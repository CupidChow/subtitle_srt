2
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,084
That must be the cake.

3
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:14,383
Honey, did you get the gift?

4
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:17,883
A gift for Yeon Doo? What is it?

5
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,494
My gosh. They're diamond rings!

6
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:28,334
Father, how many carats
are they combined?

7
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:31,564
Are you worried they'd be more
expensive than your wedding ring?

8
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,433
They're not pricey at all.

9
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,874
Their fingers just seemed
like they were missing something.

10
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:38,773
When you have the wedding
after the baby's born,

11
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,644
you can buy new ones.

12
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:41,983
Here.

13
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:47,983
Go on. Give each other the ring.

14
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,224
What?

15
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:50,983
Sure.

16
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:56,563
- Can I have your hand?
- Right.

17
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,504
Gosh, how pretty is that?

18
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:12,613
Yeon Doo, you too. Go ahead.

19
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:15,613
Right.

20
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:31,223
- What the... Ms. Jang!
- My gosh!

21
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:33,833
Oh, gosh.

22
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,473
I'm sorry
for interrupting your dinner,

23
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:47,143
but I had something to say.

24
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,044
I...

25
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:54,783
won't take the job at the US branch.

26
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:04,593
What do you mean
you won't go to the US branch?

27
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:08,604
I kept thinking about it,
but I just couldn't do it.

28
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:10,804
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:12,634
I thought
this conversation was over.

30
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,074
What's the reason
you're suddenly doing this?

31
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:18,973
A problem came up with my family.

32
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:23,214
A problem? To your parents?

33
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:24,684
Are you having money problems again?

34
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:29,723
I think...

35
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,253
they're getting a divorce.

36
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:34,624
What?

37
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:36,364
A divorce?

38
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,033
Your mother and father
are getting a divorce?

39
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:40,864
Yes.

40
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:42,434
Why all of a sudden?

41
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:43,934
Honey.

42
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,204
Their relationship has been bad
for a long time now.

43
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,543
They were stopping themselves
because of my marriage.

44
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:52,714
Oh, goodness.

45
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:56,184
This happened because her marriage
with Tae Kyung went down the drain.

46
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:02,624
Sorry for making you worry
about something like this.

47
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:12,793
I understand.

48
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:16,763
It must be hard
to see your parents split up.

49
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,973
Stop crying.

50
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,073
Sorry.

51
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:26,214
Now that my parents are doing this,

52
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,513
I have nobody else to rely on.

53
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,954
It made me think of you a lot.

54
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,323
No need to say more.

55
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:37,084
I was very uncomfortable...

56
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,454
without you, Ms. Jang.

57
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:42,093
Things must've been tough
for you recently.

58
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:45,693
When I saw Ms. Lee yell at you
to get out at the family meeting...

59
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,364
prior to the wedding,
I was so surprised.

60
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,304
That's not all.

61
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:55,503
Now that she has a grandson,
she's treating me like I'm nothing.

62
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:56,843
Oh, goodness.

63
00:03:56,843 --> 00:04:00,543
Who knew I'd have to walk
on eggshells in my own house?

64
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:03,084
Ms. Eun.

65
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:07,413
There's something you must know.

66
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,024
What is it?

67
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:29,143
What's wrong?

68
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:35,313
Ms. Jang was at the annex yesterday.

69
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:36,813
What?

70
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,854
She said she had to look
for something before she left.

71
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:43,323
She said
something was bothering her.

72
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,893
They must've been
her parents' divorce.

73
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,563
Why didn't you tell me?

74
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:53,234
I didn't really want to.

75
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:56,804
Is that why you got angry at me?

76
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,374
We had a bit of a tense moment.

77
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,844
I was irritated.

78
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:07,914
It felt like so much was happening
to me since I met you.

79
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:09,744
What about me?

80
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,383
Did I not go through a lot
because of you?

81
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:16,083
What is it?
Is there something I don't know?

82
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,094
Forget it.

83
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,063
What? Three months?

84
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:32,333
Yes. I accidentally saw it...

85
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,773
when I went to the annex yesterday.

86
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:37,403
She's planning to live alone
after three months.

87
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:40,874
Live alone? What about Tae Kyung?

88
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:43,784
I have no idea what she's plotting.

89
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:48,114
She might be fooling Tae Kyung.

90
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,323
What do you mean?

91
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:51,984
Give me some time,

92
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,294
and I'll figure it out.

93
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,323
I'll figure something out...

94
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:58,263
so that things go back
to the way you wanted.

95
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,193
As I wanted?

96
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,104
Yes.

97
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:06,403
This all happened because of Ms. Oh.

98
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:08,844
Once she's gone,

99
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:11,503
Ms. Lee will also go back
to her obedient self again.

100
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,874
I'll also be able to come back
to be by your side.

101
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,344
Oh, right. I like the sound of that.

102
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,354
Okay. How can I help you?

103
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:21,813
Well, the thing is...

104
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:31,994
Yeon Doo didn't even get to blow out
her candles because of Ms. Jang.

105
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,664
They're talking for a long time.
What could it be about?

106
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:37,734
Grandmother must be consoling her.

107
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:39,874
She must be so upset.

108
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,544
Chairman Gong. Ms. Lee.

109
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,614
Ms. Eun asked you to come in.

110
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:55,013
I'm sorry for interrupting today.

111
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,724
I'll be going, then.

112
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,333
She's going to return, Mother?

113
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,164
You're going to let Ms. Jang
come back to the secretary's office?

114
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,903
Did she ask you for that?

115
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,034
No. I told her to.

116
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,974
Ms. Jang said she didn't want to,
but I asked her to.

117
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,773
Her family was destroyed
because of us.

118
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:22,813
Don't you think it's right...

119
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:25,244
to take her in generously
as a way to ask for forgiveness?

120
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:29,284
No. That's that.
This is a different problem.

121
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:32,124
Things are uncomfortable
for her, Tae Kyung, and Yeon Doo.

122
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:34,554
Also, we've compensated her enough.

123
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,164
Why would you do that
when she didn't want to?

124
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,693
Wounds of the heart
can't be cured with money.

125
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,994
Mother!

126
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,703
It's because I need her.

127
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:46,534
Did you ever take care of me
after Ms. Jang quit?

128
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,674
You only talked back to me...

129
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,703
and treated me
like some insignificant old lady.

130
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,474
Mother. When did I...

131
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:55,513
Anyway, I made myself clear.

132
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,344
If you don't want her to work
in the office, let her work for me.

133
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,253
If not, I'll leave this house.

134
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:01,253
What?

135
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,823
We'll find a way, Mother.

136
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:04,883
Okay.

137
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:08,724
I'm getting older by the day.
Please let me get my wish.

138
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:10,364
I'm trusting you, Chan Sik.

139
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:21,734
We can't let Ms. Jang
come back to the company.

140
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,143
You must stop her somehow.

141
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,443
Se Jin's in a tough situation.

142
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:28,914
We can't let her be around us!

143
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:30,914
What are you talking about?

144
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,554
She even lied
about being infertile...

145
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,984
so that she could marry Tae Kyung.

146
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,124
What? Infertile?

147
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:41,494
I don't even want to talk about it.

148
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:44,124
If you want to know more,
ask Mother about it.

149
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,564
She knew all about it.

150
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,734
Stop Ms. Jang from coming back...

151
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:51,803
before Yeon Doo hears about it.

152
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:53,773
If not,
I won't just stand by and watch.

153
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,454
Look. It's my ex, Jay.

154
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,553
If doppelgängers meet, they die.
You know that, right?

155
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:15,964
If you meet Jay, you'll die.
Be careful.

156
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:19,234
Gosh. I'm so scared.

157
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:21,194
Do you think that will scare me?

158
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,433
He acts too brave for a coward.

159
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,503
It's on him
for calling me a stalker.

160
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:00,234
See? This is my ex, Jay.

161
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,273
Sir.

162
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:09,214
This is my face, isn't it?

163
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,344
I'm Oh Dong Wook, aren't I?

164
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:13,413
You had too much to drink.

165
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,383
Stop drinking and go home.

166
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:20,694
I failed yet another interview.

167
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:23,523
I'm...

168
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:26,893
a complete moron.

169
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,663
It's these shoes' fault.

170
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:37,773
It's my brother-in-law's fault.

171
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,273
(Managing Weight During Pregnancy)

172
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:57,594
"Oh Dong Wook?"

173
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,893
Why would Dong Wook text him?

174
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,104
I asked you to pick out some shoes.

175
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:05,433
I made a mess of the interview.

176
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:07,633
If you have a conscience,

177
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,773
get me a job
at your father's company.

178
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:12,614
"Get me a job?"

179
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,714
What a punk.

180
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,454
(Bong Nim and Boys)

181
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:22,984
What's this?

182
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:24,624
When did they make a group chat?

183
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:27,194
(Bong Nim and Boys)

184
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,224
"Good evening" has two letter "o"s.

185
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:33,533
Only one "o" makes it "God evening."

186
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:36,234
I was born in the year of the horse.

187
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:39,064
And I hate quasi-science
like horoscopes.

188
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,533
What about me?

189
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,944
Do you think
you didn't put me through stuff?

190
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:48,043
Was this what he meant?

191
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:57,283
Are you out of your mind, Mom?

192
00:11:58,124 --> 00:11:59,354
Do as I say.

193
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:01,854
Just do as I say right now.

194
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,244
What's this?

195
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:18,543
"Kang Bong Nim left the chatroom?"

196
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:20,474
(Kang Dae Sang left the chatroom.)

197
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,944
(Oh Dong Wook left the chatroom.)

198
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:24,913
Why did they all leave
at the same time?

199
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,714
Are they upset that I didn't reply?

200
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:31,053
It's for the best.

201
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:36,393
I'm not going
to the opening tomorrow.

202
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,964
You don't have to either.

203
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:39,734
Why change your mind?

204
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:42,133
You promised a few days ago
that we'd attend.

205
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:45,163
Mom told me
not to bother a busy man.

206
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:46,834
Okay?

207
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:54,143
Oh, no. What if she really is angry?

208
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,413
Oh, no. Honey!

209
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:04,224
What's the matter?

210
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,594
Her room is empty.

211
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:09,564
There's no suitcase or clothes.

212
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,734
Do you think
she went to the airport?

213
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:19,533
How could she go to the US
without a word to me?

214
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:24,303
I can't just wait here.
I'll go to the airport.

215
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,913
You know what she's like.
There's no point in going.

216
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:30,783
Should I just let her go
because there's no point in looking?

217
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,553
You know what she means to me.

218
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:36,954
She's my hope and my jewel!

219
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,153
Se Jin!

220
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:45,763
What happened?

221
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:48,933
I decided to stay.

222
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:53,803
Is that true?
You're not going to the US?

223
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,903
No. I just visited the chairman
to tell him so.

224
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:02,043
Good. It's best
you stay away from that family.

225
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:06,883
Mom. Divorce Dad.

226
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,854
What are you talking about, Se Jin?

227
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:16,194
Ms. Eun gave me the rest
of the money for the apartment.

228
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,834
If you want the money,
choose Dad or me.

229
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,734
Se Jin, what are you...

230
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,533
You don't have a say.

231
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:27,204
Mom, quickly.

232
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,474
How dare you do this
to your parents?

233
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:31,704
Get divorced.

234
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:33,043
- What?
- What?

235
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,374
You fought each other for decades,

236
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,984
but you could never do it
because of me.

237
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,584
I'll make the choice for you.

238
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:44,084
Get divorced right away.

239
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:47,423
Honey!

240
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:54,893
We might not be great parents,

241
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:56,763
but how dare you do this?

242
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,844
What are you doing?

243
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,344
What did you ever do for me?

244
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,753
Do you know how much debt
I had to repay?

245
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:19,153
What did you do while I turned 30
and still didn't have enough...

246
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,423
for my own savings account?

247
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:22,224
I told you not to repay the debt.

248
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:24,624
That your mom will never stop!

249
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,364
How can you say that?

250
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:30,234
Did you never stop to think
you put the responsibility on me?

251
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,564
Se Jin.

252
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,133
The people
I used to be able to call friends...

253
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,444
turned into successful people
I had to treat with respect.

254
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:40,643
The people I used to play tag with
treated me like a pauper.

255
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:44,214
Where were you
when I groveled to them,

256
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:46,314
hoping to eat their leftovers?

257
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,383
What did you do?

258
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:55,923
I'm sorry I put my values first
and failed to look out for you.

259
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:57,893
No.

260
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,364
You needn't apologize.

261
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:02,594
From now on,

262
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:04,864
I'll put my values first too.

263
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,133
Will you please do as I say?

264
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,474
If you act like your mom
who can't forget her glamorous past,

265
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,204
it'll only ruin you.

266
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,974
This is us and this is what fits us!

267
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:18,344
Did you say...

268
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,314
this is what fits us?

269
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:25,783
Am I only fit to live in this place
worrying about money...

270
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,094
for the rest of my life?

271
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,153
Get out.

272
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:32,624
I can't live with you anymore,
so get out!

273
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:33,933
Se Jin.

274
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:37,933
I'd be part of that family now
if only that woman didn't show up.

275
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,403
I'll get my place back.

276
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:43,143
I'll get back what's meant
to be mine, so please!

277
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:48,043
Get out of this house
and do whatever you want.

278
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:51,484
Don't get in my way anymore.

279
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,513
I'm in your way?

280
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:57,423
You didn't know that?

281
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:24,943
Se Jin. Are you all right?

282
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:30,223
You'll divorce Dad, won't you?
Answer that first.

283
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:32,683
Well...

284
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:37,693
Will you give me the money?

285
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:42,034
Just do as I say from now on
and the money's yours.

286
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,963
Okay.

287
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,173
I'll do as you say.

288
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,304
Get out. I'm tired.

289
00:17:50,328 --> 00:18:15,328

290
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,680
I bet you were exhausted yesterday.

291
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,079
Sleep will overwhelm you
during the early stages.

292
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,110
It'll be a while
before we arrive at the office,

293
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,150
so get some shut-eye.

294
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,590
How can I fall asleep
next to the driver?

295
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,150
I'm not that ill-mannered.

296
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,219
It's fine.

297
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
I know you don't
get to rest at work.

298
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,600
The child will take after
the dad's nagging first.

299
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,469
It's not just you
who values this child.

300
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,140
I'll rest enough...

301
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,670
to keep the baby healthy,
so don't worry.

302
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,410
Thanks.

303
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,479
"Dad."

304
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,680
I like the sound of that.

305
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,289
Thanks for driving me.
I'll get going.

306
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,090
Call me if you have to work late.

307
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,090
I'll pick you up.

308
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,430
Got it. Get to work safely.

309
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,430
Sure.

310
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,289
All right. Let's do this.

311
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,079
Which floor?

312
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,450
Eighth. Thank you.

313
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:18,860
Are you still not divorced?

314
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,729
Yeon Sang Hoon!

315
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,100
What are you doing here?
What about the US branch?

316
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,430
I asked you a question first.
Haven't you divorced yet?

317
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,739
You're being cheeky again.
I see you still haven't matured.

318
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,170
I take it you're still married.
What a bummer.

319
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,509
Know that I'm always available.

320
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,650
You're talking nonsense as always.

321
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,549
Do what you came here to do, then.

322
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,200
You said I should
take care of business.

323
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
I'm not following you.

324
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,469
Good morning, Ms. Gong.

325
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,739
I see you're here early.
Is everything set for the meeting?

326
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:13,180
Yes, everything is set.

327
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:17,350
How are you two together?

328
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,680
Are you acquainted?

329
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,850
What? How do you know Mr. Yeon?

330
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,219
I was going to introduce you two
before the meeting.

331
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,860
Hello, Executive Director Gong.

332
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,130
I was transferred from the US branch
to the head office's Sales Division.

333
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,900
I'm its new senior manager
Yeon Sang Hoon.

334
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,170
Good morning!

335
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,549
Did something put you
in a good mood, Director Cha?

336
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,219
Me?

337
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,479
No, nothing in particular.

338
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,749
He's been this way a lot
ever since his wife got pregnant.

339
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,559
Now that I think about it,

340
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,989
I've never seen you exhilarated
about fatherhood.

341
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,630
Me?

342
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:05,999
I'm thrilled on the inside.

343
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,499
Can't you tell I'm in bliss?

344
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:12,499
My goodness.

345
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:16,309
Director Cha, Dr. Gong,
I see you're all out here.

346
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,880
Hello.

347
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,140
What brings you by?

348
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,450
I came by to apologize...

349
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,380
for causing a scene before
among other things.

350
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,749
I'm truly sorry about
my behavior that day.

351
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,489
It's all right.

352
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,960
I hope I didn't cause any trouble
for the clinic.

353
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,999
I'm sorry, Director Cha.

354
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,029
It's all right.

355
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,130
You said, "among other things."

356
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,269
She wanted to check her hormones
for possible menopause.

357
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,269
That's right.

358
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:50,309
I've been having
anger issues lately,

359
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,979
and I'm easily irritated.

360
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,450
I couldn't sleep at all
last night...

361
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,350
and was drenched in cold sweat.

362
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,120
Se Jin didn't want to come,

363
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,249
but I begged and forced her
to drive me here.

364
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,289
Director Cha,
your reputation precedes you.

365
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,960
Why don't I take a look?

366
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,930
- Nurse Kim?
- Sure.

367
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,539
Could we perhaps talk?

368
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,440
What did you want to say?

369
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,479
I wanted to apologize
just like my mom did.

370
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,850
I ruined dinner yesterday, didn't I?

371
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,289
It seemed like you were gathered
to celebrate Ms. Oh's birthday,

372
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,590
and I'm sorry.

373
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,729
I was too wrapped up
in my own problems...

374
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,229
to consider others.

375
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:50,029
Forget it.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

376
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,739
That's a pretty ring.

377
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,880
Seeing the family
celebrate her birthday together...

378
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,120
finally made it real for me.

379
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,590
She's the one
who now holds that place.

380
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,690
It's really over...

381
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:17,960
for you and me.

382
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:25,140
I wonder why I got so greedy
when it was going to end this way.

383
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,269
My greed only made it hard
on my parents.

384
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,579
I'm sorry about your parents.

385
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,880
I do feel guilty in a way.

386
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,779
Thank you for saying so.

387
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,319
Maybe we can now be
more comfortable around each other.

388
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,090
I would like that as well.

389
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,430
I don't want to keep my mom waiting.
I'll see you around.

390
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,680
Se Jin, is this what you meant
by taking back what was stolen?

391
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,450
What do you expect from Tae Kyung
when his wife is with child?

392
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,350
Mom, what did I say
before we hit the road?

393
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,559
I shouldn't ask questions
or challenge you...

394
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,860
and just do as told.

395
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,660
That's right, so keep that in mind.

396
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,029
Did you book an appointment?

397
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,299
Of course, I did.

398
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,299
You'll give me that money, right?

399
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:37,140
I will when it's time,
so stop talking about the money.

400
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,779
I'm sick of it.

401
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,150
(Brother-in-law)

402
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,259
Why on earth is he calling me?

403
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,829
Is it to ask me
about what socks to wear?

404
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,729
Hello?

405
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,700
Uncle Tae Kyung,
aren't you coming to the opening?

406
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,769
The opening? Wait, is this Soo Kyum?

407
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,110
What are you doing?

408
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,509
I'm sorry, Tae Kyung. I'll hang up.

409
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,850
Today must be
the day of the opening.

410
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,789
I'm not going
to the opening tomorrow.

411
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,489
You don't have to either.

412
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,029
Fine. I won't go.

413
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,700
Get your rice cakes
and celebrate the opening.

414
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,739
The restaurant will open
in the afternoon,

415
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:42,140
so please attend
if you have the time.

416
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,469
Students of Old School...

417
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,239
will be allowed
to try the food for free.

418
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,479
Since it's an opening event,

419
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:49,910
your star instructor daughter
will also be there.

420
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,819
Why don't I bring my youngest son?

421
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,049
My daughter got married.

422
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,789
What? When?

423
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,719
But you didn't hand out
any wedding invitations.

424
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,390
Don't tell me she got pregnant.

425
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,289
Well, babies are considered
the modern-day dowry.

426
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,360
When did she get pregnant?

427
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,829
What does the son-in-law do?

428
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,529
Will we be able to meet him
at the opening event?

429
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,100
You won't.
He'll be too busy to be there.

430
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,400
Did you all get your rice cakes?

431
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,700
- Of course.
- Sure.

432
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,239
- I should get one to the principal.
- Hey!

433
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,410
Who said you could butter him up?

434
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,450
My gosh. Why are they being generous
with your rice cakes?

435
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,479
Give me that.

436
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,219
Where are you going?

437
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:30,450
Get out.

438
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,989
I can't live with you anymore,
so get out!

439
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:36,660
Don't get in my way anymore.

440
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,170
- Mr. Jang!
- Are you all right?

441
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,279
I couldn't get
much sleep last night,

442
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,509
but I'm all right.

443
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,749
Is it because of those gangsters
who came here to harass you?

444
00:27:57,749 --> 00:28:00,420
Did gangsters come by the school?

445
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,549
Unbelievable.

446
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,489
Maybe you're exhausted
from teaching Korean...

447
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:06,460
and also being the homeroom teacher.

448
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,019
I'm all right.

449
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,989
Why are you here
when class will soon begin?

450
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:11,729
What...

451
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,930
What's with the rice cakes?

452
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,299
It's to celebrate
the opening of my restaurant.

453
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,569
Oh, Bong Nim. What's wrong?

454
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,640
We got rid of those gangsters
for you,

455
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,079
but you just told us
to mind our own business, right?

456
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:30,350
People who don't know how to be grateful
don't deserve rice cakes.

457
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,950
I'm sorry about that.

458
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,749
Congratulations
on your store opening.

459
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,789
You're apologizing so early.

460
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,390
(Ilmiri Gold Braised Chicken)

461
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,140
Here. It's medicine for hangovers.

462
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
I told you not to drink so much.

463
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,479
Gosh. I feel like I'm dying.

464
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,140
Soo Kyum.

465
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,610
I'm so nervous.

466
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,019
This is the first time for me
to serve my food to customers.

467
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,190
Your food is super delicious.

468
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,289
When's Grandma getting here?

469
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,059
Are you all ready?

470
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,759
Yes. As you can see.

471
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,960
Wait. You were supposed to buy
a pig head for the ritual.

472
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
What's with the cake?

473
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:20,600
Look.

474
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:35,309
This is the first challenge
we're taking on...

475
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,779
without Yeon Doo's help.

476
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,350
I won't ask for this to become
a huge success.

477
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,489
Please just let us
make enough to live on...

478
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,549
and bring us closer...

479
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,190
while we work together.

480
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,170
Once more?

481
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:10,380
Gosh. She wrote down the address,
but I can't find it.

482
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,749
- She said it was a chicken place?
- Yes.

483
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,049
Isn't that it?

484
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,219
It's not fried chicken.
It's braised chicken.

485
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,259
If we don't know, we need to ask.

486
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:21,190
Excuse me.

487
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,259
Yes? Can I help you?

488
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,130
Wait. I've seen him before.

489
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:30,630
Nursing office!

490
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,069
- What?
- When Bong Nim got sick...

491
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,469
after eating bibimbap.

492
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,009
- The doctor, right?
- Right.

493
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,110
Oh, yes. What a coincidence
running into all of you here.

494
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,380
Do you know the location...

495
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,309
of the braised chicken store
that's opening today?

496
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,979
Braised chicken store?

497
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,890
Bong Nim...

498
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:54,559
seems to have gotten
a bad son-in-law, don't you think?

499
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,259
Seriously.

500
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:58,700
If he was a good guy,

501
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,999
she would've been bragging
about him nonstop.

502
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,440
Did he leech onto her family
to get money?

503
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,600
- Look at how he got her pregnant.
- Right.

504
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
She bragged about her daughter
so much.

505
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,910
Gosh. How funny.

506
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,749
Are you married, Doctor?

507
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,850
Do you need to ask?

508
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,950
Look at his face, height, and job.

509
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,850
- Girls wouldn't leave him alone.
- Right.

510
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,559
I have something to tell you.

511
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,660
- I think it's over there.
- Where?

512
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,289
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Oh, there.

513
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,930
- Oh, let's go over there.
- Let's hurry.

514
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,029
- Hold on.
- Let's go. Gosh.

515
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

516
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,600
Please come often. Take one more.

517
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,210
- To celebrate our opening.
- Thank you.

518
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,079
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

519
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,140
- Congratulations, Bong Nim.
- Congratulations, Bong Nim.

520
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,880
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

521
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:50,509
Soo Kyum. Say hello.

522
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,749
They're my friends from school.

523
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,090
Hello! I'm Soo Kyum.

524
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,690
Gosh. You're so kind and cute.

525
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,519
By the way,

526
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,029
why do you look so sad?
You just opened a restaurant.

527
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,229
Are you worried about your daughter?

528
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:08,259
- What?
- Of course, she is.

529
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,469
You worked hard to raise her
only to give her to some loser.

530
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,200
To give her to who?

531
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,440
This is what friends are for.

532
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,710
- Just let it all out.
- Right.

533
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,680
I don't know
what you're talking about.

534
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,910
What type of guy is your son-in-law?

535
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,049
A poor guy, a bad guy,
or a terrible guy?

536
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,950
Soo Kyum.

537
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,650
Uncle!

538
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:41,329
Wait. Why is your granddaughter...

539
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:43,999
calling the doctor uncle?

540
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:46,299
My son-in-law, Tae Kyung. You came.

541
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:49,739
- Son-in-law?
- Son-in-law?

542
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,079
Why did you walk here?
Where's that expensive car of yours?

543
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,249
I parked it in a public parking lot
and walked over...

544
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:57,549
because the weather was nice.

545
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,489
You remember him
from that day, right?

546
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,090
This is my son-in-law.

547
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,430
Let me officially introduce myself.

548
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,690
I'm Ms. Kang's son-in-law,
Gong Tae Kyung.

549
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,229
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

550
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,870
The store is very nice.

551
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,210
- Here. Your food is ready. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

552
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,710
- Thank you.
- Things are going well.

553
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,039
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

554
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,779
- Thank you.
- By the way,

555
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,579
don't tell Bong Nim.

556
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,019
Yes. I won't tell her. Don't worry.

557
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,789
- Gosh. Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it's here.

558
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,259
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

559
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,090
You must be happy, Bong Nim.

560
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,559
Not only is your son-in-law a doctor,
but he's also kind.

561
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,130
How did you know he was kind?

562
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:51,569
We can just tell.

563
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:54,340
Gosh. I can't hear a thing.

564
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,410
Let's eat first.

565
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,279
We should eat with Bong Nim.

566
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,809
I'm okay. I'm busy
because we have a lot of customers.

567
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,279
What are you doing,

568
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,880
- kind son-in-law?
- Sorry?

569
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,279
Gosh. Get up now
and take her apron...

570
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,719
so that she can eat
some braised chicken.

571
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,390
- Oh, right.
- What are you saying?

572
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,960
I feel bad to Tae Kyung.

573
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,289
- No, it's okay.
- It's okay. Give me your apron.

574
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,729
- It's okay. Gosh.
- It's okay.

575
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,630
- Sit here.
- Gosh. I'm okay. Goodness.

576
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,269
Here's your braised chicken.

577
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:25,470
I'm so jealous.

578
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,670
- Just take a bite.
- Enjoy.

579
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,340
Gosh. I'm okay.

580
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,110
I'm jealous.

581
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,139
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

582
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,579
- He's working hard.
- Gosh.

583
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,550
- One medium size, please.
- One medium size. Okay.

584
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,550
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

585
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,880
- More soy sauce, please.
- Oh, yes.

586
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:41,949
This way.

587
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,019
Thanks, Soo Kyum.

588
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,519
- Gosh. It's delicious.
- Gosh. Look at that.

589
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,990
- Would you like to pay?
- He's doing well.

590
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,460
- You had the medium size, right?
- Yes.

591
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,329
- Would you like your receipt?
- You did well.

592
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,900
- Okay.
- You got a good son-in-law.

593
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:57,530
- Thank you. Come again.
- Thank you.

594
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,809
When is the rice coming out?

595
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,210
Oh, one second, please.

596
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:07,740
- Careful. It's hot.
- Oh, thanks.

597
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,050
- Here's your rice.
- Should I help him?

598
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,650
Gosh.

599
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,050
Thank you.

600
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:15,690
Come again!

601
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,559
Gosh.

602
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:28,229
(CSAT)

603
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:30,199
(The First Digit Changed.
CSAT is Less Than 200 Days Away...)

604
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,479
(Master of Korean Language!
Instructor Oh Yeon Doo)

605
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:42,280
(A crash course
for a perfect score on the CSAT)

606
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:55,019
(Bulletin board)

607
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,429
My Korean score improved a lot
thanks to Ms. Oh!

608
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,030
Please take care of us
until the end, Ms. Oh.

609
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,130
I won't forget about your help
even after I go to college.

610
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,409
Yes, Mother.

611
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,150
I can't come by often
because Tae Kyung dislikes it.

612
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:23,050
Are you feeling a bit better now?

613
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,320
The past few days have been okay.

614
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:28,519
Thank you for all of these
delicious dishes, Mother.

615
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,699
Yeon Doo. Were you crying?

616
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,570
No. It's because I just woke up.

617
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,530
You were crying.

618
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,400
Is it because of Ms. Jang?

619
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,610
No, Mother.

620
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,979
I suddenly remembered the days
when I taught at the academy.

621
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,050
I've never stayed at home
for so long before.

622
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,749
I understand. People who used
to work can miss work sometimes.

623
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,590
Could I go out briefly later?

624
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,190
Of course. Go wherever you want.

625
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,929
But you need to take our car.

626
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,630
You're not alone.

627
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,769
Yes, Mother.

628
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,670
(We're closed! See you tomorrow!)

629
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,340
Gosh. That feels better.

630
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,940
Smelling chicken while hungover
was making me want to vomit.

631
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:25,349
We would've been in big trouble
without you, Tae Kyung.

632
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:28,820
Was it okay for you to leave
the hospital for the whole day?

633
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,820
Oh, yes. I only had appointments
in the morning today.

634
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,860
We should hire a part-timer.

635
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,190
Just for a few hours in the morning
when we prep the ingredients.

636
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:39,499
By the way, why did you come?

637
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,929
I thought she told us all to leave
the chat room because of you.

638
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,940
Yeon Doo told you to leave?

639
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,809
You all left the group chat...

640
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,170
because of Yeon Doo?

641
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,309
She told us she'd break our legs
if we didn't leave.

642
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,550
That's why we left quickly.

643
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,749
She could totally do that
if she decided to do so.

644
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,019
I thought you did that
because you were mad at me.

645
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,490
We were the ones who kept bothering you.
Why would we be angry?

646
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,190
Sorry I spelled things incorrectly.

647
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,400
Thanks to you, I won't forget
that "good" has two "o"s.

648
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,329
I'm sorry too, Year of the Horse.

649
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:17,269
I won't send today's fortune again.

650
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,300
I failed the job interview.

651
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,199
I know the shoes are not to blame.

652
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:24,940
I apologize.

653
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,309
What's the matter?

654
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,610
I've never been in
a family chatroom before.

655
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,349
It felt strange and uncomfortable.

656
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:37,490
I should've been honest,

657
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,090
but I wanted to be
a good son-in-law,

658
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,159
and this is what happened.

659
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,929
I'm sorry for being immature
and weird.

660
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,869
Bong Nim, he's being serious.

661
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,940
It's funny
how seriously he's taking it.

662
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,369
Tae Kyung.
No one in the world is perfect.

663
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,909
You saw how childish we can get.

664
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,849
We're all immature and weird.

665
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:08,280
And such people
look out for each other.

666
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,050
Yes. So what
if we don't have a chatroom?

667
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,789
We can meet up instead.

668
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,059
He's not cut out for social media.

669
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:18,229
Did you see his selfies?
It's a waste of a handsome face.

670
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,030
Uncle. If you give me a present,

671
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,070
I'll teach you how to take selfies.

672
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,699
What I saw earlier.
It's for me, right?

673
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,570
That's for your grandma.

674
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,409
It's mine? What is it?

675
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:36,179
I hate you, Grandma. You too, Uncle.

676
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,720
I got a present. Thanks, Tae Kyung.

677
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,679
What do you want?

678
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,780
Where are you?

679
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,880
I wanted to talk
but I couldn't reach you.

680
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,550
I'm heading home. What's this about?

681
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:18,690
I thought about this,
but I think you should know.

682
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,789
Yeon Doo overheard our conversation
the other day.

683
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,530
What do you mean?

684
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,699
You said you'd had enough of being
a son-in-law and a husband.

685
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,199
She heard it all.

686
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,070
What?

687
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,650
Why must I explain
my emotions to you all the time?

688
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,820
Are we that close?

689
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,090
Was that why she was so upset?

690
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,590
Did you just get home?

691
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:55,789
Yes.

692
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,829
You were out too?

693
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:00,659
I just dropped off your wife.

694
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,400
Yeon Doo?

695
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:04,130
Where at?

696
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,410
This place has the best tteokbokki.

697
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,179
I feel so much better.

698
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:21,779
Isn't the instructor the best?

699
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,620
It's incredible.

700
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,890
His lectures beat everyone else's.

701
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:38,600
What is it, Mom?

702
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,969
"What is it, Mom?"
Is that all you can say?

703
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,609
My son-in-law
worked all afternoon...

704
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:46,509
at the grand opening
that you skipped.

705
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:48,879
He was there?

706
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,009
Yes.

707
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,410
He served customers,
watched the till,

708
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,009
and even cleaned up.

709
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:54,879
He worked himself sweaty all day.

710
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,949
You should make it up to him.

711
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,719
I have to finish cleaning up. Bye.

712
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:07,500
Did he have to do that
and make me feel bad?

713
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,149
Who's this? It's Ms. Oh.

714
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:34,620
Long time no see.

715
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,060
The tteokbokki here must be great...

716
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,730
if you came all the way here...

717
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,730
to have some when you were fired.

718
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,429
Are you doing okay?

719
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,569
Yes, I'm doing great.

720
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,670
Are you? How could you
be doing great...

721
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,710
when you were fired dishonorably...

722
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:57,109
for getting pregnant
before you got married?

723
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:00,980
Did you work things out
with the baby's dad?

724
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,350
No. Did you get rid of the baby?

725
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,589
No, I didn't get rid of it.

726
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:09,190
It looks like it didn't go well
with the dad.

727
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,660
You should've aborted it.

728
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,929
How can you manage as a single mom?

729
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,759
Have you given up on life?

730
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,469
Are you afraid I'll come back?

731
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:22,969
What?

732
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,310
Are you scared...

733
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,710
I'll make a comeback
and threaten your position?

734
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,449
You should watch what you say.

735
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:33,879
Do you think you can come back?

736
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,580
You're just a mere single mom.

737
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,549
Leave the industry for good...

738
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:39,949
and do your best
at being a good mom.

739
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:43,460
I wonder how well
a kid will do without a dad.

740
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,460
Why is it without a dad?

741
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
Are you okay?

742
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,069
I told you to wait inside.

743
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:02,810
Who are you?

744
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:05,609
What right do you have
to say my baby...

745
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,920
doesn't have a dad
and it won't do well?

746
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:12,120
Are you Ms. Oh's boyfriend?

747
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,219
I'm her husband, not her boyfriend.

748
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,460
This is my wife and it's our baby.

749
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:18,560
"You're just a mere single mom?"

750
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,730
She's not a single mom,

751
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,660
but is it wrong to be one?

752
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:24,500
I didn't mean...

753
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:36,440
What's this?

754
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,310
My business card.

755
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,910
"Gong Obstetrics and Gynecology?"

756
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,290
If you want to talk to my wife,
call me instead.

757
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,399
I'm also the son of a single mom,

758
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,330
but I ended up
way better than you, punk.

759
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,370
Let's go.

760
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,859
Mom told me.

761
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,589
You were at the opening?

762
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:29,799
Thanks.

763
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:32,899
For working all day
at the restaurant,

764
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,670
and for showing up to save me.

765
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,540
Hyun Woo told me.

766
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,509
You overheard my complaints.

767
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,649
What a tattle.

768
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,350
I told him not to tell.

769
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,420
It all made sense.

770
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,660
You were right to be angry with me.

771
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,529
I apologize for being rash.

772
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,210
Having this kind of conversation
while sober makes me cringe.

773
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,109
Since we both feel
grateful and guilty,

774
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,609
shall we call it even?

775
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Yes.

776
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,230
You can eat just a third.

777
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,259
No way. We should eat half each.

778
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,330
I'm eating for two.

779
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,029
You get a third.

780
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:42,339
How can you use Real against me?

781
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,440
It's mine. I paid for it.

782
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,480
You can't steal food
from a pregnant woman.

783
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:50,379
Thanks.

784
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,250
Still, we share half-half.

785
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:57,049
It tastes good.

786
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,359
(Part-timer wanted.)

787
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,989
(Serving and kitchen staff.
Anyone over 20 is welcome.)

788
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,830
We're done.

789
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,899
Why did you bother to join me?

790
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,270
So you wouldn't feel lonely.

791
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,040
You're the only one
who cares about me.

792
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:21,540
Let's go inside.

793
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:29,250
- Do I know you?
- Be good to the child.

794
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,379
Sorry?

795
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,890
Do you mean my Soo Kyum?

796
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:35,120
She's not my child, but my nephew's.

797
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,589
No, not her. Your child.

798
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,230
Be good to your child.

799
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,069
My child?

800
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:46,830
What is she going on about?

801
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:49,500
Let's go.

802
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,210
- Let me see.
- Grandma!

803
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,779
Great-uncle has a child.

804
00:47:57,879 --> 00:47:59,310
Some woman just told him that.

805
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,379
What do you mean by that?

806
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,489
Some woman was speaking nonsense.

807
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:05,989
What if it isn't nonsense?

808
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:08,190
What if your child
is out there somewhere?

809
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,219
I'm not you, you know.

810
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:13,529
Please. I doubt fate
would be that cruel to me.

811
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:15,230
Weren't my two kids enough?

812
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,569
Should I also have a brother
who has a child out of wedlock?

813
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:21,500
Cut the nonsense
and have one of these.

814
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,009
- What's this?
- It's from Tae Kyung.

815
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:26,670
He got it especially for me.

816
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,679
Standing for long hours
isn't good for you,

817
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:31,850
so he got them
for his mother-in-law.

818
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,779
I'm less healthy
between the two of us,

819
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,120
but I'm too scared to even say it.

820
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,020
I'm telling you to be grateful.

821
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,219
To me and to Tae Kyung.

822
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:46,259
There you go.

823
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,310
Ice cream.

824
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:04,879
I like chocolate ice cream.

825
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,259
We're almost there,
so go back to sleep.

826
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,359
It's all right.

827
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:24,299
I shouldn't
while sitting next to the driver.

828
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,449
Mr. Gong.

829
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,819
I didn't say anything earlier
because I was grateful,

830
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,690
but don't help me like that
from now on.

831
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,489
What?

832
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:56,500
It'll be over for us
in three months.

833
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:01,699
After that, it'll be up to me
to fend for myself.

834
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:06,009
Being laughed at as a single mom...

835
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,839
and having my child be criticized
for not having a dad...

836
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:11,710
will happen to me often.

837
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,250
It's my problem and mine to solve.

838
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:20,020
Did my helping you
make you uncomfortable?

839
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,190
No, I felt reassured.

840
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:25,890
That's what scares me.

841
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:30,799
I'm worried I might
keep relying on you.

842
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:36,569
I'm a single mom, remember?

843
00:50:36,899 --> 00:50:38,609
I need to be able to do this alone.

844
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,509
I'll also be getting a job soon.

845
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,739
Anyway, that's all.

846
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,969
But don't help me like that
from now on.

847
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,270
That's what scares me.

848
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,670
I'm worried I might
keep relying on you.

849
00:51:15,379 --> 00:51:16,410
Gosh.

850
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,310
She's an odd one.

851
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:46,140
Have Ms. Jang back at the office
right away.

852
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,750
That can't happen, Mother.

853
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:53,379
Why are you still against this?

854
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:56,120
Do I not have the right
to hire my own people?

855
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,489
You know very well
what kind of a person she is.

856
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:00,759
What is she like, exactly?

857
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,890
She didn't hurt, harass,
or kill anyone.

858
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:06,129
She devoted herself
to this family her whole life,

859
00:52:06,129 --> 00:52:08,299
but you are out to get her.

860
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,370
- Follow me.
- Pardon?

861
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,770
You two are to follow me.

862
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,179
My heart was pounding hard.

863
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,580
I'll have indigestion at this rate.

864
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:31,819
Tell me about it.

865
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,589
Neither Grandma nor Mother
is backing down.

866
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,359
Honey, what do we do?

867
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,660
It's hard to decide
who to side with.

868
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:44,670
We have no choice.

869
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,870
We'll seek help
from the fortune teller.

870
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,000
The fortune teller?

871
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,739
Hello, I'm Oh Yeon Doo,
the one who came in...

872
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,210
for the job interview.

873
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,250
Yes, I remember you.

874
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:04,190
I was wondering whether or not
I should give you a call.

875
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:08,359
I was hoping to talk face to face.

876
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,060
Would you be available?

877
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,629
Of course.

878
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,129
I should make time
even if I didn't have any.

879
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,170
How about in a few hours?

880
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:19,870
Sure.

881
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,940
However, could we meet
outside school grounds?

882
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,009
Right. I'll see you then.

883
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:31,480
What a relief.

884
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,420
But what should I wear?

885
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,730
May I ask what brings you by?

886
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:48,960
I'll ask you point-blank.

887
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,170
Don't you want Ms. Jang
at the office either?

888
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,770
Sorry?

889
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,170
Mother, Yeon Doo wouldn't know
anything about the office.

890
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,670
Stay put, will you?

891
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,609
Your parents-in-law were against it,

892
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:03,779
so I came by for your approval.

893
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:07,779
You're the reason
her parents are getting a divorce,

894
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,520
so it'd be cruel...

895
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,850
to stop her from getting a job.

896
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:17,219
Right. I see you at least
have a conscience.

897
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,429
You saw that, Chan Sik. Let us go.

898
00:54:20,629 --> 00:54:22,029
- No.
- What?

899
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:24,330
What did you just say? Why?

900
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,870
There's no reason.

901
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,399
I just don't like it.

902
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:30,270
You hate me for no reason, right?

903
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,810
You can hate someone
for no particular reason.

904
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,279
Goodness.

905
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:37,649
Look at you
being all smug and confident.

906
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:42,219
Will you only be happy
if everything went your way?

907
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,620
Mother, please
don't raise your voice.

908
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,690
- You know she's with child.
- What?

909
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:49,390
I heard you knew...

910
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:51,230
that Ms. Jang
lied about being infertile.

911
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,989
How could you
want to rehire someone...

912
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,429
who said such a dreadful lie?

913
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:58,199
That's because
Tae Kyung was a womanizer...

914
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:00,299
Mom, please. That's enough.

915
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,199
You should back down on this matter.

916
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,940
My gosh.

917
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:19,719
Se Jin, I'll go to your father...

918
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,359
and do as told.

919
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:23,319
- Sure. Get going.
- Right.

920
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,870
Yes, Ms. Eun.

921
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,440
I'm afraid you won't be
accepted back at the office.

922
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:38,640
Why is that? Is it Ms. Lee?

923
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:41,410
No, the thing at the annex
is adamantly against it.

924
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,440
She's a catty little thing.

925
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,910
I knew it wouldn't be
that easy anyway.

926
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,879
I'll try and handle it.

927
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,850
Sure. Have a good day.

928
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,129
So that's how it'll be?

929
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,799
Instructor Oh Yeon Doo.

930
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:10,870
Why does it sound awkward?

931
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:18,879
Hello?

932
00:56:20,649 --> 00:56:21,879
Jang Se Jin?

933
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:25,319
Yes, and I'm sorry for calling you.

934
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,020
It's about my mother.

935
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,859
Your mother?

936
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:31,730
My mother wanted to apologize...

937
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,460
for being the way she was.

938
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:36,330
But that was a long time ago.

939
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,569
Tell her it's all right.

940
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:42,199
I have, but she won't listen.

941
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,310
The divorce has made her fragile.

942
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,810
She already apologized to Tae Kyung,

943
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,080
so could you spare her
some of your time?

944
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:56,020
Sure. Whatever.

945
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,920
I have a previous engagement today,

946
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,489
so I'd like to choose
when and where.

947
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,660
(Old School)

948
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,219
How does it feel to have a doctor
for a son-in-law?

949
00:57:04,529 --> 00:57:07,429
You saw how he helped out yesterday
donning an apron.

950
00:57:07,529 --> 00:57:10,029
He's not your regular
stuck-up doctor.

951
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:12,330
So that's your son-in-law.

952
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,270
The one with
the seven-year-old daughter.

953
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,699
No, that's my son.

954
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,509
Maybe I overdid myself yesterday.
I'm aching all over.

955
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:23,109
You should go put on
a medicated patch or something.

956
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,410
Gosh, this is killing me.

957
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,819
(The Master of Korean Language,
Oh Yeon Doo)

958
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,920
She has an impressive career.

959
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,759
What brings you here?

960
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,560
I have something for you.

961
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,759
If you don't want a scene,
we should go somewhere else.

962
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,370
This is your stuff.

963
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,270
And this is the divorce paper.

964
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,210
Take care of it as soon as possible.

965
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,679
Don't you dare try
to sneak back into the house.

966
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:03,319
Your daughter says
she doesn't want to live with you.

967
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,250
And why do you look
like such a mess?

968
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,859
Haven't you eaten at all?

969
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,589
You're on your own now,
so take good care of yourself.

970
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:15,029
I don't want to get a call
about your lonely death.

971
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:33,410
Divorce?

972
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,819
Se Jin, I did as you told me.

973
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,049
Where are you?

974
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,660
I'm meeting with someone.

975
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,020
Who?

976
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,330
You don't need to know.

977
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,129
I'll see you at home.

978
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,440
(My mom)

979
00:59:06,649 --> 00:59:08,549
Gosh, you're here.

980
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,219
Hello.

981
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,259
I watched the video clip
of your lecture.

982
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,290
Your career is way more impressive
than I thought.

983
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:23,129
Are you sure you can work
at a school like mine?

984
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:28,140
I'm pregnant now,
so no one wants me.

985
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,339
I'm sorry, but even if you hire me,

986
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:33,710
I can work only until my due date.

987
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,480
That doesn't matter at all.

988
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:38,379
It's us
who are pressed for time now.

989
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,879
Well...

990
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,819
Actually,

991
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,049
there's one more reason
I'm hesitating to work at your school.

992
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,060
I realized it later on,

993
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,460
but my mom attends this school.

994
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,660
What?

995
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:55,830
I know they all are
about my mom's age,

996
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,899
but I have to treat
all students equally.

997
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:01,739
So I thought
I should tell you all that...

998
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:03,339
before you make any decision.

999
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,109
May I ask...

1000
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,179
who your mother is?

59:59,969 --> 01:00:02,500
I didn't tell Mom about this yet.

1001
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,420
I'll ask her first
and then tell you.

1002
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,549
All right.

1003
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,560
Please excuse me.

1004
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:32,770
Hello, Mom.

1005
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,000
You called me?

1006
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:36,770
I was busy with something else,
so I couldn't answer it.

1007
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:37,770
What's the matter?

1008
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,910
I need to ask you something.

1009
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:40,910
Hang on a second.

1010
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,839
Are you going home?

1011
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,920
(Chairman Gong)

1012
01:01:01,399 --> 01:01:03,129
I'm at your school.

1013
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:06,870
I'll wait until you come.

1014
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,219
I'm sorry.
I needed to see someone off.

1015
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,949
Why did you call me?

1016
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:30,060
The thing is,
I need to ask you something.

1017
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:31,390
When can I see you?

1018
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:32,830
I'm busy now.

1019
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,330
You should come
to my restaurant later.

1020
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:43,469
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

1021
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,089
You punks!

1022
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,660
Those little...

1023
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:11,199
Dad.

1024
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,500
Are you all right? Aren't you hurt?

1025
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,469
She's pregnant.
We need to take her to a doctor.

1026
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:18,640
Call 911.

1027
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,210
I can't have you back in the office.

1028
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,149
That thing in the annex
doesn't want you back.

1029
01:02:28,149 --> 01:02:29,350
Don't call 911.

1030
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:30,549
Why not?

1031
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:33,020
It's faster by my car.

1032
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,149
I'll take her.

1033
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:36,290
Okay. Let's put her into the car.

1034
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,920
Just help me get her into the car.

1035
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,629
I'll call you
when I get to the hospital.

1036
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:13,589
Hello?

1037
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,839
You said she was pregnant.
What happened?

1038
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,969
She was almost run
against a scooter.

1039
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,739
But fortunately, I saved her
before it happened.

1040

(Emergency Medical Center)

1041
01:03:33,279 --> 01:03:35,449
Are you saying you saved her?

1042
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:38,549
Yes. I saved her myself.

1043
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,759
What does that mean?

1044
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,969
I saved her life.

1045
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:38,524

(The Real Has Come!)

1047
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,350
I guess she injured her shoulder
trying to save your wife.

1048
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,219
Are you sure you don't
have to see a doctor?

1049
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:47,719
I need to shake them up.

1050
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,560
Both her and Tae Kyung.

1051
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:52,790
Tae Kyung.

1052
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:54,460
He's being like that again.

1053
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:56,730
He couldn't eat anything
at the office all day today.

1054
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,770
Are you enjoying your meal
when my son can't swallow anything?

1055
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Pardon?

1056
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,699
Did you tell them a lie
to go back to the family?

1057
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:07,469
Don't tell anyone
that you saved her.

1058
01:05:07,969 --> 01:05:11,040
Are you sure you're not hiding
anything from me?

1059
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:14,149
If I have to swear up to the skies,
there is one thing.
