1
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,561
Move, lady.

2
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,382
My dream was a conception dream?

3
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:07,882
Whose dream was it?

4
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:10,621
- Me. - Me.

5
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,821
Look at you two.

6
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,691
Which one of you is it? Tell me right now!

7
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:14,721
It's me.

8
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:17,492
Mom.

9
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:19,892
- Yeon Doo. - Yeon Doo.

10
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:21,562
What...

11
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:24,702
did you just say?

12
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,982
I'm pregnant,

13
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:43,682
Mom.

14
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:49,991
You?

15
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,392
How?

16
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:58,702
Bong Nim. Hold on.

17
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,471
Mom. Don't worry.

18
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,672
She's going to get an abortion.

19
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,902
No. I think she got one already.

20
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:07,342
Right, Yeon Doo?

21
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:11,741
I can't.

22
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,081
What?

23
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:16,452
Gosh.

24
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:18,152
You can't?

25
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:22,551
You can't?

26
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:24,961
I'm going to have...

27
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:27,331
the baby.

28
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,032
Oh, my.

29
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,181
Come in.

30
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,292
What do we do, Uncle?

31
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:56,392
Gosh.

32
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,621
(Episode 5)

33
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,561
Bong Nim! Why are you locking the door?

34
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,262
Open the door, Bong Nim!

35
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,461
Mom. Don't get emotional.

36
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,871
You can't let your blood pressure go up.

37
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:08,271
Bong Nim. Open the door!

38
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,042
- Please? - Shut your mouth!

39
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,512
It's his, isn't it?

40
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:17,012
The one you broke up with.

41
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:21,811
Does he know that you're pregnant?

42
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:26,151
Does he also know about the state you are in?

43
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,021
He doesn't?

44
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:31,922
Why haven't you told him when he's also at fault?

45
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:34,192
And now you're saying you can't have an abortion?

46
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,762
So you're going to have the baby without telling him?

47
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,531
It's not his. It's mine.

48
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,472
What? It's yours?

49
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:45,241
Just yours?

50
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:48,572
A baby doesn't drop out of the sky or appear out of thin air.

51
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,482
You're not my daughter, are you?

52
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:53,752
You can't be my smart and clever Yeon Doo.

53
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:57,352
Couldn't you have stabbed me in the back instead?

54
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,222
Just shoot me in the head instead.

55
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,722
Mom, please.

56
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,461
Don't "Mom" me and answer my question.

57
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:05,922
Are you really going to have the baby?

58
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:10,202
I asked if you were going to have it.

59
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,102
Answer me.

60
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:16,841
I'm telling you not to have it. I'm against the idea,

61
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:21,042
but you want to have a baby without a father in the picture?

62
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:24,912
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:27,512
Why you...

64
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,541
What am I hearing, Dad?

65
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,041
Is Grandma killing Auntie?

66
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,442
We have no choice. Let's barge in there.

67
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:58,442
Sure.

68
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:01,411
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

69
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:07,322
Bong Nim, what's with the suitcase?

70
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,351
- Let go of me! - Give it here.

71
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:10,221
No one is to touch me.

72
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:11,521
Mom, please.

73
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:12,862
You're all the same.

74
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,762
How could you both keep this from me?

75
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:17,031
You good-for-nothing brats. Come on.

76
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:18,432
- Mom. - But...

77
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:19,432
Mom!

78
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:20,971
Come on.

79
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:25,271
Grandma... She's scaring me.

80
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:36,981
The baby or me. You can only choose one.

81
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:39,822
Don't think about coming home until you have the abortion.

82
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:57,572
A perfunctory marriage...

83
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,242
without children and love.

84
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,242
Does your offer...

85
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:04,142
still stand?

86
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:06,682
What?

87
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:12,552
Yes.

88
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:14,651
It does.

89
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:20,031
Let's get married.

90
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,661
You and I.

91
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:59,002
The brat actually came by.

92
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,601
He got down on his knees and asked me to forgive his mother.

93
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,971
- What? - Is that true?

94
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:08,012
As if that's enough to make me change my mind.

95
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,112
Chan Sik, set the divorce in motion.

96
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,812
Mom, please don't be like this.

97
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,812
What do you mean I shouldn't be this way?

98
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:16,421
She's the one who first mentioned a divorce...

99
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:40,041
What brings you both here?

100
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,512
We're getting married.

101
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,112
- What? - Married?

102
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,682
Tae Kyung, this is out of the blue.

103
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,351
Ms. Jang and I have agreed to it.

104
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,421
Do you mean it?

105
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:02,392
Yes. Do you now believe that I'm willing to live my life...

106
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,302
the way you want me to?

107
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:07,002
Gosh. Goodness.

108
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,331
I never thought I'd get to live to see this day.

109
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:12,171
I'm sure you're aware that you can't take back...

110
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,142
what you already said.

111
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,341
Yes, I know that.

112
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:22,151
You finally seem like a member of this family.

113
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,221
Get married soon, then.

114
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:27,692
Ms. Jang, tell your parents that you will soon be married...

115
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,421
and invite them over to the house tomorrow...

116
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,192
before the brat changes his mind.

117
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,692
Yes, Ms. Eun.

118
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,161
Chan Sik, sign the discharge papers.

119
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,562
I should head home...

120
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:40,231
and get ready to welcome my future in-laws.

121
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:43,002
Of course.

122
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,581
Bong Nim, let me do that.

123
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,952
I told you not to touch me. Should I throw you out as well?

124
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,191
Of course not. I have nowhere to go.

125
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,031
Mom, we did a terrible thing.

126
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,132
I thought you'd faint like you did when I brought Soo Kyum home...

127
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,031
which is why I couldn't tell you.

128
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,301
Stop getting on my nerves and get lost.

129
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:18,642
Bong Nim, Yeon Doo's still outside.

130
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,411
What if she catches an illness?

131
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,821
Why are you out here looking this guilty?

132
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,392
It breaks my heart.

133
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,092
Gosh, your feet must be freezing.

134
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:40,862
Put your shoes on first...

135
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,762
and take this.

136
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:47,071
Also, here are your car keys.

137
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,201
Come home in a few days when your mom's anger subsides.

138
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:55,071
I'm sorry for not being much help.

139
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:57,742
I'll head back inside, then.

140
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,982
Put those shoes on already.

141
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,531
Goodness.

142
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:16,801
My gosh.

143
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,362
Did the doctors allow you to head home?

144
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:21,732
Tae Kyung, how is it that you escorted Grandmother home?

145
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,842
Tae Kyung's marrying Ms. Jang.

146
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:27,441
What? Who's doing what with whom?

147
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,882
Gong Tae Kyung is marrying Jang Se Jin.

148
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,342
Tae Kyung, is this for real?

149
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,482
Why are you all taken aback when this calls for celebration?

150
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:37,181
Set the table, will you?

151
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,151
The bland hospital food almost made me sick.

152
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,122
Of course, Grandmother.

153
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,872
(Application of Divorce by Mutual Consent)

154
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,171
(My son)

155
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,321
Mom, I'm marrying Ms. Jang.

156
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:15,992
Where are you?

157
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,071
What's going on? Marriage, did you say?

158
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,311
It's as I texted.

159
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:36,541
Ms. Jang and I agreed to marry.

160
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,941
I said I was getting a divorce.

161
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,181
You don't need to go through with this marriage.

162
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,752
There's no particular reason. I'm just going to marry her.

163
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:46,651
Do you even love Ms. Jang?

164
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,592
She's someone I need.

165
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:54,092
Tae Kyung,

166
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:57,602
I know you're doing this for my sake.

167
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:00,232
Why would you sacrifice yourself for me?

168
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,701
Think again because I won't allow it.

169
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,671
Whether or not I make a sacrifice is up to me.

170
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,811
I will marry her without your approval.

171
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,012
How could you...

172
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:11,142
Ms. Jang's parents will be coming over tomorrow for a meal.

173
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,142
It's a family gathering in a way,

174
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,482
but whether you attend is up to you.

175
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:18,021
That's what I came here to say.

176
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:19,821
I'll get going.

177
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,421
Tae Kyung.

178
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:23,321
Tae Kyung!

179
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,332
A pre-wedding family gathering?

180
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:31,201
Really?

181
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:35,171
Yes, you have been invited over for a meal tomorrow.

182
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,571
Gosh, you weren't kidding.

183
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,002
I haven't been there in years.

184
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:41,671
What should I wear?

185
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:45,781
By the way, is his mother back home?

186
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,352
Did she approve?

187
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:51,382
Not yet, but we'll soon break the news to her.

188
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,722
Where are you going?

189
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,392
You need to get ready to meet your future in-laws.

190
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:02,161
Once again, he's ruining the mood.

191
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,031
Don't you worry though.

192
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:06,771
I'll drag him over there if it comes to that.

193
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,521
I lied that I was infertile.

194
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:29,651
I told Tae Kyung...

195
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,762
that I didn't mind paper marriage because I couldn't have a baby.

196
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:43,102
(Korean Language Teacher)

197
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,342
Hello?

198
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:49,342
Do you have the test results?

199
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:51,541
It's confirmed that I have a relapse.

200
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,512
I'm sorry, Mr. Jang.

201
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:56,311
I'm afraid you will have to find someone else.

202
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:59,181
Don't worry about that.

203
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:02,151
Just make sure that you get better.

204
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,161
You have to live.

205
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,962
Okay. I'll pay you a visit soon.

206
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:09,862
Bye.

207
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,892
I told Tae Kyung the truth.

208
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:43,531
That I'm not infertile.

209
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:47,472
And that I lied because I wanted to marry him.

210
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,472
I thought he would get mad,

211
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,612
but he proposed instead.

212
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,082
I was surprised too.

213
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:02,051
Did Tae Kyung propose to you?

214
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,382
Yes.

215
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:09,821
Why are you telling me all that?

216
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:12,492
Things like this won't happen again.

217
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,232
I will never do anything you don't like again.

218
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:21,102
I was just desperate.

219
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,771
I didn't want to lose Tae Kyung.

220
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,242
Tae Kyung is okay with this.

221
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:33,651
Why are you against it when the one to get married is okay?

222
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:36,051
People all make mistakes sometimes.

223
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,021
When you make one, you just need to fix it.

224
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,321
Se Jin.

225
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,291
All parents let their children get their own way.

226
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,492
But why are you trying to stand in my way?

227
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,222
Why are you always so harsh on me?

228
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:48,492
Can you please...

229
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,602
let me get my own way this once?

230
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:54,332
That's what your child wants.

231
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,801
I'm really desperate here.

232
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,872
Why can't you see how I'm feeling?

233
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,612
Why are you always like this?

234
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:21,132
So are you saying you will go through with this marriage?

235
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,262
No matter how hard I try to dissuade you?

236
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:27,071
Yes.

237
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:31,872
Let's go home.

238
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,012
What are you waiting for? Come with me.

239
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:41,712
We have a pre-wedding family gathering to attend tomorrow.

240
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,541
I knew you wouldn't be able to fall asleep.

241
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,882
How about a drink?

242
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:15,781
All right.

243
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:23,321
I'm sorry to say this,

244
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:24,362
but you did the right thing.

245
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:28,732
It must've been a hard decision. What changed your mind?

246
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:32,962
As you suggested,

247
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:35,801
I will decide what to do.

248
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,772
So you should make up your mind as well.

249
00:17:39,302 --> 00:17:40,711
Don't hesitate.

250
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,181
I wonder what decision she made.

251
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:45,981
What?

252
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,352
What are you so deep in thought about?

253
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:49,711
I've been drinking alone.

254
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:53,522
You should go now. I'm coming down with a cold.

255
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,241
I'm cold.

256
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:24,582
This is Gong Tae Kyung.

257
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:26,481
Thank you for today.

258
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:29,092
I hope you will make a good decision.

259
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:30,721
Good night.

260
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,431
You can't have an abortion?

261
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:36,961
So you're going to have the baby without telling him?

262
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:40,602
It's not his. It's mine.

263
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:45,772
It's mine?

264
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,342
That's absurd.

265
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:01,251
What are you doing?

266
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,392
Bong Nim, what are you doing so early in the morning?

267
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,161
You've been up all night like this?

268
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,931
Stop being so carefree and help me find it.

269
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,532
What are you looking for?

270
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,471
I need to find out who did this to Yeon Doo.

271
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,302
Just search the room and find something.

272
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:19,671
Right.

273
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:28,951
My goodness. What's wrong with this?

274
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:35,622
Welcome. Please come on in.

275
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:38,292
Thank you for having us over, ma'am.

276
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,792
I mean, Ms. Eun, our dear in-law.

277
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:44,632
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep a wink.

278
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:47,401
It's even nicer to see you here.

279
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,201
I never knew we'd be in-laws.

280
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,042
Tell me about it.

281
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:54,671
I didn't expect our kids to get married.

282
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,812
Isn't Ms. Lee here?

283
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,751
She's far away on a trip now,

284
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,711
so I told her not to come.

285
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:05,421
All right. Let's have a seat.

286
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,322
We should eat first.

287
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:09,921
This way, please. Follow me.

288
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,261
We didn't have enough time to prepare food,

289
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,362
so please be understanding that we bought some dishes.

290
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:17,332
They look really nice.

291
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:20,261
We're grateful that we get to taste such nice dishes.

292
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:23,731
They smell amazing.

293
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,501
I bet the food is from a hotel.

294
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:29,812
We got this from a head chef of a five-star hotel.

295
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:33,382
Chan Sik, give it to them before we eat.

296
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:34,382
Okay.

297
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,451
Here.

298
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:47,562
My goodness. What is going on?

299
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:50,362
This is an apartment contract.

300
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,501
Ms. Eun.

301
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,632
I'm well aware...

302
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:56,872
that causing trouble to others is the last thing you want to do.

303
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:00,001
But we're family now.

304
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,272
I just want my family members...

305
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:04,711
to live in a decent place.

306
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:08,651
It's a small apartment, so feel free to accept it.

307
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,622
We won't have to worry about moving out anymore,

308
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:14,852
Ms. Eun.

309
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,892
Thank you so much.

310
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:23,392
What are you doing? You should be grateful for her generous gesture.

311
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:29,501
You didn't have to do this, Ms. Eun. Thank you so much.

312
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,572
My pleasure.

313
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:34,741
Ms. Eun, Ms. Lee is here.

314
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:35,812
- What? - Who?

315
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:36,872
Honey?

316
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:39,842
My gosh. Ms. Lee is finally here.

317
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,251
Nice to meet you.

318
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:42,812
Ms. Jang.

319
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:44,951
Let me ask you something.

320
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:49,022
What's up your sleeve to marry my son?

321
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,761
Pardon?

322
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,021
Ms. Eun, Ms. Lee is here.

323
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,091
- What? - Who?

324
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,150
Honey?

325
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,160
My gosh. Ms. Lee is finally here.

326
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,460
Nice to meet you.

327
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,031
Ms. Jang.

328
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,230
Let me ask you something.

329
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:08,131
What's up your sleeve to marry my son?

330
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,071
Pardon?

331
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,740
Up her sleeve?

332
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,871
I know you're my son-in-law's mom, but that's very harsh of you to say.

333
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:16,641
I know Mother is making you.

334
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:19,510
What are you getting? Money?

335
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,111
What are you doing?

336
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:25,621
This is for your son's marriage. What kind of mother would do this?

337
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:26,990
Answer me, Ms. Jang.

338
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,990
I'm asking you why you're marrying Tae Kyung.

339
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,930
- That... - Don't answer.

340
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,331
Tae Kyung.

341
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,301
She's going to be my wife.

342
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,131
Don't treat her like that, Mom.

343
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:42,871
What?

344
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,970
She hasn't done anything wrong.

345
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:47,811
This was my choice. I asked her to marry me.

346
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,581
So no matter what you say, nothing will change.

347
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,311
I'm going to take care of her and protect her until the end.

348
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,081
You.

349
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:02,750
Come out for a second.

350
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:07,631
Gosh. Seriously.

351
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:12,531
Has he gone insane?

352
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,730
He was always so nice to his Mom. What's gotten into him?

353
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,170
I guess she's more important than his mom.

354
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,381
I'm going to ask you one last time.

355
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,351
Let's leave this house together.

356
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,821
No.

357
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,220
This is my home, and those people are my family.

358
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,200
I'll stay here, so leave if you want to.

359
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:46,361
I know...

360
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,071
you're doing this on purpose.

361
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:51,541
You're worried I'm going to get hurt.

362
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,400
You're worried I'm going to blame myself.

363
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,841
I know you're just saying things.

364
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,551
Even if I leave,

365
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,581
you'll stay.

366
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,321
You must've really made up your mind.

367
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:10,460
Okay. If I can't convince you,

368
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:12,660
I'll follow you.

369
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:15,730
I can't leave you alone.

370
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,861
How could I do that?

371
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:20,101
However,

372
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,631
if you ever want to take things back,

373
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,271
promise me you'll do so whenever you want.

374
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,041
As long as you promise me that,

375
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:32,480
I'll do whatever you want.

376
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:37,450
Promise me.

377
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:41,650
I promise.

378
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,281
Mother.

379
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,891
Sorry I made a ruckus.

380
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,220
I made a mistake because it involved my son.

381
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,561
It's fine.

382
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:23,391
I fully understand.

383
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:27,470
Ms. Jang. Regardless of how you started,

384
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,170
please take good care of Tae Kyung.

385
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:33,771
Once you get married, he'll become your husband...

386
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:35,811
instead of my son.

387
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:39,041
Yes, Ms. Lee.

388
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,081
I'll do my best.

389
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:43,051
Okay.

390
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,621
The soup must've gotten cold.

391
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:48,591
I'll reheat it.

392
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,391
Gosh.

393
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:55,131
It's nice having you here.

394
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,101
Let's really start eating.

395
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,930
Eat up.

396
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,940
- Gosh. - You packed so much for us.

397
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,980
You're treating us so well.

398
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:16,281
Tae Kyung. Why is your face so red?

399
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,621
I'm fine. I just need some rest.

400
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,660
Se Jin. Don't come with us.

401
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:25,960
Take care of Tae Kyung.

402
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,861
I'm fine. I need to go to the hotel.

403
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:31,930
Have a safe trip home.

404
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,801
You must be tired. Get some rest.

405
00:26:36,871 --> 00:26:37,871
Let's go.

406
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,611
Call me if you feel really sick.

407
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:47,351
I'll go.

408
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,371
What's wrong with my body?

409
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,071
Gosh.

410
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:14,871
Bong Nim. Stop it.

411
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:17,141
We can't find it, no matter how long we look.

412
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,910
Mom. We skipped breakfast.

413
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,510
Let's eat at least.

414
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,210
Is he a ghost or something?

415
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,750
They dated for a year. Why can't we find anything?

416
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,021
I'm sure Yeon Doo burned everything.

417
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:32,861
Wait.

418
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:35,391
Wait.

419
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:39,631
- I found it! - What is it?

420
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:41,470
- I found it. - What is it?

421
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:43,101
(Calucia Hotel, Room 2111, Jun Ha)

422
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:46,571
Calucia Hotel. Room 2111. Jun Ha?

423
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,571
This must be him.

424
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,480
This punk.

Wait.

Yes, Uncle. Is Mom okay?

439
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,170
Your mom and Dong Wook went to Calucia Hotel.

440
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,000
To find that guy from room 2111.

441
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,111
What? Where's my car?

442
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,750
(Notice of penalty and towing)

443
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,690
Oh, no.

447
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,581
Please help me.

448
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,460
- Hurry. - Hurry.

449
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,361
Where is he?

450
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:58,141
Excuse me. This is from this hotel, right?

451
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,841
Yes. This is a card key from our hotel.

452
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,371
- Wait. Where? - Mom. Over there.

453
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,111
- Okay. Thank you. - Let's go.

454
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,920
Jun Ha! You're in there, aren't you?

455
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,591
Come out before we force our way in!

456
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:22,260
Come out now!

457
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,831
Bring our Yeon Doo back to normal!

458
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:26,861
I'll kill you and kill myself today!

459
00:30:27,631 --> 00:30:28,831
What are you doing?

460
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,410
This is my room.

461
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,940
Who are you? Why are you making a scene in front of my room?

462
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:39,480
I'm glad you're here.

463
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,210
You're Jun Ha, aren't you?

464
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,950
That name again?

465
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,351
That's not me.

466
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:47,551
How dare you lie?

467
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:50,250
Calucia Hotel. Room 2111. It's you.

468
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,900
Do you see this? Gong Tae Kyung?

469
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,031
That's my name.

470
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:02,170
What?

471
00:31:03,301 --> 00:31:04,440
There's no way.

472
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,611
That punk should be here.

473
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,470
Please leave.

474
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,210
If you keep making noise, I'm going to call security.

475
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:17,150
Hey. Did you get plastic surgery?

476
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,321
Did you get a fake ID?

477
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,391
- What are you doing? - Let go, Mom.

478
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:24,260
Open the door. Are you hiding that punk in there?

479
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,490
Stop it, you punk!

480
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,660
Mom! What's wrong with you?

481
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,190
Why are you yelling at me instead of him?

482
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:33,230
Look. Is this face and this face the same?

483
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,531
Let's get ended up at the police station and go.

484
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:37,071
Let's go. Come on.

485
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,010
Come on. Gosh.

486
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,970
Come on, let's go.

487
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,881
Stop staring and let's go.

488
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:49,210
Gosh. Come on! Goodness.

489
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,521
What's going on? What's with all of the noise?

490
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,150
Wait. You...

491
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:01,561
Is it you again?

492
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,831
Are you following me?

493
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,331
I made a mistake again.

494
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:10,301
Sorry. I'm staying a floor above.

495
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,141
- Sorry. - Seriously. What rotten luck!

496
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:16,571
What?

497
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,381
Was I not clear?

498
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,210
I'm off to a terrible morning thanks to you, you punk.

499
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,160
Oh, no.

500
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,541
Mr. Gong.

501
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,811
Mr. Gong!

502
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,750
Mr. Gong?

503
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:00,781
My gosh.

504
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:02,621
Mr. Gong.

505
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,391
Mr. Gong, wake up!

506
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:06,720
What's going on?

507
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,061
Keep it down.

508
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,601
- Should I call an ambulance? - No, don't.

509
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:13,831
He's staying in this room. Hurry.

510
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:15,430
Right, of course.

511
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,571
Just a second.

512
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,551
Shouldn't he...

513
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,480
be taken to the infirmary?

514
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,521
(For coughing, phlegm, and sore throats)

515
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:41,231
He seems to have the common cold.

516
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,191
Thank you for helping.

517
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:45,030
I'll get going, then.

518
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,260
Is he not answering?

519
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,860
What if my dear son-in-law passed out somewhere?

520
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,130
Why would he pass out when he's a doctor?

521
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,430
Still. You never know.

522
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,340
Hello, Ms. Lee.

523
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,340
Who is it? The chairman's wife?

524
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:31,180
I should've called you in advance, I apologize.

525
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,780
Yes, we made it back home.

526
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,811
Are you perhaps free tomorrow?

527
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,680
I have a few things to say to you.

528
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:40,680
Of course, I'm free. Sure.

529
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,151
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

530
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:44,720
Have a restful evening, then.

531
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:51,401
You saw how Ms. Lee took a blow earlier.

532
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,001
"She's going to be my wife."

533
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:55,030
"Don't treat her like that, Mom."

534
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,601
How charismatic was that?

535
00:34:57,601 --> 00:35:00,401
I wouldn't mind him as a husband if you ask me.

536
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:01,410
What?

537
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,271
My goodness.

538
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:07,380
An apartment unit suddenly fell into our laps.

539
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,220
I didn't expect your marriage to benefit us this soon.

540
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,280
My gosh.

541
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:18,561
How did she know to call me at this very second?

542
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:22,331
I'm going to gloat to my friend.

543
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,860
As for you, don't forget...

544
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,800
to visit Tae Kyung first thing tomorrow morning.

545

546
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,610
Are you reading this?

547
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:38,910
Check it out.

548
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,351
It's a purchase agreement for an apartment unit.

549
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:42,651
Didn't I tell you...

550
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:45,481
that my daughter was going to marry into a rich family?

551
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,990
The second her in-laws pay the rest of it,

552
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,220
I'll sell the unit to pay off my debt.

553
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:53,891
Until then, you are to stay away.

554
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,930
I thought you were lying about your daughter's in-laws,

555
00:35:58,001 --> 00:35:59,260
but you weren't.

556
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,360
Tell me about it.

557
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,700
But Lady, you still have a lot to learn from us.

558
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,970
What could I have to learn from you?

559
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,840
You should've asked for more from a family that rich.

560
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,711
The unit should be over 132 square meters...

561
00:36:12,711 --> 00:36:14,340
for you to pay back the debt...

562
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,481
and also leave some for yourself.

563
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:19,751
Over 132 square meters?

564
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:20,851
That's right.

565
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,021
How naive of you.

566
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:54,450
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

567
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,970
(Look at you sleep...)

568
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:09,521
Look at you sleep unaware of who nursed you all night.

569
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:12,561
Thank you for yesterday.

570
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,561
Drink lots of warm water and get well soon.

571
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,311
Excuse me. Who's there?

572
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:45,717
Excuse me. Who's there?

573
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:52,297
Who is it?

574
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,268
Hey, you're up.

575
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:06,007
How are you feeling?

576
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:09,907
Was it you? Were you here all night?

577
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,418
You've finally cooled down a little.

578
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,418
It was serious.

579
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:23,128
I worried all night.

580
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,067
I don't remember anything.

581
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,268
How did I get back here?

582
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:33,338
What?

583
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:36,338
Well, I couldn't reach you.

584
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,907
I came by thinking you could be sick...

585
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:40,478
when I saw an employee helping you down the hall.

586
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:43,547
I let myself in using the card key I got...

587
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:45,447
for when your mother stayed here.

588
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:49,088
You can probably fill in the rest.

589
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:50,518
I see.

590
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:52,757
You must've exhausted yourself all night.

591
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:56,728
Don't overexert yourself and take it easy.

592
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,467
What? You don't want me to stay too close to you?

593
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:46,378
It's not like that. I just don't want you to catch a cold.

594
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,277
What?

595
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,378
That doesn't sound like you. Do you care about me?

596
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:55,617
It's not pleasant to spread the virus to others.

597
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,518
I'm not some stranger though. Now you sound like Gong Tae Kyung.

598
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:03,257
I'm joking.

599
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:08,668
This isn't going to work. You should get an IV.

600
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:11,097
I don't need an IV.

601
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:13,697
If I leave you here like this,

602
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,237
I'll get a scolding from both Ms. Eun and Ms. Lee.

603
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,907
I'm doing this as an assistant,

604
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,808
so please do as I say, Mr. Gong.

605
00:42:24,677 --> 00:42:26,947
Then just take me to the hospital.

606
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:29,887
Okay. Where's your jacket?

607
00:42:32,987 --> 00:42:36,487
Oh, right. I'm meeting with Ms. Lee for lunch. Will you come?

608
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:41,467
Forget it. I shouldn't have said that.

609
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:44,027
I'll go.

610
00:42:45,168 --> 00:42:46,168
What?

611
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:48,768
You took care of me all night, so I should return your favour.

612
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:50,907
Lunch is on me.

613
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,078
But you don't have to nurse me again.

614
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,308
All right.

615
00:42:58,378 --> 00:43:00,918
Our marriage is just perfunctory.

616
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:08,628
I forgot to bring my phone.

617
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,688
Wait in the parking lot. I'll be right there.

618
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,867
What am I doing?

619
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:28,007
Do you know Gong Tae Kyung?

620
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:32,078
Right. It's her.

621
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,608
His girlfriend could've gotten the wrong idea.

622
00:44:38,148 --> 00:44:40,418
Oh, right. The message.

623
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:45,887

And there will be a fine.

Why does it have to be today?

Hello?

00:45:46,248 --> 00:45:49,317
You applied for the Korean instructor position online,

But you teach Korean anyway.

646
00:46:08,038 --> 00:46:09,237
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:09,507 --> 00:46:12,277
To be honest, I'm not comfortable working at a school.

648
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,608
I understand.

Ms. Kang Bong Nim, is something wrong?

Why? What do you want?

- My fault? - Yes.

but why did you insist that it was a conception dream?

669
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:49,007
There's no way it's a conception dream. It's impossible.

670
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,137
This is all your fault.

671
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:53,578
My daughter got in trouble because of you!

672
00:47:53,777 --> 00:47:57,148
It's your fault, so do something for my daughter's ruined life!

673
00:48:01,987 --> 00:48:05,188
It's my fault. I'm responsible for what has happened.

674
00:48:06,288 --> 00:48:08,588
I'm so sorry, Ms. Kang Bong Nim.

675
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,788
I'm just ignorant.

676
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:48,768
I've been illiterate my whole life.

677
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:53,398
I'm stupid and unsophisticated, so I raised my children wrong.

678
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:55,637
It's all my fault.

679
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,708
Those who are well-educated and sophisticated...

680
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:03,208
aren't so different though.

681
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,817
I went to one of the most prestigious universities,

682
00:49:06,317 --> 00:49:08,347
but things about my children don't go my way.

683
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:11,588
Do you mean it?

684
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:12,717
Sure.

685
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,157
"Live an honest life. Work with diligence."

686
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:17,527
"Don't lie."

687
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:20,797
I always tell others what's right,

688
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,067
but I failed to raise my children well.

689
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:27,567
I'm the one who's ignorant and stupid.

690
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:28,808
You know, Ms. Kang Bong Nim?

691
00:49:47,788 --> 00:49:48,788
(Thank you. I hope you will make a good decision.)

692
00:49:48,788 --> 00:49:49,887
(Are you at the hotel? Help me. Please go to Room 2111.)

693
00:50:07,777 --> 00:50:09,407
Why did I have a dream like that?

694
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,157
Darn it.

695
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,108
Is this Ms. Jang's?

696
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:43,208
(Sinhwa Department Store)

697
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,277
I didn't know you were here to buy a gift.

698
00:50:45,978 --> 00:50:48,987
My daughter-in-law is pregnant, but I didn't get her anything yet.

699
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:51,887
She uses only luxury products.

700
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,058
I'm not sure if she will like this.

701
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,987
It's not like only luxury products are useful.

702
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:57,958
Everything that a baby uses is precious.

703
00:50:58,728 --> 00:50:59,898
You can't set a price on it.

704
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,898
Yes, Ms. Lee. I'll keep that in mind.

705
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:08,838
Now that I see a pregnant woman,

706
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,608
It reminds me of that girl from the food cart.

707
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,208
You delivered the present, right?

708
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,547
I gave her a department store gift card,

709
00:51:16,547 --> 00:51:17,578
but she didn't accept it.

710
00:51:18,217 --> 00:51:20,277
She said she wanted to leave it as a nice memory.

711
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:22,387
I see.

712
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:26,518
She's a nice person, so she'll make a good mom.

713
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,728
Could you repair this with the same button?

714
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:36,697
I had to inquire with headquarters on whether we have the same button,

715
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:38,097
but since it's a holiday...

716
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:40,668
I'll see if the repair shop has the same button.

717
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:47,078
Thank you. I'll visit the next store.

718
00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:48,078
Yes, ma'am.

719
00:51:56,788 --> 00:51:58,858
What kind of item is this type of button normally on?

720
00:51:59,558 --> 00:52:02,527
It seems like a woman's coat or a tweed jacket.

721
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:04,757
Please show me some items like that.

722
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:06,797
Who is this for?

723
00:52:06,797 --> 00:52:07,998
The person I'll marry.

724
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:10,398
She's in her early to mid 30s.

725
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,137
You can look over here.

726
00:52:15,308 --> 00:52:17,768
Let me know if you have any questions.

727
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:18,777
Okay.

728
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:35,927
What?

729
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:37,987
What?

730
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:39,027
Ms. Oh.

731
00:52:44,768 --> 00:52:47,168
Did things work out with your mother yesterday?

732
00:52:47,168 --> 00:52:48,168
What?

733
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,338
She left without meeting Mr. Kim, thanks to you.

734
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:56,847
That's true. I remember that much.

735
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:00,677
She won't even thank me.

736
00:53:01,547 --> 00:53:02,547
What?

737
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:03,987
Oh, it's nothing.

738
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:06,157
What did you come to a department store for?

739
00:53:06,987 --> 00:53:08,328
To get my cloth repaired.

740
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:10,688
I have an interview at an academy.

741
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:13,197
I hope you can get it repaired.

742
00:53:13,197 --> 00:53:14,527
I have to pick out some clothes.

743
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,628
I see. See you.

744
00:53:23,608 --> 00:53:24,737
Ms. Oh.

745
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:28,947
There's a similar button in the repair shop.

746
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:31,378
Really? That's a relief.

747
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,478
The detail is slightly different from this button.

748
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:34,748
What do you think?

749
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:37,018
Should we change one or should we change it all?

750
00:53:37,288 --> 00:53:39,617
Well...

751
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:44,157
What are you doing?

752
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:48,157
This button is the same as the button on your jacket.

753
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:49,467
What?

754
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:51,297
Why do you...

755
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:54,498
Please repair her jacket with this button for now.

756
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:55,567
Yes, sir.

757
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:03,378
Did you come to my room?

758
00:54:06,717 --> 00:54:08,217
Well...

759
00:54:08,918 --> 00:54:10,217
The thing is...

760
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:12,157
Answer me clearly.

761
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:13,558
I'm asking if you came to my room.

762
00:54:16,358 --> 00:54:18,558
I didn't know things would end up that way.

763
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:22,027
You suddenly passed out in front of his room.

764
00:54:22,597 --> 00:54:24,498
I was thankful that you helped me with my mom.

765
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:27,438
I was going to leave after your fever came down,

766
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:30,007
but she suddenly came.

767
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:33,907
Sorry.

768
00:54:39,148 --> 00:54:40,518
Your fever finally came down.

769
00:54:40,918 --> 00:54:42,447
That was dangerous.

770
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:44,918
I was worried about you all night.

771
00:54:53,197 --> 00:54:55,527
Did you catch something from me?

772
00:54:57,597 --> 00:54:58,697
I'm not sure.

773
00:54:59,237 --> 00:55:02,507
I can't be sure of that.

774
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,137
You said you nursed me all night.

775
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:05,478
I don't think it was from the nursing.

776
00:55:06,578 --> 00:55:08,108
It must be because I slept in my car.

777
00:55:08,578 --> 00:55:09,907
You slept in your car?

778
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:11,648
Why?

779
00:55:13,578 --> 00:55:15,117
I got kicked out of my house.

780
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:20,117
Mom told me not to come home.

781
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:25,328
Hey. What are you doing?

782
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:30,297
You thankfully don't have a fever. Follow me.

783
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,237
Where?

784
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:38,608
I didn't even know Tae Kyung was sick.

785
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,308
I'm a bad mom.

786
00:55:42,308 --> 00:55:44,878
I'm sure he didn't tell you because he didn't want you worrying.

787
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:47,847
His fever came down, and he seemed fine.

788
00:55:50,217 --> 00:55:54,117
I'm sorry for yelling at you in front of your parents.

789
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:58,358
This marriage happened so quickly.

790
00:55:58,927 --> 00:56:02,228
I completely understand how you must've felt.

791
00:56:03,297 --> 00:56:05,838
I'm going to ask you one more time.

792
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:10,608
Are you still on Mother's side?

793
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,078
What?

794
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,277
I don't want to believe...

795
00:56:15,277 --> 00:56:17,648
that you decided to get married because Mother told you to.

796
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,677
You can't get married because of what other people want.

797
00:56:22,688 --> 00:56:25,387
If you want to marry Tae Kyung,

798
00:56:26,657 --> 00:56:28,987
please be on Tae Kyung's side,

799
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:31,027
not Mother's.

800
00:56:32,828 --> 00:56:37,128
I know Mr. Gong had a hard time because of Ms. Eun.

801
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:40,637
Once we get married, I'm going to stop...

802
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:44,737
Ms. Eun and everyone else from treating him poorly.

803
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:48,547
Thanks for saying so.

804
00:56:49,478 --> 00:56:52,347
As long as you do that,

805
00:56:53,217 --> 00:56:55,887
I'll try my best to accept you...

806
00:56:57,317 --> 00:56:58,487
as my daughter-in-law.

807
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:03,387
You still disapprove of me, right?

808
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:08,128
It's not that I disapprove.

809
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:11,797
Honestly, I want Tae Kyung...

810
00:57:11,797 --> 00:57:14,768
to marry someone he loves.

811
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:18,168
If there was someone like that,

812
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,777
I would've done anything...

813
00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:24,608
to stop this marriage.

814
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:32,617
Look at you sleep unaware of who nursed you all night.

815
00:57:37,027 --> 00:57:41,157
Love can be slowly built over time.

816
00:57:42,027 --> 00:57:45,498
I'll try my best to do that for me and Tae Kyung.

817
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,067
Please watch over us, Ms. Lee.

818
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:50,668
Okay.

819
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,038
There is such a thing as attachment.

820
00:57:56,378 --> 00:57:58,047
Tae Kyung isn't coming.

821
00:57:58,047 --> 00:57:59,617
I'll head in first.

822
00:57:59,617 --> 00:58:00,817
Go after you see Tae Kyung.

823
00:58:01,918 --> 00:58:02,987
Yes, Ms. Lee.

824
00:58:09,328 --> 00:58:10,688
(Ms. Jang)

825
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,197
Sorry.

826
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:25,378
I was too into the food.

827
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:27,237
It must've been hard nursing me.

828
00:58:28,078 --> 00:58:30,148
Don't worry and eat up.

829
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,117
Okay. I won't turn you down. I'll eat as much as I want.

830
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:39,058
Why did you get kicked out?

831
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:46,458
I told Mom that I wanted to have the baby.

832
00:58:48,668 --> 00:58:50,197
You made your decision.

833
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:52,697
Yes.

834
00:58:53,737 --> 00:58:56,867
I want to have the baby and raise it on my own.

835
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:58,838
I'll give the baby my last name.

836
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:01,978
I'll be both a mom and a dad and raise it well.

837
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:07,418
From what I saw yesterday, your mother seemed very emotional.

838
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,018
Are you going to be okay?

839
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:19,858
Ms. Oh.

840
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:25,567
It's okay.

841
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:29,567
I'll convince Mom somehow.

842
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:33,507
This baby and I...

843
00:59:33,507 --> 00:59:37,708
are both trying hard to survive. We're going to get through it.

844
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:45,018
I want to ask you something.

845
00:59:46,117 --> 00:59:49,788
What decision did you end up making?

846
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:57,228
Marriage.

847
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:05,067
You're marrying her.

848
01:00:07,277 --> 01:00:10,108
She didn't get the wrong idea about me, right?

849
01:00:10,947 --> 01:00:12,217
There's no reason for her to.

850
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,978
It's a marriage of convenience.

851
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:20,817
What? Marriage of convenience?

852
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,737
Honestly, I want Tae Kyung...

853
01:00:38,737 --> 01:00:41,308
to marry someone he loves.

854
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:44,478
If there was someone like that, I would've done anything...

855
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:48,078
to stop this marriage.

856
01:00:55,757 --> 01:00:57,387
What? I'm busy.

857
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,728
I'm going to meet Ms. Eun.

858
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:00,958
Going where?

859
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:05,097
I'm going to ask Ms. Eun to give us a bigger apartment.

860
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,637
What? Are you crazy?

861
01:01:08,438 --> 01:01:09,768
Don't go!

862
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,208
I just tried to stuff my face,

863
01:01:17,078 --> 01:01:18,208
but this is tough.

864
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:22,317
I should get going now.

865
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:24,817
I'll pay.

866
01:01:24,817 --> 01:01:26,458
Of course, you will.

867
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:30,328
Please excuse me. I need to go to the restroom.

868
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:48,507
What? She is...

869
01:01:48,507 --> 01:01:49,578
Mom!

870
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,007
You should be grateful for what we already got.

871
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:53,277
What's wrong with you?

872
01:01:53,518 --> 01:01:55,447
What's with that submissive attitude?

873
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:58,447
Can't I at least tell her an apartment I want?

874
01:01:58,817 --> 01:02:00,688
Please stop it now.

875
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:02,128
I told you.

876
01:02:02,128 --> 01:02:04,458
If you stay put, this marriage will never be called off.

877
01:02:04,628 --> 01:02:05,898
How can you be so sure?

878
01:02:05,898 --> 01:02:07,958
You never know what will happen in life.

879
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:11,197
Ms. Eun, Ms. Lee, and even Tae Kyung trust me.

880
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:13,137
So you should trust me.

881
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,507
Trust me and don't do anything.

882
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,108
Tae Kyung doesn't have romantic feelings for you.

883
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:23,347
- What? - Once a man falls in love,

884
01:02:23,347 --> 01:02:25,447
he will go through fire and water for the woman he loves.

885
01:02:25,447 --> 01:02:28,277
If that happens, how will you keep Tae Kyung with you?

886
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,717
I lied to Tae Kyung that I was infertile.

887
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:36,788
I told him that I couldn't have a baby.

888
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,358
Once we get married, I'll have as many kids as I need...

889
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:42,058
to keep him with me.

890
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:46,538
Tae Kyung can't get away from me. So don't worry.

891
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:54,478
Infertile?

892
01:02:55,748 --> 01:02:56,847
Lie?

893
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:01,078
What is this all about?

894
01:03:03,588 --> 01:03:04,688
About Gong Tae Kyung?

895
01:03:57,038 --> 01:03:59,438
(The Real Has Come!)

896
01:03:59,608 --> 01:04:00,708
What are you talking about?

897
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,177
How can you be sure that I'm the father?

898
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:05,407
I quit my job at the academy.

899
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:07,418
He must be the groom.

900
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:10,847
Why did you lie with such beautiful lips?

901
01:04:12,858 --> 01:04:15,018
Your resume is quite impressive.

902
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,458
Are you sure you can work at a place like this?

903
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,558
- Help! - Call 911!

904
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:21,898
Now that it's already like this...

905
01:04:21,898 --> 01:04:23,728
Do you want to ruin my life?

906
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,137
I'm the father of this baby!

907
01:04:26,498 --> 01:04:27,637
Mr. Gong Tae Kyung...
