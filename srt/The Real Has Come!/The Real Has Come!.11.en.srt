00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:01,514
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:01,703 --> 00:00:03,873
I can do this for you.

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,912
This is what I want to eat.

4
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:08,482
I make better geotjeori than you do.

5
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:12,252
I’m glad that you recovered your strength, Mother.

6
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:13,883
I have to be strong...

7
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,153
for my children and grandchildren.

8
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:18,793
They must be here.

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,132
Are you nervous?

10
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:32,373
I'm fine.

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,373
This is where people live after all.

12
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:52,452
Hello.

13
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,223
Welcome. We're glad that you've become our family.

14
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:56,392
You're here.

15
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:57,862
Mother.

16
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,732
Welcome, Yeon Doo. I'm glad you're here.

17
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:02,603
- Thank you. - Where's Mom?

18
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,603
- She's in the kitchen. - I'm here.

19
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,803
Hello, Grandmother. I'm here.

20
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,812
Okay. Welcome to my house.

21
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,442
Thank you.

22
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:20,952
- Oh, my. - Oh, my!

23
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:22,053
Grandmother!

24
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:24,023
- Oh, my. - Mother.

25
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:32,532
What are you doing?

26
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:33,832
What do you mean, what am I doing?

27
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:37,532
Is it wrong to throw some salt at an unlucky guest...

28
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:39,633
I don't want in my home?

29
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,832
Unlucky?

30
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:42,472
How could you say that to a pregnant woman?

31
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:43,573
Oh, my.

32
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:47,172
It must be expensive salt.

33
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:48,612
What?

34
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,743
I chewed on the grain of salt, and it wasn't salty at all.

35
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:57,222
Thank you for the exciting welcome, Grandmother.

36
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:59,493
Oh, my. You.

37
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:03,993
From now on, I'll try my best to be a lucky granddaughter-in-law.

38
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:08,233
I'll change into clothes without salt on them...

39
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,703
and come to greet you again.

40
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:10,963
Come again?

41
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:14,102
Don't take one step into my house without my permission again.

42
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:17,243
You don't have to say that. We don't plan to come often anyway.

43
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:19,713
Mother.

44
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:22,683
Don't fight with Grandmother because of me.

45
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:26,882
I'm sure Grandmother knows what she did wrong.

46
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:29,222
Oh, my.

47
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,882
- Let's go, Yeon Doo. - Okay.

48
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:43,903
Gosh.

49
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,012
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

50
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,282
You must be very offended.

51
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:00,852
Are you okay?

52
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,153
Yes. I'm okay now.

53
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:07,553
I had prepared myself,

54
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,322
but it still surprised me.

55
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:11,993
Gosh.

56
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:16,233
I didn't know I'd end up playing a granddaughter-in-law...

57
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,903
who gets hit with salt thrown by her grandmother-in-law.

58
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:24,002
I have no words.

59
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:28,583
It's not your fault.

60
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,683
She told us we couldn't go into that house.

61
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:33,083
That's good news.

62
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,292
The interior of this house is really perfect for newlyweds.

63
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:42,423
Ms. Jang did that.

64
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:45,262
I didn't bother to change it since we would be leaving soon.

65
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:48,703
We're not actually married. There's no reason to waste money.

66
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:50,903
Let's see.

67
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:55,703
Oh, my.

68
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,113
Oh, my.

69
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:04,912
Which room should I use?

70
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,582
Since you have a baby, use this room with the bed.

71
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:11,452
Also, I prepared something to welcome you.

72
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:12,923
What is it?

73
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:14,952
A gift?

74
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:20,062
I don't want to see him,

75
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,762
so don't set the table for him ever again.

76
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,132
Yes, Ms. Eun.

77
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,402
They're both the same.

78
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:27,673
How did he find someone just like him? Gosh.

79
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:30,303
Grandma was also in the wrong.

80
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:32,373
She kept talking back, not even breaking eye contact.

81
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,942
She's so rude and brazen.

82
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:35,683
What did she use to do?

83
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:36,683
What?

84
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:39,452
She used to teach kids at an academy.

85
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,983
How could a teacher get pregnant before getting married?

86
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,522
How crude and uneducated.

87
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,353
You can't say things like that these days.

88
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:48,123
A lot of people get pregnant before getting married lately.

89
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,793
She's not even his type.

90
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,933
News reporters, flight attendants, and designers.

91
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,993
He only dated flashy women.

92
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,163
Where did those two meet?

93
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:03,272
I was only told that it was love at first sight.

94
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:04,673
Love at first sight?

95
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,012
Did they have a one-night stand?

96
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:08,712
What?

97
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:10,483
Why do you look surprised?

98
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:12,452
Was it really a one-night stand?

99
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:14,553
Did they just do it as soon as they saw each other?

100
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:16,483
How dirty.

101
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:19,053
We're eating.

102
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,593
Don't talk about what they did in private.

103
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,663
Just letting that girl into our family made such a mess.

104
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,493
It's not like that, Mother.

105
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,762
Those two love each other.

106
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,173
I'm losing my appetite.

107
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:33,933
Why did they have to move into the annex?

108
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,473
Exactly.

109
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:36,843
She didn't say so,

110
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,843
but I'm sure she came in here wanting something.

111
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:41,212
To be frank, she wouldn't have had the baby...

112
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,913
if our family wasn't well off.

113
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:44,582
She would've gotten rid of it right away.

114
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,613
She definitely has an ulterior motive.

115
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,363
"The housemate rules?"

116
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,863
This is my gift?

117
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,632
I never said it was a gift.

118
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,402
I just said I prepared something to welcome you.

119
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:07,303
"First, treat each other like an invisible person."

120
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:09,343
Even though we're living together,

121
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:11,343
let's live freely and independently, as if we're each living alone.

122
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:12,413
That's what that means.

123
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:16,743
"Second, clean up after yourself."

124
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:20,582
Let's each do our own cooking, dishes, laundry, and cleaning.

125
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:25,553
"Third, hide unpleasant bodily sounds and smells from each other."

126
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,892
What is that?

127
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:29,262
I get grossed out easily.

128
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:31,593
Let's be careful...

129
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:33,962
with unnecessary odours or smells from bodily fluids.

130
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:38,533
You're saying we should hide bodily odours and smells...

131
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,902
from each other, right?

132
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,173
Ms. Oh.

133
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:44,543
Those kinds of crude expressions are a bit rude, don't you think?

134
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,613
Rude, my foot.

135
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,613
"Fourth,"

136
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:51,512
"the cohabitation ends in three months no matter what."

137
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:56,123
"During that time, Oh Yeon Doo shall not mistake..."

138
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,053
"Gong Tae Kyung's kindness for affection."

139
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,392
What are you saying?

140
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,762
What are you doing, Ms. Oh?

141
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,562
You must've forgotten you were human...

142
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:10,033
because you've been in a hotel for too long.

143
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,733
It's normal for people to make unpleasant noises...

144
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,603
or smell bad sometimes.

145
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:16,142
We're going to be living together.

146
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:18,072
How can we pretend the other person's not there?

147
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,642
How can we only clean up after ourselves?

148
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:23,543
Wait. What's so bad about setting rules?

149
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,043
What kind of rules are those?

150
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,853
- Who is it? - I don't know.

151
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,163
The password's still the same.

152
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:39,993
Here's some food. Mom told me to take it to you.

153
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:41,392
Okay.

154
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,202
Is that all?

155
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:45,832
Shouldn't you at least say thanks?

156
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,502
Oh, thank you.

157
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,702
Tell Mother we will enjoy it.

158
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,772
The interior is still the same.

159
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,913
Ms. Jang picked everything. Doesn't that bother you?

160
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,483
I'm a practical person.

161
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,053
I also don't know much about interior design.

162
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:07,192
Yeon Doo. You have some ulterior motive, don't you?

163
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,022
What? An ulterior motive?

164
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:14,262
Tae Kyung normally likes women with glamorous bodies.

165
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,632
You had many chances to get rid of the baby.

166
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,673
What are your intentions behind coming into our house?

167
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,173
Wealth? Honour?

168
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:26,412
Relax.

169
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:32,042
You're not that great a judge of character.

170
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:33,782
Me?

171
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:37,583
It's not just about what you see.

172
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:41,853
I'm more voluptuous than I look.

173
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:43,363
Aren't I?

174
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,292
See?

175
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:52,032
It's such a shame that I can't show you.

176
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,973
Shall we go to a sauna together?

177
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,573
This is why I like you.

178
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:04,642
The rest of the family thinks so, but not me.

179
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:07,313
I'm on your side, so you can relax.

180
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:09,453
Keep up the fight.

181
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:13,552
Tae Kyung, is your throat sore? Why won't you say anything?

182
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,922
You don't want to be disturbed?

183
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:19,963
I'll leave. See you around.

184
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:21,733
Okay. Bye.

185
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,902
See? You almost got caught doing something stupid.

186
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,672
Don't you dare pretend to be someone on TV.

187
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,483
Change the door code every two weeks.

188
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:39,882
I must add that.

189
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,323
I'll write out a new set of rules.

190
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,953
Whatever.

191
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,063
Let's eat the food Mother sent us.

192
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,132
But...

193
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,682
That was good.

194
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,483
I'm stuffed.

195
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,422
It's so odd how your mother's food...

196
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:18,522
doesn't make me sick.

197
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,693
How are you able to eat in five minutes?

198
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:22,823
Oh, that?

199
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,632
I'm used to eating between classes.

200
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,162
You shouldn't pick at the vegetables.

201
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,132
Rice is what keeps us Koreans going.

202
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,532
You must watch your shape.

203
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:36,873
You'll ruin your figure if you eat all the carbs you want.

204
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:39,113
Figure, my foot.

205
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:42,583
We're so very different.

206
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:43,743
We are.

207
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,282
You heard what Yu Myung said.

208
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,182
We need a timeline to make sure...

209
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,323
No! Forget that.

210
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:53,152
You like to plan and schedule a bit too much.

211
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,623
However hard we plan, there will be holes,

212
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,162
and our predictions will be wrong.

213
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,693
We won't come across your family that much anyway.

214
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:04,932
While I shower, can you do the dishes?

215
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,532
I'll do them tomorrow.

216
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:13,343
Can we not clean up after ourselves?

217
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,802
Dae Sang.

218
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:44,243
Dong Wook.

219
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:46,772
Soo Kyum.

220
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,213
Where is everyone?

221
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:51,713
(English for Seniors)

222
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,252
My goodness.

223
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,323
What are you all doing here?

224
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:01,823
Bong Nim. I think I'm depressed.

225
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,422
I can't even cook.

226
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,993
I think I'm dyslexic.

227
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,792
I can't seem to read at all.

228
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,032
I have insomnia.

229
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,603
I miss Auntie so much, I can't sleep.

230
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:17,502
A beating will cure you all.

231
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:19,213
Get up.

232
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:20,573
You too.

233
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:21,843
Darn you.

234
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:27,052
Yeon Doo didn't leave the country.

235
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,953
I need to study.

236
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,252
Stop using Yeon Doo as an excuse and do your duties.

237
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,262
Do you need another slap?

238
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,463
Let's go.

239
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:01,282
Mom...

240
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:04,052
can't eat,

241
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,593
study,

242
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:08,892
or sleep.

243
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:12,693
No.

244
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:14,532
I must do well...

245
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,132
if Yeon Doo's to do well.

246
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:23,203
(English for Seniors)

247
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:36,652
Wait. Did he really wash only what he used?

248
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:40,853
Is this what he's like?

249
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,563
Darn it.

250
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,172
It's okay.

251
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:57,042
It feels unfamiliar,

252
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:00,012
but at least I have you.

253
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:07,782
Find a job.

254
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:13,292
Find a place where I can...

255
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,422
live alone.

256
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:18,792
Find a postnatal...

257
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,193
(Pregnancy Diary)

258
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,563
Care center.

259
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,262
And then...

260
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:29,473
Three months...

261
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:33,412
and it's over.

262
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:43,422
(Find a job, find a place,)

263
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:45,022
(find postnatal care center.)

264
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:49,493
I just need to survive here for three months.

265
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:56,863
Let's get through this together.

266
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,132
Let's do this!

267
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:03,502
Shoot.

268
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:07,943
She's so noisy.

269
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:10,412
Is it because she taught kids?

270
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:22,223
Gosh.

271
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,733
I can't believe I did the dishes.

272
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,873
What if I end up with dermatitis?

273
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,443
Why is this chair so hard?

274
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:44,943
It's just three months. Then this will all be over.

275
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:52,123
Oh, gosh.

276
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,349
Tomorrow is your dad's death anniversary.

277
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:30,878
That day came around already?

278
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:34,148
I'm sorry, Mother. I should've remembered.

279
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:37,259
Do you know why it matters who marries into the family?

280
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:40,059
If something weird enters the house,

281
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,198
it plagues not just the living but the dead too.

282
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,999
If you feel bad, make up for it...

283
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,468
by putting in extra effort.

284
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:48,738
Yes, Mother.

285
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:52,668
Mother. I think we should let Tae Kyung...

286
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,938
Did you pay attention to what I said?

287
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:57,978
Did I ever invite him to join the memorial service?

288
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:01,009
He's married now and they're expecting a baby.

289
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,319
That baby isn't of your father's descent.

290
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:05,218
That's even more reason for them not to attend.

291
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:08,559
Don't. I'm sure Tae Kyung doesn't mind.

292
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:10,619
There'll be no point in asking,

293
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,289
but Ji Myung, will you be home late due to work?

294
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,259
You got that right.

295
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:18,529
I have an evening meeting and will be late.

296
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,369
I'll try to come home as soon as possible.

297
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,869
Early or late,

298
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,609
You're only going to eat the food without putting in the work.

299
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,408
Don't worry, honey. I'll help.

300
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:28,708
You know how good my jeons are.

301
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,279
Can't we just order the food we need?

302
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,749
- Why bother with the work and... - How dare you?

303
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:38,019
America may have rubbed off on you, but he was still your grandfather.

304
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:40,019
Keep in mind...

305
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:42,089
that the same kind of food...

306
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,718
will be expected at my memorial service.

307
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,329
- Sure, Grandmother. - Of course, Mom.

308
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:55,099
So Ms. Jang left this behind?

309
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:56,938
Yes, sir. She came by...

310
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:59,408
while you were in Jeju for your business trip.

311
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,849
Of course, Mr. Gong. I'll come see you later.

312
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,589
Was it Chairman Gong? Why did he call?

313
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:16,789
Does he want you at the office early?

314
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:19,859
I handed in my resignation. That's what he called about.

315
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:22,259
What? You resigned?

316
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:25,099
I thought you took a few days off for your honeymoon.

317
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:26,769
Good.

318
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:28,869
We shouldn't get involved with that family anymore.

319
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,039
In what way is this good?

320
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,168
A broken engagement is bad enough,

321
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:35,438
so why quit her job without getting anything?

322
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,408
She should get what she can.

323
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,148
Again with that nonsense.

324
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,549
Hand back the contract for the apartment unit as well.

325
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,619
Are you out of your mind? Why would we do that...

326
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,359
when she promised to pay the rest of the money?

327
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,029
The gift was burdening to begin with.

328
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,289
It's something we shouldn't have received.

329
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:57,559
My gosh. I don't cook for you so that you can spew nonsense.

330
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,329
If you lay a finger on that apartment contract,

331
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:01,198
I'll divorce you.

332
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:08,738
Let's keep eating.

333
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,349
Help yourself, Dad.

334
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,388
You've got to be kidding me.

335
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:25,928
What should I do about this?

336
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,009
Gosh, Ms. Joo. What could've been so urgent...

337
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,109
that you asked to meet this early in the morning?

338
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:45,609
Stop sounding like losers, and check this out.

339
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,309
What is it?

340
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,119
It's the real estate contract you showed us before.

341
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:55,619
Hand it over after it's been paid in full.

342
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:58,589
Something came up which is why I'm giving it to you.

343
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:01,458
The family agreed to pay the rest.

344
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,269
Once that transaction is complete, consider my debt reduced.

345
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:08,069
Unbelievable.

346
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:23,418
It's Jang Se Jin.

347
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:28,519
What is Ms. Jang doing here?

348
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,888
Could she be coming back?

349
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:33,759
When his son dumping her is public news around here?

350
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,428
It'd be too humiliating.

351
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,829
I guess.

352
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:43,238
Coming to the office must be uncomfortable for you.

353
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:47,138
It's all right. I had to go through it once anyway.

354
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,279
So why did you ask to see me?

355
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,509
What happened recently must've hurt you immensely.

356
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:56,779
I apologize, Se Jin.

357
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:00,488
Thank you for saying so.

358
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,089
You once said you wanted to try something different.

359
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:09,829
How would you like a position in the US branch?

360
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:12,698
The US branch?

361
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:15,238
I'll support you in every way if you choose to go.

362
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,968
That thought never crossed my mind.

363
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,079
I'd like to think for a while.

364
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:26,148
Anyway, this...

365
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:29,218
It's clear rice wine.

366
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:31,648
It's your father's death anniversary tomorrow.

367
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:35,289
I kept track of it every year, so I came by with a bottle of wine.

368
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:36,789
Thank you.

369
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,789
My father would love it.

370
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,968
Look carefully. Is it not there?

371
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:51,968
I apologize, Ms. Eun.

372
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,908
I know I put it here somewhere.

373
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:55,638
What are you looking for?

374
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,109
Sponge for the brassware.

375
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,678
We have to clean the brassware, but we can't seem to locate it.

376
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:02,448
They were shelved after being washed last year.

377
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:04,349
Couldn't we use them as is, Ms. Eun?

378
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:05,349
My gosh.

379
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,718
They're washed before being stored and after they leave the cupboard.

380
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:10,119
It's a rule that must be kept. Unbelievable.

381
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:13,658
You should buy another one while picking up the rice cakes.

382
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:16,158
- Sure. - Let me pick them up.

383
00:22:17,228 --> 00:22:18,999
A baby kept crying in my dream last night,

384
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,898
and I couldn't sleep.

385
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:23,999
Maybe I should go and get myself an IV drip of fluids.

386
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,269
You're still recovering from the pain, so stay home.

387
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:27,609
I'll pick them up.

388
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:29,309
Would you?

389
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:30,708
I apologize, Mother,

390
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,749
for not being a good enough daughter-in-law.

391
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:34,609
Why would you even say that?

392
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,418
- Mother, I'll go. - Sure.

393
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:40,589
For memorial services conducted on the death anniversary,

394
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:43,988
we add 18L of rice or half of that for a plate of rice cakes.

395
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,759
Confirm that before bringing it home.

396
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:46,859
Of course.

397
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,458
How can one know how much rice went in...

398
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,999
just by looking at it?

399
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:54,329
Placing the order in person is how you can somewhat guarantee it.

400
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,668
My husband loved having rice cakes,

401
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,408
so that's the least we can do even though it's fussy.

402
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:03,039
(Blue Anchovies)

403
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,579
Is this from Mr. Choi in Namhae?

404
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:07,978
Yes, Ms. Eun. I talked to him on the phone myself.

405
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,819
Mother, I'll get going.

406
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:11,849
Sure.

407
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,218
- Mr. Kim, shall we? - Sure.

408
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:15,019
Have a safe trip, Mother.

409
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,388
I'll go to my room, then.

410
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:18,119
Where do you think you're going...

411
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,158
when there are anchovies to clean?

412
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:21,428
Sorry?

413
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:26,999
Right. Of course, I should be the one to do it.

414
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:31,198
Absolutely. You'll soon be in charge of the housework around here.

415
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:33,339
I'll go and get some rest, then.

416
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,408
Sure.

417
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,378
Picking up the rice cakes would've been easier.

418
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:43,178
When am I supposed to gut all of these?

419
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:51,218
Gosh. What are these?

420
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,128
Clean them for now.

421
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,769
But...

422
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:07,708
But what are all these?

423
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,938
Haven't you seen anchovies before?

424
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:13,678
I bet you're not acquainted with top-grade jukbang anchovies.

425
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:17,178
These are female anchovies which were sent from Namhae.

426
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:20,249
The meat is firm, and they aren't as fatty,

427
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:21,589
which is why they smell less fishy.

428
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:26,958
I see. They don't smell fishy at all.

429
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,999
What's with all the anchovies though?

430
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:31,529
You need to cook the anchovy Jeon.

431
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,138
The anchovy Jeon? Do they even exist?

432
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:38,438
They're served at memorial services in Chungcheong Province.

433
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:40,069
Grandfather's death anniversary is tomorrow.

434
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,438
Right, a memorial service.

435
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:46,549
Does anchovy Jeon even taste good?

436
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:49,819
Who cares about taste when it's a memorial service?

437
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:51,418
It's about cooking food with love.

438
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,789
Your job is to pick out anchovies that are suitable for a Jeon.

439
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,988
Those that are of sparkling silver...

440
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:00,359
with backs that are as straight as an arrow.

441
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,359
They also need to be spotless.

442
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,099
You will go through these and sort them out one by one.

443
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,938
One by one?

444
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:11,468
What is it? Don't you want to do it?

445
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,468
Aren't you also a daughter-in-law of this family?

446
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,678
I guess I am, but...

447
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:21,049
The rest of the family thinks so, but not me.

448
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:24,849
Why would I not want to do it?

449
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:26,718
Of course, I should do it, Soo Jung.

450
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,249
Good.

451
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:55,119
Jay.

452
00:25:57,378 --> 00:25:58,448
Welcome.

453
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,688
No way.

454
00:26:03,988 --> 00:26:06,728
The alcohol made me see things.

455
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,829
I must miss Jay terribly.

456
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:16,938
Jay?

457
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:18,609
I'm flying out today.

458
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,039
I'll send your belongings once I get home.

459
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,458
It must be upsetting...

460
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,458
to live with your in-laws without even having a wedding.

461
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,099
It's all right.

462
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,799
You accepting me as family is more than enough.

463
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:47,898
Did you register your marriage?

464
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:50,668
Yes, of course we did.

465
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,609
I see.

466
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:54,938
Be honest with me.

467
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:56,809
You have an ulterior motive, don't you?

468
00:26:57,938 --> 00:27:00,079
- Sorry? - Let's be honest here.

469
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,918
You knew you wouldn't be welcomed,

470
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,648
so why did you move in?

471
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:09,458
What were you after when you married into this family?

472
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,329
- What? - You're offended, aren't you?

473
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:15,089
I'm offended by the doubts you have about me.

474
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:17,958
How are we the same?

475
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:21,329
I married into this family because I love Chun Myung.

476
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,698
My family is more prestigious than his.

477
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:25,539
But I married my husband for love.

478
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:28,708
And I married Tae Kyung because I loved him.

479
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:30,638
What's the difference?

480
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:33,009
My gosh.

481
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:34,648
Just keep picking out the anchovies.

482
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,448
Make sure to pick shiny silver ones.

483
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,789
Okay. I will.

484
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:46,458
(Terminal 2)

485
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:50,198
(Check-in counters)

486
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,378
The phone is turned off.

487
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:09,718
Jay...

488
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,888
Just throw away my stuff.

489
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,089
Take care, Jay.

490
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,839
I didn't know this was here.

491
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:55,928
What's this?

492
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,168
Yeon Doo, take care. I'm going abroad.

493
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,599
Give me that.

494
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,138
You're the one I miss most at this moment.

495
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:05,138
I'm sorry for everything. I loved you.

496
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:07,468
Why are you checking my phone?

497
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:09,309
That's not the problem.

498
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,678
Who is this guy?

499
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:13,849
Why would he send this message to a married woman with a baby?

500
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,849
What's going on between you two?

501
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:18,119
Does Tae Kyung know about this?

502
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:20,148
- Just give me that. - I won't.

503
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,359
You just said you didn't have any ulterior motive.

504
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:24,188
Now what? Is there anything to hide?

505
00:29:24,658 --> 00:29:27,188
I can't let this slide. I should tell the family.

506
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:29,658
Wait, Ms. Soo Jung. Please don't do this.

507
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:31,599
I have nothing to do with him.

508
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,029
If it's no big deal, just tell them the truth without hiding anything.

509
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:44,339
What... Why are you crying?

510
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:51,849
Why won't you believe me?

511
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:55,019
He's a guy I used to date.

512
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:57,119
He just sends me a text message like this when he's drunk.

513
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,759
And Tae Kyung knows.

514
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:01,289
You can call him and check it yourself.

515
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:05,029
Really? Does Tae Kyung know about this?

516
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:06,799
Yes.

517
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,839
What did I do so wrong?

518
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:11,938
Grandmother threw salt at me,

519
00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:13,938
and you all put me down because my family is not well off.

520
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:16,708
It's not like I wanted to move in here.

521
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,309
Mother wanted us to move in here,

522
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,448
so I had no other choice.

523
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:24,819
Okay. I understand.

524
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:31,718
You've never been pregnant before.

525
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,388
What?

526
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:39,468
When you're pregnant, you become depressed and anxious.

527
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,569
You might not know what it's like to be pregnant,

528
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:45,408
but you're still a woman.

529
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:48,609
Are you making fun of me?

530
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:50,938
What?

531
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:59,218
What...

532
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,188
What's with her?

533
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:04,089
Did I do something wrong?

534
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:08,188
Darn it. Kim Jun Ha, you...

535
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:11,059
Hi, Uncle Dae Sang.

536
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,769
Anchovy Jeon for a memorial service?

537
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:15,799
Do they make Jeon with anchovies?

538
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:17,839
Don't tell Mom.

539
00:31:18,198 --> 00:31:20,468
I need to pick out anchovies. I'm hanging up.

540
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:26,779
We need to keep the entrance clean to get more customers.

541
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:30,918
We're not even open yet, but why are you wearing the uniform?

542
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,988
I just want to draw a line between work and life.

543
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:36,188
Ms. Kang, I'll be paid, right?

544
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:37,619
It depends on what you do.

545
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,428
If you don't work hard, I'll find a new chef.

546
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,898
Where's Dong Wook?

547
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:44,559
He's out to meet a friend.

548
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:50,698
Jay.

549
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:54,638
Did you come to see me?

550
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,408
Your underwear. Give it back.

551
00:31:56,408 --> 00:31:58,039
What do you think you're doing?

552
00:31:58,878 --> 00:31:59,908
I really...

553
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:03,579
I really loved this face.

554
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,218
Why did I make a mistake like that?

555
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,158
Sir, I'd like to go somewhere else.

556
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:17,259
- Excuse me. - Yes, ma'am.

557
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,799
How may I help you?

558
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:23,198
I knew it.

559
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,908
How could I mistake him for Jay?

560
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:35,878
Jay?

561
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,349
It's the psycho again.

562
00:32:40,488 --> 00:32:41,849
Are you back to pay for the soju?

563
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,988
What are you doing?

564
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,898
What's going on? Let go of me.

565
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:52,769
I'll report you to the police for sexual harassment.

566
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:56,569
You don't have the mole.

567
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:58,968
You're not Jay.

568
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:04,838
- We're back. - Hello.

569
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,709
This is a sponge for brassware.

570
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,318
Wash the plates with this.

571
00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:10,479
Where's Mother?

572
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,789
- She's in her room with Ms. Yeom. - Okay.

573
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,959
What are they doing here?

574
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,899
What do you think? It's a mess, isn't it?

575
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,008
You did a good job.

576
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:38,778
You've improved a lot only in a year.

577
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:40,749
Your grandfather...

578
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:44,479
would be proud of his granddaughter-in-law.

579
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,818
Mother, the members of the tea ceremony group are here.

580
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:52,629
What are they doing here?

581
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,528
They say you invited them over...

582
00:33:54,528 --> 00:33:56,858
to thank them for attending Tae Kyung's wedding.

583
00:33:56,928 --> 00:33:59,229
Gosh. You're right, I did.

584
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:01,169
Without Ms. Jang,

585
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:03,499
I can't keep my schedule under control.

586
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,539
I should... Hang on.

587
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:08,209
They must've seen...

588
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,539
that the wedding was called off.

589
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:14,209
Those wicked ladies.

590
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:17,379
They must be here to make fun of me.

591
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:20,588
Hey, you should call that thing in the annex...

592
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:22,919
and tell her not to step foot out the door.

593
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:24,919
Yes, Grandmother.

594
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:44,908
Welcome. It's so nice to see you guys at my place.

595
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,379
It would've been better if I knew you'd come.

596
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:49,919
We thought you'd be busy, so we didn't want to bother you.

597
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,948
- Actually, we brought some tea. - My gosh.

598
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:55,619
It's homemade jujube tea that's good for relaxing your mind and body.

599
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,718
My gosh. Come on in and have a seat.

600
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:08,928
I was really worried about you.

601
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:11,738
A pregnant woman showing up to ruin a wedding ceremony?

602
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:13,908
You must've been shocked.

603
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:17,838
Let's not talk about it. Just enjoy your tea.

604
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:19,948
Ms. Eun, I'm dying to know.

605
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:22,818
What happened to the woman who showed up at the wedding?

606
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:25,689
Is she really pregnant with your great-grandchildren?

607
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:27,919
Did you have a DNA test?

608
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:30,718
The father is a gynaecologist.

609
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,988
There's no room for doubt.

610
00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:34,928
In Ok, go bring...

611
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:37,158
the dried persimmon we got from Hamyang.

612
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,669
Yes, Mother.

613
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:44,468
Ms. Eun, what are you going to do?

614
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,039
Will you take her in?

615
00:35:46,238 --> 00:35:47,408
That's absurd.

616
00:35:47,408 --> 00:35:49,678
I've never seen such a boorish woman like her before.

617
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,678
Does she have no shame at all? In front of so many people,

618
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:56,448
she ranted and raved that she was pregnant.

619
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:59,349
There's no way a sophisticated lady like you...

620
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:02,419
can put up with an ignorant woman like her.

621
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:03,818
You might end up falling sick.

622
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:05,729
Why would I fall sick?

623
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:09,298
Do you think I'd take in such an ignorant...

624
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:11,129
and vulgar woman?

625
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:14,198
That would be ridiculous. It's just absurd.

626
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:15,499
- I know. - Tell me about it.

627
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:18,198
I kicked her out right away.

628
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:20,738
I said I'd haunt her down even after I die...

629
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:23,309
if she stood in my precious grandson's way.

630
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:26,379
And she humbly begged my pardon and wimp out that day.

631
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:29,318
How dare she? My goodness.

632
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:31,079
You know what I'm like.

633
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:34,818
She can marry my grandson over my dead body.

634
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,988
- A girl like her... - Grandmother.

635
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:40,858
What? My gosh...

636
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:44,499
What are you doing... How...

637
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:45,829
Hello.

638
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,829
I'm her granddaughter-in-law, Oh Yeon Doo.

639
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:50,669
- What... - How...

640
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,468
What's with that hanbok?

641
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:54,809
Yeon Doo, that hanbok...

642
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:59,349
Aren't I supposed to wear hanbok for the tea ceremony?

643
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:01,579
What is she talking about?

644
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:03,948
What are you doing here?

645
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:06,749
- Grandmother. - We should have persimmon later.

646
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:08,649
I'd like you to leave now.

647
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,088
Gosh.

648
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:17,829
My gosh. That was just...

649
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,169
Look at her.

650
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:23,999
Grandmother.

651
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,809
Get out this instant!

652
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:32,379
Pregnancy really is something.

653
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:35,048
Even Ms. Eun couldn't say anything in front of her.

654
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:36,678
Are you going to be okay?

655
00:37:36,678 --> 00:37:39,519
What if your son cheats again?

656
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,019
I think we should discontinue our tea ceremonies.

657
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:45,318
I no longer want to do it with people...

658
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:47,059
who pry into the lives of others too much.

659
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,658
Gosh. If you don't want people to look,

660
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:52,198
you shouldn't do things that make people curious.

661
00:37:52,198 --> 00:37:53,269
Exactly.

662
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:54,528
Don't blame others...

663
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:56,539
and take care of your son.

664
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:06,379
The hanbok Yeon Doo's wearing. It's yours, isn't it?

665
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:08,249
Did you do that on purpose?

666
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:10,948
How could you do that to a pregnant woman?

667
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,749
It's below me in this family.

668
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,218
Am I not allowed to do that?

669
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:16,619
What?

670
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:20,888
Is it your hobby to embarrass me?

671
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:23,599
Do you not listen to your elders?

672
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,499
I told you not to take one step outside.

673
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,169
Are you ignoring me now?

674
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:30,039
Are you not afraid of anything?

675
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:32,169
It wasn't that.

676
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:33,939
Soo Jung told me to put on the hanbok...

677
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,439
and come to the tea ceremony to greet people.

678
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,579
There you go lying again.

679
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,879
Why would she tell you to do something like that?

680
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:43,218
I'm telling the truth, Grandmother.

681
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:44,718
You can call her over...

682
00:38:44,718 --> 00:38:46,249
- and check with her. - What?

683
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,988
It's true, Grandmother. I did it.

684
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,959
What? Why would you do something like that?

685
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:54,888
Because I was annoyed and angry.

686
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,829
She said I wouldn't understand how pregnant women felt...

687
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:59,129
because I've never had a baby myself.

688
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:01,869
How could she say that to someone who had a miscarriage?

689
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:05,599
Yes. It was malicious and done with intent.

690
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:08,769
That's not true.

691
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:11,908
I didn't know you had a miscarriage.

692
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:14,379
How could you not know?

693
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:16,318
You two are very intimate.

694
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:18,749
How could you not know anything about our family?

695
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:21,689
Are you so proud of being pregnant?

696
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:24,059
Is it fun to throw salt at someone else's wounds?

697
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,789
It's a misunderstanding.

698
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:28,789
- They got close so quickly. - Be quiet!

699
00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:32,698
This is all because of this reckless simpleton.

700
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,798
Oh, goodness.

701
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:38,138
She even tied her bow the other way, but she has no idea.

702
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:40,138
Oh, goodness.

703
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:43,309
Is that how your family taught you?

704
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:46,309
Do you want to show off that you have an uneducated mother?

705
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:49,849
Don't you dare cause another scene.

706
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:52,249
If you do, I'll leave this house.

707
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:55,349
I don't want to see you. Go and throw that hanbok away.

708
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,669
Do you only care about your son?

709
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,769
Don't you care that she was hurt?

710
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,638
I can still hear my baby's cries in my dreams.

711
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:16,278
Why do you always take her side?

712
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:18,508
It's because of the baby.

713
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:27,810
I'm tired.

714
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,379
Me too.

715
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:35,149
Yeon Doo.

716
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:38,019
Do you think doppelgänger really exist?

717
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,060
I'm not sure.

718
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,530
I've never seen one myself.

719
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:45,760
I saw one, but I still can't believe...

720
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,399
that those two faces were the same.

721
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:51,240
What?

722
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:55,169
Yeon Doo. What's with that old-fashioned hanbok?

723
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,209
This old-fashioned hanbok...

724
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,339
will leave now.

725
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,580
What are you doing, Gong Yu Myung?

726
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,519
Why does it matter if they look the same?

727
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:17,030
(Sarang Women's Clinic)

728
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,370
We have some questions in case of complications.

729
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,999
Have you ever had an abortion?

730
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,910
No, I haven't.

731
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,069
Okay.

732
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,640
Please come tomorrow at 9am.

733
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,439
By the way,

734
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,550
what about a guardian?

735
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,950
You may come together if you would like.

736
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,120
One moment, please.

737
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:08,979
Hello?

738
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,850
I'm...

739
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,220
getting surgery tomorrow morning at the hospital I've been going to.

740
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:17,649
Why are you telling me that?

741
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:19,660
Do you need a guardian?

742
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:24,859
Why aren't you saying anything?

743
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,660
Are you scared?

744
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:30,100
I'm not scared.

745
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,300
I only told you because I didn't want you...

746
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,740
to overreact later about me not telling you.

747
00:42:33,939 --> 00:42:36,140
There are exactly three days left of the deliberation period,

748
00:42:36,669 --> 00:42:38,879
so just attend the memorial service tomorrow.

749
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Okay.

750
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,680
You don't have to report every little thing to me now.

751
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:44,450
We're already strangers.

752
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,539
The 26th.

753
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:12,410
How messy. What is this?

754
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,039
You scared me.

755
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,209
This?

756
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:18,720
Well...

757
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,450
The memorial service.

758
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,289
It's Grandfather's memorial service tomorrow.

759
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:26,890
Is it?

760
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:29,390
You even note down your wife's family's memorial services.

761
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,459
You're very impressive.

762
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,060
Thanks.

763
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:35,069
I'll head home first.

764
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,300
Okay.

765
00:43:53,649 --> 00:43:55,490
Hello, Mom. I'm driving right now.

766
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,550
I'll call you later.

767
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:57,819
Tae Kyung.

768
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,060
Yes. Go ahead.

769
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,890
Listen without getting riled up.

770
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,830
Today, Yeon Doo...

771
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,569
What? That woman?

772
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:11,229
These punks.

773
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,100
This punk.

774
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,209
Are we going to take being treated like this here?

775
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:17,870
What would you like me to do?

776
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,140
Should we move out so we don't have to see them?

777
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,749
Are you insane?

778
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:24,050
If we leave, who do you think will take this room?

779
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:26,749
They'll move in here with Mother on their backs.

780
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:28,249
Do you want to see that happen?

781
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,649
You're right.

782
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:31,890
I'm sorry. I didn't think things through.

783
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:34,789
I don't want to lose to them.

784
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,289
I'll make them kneel before me.

785
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,830
Okay.

786
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,999
I'm going to discipline them a bit.

787
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:42,700
This punk.

788
00:44:50,669 --> 00:44:52,539
Yeon Doo was misunderstood because she didn't know...

789
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:53,839
about Soo Jung's situation.

790
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:55,649
Please talk them through.

791
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,620
What does she want me to do?

792
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,319
Hey.

793
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:05,760
Gong Tae Kyung.

794
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,229
Do you know what your wife did to hurt my wife today?

795
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,300
Lead the way. I want an apology.

796
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,399
Let's not blow things out of proportion.

797
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,240
I'll apologize instead.

798
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:21,539
Hey.

799
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:24,140
You don't have the attitude of a person that's apologizing.

800
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:27,209
Are you looking down on me because your wife does?

801
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:30,180
- What is wrong with you two? - Who looked down on who?

802
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,550
It won't happen again, so please go inside.

803
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,189
Hey.

804
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,560
Hey, Gong Tae Kyung!

805
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,229
Oh, you're here.

806
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,330
It dozed off for a moment.

807
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,640
Don't get involved with my family.

808
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:56,269
What?

809
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:58,339
I don't even know what dates our memorial services are on.

810
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,310
You should also not care about my family.

811
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,749
Keep as much distance as possible.

812
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,189
It's not like I wanted to get involved.

813
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:11,419
You're the one who didn't tell me the things I should've known.

814
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,490
Grandma. Soo Jung's very ill.

815
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,019
No, honey.

816
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,229
I'm okay, Grandma.

817
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,789
I must cook for the memorial service.

818
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:52,330
No, leave it.

819
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,530
This doesn't look good.

820
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,499
In Ok can't manage on her own.

821
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,569
But then, I can't have Ji Myung leave work...

822
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:01,200
or ask Yu Myung to help.

823
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:03,370
What about Yeon Doo?

824
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,439
She's a stranger. I can't have her cook our food.

825
00:47:06,979 --> 00:47:09,310
You shouldn't be saying that, Grandma.

826
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,220
Tae Kyung even insulted me last night.

827
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,280
What?

828
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,419
He lost all sense and reason because of a girl.

829
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:17,919
You can't leave them alone.

830
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:20,589
You must teach the new girl the pecking order.

831
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,490
Think about it.

832
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,859
If you don't call or put her to work, who would that benefit?

833
00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:29,169
Her and no one else. Am I wrong?

834
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,310
(Gynaecologist Cha Hyun Woo)

835
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,109
Tomorrow morning, I'm getting surgery...

836
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,510
at my usual clinic.

837
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:52,890
(Operating Room)

838
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,729
Where is Gong Ji Myung getting operated?

839
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:06,569
I'm her husband.

840
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:08,669
- Gong Ji Myung? Just a moment. - Yes.

841
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:15,149
She'll be done by now.

842
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,050
What?

843
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,959
(Operating Room)

844
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,839
Did you get the abortion?

845
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:44,370
Why are you here?

846
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,550
Don't avoid the question. Did you get it done?

847
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:51,149
No, so let go of me.

848
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,479
Really? You didn't get the abortion?

849
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,890
No.

850
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,089
Let's talk outside.

851
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,729
(Pregnancy registration)

852
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,600
Who is it?

853
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,810
Don't mind the household events...

854
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,310
and avoid others.

855
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,649
Yes. Let's not mind them.

856
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:25,280
I don't exist.

857
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,149
Wait. We didn't change the door code?

858
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:32,819
Mother.

859
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,990
Grandmother.

860
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:53,939
Sorry for telling you to get an abortion.

861
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,209
I got angry and said what I didn't mean.

862
00:49:59,149 --> 00:50:00,450
Don't apologize.

863
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,950
I couldn't wait to get rid of the baby myself.

864
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:08,560
I wondered why and it was...

865
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:12,100
because of the divorce.

866
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,269
I thought I needed to get rid of the baby...

867
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:19,100
and divorce you to make a clean break.

868
00:50:20,169 --> 00:50:22,769
But once I got wheeled in, I realized...

869
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:24,269
I couldn't do it.

870
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:29,080
You made the right call. Thanks so much, Ji Myung.

871
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,649
I made up my mind as I left the operating room.

872
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,189
The baby and divorce are two separate issues.

873
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,519
What do you mean?

874
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:40,720
We'll get divorced as planned.

875
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,830
And I'll raise the baby on my own.

876
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:47,060
What? You can't do that.

877
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,899
- Why not? - The baby you're carrying...

878
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:51,100
is mine too.

879
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:55,439
I don't want to see my child every few weeks as if it's a favour.

880
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,370
You might give birth to it,

881
00:50:57,669 --> 00:50:59,180
but raising it is a different issue.

882
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,510
So what? Will you raise the kid or something?

883
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,450
Why not?

884
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,220
When you were reluctant to have a baby because of your career,

885
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:09,220
I said I'd raise it if you just had it.

886
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,620
I meant that.

887
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,859
What if you raise it on your own?

888
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:13,890
I don't want my kid to be motherless.

889
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,760
The same goes for it if you raise it alone.

890
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,359
I don't want my kid to be fatherless.

891
00:51:19,229 --> 00:51:22,269
I don't want to live with you for the kid's sake.

892
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:24,399
We won't change.

893
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:26,769
We'll clash and fight over everything.

894
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:28,039
I don't want that either.

895
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,910
A couple that constantly fights stunts a kid's emotional growth.

896
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,109
Then what? Should we go to court?

897
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,910
Will you list up and debate why I'm not a suitable mom...

898
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,850
for parental rights and custody?

899
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,720
Was fighting at home not enough?

900
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,890
You want to fight in court too?

901
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,120
I'm sick of it. I hate it.

902
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,089
You're sick of this and don't want that.

903
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,189
What do you want to do, then?

904
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:54,499
I don't know. I'm confused.

905
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,200
Let's wrap up the divorce first.

906
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,740
Come home for the memorial service.

907
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:15,720
Mother. You said you wanted to look around the annex.

908
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,950
Why have Yeon Doo...

909
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,060
I'll cook the anchovy Jeon.

910
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,589
I accepted you...

911
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:22,760
after you learned to cook for the memorial services.

912
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,030
She must do this much...

913
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,399
if she wants to be acknowledged.

914
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,430
But Mother...

915
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,930
Jeon isn't the only thing that goes on the table.

916
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:32,939
Go and do your thing.

917
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,510
I'll be fine, Mother. I'll try my best.

918
00:52:36,669 --> 00:52:37,740
Okay, then.

919
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:39,780
Call me if it's too much.

920
00:53:00,399 --> 00:53:01,970
If that pan's warm enough,

921
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:06,039
take some flour water and spread it, as thin as a crepe...

922
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:08,039
and the size of a dumpling skin.

923
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:09,539
Yes, Grandma.

924
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:17,649
No. That's too thick.

925
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,379
It'll take a whole day to cook it to the center.

926
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,120
Yes, Grandma.

927
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,319
No. Are you making a blanket?

928
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,789
It must be small, two bites at most.

929
00:53:30,189 --> 00:53:32,030
Yes, Grandma. Small.

930
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:37,700
My goodness. What a mess.

931
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,269
I may be old,

932
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:42,140
but I've never seen an idiot cook a Jeon with corners.

933
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,569
Make it round.

934
00:53:43,939 --> 00:53:45,439
Okay, round.

935
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,680
That's it. If that's done, put an anchovy on top.

936
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,850
Okay, anchovies.

937
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,620
No.

938
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,390
One anchovy per Jeon.

939
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,749
Okay. One per Jeon.

940
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:04,589
My gosh.

941
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,899
What are you doing, Uncle?

942
00:54:17,169 --> 00:54:18,979
Our restaurant's specialty is braised chicken.

943
00:54:18,979 --> 00:54:20,240
Why are you making Jeon?

944
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:22,109
Anchovies?

945
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,310
There's an anchovy Jeon?

946
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,350
Someone asked me to make them.

947
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:29,319
Let's say I'm donating my talent.

948
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,660
Why would they ask you when they could go to a store?

949
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,660
Who asked?

950
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:40,660
(Gong Obstetrics and Gynaecology)

951
00:54:42,129 --> 00:54:44,569
I made some Jeon.

952
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:50,439
This is what your clinic looks like.

953
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:52,510
It's nice.

954
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,640
All clinics are like this.

955
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,479
Why did you bring the Jeon to me here?

956
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:00,950
Oh, well...

957
00:55:02,419 --> 00:55:03,850
It's Yeon Doo.

958
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,289
She studied and worked all her life and can't do any housework.

959
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:09,490
Now she's pregnant,

960
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,200
and what if she gets nauseous while cooking for the service?

961
00:55:13,129 --> 00:55:15,160
Did Yeon Doo say...

962
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:17,470
she's cooking Jeon for the service?

963
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,669
Yes. She told me yesterday...

964
00:55:19,669 --> 00:55:22,069
that she picked out anchovies for the Jeon.

965
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,839
I couldn't reach her at all today,

966
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,140
so I got worried and had to do something.

967
00:55:27,939 --> 00:55:30,580
She'll feel so tense around your family.

968
00:55:31,209 --> 00:55:34,149
Do you think you could rush home to her?

969
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Okay.

970
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,830
(Mr. Gong Tae Kyung)

971
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:55,870
Add the anchovies quickly.

972
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,640
There are other jeons to cook.

973
00:55:58,109 --> 00:55:59,140
Okay.

974
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,950
You forgot what I said already.

975
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,249
One anchovy per Jeon.

976
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:09,249
You should listen to what an elder says.

977
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:11,390
Were you not taught well at home?

978
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,990
What on earth are you...

979
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,729
My goodness.

980
00:56:20,229 --> 00:56:22,600
Darn anchovies!

981
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:27,169
If you're not pleased with my work, do it yourself!

982
00:56:27,169 --> 00:56:30,439
Since yesterday, you've been going on about my upbringing.

983
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:33,140
Who teaches people to cook Jeon at home these days?

984
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,839
Besides, you're one to talk...

985
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:37,249
when those in your family are equally disappointing!

986
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:41,050
What... My goodness.

987
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,050
What are you doing?

988
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,260
Have you gone as far as to spacing out?

989
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:51,560
Gosh, no.

990
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,939
Yeon Doo, what are you doing?

991
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,399
Tae Kyung, goodness.

992
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:05,539
- Come on. - What...

993
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:08,039
- What are you doing? - Tae Kyung!

994
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:18,149
Didn't you hear what I said yesterday?

995
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,160
I told you to ignore them, so why were you there cooking?

996
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,430
It's not like I wanted to do it.

997
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,589
How could I refuse...

998
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:26,129
when your grandmother came all the way here?

999
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:27,530
Of course, you could've refused.

1000
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,330
You could've used me as an excuse.

1001
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:31,800
But doing so would cause trouble for your mom,

1002
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,839
so how could I?

1003
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:34,700
That shouldn't be your concern.

1004
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,439
Whatever happens in that family...

1005
00:57:37,439 --> 00:57:38,939
has nothing to do with us.

1006
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,510
How can it not concern me?

1007
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,950
While you're at work,

1008
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,609
I'm here all day.

1009
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:47,979
Refusing to do tasks isn't as easy as you think.

1010
00:57:47,979 --> 00:57:51,149
So? Are you saying you'll keep this up?

1011
00:57:51,149 --> 00:57:54,019
What can I do when my baby needs a father?

1012
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:55,490
What?

1013
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:56,959
Darn it.

1014
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,629
I moved in here for the sake of my baby.

1015
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:01,560
To make them believe that I'm your wife,

1016
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,569
I have to pretend to be a member of this family.

1017
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:06,669
But you're telling me not to get involved with them.

1018
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,970
You ignoring them by yourself isn't a solution.

1019
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,439
Didn't you say you'd do everything for my baby?

1020
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:13,310
Living with strangers is exhausting enough,

1021
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,479
so what am I supposed to...

1022
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,879
The smell of oil is sickening.

1023
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,519
This is too frustrating. Darn it!

1024
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:31,189
What are you doing?

1025
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,830
Mr. Gong?

1026
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,229
Don't follow me and stay here.

1027
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:40,339
What is he up to?

1028
00:58:46,379 --> 00:58:49,749
Mother, please cut Yeon Doo some slack.

1029
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,080
She was pregnant with twins,

1030
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,479
but she lost one of them, so...

1031
00:58:55,479 --> 00:58:57,350
I also miscarried.

1032
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,319
It's not like she's giving birth this month,

1033
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:00,689
so why can't she cook the Jeon?

1034
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,399
Tae Kyung, what are you doing?

1035
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:17,169
Didn't I tell you to rest?

1036
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:18,870
I'll cook the Jeon instead.

1037
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:22,479
Are you trying to get back at me for making your wife do chores?

1038
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:26,450
No, I'm offering my labour.

1039
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
Get out.

1040
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,019
I won't serve my husband the Jeon you made.

1041
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:32,089
Then you shouldn't make her cook either.

1042
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:33,990
Men and women aren't the same.

1043
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,189
A daughter-in-law of this family must contribute to memorial rites.

1044
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:38,660
If you consider her a daughter-in-law of the family,

1045
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,959
that makes me part of the family too.

1046
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,899
I'll do the work,

1047
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,200
so stop harassing her.

1048
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,839
What?

1049
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:48,100
Do you mean that?

1050
00:59:52,169 --> 00:59:53,879
If you mean it,

1051
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:55,339
you'll cook the Jeon and attend the service.

1052
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:56,950
What?

1053
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:01,080
If you care for your wife,

1054
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,050
you'll act like a member of this family.

1055
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:04,819
Chan Sik, have you lost your mind?

1056
01:00:05,149 --> 01:00:06,160
Mom.

1057
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,620
The baby she bears...

1058
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,260
doesn't have a drop of your father's blood.

1059
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:13,399
A stranger has no place at your father's memorial service.

1060
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:14,399
I'll...

1061
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,470
attend.

1062
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:20,539
Yeon Doo and I will attend the memorial service.

1063
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,640
Good. You made the right decision.

1064
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:43,990
All right. So this goes here.

1065
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:48,129
They must all be in a straight line as well.

1066
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,189
All right. Let's begin.

1067
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,810
Let us bow together.

1068
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:41,419
Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo will also bow with us.

1069
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:45,089
Chan Sik, how dare you?

1070
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:52,729
Father, this is my son Tae Kyung.

1071
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,269
I apologize for not introducing him to you sooner.

1072
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,100
Honey.

1073
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,439
It's all right.

1074
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:35,669
She should learn to accept this anyway.

1075
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,560
I know I'm only pretending to be family,

1076
01:02:55,959 --> 01:02:57,260
but bowing to him...

1077
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:59,700
gave me a weird feeling.

1078
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:01,930
I felt like...

1079
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:04,600
a member of the family.

1080
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,569
Did you feel the same way?

1081
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,870
Bowing at the service once doesn't change anything.

1082
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,640
There's no connection between me and this family.

1083
01:03:15,439 --> 01:03:17,410
Then why were you tense earlier?

1084
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,879
Your hands trembled while you were bowing.

1085
01:03:19,979 --> 01:03:20,979
My hands?

1086
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:22,819
No way.

1087
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:24,589
Maybe you're the one...

1088
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:26,390
who's too invested in playing the daughter-in-law.

1089
01:03:27,189 --> 01:03:28,660
Don't be mistaken...

1090
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,729
for our relationship isn't real.

1091
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,629
Sure.

1092
01:03:32,629 --> 01:03:36,700
I'm super glad that this isn't real.

1093
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:38,769
What do you mean it isn't real?

1094
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,839
Something's not real?

1095
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:43,669
What isn't real?

1096
01:03:43,769 --> 01:03:45,069
What else can it be, then?

1097
01:03:45,339 --> 01:03:46,539
Is something fake?

1098
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,379
What could be fake?

1099
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,379
What isn't real, and what is fake?

1100
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:53,249
Tell us yourselves this instant.

1101
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,319
(The Real Has Come!)

1102
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:34,689
Ms. Oh,

1103
01:04:34,689 --> 01:04:36,859
what have you been up to in this household?

1104
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:39,499
A divorce?

1105
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,200
You eavesdropped on us.

1106
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,430
Run that mouth of yours, and you'll pay.

1107
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:47,269
In exchange for reducing her debt...

1108
01:04:47,269 --> 01:04:49,100
- What the... - Hey, that's my contract!

1109
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,169
Take out the garbage, ladies!

1110
01:04:51,169 --> 01:04:52,569
You trash!

1111
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:54,439
What am I hearing?

1112
01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:55,609
A divorce?

1113
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:58,280
Did you tell people about our divorce?

1114
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,019
Tell me this instant!

1115
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:02,819
Ms. Oh, did you know...

1116
01:05:03,819 --> 01:05:07,160
that Tae Kyung and I used to like each other?

1117
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:08,789
What are you doing?

1118
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:10,390
For what reason did you tell her that?

1119
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,229
That I also liked you?

1120
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,700
Well, it's true.
