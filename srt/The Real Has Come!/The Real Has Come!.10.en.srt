1
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:11,109
Come on in.

2
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,509
It's that woman. Tae Kyung's...

3
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,549
What do you mean? Tae Kyung's what?

4
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,848
What's going on, Mother?

5
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,029
We only just met, so do excuse me.

6
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:57,889
There's something I must correct.

7
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:01,329
Tae Kyung's wife-to-be isn't her. It's her.

8
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,598
Quit with the daydreaming and get lost.

9
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,008
Mother.

10
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,338
Pull yourselves together.

11
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,708
If a son goes astray, the parents must correct him.

12
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,448
How dare you gang up with him to drive away his rightful wife?

13
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:20,549
Who are you calling his rightful wife?

14
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,848
She's right here.

15
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,049
She's your daughter-in-law who had her husband stolen from her.

16
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,618
I apologize, Mr. Gong.

17
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:28,159
I didn't know you were meeting her family.

18
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,629
Ms. Jang, leave.

19
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,659
Mother, you should leave too.

20
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:36,098
He's my son before he is your grandson.

21
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:39,139
So please leave and stop meddling with his life.

22
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,068
- What? - Mom.

23
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,769
- You should leave. - What?

24
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,439
- What are you doing? - Please leave.

25
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,478
Let go of me! Don't.

26
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:48,948
Ms. Jang, you'll also come with me.

27
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,079
Let go of me.

28
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,348
Unbelievable.

29
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:59,258
How dare she yell at me with daggers coming from her eyes?

30
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:02,329
Let go of me. It wouldn't be right to let this slide.

31
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,428
That's enough, Mom.

32
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:06,799
What?

33
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:09,968
Grandmother, you should head back. I'll call you later.

34
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:12,769
Sure.

35
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,609
Ms. Jang, what was that?

36
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:22,979
This isn't how a rational person should act.

37
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,479
How could I possibly be rational at the moment?

38
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,479
What?

39
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,289
She only told me about the gathering when I got here.

40
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,558
I thought about leaving.

41
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,729
But I was too angry, and I felt wronged.

42
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:37,789
How could you meet her family...

43
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,299
only days after she crashed my wedding?

44
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,699
Am I not allowed to ruin this gathering...

45
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,269
when she ruined my wedding of all things?

46
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,669
You should head back for now. We'll talk about this later.

47
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,688
(Episode 10)

48
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:12,058
I can't let my daughter marry into a family like yours.

49
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,359
- Bong Nim. - Please.

50
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,799
Please hear me out.

51
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:17,398
As if there's anything to hear.

52
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,938
Tae Kyung, don't just sit there.

53
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,139
Mother, you can't leave. What about Yeon Doo and the baby?

54
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:32,579
Allow me to apologize on my mother-in-law's behalf.

55
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:34,919
It was rude and stupid of her.

56
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,289
Be angry at me instead.

57
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,989
You can be angry at me all you want.

58
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,389
You should sit.

59
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:46,998
It's like I'm punishing you which makes me uncomfortable.

60
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:55,569
I apologize, in-law.

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,769
You shouldn't have gone through that...

62
00:03:57,769 --> 00:03:59,308
when we're lucky to have your precious daughter.

63
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:01,539
Yeon Doo isn't the only precious child here.

64
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,079
Tae Kyung must also be a precious son.

65
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,748
She didn't seem like an average mother-in-law.

66
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,948
Being her daughter-in-law must leave your heart in tatters.

67
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,159
Because I had it rough,

68
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,128
I don't want it to be that way for my daughter-in-law.

69
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:20,529
It didn't seem like the other woman was over Tae Kyung.

70
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,628
It's over between them.

71
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:24,698
Besides, the marriage was my mother-in-law's idea.

72
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,669
Allow me to be honest.

73
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:35,209
Tae Kyung isn't related to my mother-in-law by blood.

74
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,078
- What? - What?

75
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,719
When Tae Kyung was a junior in high school,

76
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:43,589
I married into this family.

77
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,258
He's not related by blood?

78
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,989
Does that mean he won't receive any inheritance?

79
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,099
- Uncle, please. - Gosh.

80
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,828
I apologize, Mother. He harbours no malicious intent.

81
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:00,938
It's all right. Of course, he can be curious.

82
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,368
I apologize for not telling you sooner, Mother.

83
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:06,909
It must've been hard for you,

84
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:09,279
my son-in-law.

85
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,078
It's pretty obvious.

86
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,948
Living with a grandmother like that must've been excruciating.

87
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,789
She would've been even meaner...

88
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,789
if there were grandchildren of her own blood.

89
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,359
Mother, are you all right?

90
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,568
Yes, I'm fine. How silly of me.

91
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,868
And in front of my future in-law?

92
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,039
There's nothing I fear anymore.

93
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,109
Why should I when they're in love?

94
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,878
We should help them have this baby and be a happy family.

95
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:47,649
I'll persuade my mother-in-law,

96
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,919
so please put your faith in me...

97
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,219
and accept...

98
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,989
my Tae Kyung.

99
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,868
Bong Nim, think of the baby.

100
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,599
He's the father above anything.

101
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,068
Mom, please.

102
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,049
Will there at least be a wedding?

103
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,678
Of course!

104
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,979
Tae Kyung, book the venue in Samcheon-dong.

105
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,888
Let's settle on a date.

106
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,459
- For the wedding? - Would a wedding...

107
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,219
be absolutely necessary?

108
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,558
- What? - What?

109
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,799
People will laugh if Tae Kyung chooses...

110
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,359
to have another ceremony.

111
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,568
His grandmother would object even harder.

112
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:40,138
I'm not one who needs formalities.

113
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,508
All I need is Tae Kyung.

114
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,279
Still, a woman...

115
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,508
only gets to marry once.

116
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,578
We're not saying we won't have the wedding.

117
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,518
We'll get around to it after the baby is born.

118
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:56,448
Well,

119
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:58,289
it's normal for couples these days...

120
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,089
to have the ceremony after welcoming the child.

121
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,229
So that settles the wedding,

122
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,428
but what about where you'll live?

123
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:08,399
Things have been set up at the annex for newlyweds.

124
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,928
We'll take care of that.

125
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,698
We may be pregnant, but we're still newlyweds.

126
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,868
We'd like to enjoy our time together...

127
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,868
without having to walk on eggshells around our elders.

128
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:24,109
In-law, we should leave it to them to handle their living situation.

129
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:25,479
They're all grown up anyway.

130
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:29,789
Of course. I'm with you one hundred percent.

131
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,859
Why don't we have them register their marriage...

132
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,188
to commemorate this moment?

133
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,489
- What? - What?

134
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,628
That's a great idea.

135
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,459
They should do that since they're expecting a child.

136
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,998
- Gosh, no. - Gosh, no.

137
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:46,368
The last thing we want is to exhaust you even more.

138
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:49,839
That's right. We have to look for a house tomorrow anyway.

139
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:52,409
Get it done tomorrow, then.

140
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,878
Anyway, when will the food be served?

141
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,508
I'm hungry.

142
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,219
This is killing me.

143
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,229
Is there digestive medicine that pregnant women can take?

144
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:13,659
Yes, it's safe to take digestive enzymes...

145
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:16,229
and any liquid medicine that doesn't have yanhusuo in it.

146
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,698
I also have a killer headache.

147
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,638
I guess lying isn't for everyone.

148
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,939
Yeon Doo.

149
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,109
Hey, Uncle.

150
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,008
It took us a while, didn't it?

151
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,648
We had to exchange our numbers.

152
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:34,918
Did you set a time for tomorrow?

153
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:38,148
- Sorry? - Sorry?

154
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,658
Why are you both spacing out?

155
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:41,888
You're registering your marriage tomorrow.

156
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,729
Oh, that?

157
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,559
Yes, we set a time.

158
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:47,229
Right?

159
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,758
Right, of course.

160
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,199
We agreed to meet at 2pm at the borough office.

161
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,839
Don't forget to bring your seal.

162
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,199
Sure thing.

163
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:58,368
We'll be stamping our seals to confirm our marriage.

164
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:00,038
That's right.

165
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,648
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

166
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:13,359
Did the family gathering end so soon?

167
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:14,859
That was fast.

168
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,429
Grandma, where's mom?

169
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:19,929
Mom? Don't even mention her to me.

170
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,569
She had a right to be angry.

171
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,398
Why did you invite Ms. Jang in the first place?

172
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:26,839
Ms. Jang?

173
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,339
You had her attend the gathering?

174
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,008
Grandma, are you out of your mind?

175
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,439
Yes, I'm out of my mind.

176
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:36,849
Both my son and granddaughter are accusing me of lunacy.

177
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,109
From this day on, think that I'm invisible.

178
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,918
No one is to bother me.

179
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,219
Grandmother, please.

180
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:54,859
Where did you go dressed up well like that?

181
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:58,699
Please don't tell me you were with a guy out of spite.

182
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,699
I'm tired, so leave me alone.

183
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,569
Se Jin, I thought about it,

184
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,079
and it's over between you and Tae Kyung.

185
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,079
With your pretty face, your body, and brains,

186
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,979
you'll be able to marry a guy way better than him.

187
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,319
Why not use this opportunity to have the family...

188
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,658
compensate for emotional duress...

189
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:23,189
and spend it on a full-on makeover?

190
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,189
Mom!

191
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:27,599
Goodness me.

192
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:35,398
That woman was there?

193
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,638
Hear it from Uncle. I'd like to rest.

194
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,479
The grandmother-in-law is a piece of work,

195
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,709
but the mother-in-law seems pretty decent.

196
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,648
She promised to take care of his former fiancée, so we'll wait.

197
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,349
Why are you fidgeting like puppies that need release?

198
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:52,758
What is it?

199
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,258
We said...

200
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:58,028
that woman came by yesterday.

201
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,128
A family gathering had been decided on,

202
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,798
so I didn't say anything since you'd worry...

203
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,729
Stop beating around the bush!

204
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,128
She said she'd take Yeon Doo's child...

205
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,668
- and raise it as her own. - What?

206
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,969
And look what happened today.

207
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,268
She crashed our family gathering.

208
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,439
She's not over Tae Kyung yet...

209
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,179
and could be planning something big with that grandmother.

210
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,378
A collaboration of a nasty grandma and a horrible woman.

211
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,248
Don't let your guard down, Mom.

212
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,189
I didn't expect Ms. Jang to do that.

213
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,989
How could she show up as if nothing had happened...

214
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,028
when she knew Ms. Oh's pregnant?

215
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:35,959
She can do even worse.

216
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:38,929
What do you mean?

217
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,099
Do you know something?

218
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,239
Not at all.

219
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,548
Back then. What did you talk about?

220
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,609
Before the wedding, after a chat...

221
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:54,618
with Ms. Jang and your grandma, you suffered for a few days.

222
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,118
What happened then?

223
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,758
It was nothing.

224
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:02,388
Tell me. I need to know.

225
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,059
If you won't tell, I'll ask your grandmother.

226
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,729
Ms. Jang lied to me...

227
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:15,798
and said she was barren.

228
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,309
Barren?

229
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:21,508
Your grandmother knew about it?

230
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,878
She convinced Grandma that she lied...

231
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:27,979
to get me to marry her.

232
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,219
It's in the past,

233
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,459
so don't blow things out of proportion now.

234
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,758
How could she tell such a dreadful lie?

235
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,429
What if it hadn't been for Yeon Doo?

236
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,229
The heavens saved us.

237
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,829
Your baby saved you.

238
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:46,798
I think so too.

239
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,319
Honey.

240
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,449
How's Grandma? Did she have a sedative?

241
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,018
She didn't want one, so I persuaded her.

242
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,118
She'll take a nap.

243
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:12,089
How come two different women ruined both the wedding and family meeting?

244
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,398
What do they see in that fool?

245
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,868
He has his charms.

246
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:18,368
He's handsome and smart.

247
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,898
Stop it.

248
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,268
Mom.

249
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:30,508
Mother, I'm coming in.

250
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:34,319
Why is she so proud and haughty?

251
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,189
Her grandchild is on the way.

252
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,589
If none of us have any children,

253
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,089
that kid will inherit everything.

254
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,229
Mother, In Ok's home.

255
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,229
I leave on a business trip tomorrow, so can you let it go now?

256
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,638
I'll head over to the annex.

257
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,018
Mother. If you don't want to speak,

258
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:08,118
just listen.

259
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,748
Ms. Oh's mother and I agreed to...

260
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,489
let the two live together.

261
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,459
I'll handle everything.

262
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,829
You don't have to worry about it.

263
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,439
That...

264
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,309
won't change anything.

265
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,408
I'm not...

266
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:39,918
afraid of you anymore.

267
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,719
Excuse me.

268
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:47,459
How dare that...

269
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:52,059
That evil thing. You dare...

270
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,998
When we get the marriage license,

271
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,268
can we just pretend to sign it?

272
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:00,998
Yes.

273
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:03,908
Let's meet up and find our own places to stay.

274
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,709
You look for a place that'll suit a newlywed couple.

275
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,979
I'll find a studio apartment for myself.

276
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,248
They must be close by.

277
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:13,918
We must pretend to live together in case of an emergency.

278
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:14,918
Right.

279
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,219
Shall we check out the area halfway between our parents' homes?

280
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:20,658
Sounds good.

281
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:23,489
Once I move in, I'll lay out...

282
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,388
some of your clothes and baby stuff.

283
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:28,298
So anyone will think it's the home of newlyweds with a newborn.

284
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,028
Tae Kyung.

285
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,368
What was that noise?

286
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:35,339
Someone's here. Let's talk tomorrow.

287
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,079
Why are you at home?

288
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:45,849
We're going somewhere.

289
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,449
Get your jacket and come outside.

290
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,138
Where are we?

291
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:11,268
The woman you almost married lives here.

292
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:14,378
- What? - It's Ms. Jang's home.

293
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:15,709
Come with me.

294
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:34,859
What are you doing?

295
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:39,168
He did something so terrible that we both must kneel and beg.

296
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:43,969
My family wronged yours in a way we can never make up for.

297
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:48,878
I insulted both you and your daughter.

298
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,748
I apologize.

299
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:53,849
Do you think apologizing now will cut it?

300
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,449
That day, my Se Jin...

301
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,818
was humiliated and tormented more than any woman deserved.

302
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,758
I hesitated because I didn't know how to apologize.

303
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:04,328
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,058
What will you do?

305
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,629
How will you compensate us?

306
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:11,429
You scoundrel. I wish I could just kill you.

307
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,739
Give my daughter her life back. Heal her broken heart.

308
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:16,038
Stop it!

309
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,639
Why didn't you call off the wedding...

310
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,409
if you knew you'd impregnated another woman?

311
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,848
I wasn't brave enough.

312
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,219
I apologize.

313
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:34,858
"I apologize!"

314
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:37,558
Do you even mean that?

315
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,199
You're not here to apologize.

316
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,798
You're here to end it.

317
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,298
Se Jin.

318
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,969
Do you think I'll let you off?

319
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:56,108
Do you think you can end it?

320
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,748
What do you think you are? What right do you think you have?

321
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,489
You'll regret humiliating me.

322
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:07,159
I'll make you pay for this!

323
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:10,028
You wait and see!

324
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:19,469
That's the end of your relationship.

325
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,268
Don't see each other ever again.

326
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,608
Se Jin.

327
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:31,709
Se Jin.

328
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,358
Thank you.

329
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:51,129
You scolded me and taught me that I'm lacking.

330
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:53,268
Thank you.

331
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:57,308
I'm partially responsible for your marriage with Ms. Jang.

332
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,479
I'm sorry for lacking as a father.

333
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,088
I said I can pack.

334
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,358
You've been stressed out about everything. Get some rest.

335
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:25,399
I'm sorry, honey.

336
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,298
For being rude to your mother.

337
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:29,669
The situation called for it.

338
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:34,639
Last night, I took Tae Kyung and ended it with Ms. Jang's family.

339
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:36,748
You don't have to worry anymore.

340
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,818
Sometimes I think that if we hadn't met,

341
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,929
I wouldn't have met your mother.

342
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:52,229
But then I think because I have you,

343
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,459
I should rightly put up with your mother.

344
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:58,828
That's good to hear.

345
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,338
I should treat you even nicer so you don't run away from me.

346
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:08,608
We can't let Tae Kyung and his wife live in the annex, can we?

347
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,808
All the kids live here with their spouses.

348
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:12,108
Why not them too?

349
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,078
I know your mother won't approve,

350
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:16,818
but the thought of them living elsewhere...

351
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,219
bothers me in many ways.

352
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,689
Discuss it with Ms. Oh's mother.

353
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,758
My mom can't forever be against the marriage.

354
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,699
Mom, I'm heading out on my business trip.

355
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:34,298
I'll be back tomorrow.

356
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:45,479
Take care of your grandmother for me.

357
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,479
Sure thing, Father.

358
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,119
Don't worry and be on your way.

359
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,489
Grandma has me, remember?

360
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:52,818
You don't want to be late.

361
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,729
Your father's going on a business trip today.

362
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,989
Tae Kyung's registering his marriage today.

363
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,598
He's getting his marriage license?

364
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,229
My gosh. Are you finally going off the market?

365
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,139
I hope it goes well.

366
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,909
- Right. Have a safe trip. - Sure.

367
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,108
Mom, I'm leaving.

368
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,462
Is milk all you're having again?

369
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,793
She can't seem to stomach anything.

370
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,762
I thought she was registering her marriage at 2pm?

371
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,373
She must have another errand to run.

372
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,103
What does it mean to register a marriage?

373
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,303
You're being certified as a married couple.

374
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:35,113
Why is she registering her marriage before the wedding?

375
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:38,583
They agreed to live together first.

376
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:42,153
If you're done, get Soo Kyum ready for kindergarten.

377
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:44,383
Right, of course.

378
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:45,482
Let's go.

379
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:48,752
Yes, in-law.

380
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,323
So you're looking for a place for newlyweds.

381
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,432
How much would your budget be?

382
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:54,732
Money isn't an issue.

383
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,303
I'd rather it be a newly built apartment.

384
00:21:58,462 --> 00:21:59,563
Did you say 200,000 dollars?

385
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:01,732
For a tiny studio apartment?

386
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:03,303
Well, it's a yearly deposit.

387
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:06,002
Besides, it's not as expensive as it used to be.

388
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:09,242
Would you rather look for places with a monthly rate?

389
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:11,012
Yes.

390
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,383
A deposit of 50,000 dollars with a monthly rent of 700 dollars...

391
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:16,182
or 30,000 dollars deposit with a rent of 1,000 dollars.

392
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:17,883
Which do you prefer?

393
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,123
A monthly rent of 700 dollars or 1,000 dollars?

394
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:23,393
Isn't there anything cheaper?

395
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:25,162
How about this one?

396
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,133
Isn't there one that's pricier?

397
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:30,303
One that offers nice community facilities...

398
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:31,833
that is in the vicinity of two subway stations.

399
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,573
Again, money isn't an issue.

400
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:38,502
Things must be easy for your wife-to-be...

401
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,643
thanks to you being well-off.

402
00:22:42,672 --> 00:22:45,212
I can't stay in sub-basement or rooftop units.

403
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:46,752
I'll be raising a baby, you see.

404
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:50,323
Nothing seems to satisfy you,

405
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,853
so what am I supposed to do?

406
00:22:57,662 --> 00:22:58,863
The annex?

407
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:03,192
Yes, it's where Tae Kyung used to stay.

408
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,803
I heard that Yeon Doo lost one of the babies...

409
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,932
and that still weighs on my mind.

410
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:12,972
After finding out that she had lost the baby,

411
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:14,942
I cried in secret too.

412
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:16,613
Of course, you did.

413
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:20,383
I bet she hasn't been eating well because of her morning sickness.

414
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:24,583
She once again left this morning only after having a glass of milk.

415
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:26,922
My goodness.

416
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:31,192
She was able to stomach what I cooked for her though...

417
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:33,093
and that came to mind.

418
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:35,393
So would it be possible...

419
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,903
to have her live at our place until the baby is born?

420
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:39,762
It's just wishful thinking, of course.

421
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,502
I wouldn't do anything without your approval.

422
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:52,242
It's about Tae Kyung's ex-fiancée.

423
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:56,012
She told Yeon Doo that she'd take the baby.

424
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:58,222
Did you hear about that?

425
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,893
What? She wanted the baby?

426
00:24:01,922 --> 00:24:04,363
Ms. Jang is out of her mind.

427
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:06,793
Her lying about being barren was dreadful enough, but...

428
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,893
What? She said she was barren,

429
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:10,803
but it was a lie?

430
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:12,063
She believed...

431
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:15,432
that it would get Tae Kyung to marry her.

432
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:16,803
My gosh, how could one...

433
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:20,613
And my mother-in-law tried to have her live in our annex.

434
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:23,583
No can do, in-law.

435
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,813
Let's have the children live in your annex.

436
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:27,883
- What? - The grandmother...

437
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,353
is siding with her.

438
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:32,283
What if they collude once again...

439
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:34,623
to break our kids up and take the baby?

440
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:38,462
We must show her that Yeon Doo is your proud daughter-in-law.

441
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:40,633
You're absolutely right, in-law.

442
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,762
My mother-in-law will back off a little...

443
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:44,103
once Yeon Doo moves in.

444
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:47,002
Let's tell them right away.

445
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:49,103
When did they say they were registering their marriage?

446
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:54,113
The unit is in great condition.

447
00:24:55,672 --> 00:24:58,242
You'll regret it if you miss out on it.

448
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:00,783
You may be able to find other places to stay,

449
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,682
but not in this apartment complex.

450
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:07,922
The view isn't ideal, but I'll take it.

451
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:10,893
You made the right choice.

452
00:25:10,922 --> 00:25:13,692
Let me contact the home owner right away.

453
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,073
- Hey, Mom. - Are you at the borough office?

454
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:25,573
Are you and Yeon Doo together?

455
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:28,972
Yes, I'm at the borough office. Yeon Doo and I just met.

456
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:30,242
Hello, sir.

457
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:32,412
You put your apartment unit on the market.

458
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:34,452
I hear people chattering.

459
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,422
Anyway, Ms. Oh's mother and I are almost there, so sit tight.

460
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:40,123
What? Why are you heading over here?

461
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:42,452
We wanted to see you register your marriage,

462
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:43,722
and we had something to say.

463
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,323
Mom, I'm hanging up. Nature's calling.

464
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:47,492
Sure thing.

465
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,033
- I'm sorry. - But sir!

466
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:50,502
Sir!

467
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:52,603
(Oh Yeon Doo)

468
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,903
Why aren't you picking up?

469
00:25:58,702 --> 00:25:59,873
(Gong Tae Kyung)

470
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:01,813
It's nice and clean.

471
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:06,212
The unit has low water pressure.

472
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:08,952
Let me check the bathroom again.

473
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,722
Again?

474
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,593
She's too thorough for her own good.

475
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,022
(General Service Center)

476
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:34,143
(General Service Center)

477
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,512
Mom, Mother.

478
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,482
- Tae Kyung, my gosh. - Tae Kyung.

479
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:40,412
You didn't have to come all this way.

480
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:41,982
We could handle this on our own.

481
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:43,583
Did Yeon Doo go somewhere?

482
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:45,482
She went to the restroom.

483
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,823
Why? Was she feeling queasy again?

484
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,393
No, it's not that, but...

485
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:51,022
I can't believe she's making you wait.

486
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:52,192
Let me call her.

487
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:54,593
Gosh, no. Let me go to her instead.

488
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:55,893
I'm too worried to just stand here.

489
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:56,903
Wait!

490
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:58,303
- Why? - Why?

491
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:01,603
I'm afraid something came up for her.

492
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:02,932
- What? - What?

493
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:06,373
We'll have to register our marriage some other time.

494
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:07,843
Why aren't you coming in?

495
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:15,313
I can't believe you.

496
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:17,583
What took you so long at the restroom?

497
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,982
Sorry, Mom. My stomach was acting up.

498
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,992
I apologize, Mother.

499
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:25,192
Please don't. Being pregnant makes you sensitive.

500
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:27,192
Anyway, let's take a look...

501
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:29,033
at a freshly stamped marriage certificate.

502
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,662
- Shall we? - Sure.

503
00:27:30,662 --> 00:27:31,662
Let's head inside.

504
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:34,133
Come on.

505
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,742
What on earth? Why weren't you taking my calls?

506
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:43,472
I was out house-hunting and forgot to check my phone.

507
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:46,412
Anyway, what are we going to do?

508
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,583
We'll have to avoid sealing the deal at all costs.

509
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:59,222
(Marriage Registration)

510
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:04,162
Husband, Gong Tae Kyung. Wife, Oh Yeon Doo.

511
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:05,303
Even your names go well together.

512
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,803
- Fill out the rest. - Sure.

513
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:16,442
(Witness)

514
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:18,283
Hold on. We need a witness.

515
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:22,653
Goodness. Oh, dear.

516
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,452
We didn't know and didn't come prepared.

517
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:28,893
Mom, I'm afraid we can't sign it today. Let's go.

518
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:30,823
What are you doing?

519
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:32,662
Mom, we'll have to come back some other time.

520
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:34,162
Sure. I'll get going.

521
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:35,492
You have your witnesses.

522
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:38,262
Your mothers are adults, aren't they?

523
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:39,903
They can be witnesses.

524
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:47,712
Is that so? In-law, I'm glad we came here today.

525
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:48,813
Exactly!

526
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:52,143
How meaningful is it to be witnesses to our children's marriage?

527
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:54,853
We're here for you, so fill out the rest...

528
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:56,783
and stamp your seals on there.

529
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,492
Tae Kyung, do you have your seal with you?

530
00:29:04,123 --> 00:29:05,363
You forgot, didn't you?

531
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,192
My seal?

532
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:10,133
Gosh, I forgot to bring it. What do I do?

533
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:12,063
Did you really forget?

534
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,833
I should've brought it instead.

535
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:15,472
What now?

536
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:17,843
They can't possibly register their marriage...

537
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,343
without their seals.

538
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:22,843
Actually, they can. We only need their signature.

539
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:25,383
Didn't you look anything up?

540
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:28,452
Gosh, you must really be meant to be.

541
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:32,222
Yeon Doo, go ahead and sign it.

542
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:33,623
Tae Kyung, you too.

543
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:35,992
Goodness.

544
00:29:43,863 --> 00:29:45,033
What's wrong with you?

545
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,373
How could you forget your seal?

546
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,133
Yeon Doo, hold on.

547
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:51,643
You don't need one to register your marriage.

548
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:54,143
Mom, that's not what I'm talking about.

549
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:57,343
How many times did I tell you to bring your seal?

550
00:29:57,482 --> 00:29:59,613
How can one be this clumsy?

551
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:02,712
You being unprepared the day we first met...

552
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:04,783
is why I ended up with a bun in the oven.

553
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:07,553
Unprepared? My gosh. Yeon Doo,

554
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:08,992
please calm down.

555
00:30:09,422 --> 00:30:11,093
My signature will do, though.

556
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:12,692
Why won't you cut me some slack?

557
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:13,992
And you're one to talk.

558
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,232
Why did you not know we needed witnesses?

559
00:30:16,593 --> 00:30:19,502
What mom-to-be is so absent-minded and careless?

560
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:22,833
Will you forget the dates for the baby's vaccination too?

561
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,643
Stop it, Tae Kyung.

562
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:28,613
What? I'm absent-minded and careless?

563
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,412
Is that all you can say?

564
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:33,742
You're an irresponsible...

565
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:35,583
and good-for-nothing fool.

566
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,912
I was pregnant...

567
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:38,982
and you tried to marry someone else!

568
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:41,323
Yes, I'm irresponsible.

569
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:45,323
I wouldn't be signing this if it weren't for the baby.

570
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,593
Okay?

571
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:50,232
Let's forget about this. Forget about it all!

572
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:54,232
Sounds great. I can't live with someone like you either.

573
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,702
Let's go our separate ways. It's over!

574
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,172
As if I care.

575
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:02,613
Wait, Yeon Doo. You can't...

576
00:31:09,252 --> 00:31:10,252
Nice one.

577
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,182
That was spot-on.

578
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:13,583
Well done, Yeon Doo.

579
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:16,323
You made it look pretty real too.

580
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,522
We got them good.

581
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,633
Let's keep up the act.

582
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:26,033
We should.

583
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:29,833
What, Mom? I'm going home.

584
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:31,803
What, Mom? See you at home.

585
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:34,313
Mother.

586
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,343
Mother?

587
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:43,813
Grandma, can you join us for dinner?

588
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:46,123
I don't feel like eating...

589
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:48,293
- without you at the table. - Okay.

590
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:50,452
You must stay strong, Grandma.

591
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:54,262
You're the matriarch of the family, not Mother.

592
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:56,692
Okay.

593
00:31:57,702 --> 00:31:59,563
I'll join you for dinner.

594
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:03,702
Eat up, sweet Geum Sil.

595
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:08,742
Don't you dare tease your granny.

596
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:10,843
You laughed.

597
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:14,813
Oh, dear. It's Ms. Jang.

598
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:16,353
What?

599
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:19,553
How is Ms. Eun?

600
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:22,252
I'd like to visit if she's okay.

601
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:24,393
She is okay, but...

602
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:26,593
Hang on.

603
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:29,633
Are you here already? The doorbell's ringing.

604
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,833
No, I'm in a taxi, on my way there.

605
00:32:32,962 --> 00:32:34,333
I just reached the neighbourhood.

606
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:38,543
Your mother's here.

607
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:40,442
Hang up. I'll call you later.

608
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:43,472
My mom?

609
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:47,553
Sir, can you drive faster?

610
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:52,653
Mom...

611
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:57,962
Wait, Ms. Eun's...

612
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,992
Oh, you're eating.

613
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:03,333
Get out of the way.

614
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:08,403
I got some traditional snacks from a Cheongdam-dong rice cake place.

615
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,103
Why are you here?

616
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:12,672
You must be so upset.

617
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,712
I barely sleep these days.

618
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:17,613
I stayed up all last night...

619
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:19,543
and came over because I had to.

620
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:22,283
My head's ringing, so get to the point.

621
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,482
Why are you here?

622
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:27,593
The apartment you promised us.

623
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,653
You will still...

624
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:32,563
pay for the rest of it even though the wedding didn't happen, right?

625
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,293
Well,

626
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:38,303
I believe you wouldn't do something that crass,

627
00:33:38,303 --> 00:33:39,633
but then I get worried.

628
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:42,272
I'll pay for it, so get out.

629
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,272
Didn't you hear me?

630
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:49,813
What else will you give us?

631
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:51,313
What?

632
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:53,143
What are you saying?

633
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:54,952
My Se Jin.

634
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:57,883
She wore a wedding dress and walked down the aisle.

635
00:33:57,982 --> 00:33:59,982
She should be part of your family,

636
00:33:59,982 --> 00:34:02,093
but she's lying in bed half-dead.

637
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,792
She was branded a girl who got ditched at the altar.

638
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,493
Who would want to marry her now?

639
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:10,263
Would she even be able to date?

640
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:16,232
Do you think a tiny apartment is enough compensation?

641
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:19,743
You could give me many times more and it won't heal the insult!

642
00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:21,812
It's not good enough!

643
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,042
Many times more than that?

644
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:27,113
Do you want me to pay up millions of dollars, then?

645
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,212
Compensate us for the mental anguish.

646
00:34:30,212 --> 00:34:34,453
You must hand over much more if you have a conscience!

647
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:37,823
Are you trying to bargain with your daughter?

648
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:39,823
Get out of my house!

649
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,163
I can't.

650
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,163
I won't move an inch...

651
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:47,533
until I'm compensated for the torment!

652
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:50,203
Mom!

653
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:55,073
Get up. We're going home.

654
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:56,712
I can't go.

655
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:59,982
I'm not leaving until I'm compensated!

656
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:02,082
Do you want to see me dead?

657
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,982
We're leaving.

658
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:09,692
No. Hand it over. Hand over my money!

659
00:35:10,022 --> 00:35:12,663
My money! I want it now!

660
00:35:12,663 --> 00:35:15,763
I can't believe people can be like that.

661
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,062
Are you okay, Grandma?

662
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,633
Oh, dear...

663
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:26,542
Am I wrong?

664
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:29,743
There's no way we can be their in-laws now.

665
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:34,312
So we have to milk them for all they've got.

666
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:37,153
They didn't ruin me. You did!

667
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:40,522
You turned Ms. Eun against me.

668
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:44,223
You ruined the last hope I had!

669
00:35:51,303 --> 00:35:52,462
Se Jin.

670
00:35:57,303 --> 00:36:00,442
Tae Kyung. You must feel so hurt.

671
00:36:01,312 --> 00:36:04,513
I can't believe Yeon Doo yelled at you...

672
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,513
for forgetting your seal.

673
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,383
It's not the first time.

674
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,153
Should she have the baby or not?

675
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,383
She tortured me so many times.

676
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,453
I'm her mom and I know how mad she can be.

677
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:18,993
She makes you so angry every once in a while.

678
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,332
You can forget the marriage license.

679
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,602
As long as you don't stay angry for long.

680
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:30,602
Well, I do feel a bit better, thanks to you.

681
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,272
You do?

682
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:34,812
Then shall we have some tea?

683
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:36,272
I picked out a café.

684
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:38,542
Sure, Mother.

685
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:40,343
- Let's go. - Good.

686
00:36:41,453 --> 00:36:44,422
Yeon Doo. Let me apologize instead.

687
00:36:44,422 --> 00:36:46,922
Stay with him, for my sake.

688
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:50,192
I'll box his ears when I get home.

689
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:53,892
He speaks in such a hurtful manner.

690
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,633
You heard him.

691
00:36:56,392 --> 00:36:59,433
He wouldn't get a marriage license if it weren't for the baby.

692
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:02,732
What does that make me, then?

693
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,303
You know that...

694
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:08,013
he talks like that when he doesn't mean it.

695
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,172
He's not the type to care about a baby.

696
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:13,482
He's doing this because he loves you.

697
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:16,953
Hearing your placating...

698
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:20,082
makes me feel a little at ease.

699
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:23,993
Good. Now that we feel better,

700
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:27,192
shall we forget the license and get some dessert?

701
00:37:28,692 --> 00:37:29,832
Sure, Mother.

702
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:34,203
Patch things up.

703
00:37:34,473 --> 00:37:38,002
Do you want the baby to hear only fighting sounds?

704
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:40,843
Yes. It's too much on us old moms.

705
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,843
Let it go.

706
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:52,953
I'm sorry, Tae Kyung. I was too harsh.

707
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:54,553
I was in the wrong.

708
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,953
That was no way to treat a pregnant woman.

709
00:37:57,863 --> 00:37:58,863
That'll do.

710
00:37:59,323 --> 00:38:01,062
The marriage license can wait.

711
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:04,363
You can move into their annex.

712
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:05,562
- What? - What?

713
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:09,073
Yes. That's what we decided on.

714
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:10,672
I already found a place.

715
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:11,703
I also...

716
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:14,413
I mean, we already did.

717
00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:17,743
I get that you want to live on your own,

718
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:21,953
but stay with us only until Ms. Eun and Ms. Jang calm down.

719
00:38:21,953 --> 00:38:25,522
Yes. You must show them that you're a rightful family.

720
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:28,522
- I can't do that. - I can't do that either.

721
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:34,363
Then let's go get that marriage license.

722
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:36,163
Yes, get up. We're going back.

723
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:37,192
- Mother. - Mom.

724
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:40,403
You two.

725
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:41,933
What's going on?

726
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:44,232
No wedding, no marriage license,

727
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:45,542
no living in the annex.

728
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,743
Why are you against everything?

729
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:49,743
Are you...

730
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:52,613
thinking of making it legal after trying things out?

731
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:56,982
Okay, then. I'll respect your wishes...

732
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:58,622
if you live in the annex.

733
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:06,692
What's that look about?

734
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,533
Are you lying to us about something?

735
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:12,903
Why would I lie to you about anything?

736
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:14,672
As if you didn't in the past.

737
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:16,732
You first told me that Tae Kyung wasn't the father.

738
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:17,772
That was you lying.

739
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,573
My gosh. Did she actually say that?

740
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:23,573
She told me that the father wasn't in the picture,

741
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:26,042
so I thought he had cheated on her or died.

742
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:29,812
Why did you say those things?

743
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:32,422
His grandmother and Ms. Jang would have a field day with that.

744
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:33,683
Tell me about it.

745
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:37,593
They would've insisted that Tae Kyung wasn't the father...

746
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:39,163
and would've thrown a fit...

747
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:40,863
about testing the baby's DNA.

748
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:41,933
Exactly.

749
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:43,732
Look at them right now.

750
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,133
One might think that they're faking it...

751
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,502
since they don't want to get married...

752
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:48,703
- or move into the annex. - We'll move in.

753
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:50,703
Sure, we'll move in.

754
00:39:51,403 --> 00:39:52,772
We'll...

755
00:39:52,772 --> 00:39:55,513
move into the annex like you want.

756
00:39:57,243 --> 00:39:59,883
There aren't any issues with us.

757
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:03,312
Anyway, I'll put you out only until the baby's born.

758
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:06,522
Don't you think that way. It's my pleasure.

759
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:10,093
In-law, when should we have them move in?

760
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,022
How does this weekend sound?

761
00:40:12,962 --> 00:40:15,292
Sounds good to me. I'll get ready on my end as well.

762
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:17,763
You two are just as happy, right?

763
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:21,332
Sure.

764
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:25,942
You don't have to prepare anything.

765
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:27,812
The place is fully furnished.

766
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:30,913
I was intimidated by what to get...

767
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:32,642
for a family like yours.

768
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:35,113
I'm grateful for the consideration you've shown us.

769
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:37,413
I'm the one who's grateful.

770
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:39,852
My Tae Kyung is finally having a family of his own.

771
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:42,622
It's taking them a while to get everything to go.

772
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:56,872
I don't want to live with you, you know.

773
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:58,743
I'm not exactly delighted myself.

774
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:01,872
But they'll suspect us even more if we refuse to move in.

775
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:06,513
We'll suck it up and tolerate it for three months.

776
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:09,413
Why three months?

777
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:11,082
By then,

778
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:13,553
it'll be illegal to have an abortion,

779
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,653
and it's an adequate amount of time for us...

780
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:17,053
to know that we're butting heads.

781
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:19,922
Personality differences.

782
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:22,493
It's a universal reason...

783
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,903
when it comes to breakups.

784
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:27,633
Exactly.

785
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:30,573
We'll break up saying we're sick of each other.

786
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:35,613
- How can it be this sweet? - It's so good.

787
00:41:35,613 --> 00:41:37,942
- It's good. - This is delicious!

788
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:39,042
Is it good?

789
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:41,082
It's so sweet.

790
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:48,022
Yeon Doo will skip her wedding...

791
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:51,593
and move into her in-laws' annex this weekend.

792
00:41:51,962 --> 00:41:52,993
What?

793
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:55,593
Don't be too surprised.

794
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:58,602
It's a nice place, so there's no need to be sad.

795
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:01,172
Why would we be sad?

796
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,303
A family like that would have a grand annex.

797
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:04,942
It'll probably be bigger than our place.

798
00:42:05,642 --> 00:42:07,872
You're now the daughter-in-law of a company chairman.

799
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:11,243
Could you get me a job at his company?

800
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:13,482
You'll be leaving your laptop, right?

801
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:17,383
Uncle's family is rich, so you can buy a new one.

802
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:22,192
I can't believe you all. Is that all you can say to me?

803
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:24,422
Don't think about mooching off her and enjoy the dessert.

804
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:26,022
Tae Kyung's mother bought it for us.

805
00:42:27,122 --> 00:42:30,392
A rich chairman's wife buying this for us...

806
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:31,732
must be why it's so delicious.

807
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:33,363
It's sweet but in a classy way.

808
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:34,973
I'd love to have this every day.

809
00:42:35,073 --> 00:42:37,172
I'm going to eat more than anyone here.

810
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:39,772
- Sure. - Go ahead. Have it all.

811
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:41,973
- Stop that. - Let me have a little more.

812
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,413
- That's enough! - Don't be like that.

813
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,312
- Stop it. - I didn't get to have much.

814
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:47,812
- It's mine. - Hands off!

815
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:58,462
Mother.

816
00:42:59,192 --> 00:43:02,033
I bought your favourite dessert.

817
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:03,062
Forget it.

818
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:05,962
Why would I be spoiling my dinner?

819
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:17,812
Mother, I have something to tell you.

820
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:20,812
Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo...

821
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:24,283
will move into the annex this weekend.

822
00:43:24,283 --> 00:43:26,953
Who's moving in where?

823
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:27,953
Mother,

824
00:43:28,852 --> 00:43:30,852
should you be doing this when Dad's out of town?

825
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:32,922
I already told him.

826
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:34,763
I apologize for not discussing this with you.

827
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:38,363
But this is about having someone new live with us.

828
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:40,133
You two both live here.

829
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:41,573
Why can't Tae Kyung live here too?

830
00:43:41,573 --> 00:43:42,672
He's family.

831
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,133
Shut it.

832
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:48,113
You're only family if you actually eat with them.

833
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:51,343
How can we have some stranger barge into this house?

834
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:53,783
Do what you want.

835
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,982
As of this moment, I will not eat anything,

836
00:43:56,982 --> 00:43:58,422
so do as you please.

837
00:43:58,422 --> 00:44:01,493
Then I will also refuse to eat.

838
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:04,763
How could I possibly eat...

839
00:44:04,763 --> 00:44:07,122
when you're not eating anything?

840
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:10,433
Fine. Let's see who wins.

841
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:13,203
We'll see if you're willing to take it as far...

842
00:44:13,203 --> 00:44:15,102
as to seeing me wither away.

843
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:18,473
Grandma.

844
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:54,973
They're both refusing to eat.

845
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:56,743
You should hurry home...

846
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:58,582
once you wrap things up on Jeju Island.

847
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:00,413
Right. Sure thing.

848
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:05,723
How are Grandma and Mother? Are they both not eating?

849
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:08,392
As if this is even worth it.

850
00:45:08,392 --> 00:45:10,522
We're being held back from going to work.

851
00:45:10,522 --> 00:45:14,263
What could she want to make her move into the annex?

852
00:45:14,263 --> 00:45:15,593
You think she has an ulterior motive?

853
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:16,593
What about me, then?

854
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:18,863
Did I move in here because I had an ulterior motive too?

855
00:45:19,102 --> 00:45:20,863
How can you compare yourself to her?

856
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:24,033
She's an absurd woman who crashed another couple's wedding.

857
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:26,303
And this family is a mess because of her.

858
00:45:27,602 --> 00:45:29,042
Excuse me, but I should get going.

859
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:32,183
Hyun Woo, aren't you a member of this family?

860
00:45:32,683 --> 00:45:34,383
We don't see you a lot around the house anymore.

861
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:37,013
Is something up? Did you and Ji Myung argue?

862
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:41,723
Hold on.

863
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:45,493
What if we met her ourselves?

864
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:47,392
Us?

865
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,562
Count me in. It sounds like fun.

866
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:52,403
But how do we contact her?

867
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,403
I know a way.

868
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:04,812
Ms. Jang, do you have her contact information?

869
00:46:05,413 --> 00:46:07,042
We're going to meet her...

870
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:09,153
and tell her not to move into the annex.

871
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:11,482
I know her number.

872
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:13,783
I'll text it to you after we hang up.

873
00:46:31,903 --> 00:46:33,642
I'm sorry for acting like a stalker.

874
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,372
I won't ask you to marry me.

875
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:38,312
Please, just don't say we should break up.

876
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:14,212
(Letter of Resignation)

877
00:47:23,522 --> 00:47:24,622
This is wrong.

878
00:47:24,622 --> 00:47:26,692
How could I possibly live at the annex?

879
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:30,593
What?

880
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:32,433
Who could it be?

881
00:47:34,872 --> 00:47:35,903
Hello?

882
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:40,272
Chun Myung, is this necessary?

883
00:47:41,002 --> 00:47:42,073
Hyun Woo,

884
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,113
why are you putting it like that?

885
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:46,542
I'm not going to swallow her alive.

886
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:48,752
Exactly.

887
00:47:48,752 --> 00:47:50,053
You saying that...

888
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:52,582
makes us seem like the villains here.

889
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:55,022
There's no need to be sensitive.

890
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:56,723
We only want to talk to her.

891
00:47:56,723 --> 00:47:58,462
Hey. Over here!

892
00:48:07,102 --> 00:48:08,102
Gosh.

893
00:48:15,743 --> 00:48:17,542
Maybe I shouldn't have said we should hold out for three months.

894
00:48:18,942 --> 00:48:20,343
How would we live together?

895
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:23,883
It's suffocating.

896
00:48:29,392 --> 00:48:30,453
Gosh.

897
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:37,433
Darn it.

898
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:53,982
What's with them?

899
00:48:54,243 --> 00:48:56,453
It feels like I'm a monkey in a zoo.

900
00:48:58,283 --> 00:48:59,922
I'm Tae Kyung's older brother.

901
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:01,892
This is my wife.

902
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:04,493
She's Tae Kyung's older sister, and he's her husband.

903
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:06,993
Oh, right. She's the younger sister.

904
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:11,602
I'm Oh Yeon Doo. Nice to meet you.

905
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:15,102
The thing is, it would feel strange...

906
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,002
if you just moved in with us all of a sudden.

907
00:49:17,002 --> 00:49:20,372
So I thought we should get together...

908
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:22,142
to be familiar with each other.

909
00:49:23,113 --> 00:49:26,383
I should've paid you a visit first. I'm sorry.

910
00:49:26,513 --> 00:49:28,812
Do you really have to move into the annex?

911
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:32,653
- Pardon? - You know what our family is like.

912
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,593
It seems like you grew up in a modest family.

913
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:39,392
You will have a hard time if your standard of living suddenly changes.

914
00:49:39,692 --> 00:49:42,562
You don't want to get out of your comfort zone.

915
00:49:42,732 --> 00:49:44,562
You should live at ease in your own place.

916
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:50,232
I'll make sure...

917
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:52,542
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

918
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:56,442
But why do you want to move in with us?

919
00:49:56,712 --> 00:49:58,582
I'm sorry to say this,

920
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:01,212
we're not on good terms with Tae Kyung.

921
00:50:01,212 --> 00:50:03,383
We are just like strangers.

922
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:06,153
And even if the baby in your belly...

923
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:09,352
is the only offspring of our family, the baby won't get anything.

924
00:50:10,323 --> 00:50:11,553
Get anything?

925
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:17,232
It's not like I'm having this baby to get money or something.

926
00:50:17,462 --> 00:50:19,732
I just fell pregnant naturally.

927
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:23,533
You must be happy that you fell pregnant naturally.

928
00:50:24,672 --> 00:50:26,303
Is she bragging or what?

929
00:50:27,573 --> 00:50:29,942
I'm not bragging.

930
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:35,783
I'll move out once I give birth to my baby.

931
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,013
I promise.

932
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:40,053
Stop talking about the baby. A baby is the key to everything?

933
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:42,422
This is just an unplanned pregnancy.

934
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,993
Do you have to mess up our family...

935
00:50:43,993 --> 00:50:45,593
because of your unwanted baby?

936
00:50:46,823 --> 00:50:49,593
It's not like all parents have a baby through a planned pregnancy.

937
00:50:49,832 --> 00:50:52,903
A lot of babies are born through mistakes these days.

938
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:55,872
What did you say? That's...

939
00:50:55,872 --> 00:50:58,403
Honey, just stay quiet.

940
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:03,442
Yeon Doo, how's your marital compatibility with Tae Kyung?

941
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:07,013
We didn't have our marital compatibility told yet.

942
00:51:07,142 --> 00:51:10,212
That's not what I'm talking about. I mean, in bed.

943
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,183
Hey, you watch your words.

944
00:51:14,183 --> 00:51:15,292
Aren't you ashamed of what you said?

945
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:16,922
Why would I be ashamed?

946
00:51:16,922 --> 00:51:18,622
We are all adults.

947
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:20,163
And she's pregnant with Tae Kyung's baby.

948
00:51:20,993 --> 00:51:22,192
I'm curious.

949
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:24,392
What's her charm that made Tae Kyung cave in...

950
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,863
when he wanted to stay single?

951
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:33,573
She's innocent and sexy.

952
00:51:35,002 --> 00:51:37,343
She's innocent and sexy at the same time.

953
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,913
And she's feminine and yet bold.

954
00:51:39,482 --> 00:51:42,183
She has her unpredictable charm.

955
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:46,122
Yeon Doo, is the baby surprised?

956
00:51:47,922 --> 00:51:50,522
What took you so long, Tae Kyung?

957
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,562
I'm sorry I'm late.

958
00:51:53,562 --> 00:51:54,763
Why did you call her?

959
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:58,093
Don't you think it's unfair to push her all together like this?

960
00:51:58,403 --> 00:52:00,133
She's being sensitive in the early stage of pregnancy.

961
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:01,832
What if something bad happens to our baby?

962
00:52:01,832 --> 00:52:04,303
We didn't do anything to harm your baby.

963
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:06,372
Whether we move into the annex or not, it's for us to decide.

964
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:10,513
If you give her a hard time again like this, I won't let it slide.

965
00:52:11,142 --> 00:52:12,942
- If you do... - Then what?

966
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:17,312
I'll go to the main house, not the annex.

967
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:27,022
What was that?

968
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:28,692
She pretended to be innocent,

969
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:30,933
but she called Tae Kyung out without telling us.

970
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:33,403
Tae Kyung says he will come to the main house.

971
00:52:34,102 --> 00:52:35,203
Things won't be so easy.

972
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:37,002
Let's go.

973
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,582
It's you who called Tae Kyung, aren't you?

974
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:48,982
Yes. You know we were being cheap.

975
00:52:49,712 --> 00:52:50,852
Don't play the hypocrite.

976
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:52,723
Just don't tell Chun Myung.

977
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:54,622
I don't want to take the blame with you.

978
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:07,602
Why do they force me to go? I'm dying to know more.

979
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:15,372
Do you like the food?

980
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:19,113
Yes. I was worried about us moving in together,

981
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,743
so I couldn't eat anything.

982
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:25,082
I've lived alone for such a long time.

983
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:27,752
Do you think I'm happy to move in with you?

984
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,493
Then why did you tell them you'd go to the main house?

985
00:53:31,723 --> 00:53:33,392
We have no other choice.

986
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:35,022
Otherwise, we can't persuade our moms.

987
00:53:36,363 --> 00:53:38,703
What's with your family members?

988
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:40,502
Your grandmother is hard enough to deal with.

989
00:53:40,502 --> 00:53:43,633
And even your brother and sisters are going against our decision.

990
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:46,002
We won't get to see them a lot in the annex.

991
00:53:46,343 --> 00:53:47,542
Just think of them as strangers.

992
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:50,513
And we will live like strangers in separate bedrooms.

993
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:52,042
You don't have to worry.

994
00:53:52,982 --> 00:53:54,642
I'll go pick you up in the morning the day after tomorrow.

995
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:02,692
You can't fast. It will only ruin your health.

996
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,692
We can find another way to convince Mom.

997
00:54:06,823 --> 00:54:08,223
I'm sorry, honey.

998
00:54:08,223 --> 00:54:11,133
I really want them to move into the annex.

999
00:54:12,602 --> 00:54:14,263
You should go to Mother.

1000
00:54:14,263 --> 00:54:17,133
She will get furious if even her son neglects her.

1001
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:33,323
I got you some omegi tteok from your favourite place.

1002
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:37,053
Please try some and chew it well.

1003
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:43,533
Then I'll fast too from now on.

1004
00:54:46,803 --> 00:54:50,073
You can't skip a meal when you go to work.

1005
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:51,772
Mom.

1006
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:55,413
You know I can't live without you.

1007
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:58,913
Please think of your only son. Okay?

1008
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:04,683
Fine. Now that you insist,

1009
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:07,352
I'll just try one.

1010
00:55:07,352 --> 00:55:10,622
That's great. Here.

1011
00:55:11,153 --> 00:55:12,192
Grandmother.

1012
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,192
What's the matter?

1013
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:15,493
Dad, you're home early.

1014
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:19,062
Grandmother, Tae Kyung's girlfriend is such a vixen.

1015
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,332
She pretends to be all innocent,

1016
00:55:21,332 --> 00:55:24,332
but she's just like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

1017
00:55:24,403 --> 00:55:26,303
She has Tae Kyung in the palm of her hand.

1018
00:55:26,372 --> 00:55:28,613
If they can't move into the annex, they will move into the main house.

1019
00:55:29,113 --> 00:55:31,172
But they actually make a good match.

1020
00:55:31,172 --> 00:55:32,582
They're meant to be together.

1021
00:55:33,082 --> 00:55:34,343
What are you talking about?

1022
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:36,913
Did you meet Tae Kyung and her girlfriend?

1023
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:38,212
What?

1024
00:55:39,622 --> 00:55:40,953
My goodness.

1025
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:45,093
I won't even take a sip of water.

1026
00:55:45,363 --> 00:55:47,122
Get out of my room!

1027
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:49,093
Mom, please.

1028
00:55:52,062 --> 00:55:53,363
Gosh.

1029
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:04,672
Yeon Doo, would this be enough?

1030
00:56:05,413 --> 00:56:07,783
Yes. I'll just bring what I need for now.

1031
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:12,053
Auntie Yeon Doo, can I have your laptop?

1032
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:14,482
- Hey. - What?

1033
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:16,852
I can just say no.

1034
00:56:16,852 --> 00:56:18,723
You don't have to yell at her.

1035
00:56:21,993 --> 00:56:25,502
Soo Kyum, finding a job is more important than a laptop.

1036
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:30,602
Yeon Doo, will you get me a job at your father-in-law's company?

1037
00:56:31,732 --> 00:56:33,102
Come on out and eat.

1038
00:56:41,082 --> 00:56:42,582
I'm moving out tomorrow.

1039
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:44,683
Aren't you throwing a farewell party for me?

1040
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,622
A farewell party, my foot. It's not like you're dying.

1041
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:49,522
We're just having the usual.

1042
00:56:49,892 --> 00:56:52,122
You will miss my cooking later on.

1043
00:56:53,723 --> 00:56:55,122
As if you care about me a lot.

1044
00:56:55,863 --> 00:56:58,533
I'll move into Yeon Doo's room tomorrow.

1045
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,002
I'm finally getting away from the cold, tiny room.

1046
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:02,703
No. It will be my study.

1047
00:57:02,703 --> 00:57:05,903
What are you talking about? I need my own room.

1048
00:57:06,073 --> 00:57:07,473
I want privacy.

1049
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:09,513
You don't have privacy.

1050
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:11,343
Auntie's room will be my dressing room.

1051
00:57:11,913 --> 00:57:14,113
What? That's ridiculous.

1052
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:17,113
Hey, we need a study, not a dressing room.

1053
00:57:17,712 --> 00:57:19,852
- You're my granddaughter, but... - You don't even study.

1054
00:57:19,852 --> 00:57:22,453
- Right. - And a dad doesn't need privacy.

1055
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:23,993
- I will study. - What are you talking about?

1056
00:57:24,422 --> 00:57:27,363
It's like they've been waiting for me to move out.

1057
00:57:27,363 --> 00:57:28,422
This is unbelievable.

1058
00:57:28,422 --> 00:57:31,232
- Hey, your room is big enough. - I need a bigger room.

1059
00:58:04,562 --> 00:58:05,562
Yeon Doo.

1060
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:11,672
I know you've been through a lot in this house.

1061
00:58:14,672 --> 00:58:17,413
I'm so happy that I'm your mom.

1062
00:58:20,843 --> 00:58:22,082
My Yeon Doo.

1063
00:58:24,153 --> 00:58:26,283
You'll be a better mom than me.

1064
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:32,462
Let's not cry. Let's say goodbye with a smile.

1065
00:58:34,892 --> 00:58:37,062
Okay? My dear girl.

1066
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:45,502
Get out.

1067
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:47,372
Did you cry, Bong Nim?

1068
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:50,513
We promised not to cry.

1069
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:55,142
How would we let Yeon Doo go?

1070
00:58:55,613 --> 00:58:56,852
I can't.

1071
00:58:57,212 --> 00:58:58,752
Do we have to let her go?

1072
00:58:59,522 --> 00:59:01,982
What if she forgets about us after living in a nice house?

1073
00:59:02,653 --> 00:59:03,752
I don't...

1074
00:59:04,823 --> 00:59:06,522
need her laptop.

1075
00:59:08,392 --> 00:59:10,033
I want to live with Auntie Yeon Doo.

1076
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:12,303
Stop making a fuss and get out.

1077
00:59:12,303 --> 00:59:14,133
We might wake her up.

1078
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,433
You guys are being ridiculous.

1079
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:19,243
I don't want you to cry for me.

1080
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:22,812
I don't want to cry either.

1081
00:59:23,372 --> 00:59:25,413
I really don't.

1082
00:59:26,113 --> 00:59:28,852
- Yeon Doo. - Yeon Doo.

1083
00:59:28,852 --> 00:59:30,482
Don't go, Yeon Doo.

1084
00:59:31,752 --> 00:59:33,553
Don't go.

1085
00:59:34,022 --> 00:59:37,352
- Just live here with us. - Yeon Doo.

1086
00:59:37,352 --> 00:59:39,163
We want you here.

1087
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:41,692
- Auntie Yeon Doo. - Yeon Doo.

1088
00:59:42,962 --> 00:59:46,133
- Yeon Doo, don't go. - Auntie.

1089
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:47,763
Yeon Doo.

1090
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:00,183
Get out this instant.

1091
01:00:03,982 --> 01:00:05,653
I made...

1092
01:00:06,723 --> 01:00:08,283
some mung bean porridge you like.

1093
01:00:09,493 --> 01:00:13,363
I bet you had some of it while pretending to cook for me.

1094
01:00:14,993 --> 01:00:16,093
Mother.

1095
01:00:16,692 --> 01:00:18,832
I know you hate me,

1096
01:00:18,832 --> 01:00:20,633
but I don't want you to skip a meal.

1097
01:00:21,602 --> 01:00:24,133
Do you think I'll fall for that?

1098
01:00:24,133 --> 01:00:26,172
That's not going to happen.

1099
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:31,042
Do you know how I got...

1100
01:00:32,013 --> 01:00:34,343
the courage to go against you?

1101
01:00:35,183 --> 01:00:38,982
I was upset when you shunned Tae Kyung.

1102
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:43,852
But now I understand why you cared so much about your grandchildren.

1103
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:48,863
Having a grandchild is different from having a child.

1104
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:53,832
Tae Kyung and her girlfriend will move in today,

1105
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:56,832
but they will move out after the baby is born.

1106
01:00:57,703 --> 01:01:00,672
Only until the baby is born healthy,

1107
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:04,712
please cut them some slack.

1108
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:06,383
Please, Mother.

1109
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:13,852
I don't want porridge.

1110
01:01:15,122 --> 01:01:16,122
Pardon?

1111
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:19,263
I want rice, instead of porridge.

1112
01:01:33,442 --> 01:01:35,272
Take your time and eat slowly.

1113
01:01:35,272 --> 01:01:38,372
If you rush it like that, you'll get an upset stomach.

1114
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:40,413
My stomach is made of iron.

1115
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,513
I've never had an upset stomach my whole life.

1116
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:47,982
Tomorrow morning,

1117
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:51,852
I want octopus soup and sliced raw octopus.

1118
01:01:51,852 --> 01:01:53,422
They will help me perk up.

1119
01:01:54,323 --> 01:01:55,763
Yes, Mother.

1120
01:02:09,812 --> 01:02:11,473
What's with your eyes?

1121
01:02:12,073 --> 01:02:15,343
We had salty dishes last night.

1122
01:02:15,343 --> 01:02:17,113
So we had a lot of water.

1123
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:18,712
Don't worry, Tae Kyung.

1124
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:22,622
Once Yeon Doo gets there, you'll be the only one she has.

1125
01:02:22,622 --> 01:02:23,953
Take good care of her.

1126
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,593
If you don't,

1127
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:27,392
I'll haunt you down and teach you a lesson.

1128
01:02:27,622 --> 01:02:30,933
You're taking Auntie Yeon Doo from me. I hate you.

1129
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:32,363
I'm sorry, Soo Kyum.

1130
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,102
I'll be sure to come here often with your aunt.

1131
01:02:39,642 --> 01:02:40,672
Mom.

1132
01:02:43,142 --> 01:02:45,272
Go ahead and leave.

1133
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:07,462
Let's go.

1134
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:15,942
Yeon Doo.

1135
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:18,013
Yeon Doo!

1136
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:25,482
I can do this for you.

1137
01:03:25,482 --> 01:03:27,482
This is what I want to eat.

1138
01:03:27,482 --> 01:03:29,922
I make better geotjeori than you do.

1139
01:03:31,122 --> 01:03:33,892
I'm glad that you recovered your strength, Mother.

1140
01:03:33,892 --> 01:03:36,763
I have to stay strong for my children and grandchildren.

1141
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:40,332
I think they're here.

1142
01:03:50,712 --> 01:03:51,712
Are you nervous?

1143
01:03:53,883 --> 01:03:54,942
I'm fine.

1144
01:03:55,383 --> 01:03:58,153
This is where people live after all.

1145
01:04:15,133 --> 01:04:16,303
Hello.

1146
01:04:16,303 --> 01:04:17,403
Welcome.

1147
01:04:17,403 --> 01:04:19,033
We're glad that you've become our family.

1148
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:20,203
You're here.

1149
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:21,672
Mother.

1150
01:04:22,243 --> 01:04:24,513
Welcome, Yeon Doo. I'm glad you're here.

1151
01:04:24,513 --> 01:04:26,482
- Thank you. - Where's Mom?

1152
01:04:26,482 --> 01:04:28,542
- She's in the kitchen. - I'm here.

1153
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:32,783
Hello, Grandmother. I'm here.

1154
01:04:32,783 --> 01:04:35,752
Okay. Welcome to my house.

1155
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:41,392
Thank you.

1156
01:04:44,892 --> 01:04:45,903
Grandmother!

1157
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:33,982
(The Real Has Come!)

1158
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:36,212
"The housemate rules?"

1159
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:38,953
"First, treat each other like an invisible person."

1160
01:05:38,953 --> 01:05:41,352
Does he think I want anything to do with him or what?

1161
01:05:41,653 --> 01:05:44,622
"The cohabitation ends in three months no matter what."

1162
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:46,292
What?

1163
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:47,863
Go ahead and cry.

1164
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:51,533
My goodness.

1165
01:05:51,633 --> 01:05:53,363
I think I have depression.

1166
01:05:53,502 --> 01:05:55,002
And I have insomnia.

1167
01:05:55,363 --> 01:05:57,933
I miss Auntie Yeon Doo so much that I can't fall asleep.

1168
01:05:57,933 --> 01:06:00,672
No. I'm doing fine.

1169
01:06:01,672 --> 01:06:03,372
And Yeon Doo is doing fine too.

1170
01:06:03,913 --> 01:06:06,142
What did I do so wrong?

1171
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:08,243
She threw salt at me.

1172
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:13,582
You've never been pregnant before.

1173
01:06:13,582 --> 01:06:16,522
- Are you making fun of me? - What?

1174
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:18,823
Didn't your family teach you stuff like this?

1175
01:06:19,192 --> 01:06:21,792
You keep mentioning my family since yesterday,

1176
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:24,593
but what kind of family teaches their children how to cook Jeon?
