(What's going on?)

Your Honor!

21
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:54,123
You must uphold justice for us.

22
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:55,283
Look at this bride

23
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:56,324
and her adulterer.

24
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:57,763
She didn't come to marry,

25
00:01:57,763 --> 00:02:00,324
but to wipe out our family.

26
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:01,363
Mr. Xue.

27
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:02,164
Get up first.

28
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:02,884
Calm down.

29
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:04,604
I can't calm down, my lord.

30
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:06,684
My father was supposed to be remarried.

31
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:07,763
However,

32
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,480
the bride and her adulterer tried

33
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:11,203
to murder my father this morning.

34
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:12,923
My son.

35
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:16,164
Why can't you accept me
as your stepmother?

36
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:18,523
Why would you frame me
with such a heinous crime?

37
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,284
Frame you?

38
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:21,763
This is

39
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,284
what I found in my father's bedroom.

40
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,763
It's the same fabric
this adulterer is wearing.

41
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,203
He is the culprit.

42
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,284
Who's the adulterer?

43
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:41,363
Explain yourself!

44
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:44,083
Who'd be her adulterer?

45
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:46,724
Look how she beat me up.

46
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,844
Why are you carrying so many weapons?

47
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,044
My lord.

48
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:05,164
He obviously

49
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:06,363
means to kill us all.

50
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:07,884
Please do us justice.

51
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:09,243
Nonsense...!

52
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:10,324
Feng Zuoren.

53
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:12,083
Say something.

54
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,444
Idiot.

55
00:03:17,324 --> 00:03:18,324
At this point,

56
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:19,683
Mr. Gu.

57
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:21,763
Just tell them the truth.

58
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:27,564
(Gu Qianfu.)

59
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,192
(You'll have to take the fall.)

60
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:36,776
How dare you?

61
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,724
I came here

62
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,604
under imperial orders.

63
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:43,324
Imperial orders?

64
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:46,203
Then

65
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,444
what's your mission?

66
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:51,604
No comment.

67
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:52,203
You...

68
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,923
Why don't you stop lying?

69
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:55,124
You...

70
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:56,604
No comment.

71
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,832
How dare you!

72
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,048
You have anything to say

73
00:03:59,048 --> 00:03:59,923
besides "no comment"?

74
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,604
Pathetic vocabulary.

75
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:03,284
Your disrespect doubles your crime.

76
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:03,844
You'd better

77
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,083
stop making excuses.

78
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,404
Confess and beg

79
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:07,464
for forgiveness.

80
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:09,004
Mr. Gu

81
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:12,404
is the Chief of the Jing'an Bureau.

82
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:17,764
That's right.

83
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:19,844
His Majesty told me that the Xue family

84
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:21,764
boasts military merits.

85
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,003
Lord Dingyuan is ill.

86
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,923
Many schemers would try to hurt him

87
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:26,923
when he's vulnerable.

88
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:29,923
Thus, Grand Tutor Zhou's Jing'an Bureau

89
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:31,204
sent a special guard.

90
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:32,044
And that is

91
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,284
Mr. Gu.

92
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:40,524
That's right.

93
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:41,644
I almost

94
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,123
got abducted by that culprit.

95
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:46,164
Mr. Gu saved me.

96
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:47,724
During the struggle,

97
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:50,164
I accidentally fell onto him.

98
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:51,604
That's all.

99
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:53,204
I don't know

100
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:54,683
anything else.

101
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,363
If you doubt Mr. Gu's credentials,

102
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,404
ask the Grand Tutor.

103
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:00,524
All of it

104
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,243
is arranged by the Grand Tutor.

105
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:03,563
That's right.

106
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,164
My lord.

107
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,443
This woman has a sharp tongue.

108
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:08,604
Don't be deceived.

109
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:11,724
Ms. Wang just married your father.

110
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:13,964
You keep opposing her

111
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:16,964
and almost spread rumors about her.

112
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:18,803
Your father's remarriage

113
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,443
upsets you so much?

114
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:22,404
I...

115
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,003
How can a Xiao family member

116
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,204
be so petty?

117
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:29,003
You...

118
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:29,724
Madam.

119
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,044
Don't hurt Hexu.

120
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,084
My son.

121
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:40,844
I know you lost

122
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:42,883
your mother young.

123
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:45,724
Your grandmother and father raised you.

124
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:47,724
That's why you're so guarded

125
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:49,844
and always expecting the worst.

126
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:51,844
But I know

127
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:53,724
you meant to protect your family.

128
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,204
My son.

129
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:00,764
You've suffered.

130
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,123
Ms. Wang.

131
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:07,443
You showed such magnanimity

132
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:09,404
after suffering such humiliation.

133
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:11,803
With you joining us,

134
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:16,443
our family finally sees hope.

135
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,923
It's just a misunderstanding.

136
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:25,480
In that case,

137
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:28,204
I'll take my leave now.

138
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:32,923
Why bother me with family affairs?

139
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:36,644
It's fine now.

140
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,000
(Xue Mansion)

141
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:57,204
Stepmother.

142
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,483
This will be your chamber.

143
00:06:58,724 --> 00:06:59,764
It's been a long day.

144
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:00,604
You must be shaken.

145
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:01,923
Rest well tonight.

146
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,803
I'll pay my respects tomorrow morning.

147
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:05,844
Thank you.

148
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:18,563
Come down.

149
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:32,323
No need for such formalities.

150
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:39,803
Why expose me?

151
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:41,604
How can I fulfill my task now?

152
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:42,683
Feng Zuoren.

153
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:43,524
No one wants

154
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:44,724
a vicious woman like you.

155
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:46,923
Have you forgotten?

156
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:48,964
Today is my wedding day.

157
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:50,323
Y-You...

158
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:51,323
"You" what?

159
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:52,803
The Jing'an Bureau

160
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,524
is always involved in shameful dealings.

161
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,164
I gave you a chance to play hero.

162
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:57,084
Be grateful.

163
00:07:58,563 --> 00:07:59,683
You cleared my inner energy.

164
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:00,923
Yet I should thank you?

165
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:02,376
The Jingang Pill

166
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:04,003
restores your inner energy.

167
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,483
I want the antidote
for the Dispersing Powder.

168
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:06,964
Deal.

169
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,284
(- I knew it.
- I knew it.)

170
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:35,843
I knew it.

171
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,088
The Jingang Pill

172
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,843
wouldn't possibly work immediately.

173
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:42,284
You think I don't know?

174
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,443
Your antidote

175
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:44,923
only works temporarily, too.

176
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:45,683
- Liar.
- Liar.

177
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:47,083
Good.

178
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,404
It proves we're both well-trained.

179
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:50,563
In that case,

180
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:52,723
we can exchange the antidotes.

181
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,284
In your dreams.

182
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:57,044
It's proven that

183
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,164
you'd kill me once you restored

184
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,164
your inner energy.

185
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:03,364
We're both depleted of inner energy.

186
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:05,323
But we must solve the case.

187
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:06,764
In that case,

188
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:07,963
let's join forces.

189
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:09,004
Come on.

190
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,603
Tell me the clues you have.

191
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,764
A devil like you doesn't collaborate.

192
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:18,563
Don't tell me

193
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:20,603
you're completely clueless.

194
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:28,484
I progressed more than you did
even without inner energy.

195
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:31,923
Goodbye.

196
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:48,404
It's late.

197
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:49,563
Go to sleep.

198
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:50,843
I'm not tired.

199
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,923
Harmony at home brings peace, you know?

200
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:55,963
I just want to protect my family.

201
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,004
Ever since Ms. Wang

202
00:09:58,884 --> 00:09:59,843
came here,

203
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,352
many things have happened.

204
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,443
She's surely involved.

205
00:10:03,284 --> 00:10:06,284
Don't bring the merchant's suspicion

206
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:07,524
into family affairs.

207
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,244
Thorough consideration

208
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,484
can't be wrong.

209
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:14,603
Father.

210
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:15,764
Rest assured.

211
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:18,203
I won't let the Xue family

212
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:19,764
suffer any harm.

213
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:22,644
Father.

214
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:23,764
It's fine.

215
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:24,644
We're safe.

216
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,296
(Xue Mansion)

217
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,484
(Former Crown Prince.)

218
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:22,484
(With the entire family)

219
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:24,484
(accompanying you to death,)

220
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,164
(you won't be lonely.)

221
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,936
Fire!

222
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:06,963
Hurry.

223
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:16,843
It must be a coincidence.

224
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,644
Fire!

225
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:38,004
Fire!

226
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:50,563
Why is this happening?

227
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:52,764
They put out the fire so fast!

228
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:54,536
I'll save Stepmother.

229
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:00,284
Stepmother.

230
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:01,443
I'm here to save you.

231
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:05,244
Stepmother.

232
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:06,723
Are you okay?

233
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:08,963
There's a fire!

234
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,044
(I bet this vicious woman set the fire.)

235
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:16,203
Stepmother.

236
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:18,963
I've contained the fires elsewhere.

237
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:19,923
But the flames

238
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:22,683
are too fierce here.

239
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:24,603
I can't control it anymore.

240
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:28,484
Stepmother.

241
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:30,164
The fire is deadly.

242
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:31,644
See you in the next life.

243
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:42,644
Is there a fire?

244
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:43,443
Yeah.

245
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,443
Thank goodness you're fine.

246
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:53,764
How could I bear to be separated

247
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:55,284
from my son?

248
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:59,563
We're here.

249
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:15,368
Don't be afraid, Stepmother.

250
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:17,404
How did the mansion catch fire?

251
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,124
This fire came raging in

252
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,843
and was extinguished so quickly?

253
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,484
The manor hasn't been burnt.

254
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,484
You must be disappointed.

255
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,364
I'm just worried.

256
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:31,484
How could you think that of me?

257
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:32,563
My son.

258
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:35,803
Stepmother.

259
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:37,404
It's all thanks to Hexu

260
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,203
and the alarm bells he designed.

261
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:41,644
Alarm bells?

262
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:44,524
Yeah.

263
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:47,004
We have

264
00:14:47,683 --> 00:14:49,203
a thread running through the walls

265
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:51,524
with bells tied to it.

266
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:54,164
When fire burns through the thread,

267
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,923
the bells drop

268
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:57,404
and make a sound.

269
00:14:58,203 --> 00:14:58,963
When we hear it,

270
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:00,683
we know where the fire is.

271
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,364
The manor is full of bells.

272
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,764
But Hexu won't let me play with them.

273
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,843
Those are not toys, Dongyang.

274
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:10,843
That's truly

275
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:13,044
impressive.

276
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,124
(These people)

277
00:15:15,723 --> 00:15:17,364
(are surprisingly hard to kill.)

278
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:19,244
We have experienced ten fires

279
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:20,443
in 20 years.

280
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:22,524
The culprits probably think

281
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,044
that they can disguise
murders as accidents.

282
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:26,203
In that way,

283
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,764
all evidence and witnesses

284
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:30,083
will be annihilated.

285
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:31,364
Right?

286
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:39,764
H-how would I know?

287
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:41,803
I'm scared out of my wits.

288
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:43,644
Totally.

289
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:45,044
The arsonist

290
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,443
thinks he has it under control.

291
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:49,563
But he will end up burned.

292
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:50,884
Be careful

293
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:52,644
not to get

294
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:54,164
scorched.

295
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:56,872
Luckily, Hexu was prepared.

296
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:58,364
We conduct

297
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:00,284
fire drills every month.

298
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,124
Constant practice ensures readiness.

299
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,164
You must have been frightened again.

300
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,803
There are things

301
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,164
you must get used to.

302
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,164
You'll be arranging

303
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:11,004
all the drills.

304
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:17,683
I'm having a headache.

305
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:19,004
It's late.

306
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:20,364
Go to sleep.

307
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:21,563
I'll rest, too.

308
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,524
(My son.)

309
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:57,004
(A fire)

310
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:58,364
(must be foolproof.)

311
00:16:58,963 --> 00:16:59,963
(You can stop it once.)

312
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:01,484
(But can you stop it)

313
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,164
(twice in a row?)

314
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:07,240
Four Characters.

315
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:11,484
I can't sleep because of the fire.

316
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:12,803
I prefer playing Mahjong.

317
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,883
Self-drawn.

318
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:20,040
Six Characters.

319
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:30,403
East Wind.

320
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:32,524
I won.

321
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:34,403
Are you serious?

322
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,323
You won like this?

323
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,004
He was waiting

324
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:37,004
for the east wind.

325
00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:38,883
Dongyang's luck is heaven-sent.

326
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:58,484
East wind out of nowhere?

327
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:06,643
(Oh no.)

328
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:07,803
(Jing'an Bureau.)

329
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:08,552
(Jing'an Bureau)

330
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:17,764
Feng Zuoren,

331
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:19,083
how dare you set fire

332
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:20,643
to obstruct my investigation?

333
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,883
The Xue Guardians
are obviously against me.

334
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:44,643
Yeah.

335
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:47,403
I must report Feng Zuoren's misconduct.

336
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,123
That's right.

337
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:53,603
Stop crying.

338
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:55,524
Look at you, poor thing.

339
00:18:58,524 --> 00:18:59,204
Do I look fine?

340
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:03,444
You look alright.

341
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,363
His Majesty is furious.

342
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:17,803
You've been too conspicuous,

343
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,363
drawing attention in just two days.

344
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,724
The investigation
must be conducted secretly.

345
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:26,643
This commotion will alert our targets.

346
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:28,004
Do you confess?

347
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,284
I acknowledge my mistake.

348
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:33,204
The imperial succession
affects everything.

349
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:35,123
Don't let your stupidity

350
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:36,643
ruin His Majesty's plans.

351
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:41,004
Are you

352
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:43,363
defying the imperial decree?

353
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,204
I heed

354
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:49,643
the decree.

355
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:00,284
A mere woman like you

356
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,083
is truly useless,

357
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,204
wasting His Majesty's trust.

358
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:06,684
If you act recklessly again,

359
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,044
you'll forfeit your pathetic life.

360
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,528
(Xue Street)

361
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:51,684
(Guess I need to lay low.)

362
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,603
(I can't kill the elderly.)

363
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,843
(Nor do I have to kill the women.)

364
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:58,123
(Xue Hexu.)

365
00:20:58,803 --> 00:20:59,764
(Despicable scum.)

366
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,964
(I'll kill you first.)

367
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:07,272
(Xue Street)

368
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:11,403
It's been a mess lately.

369
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:13,083
Everyone is frightened.

370
00:21:13,363 --> 00:21:14,403
Let's make them some soup.

371
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:17,004
(Perfect time to add ingredients.)

372
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:18,123
Fetch me some goji berries.

373
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:19,244
Alright.

374
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,403
Where's my Cobra Pill?

375
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:34,643
Man-Eating Flower Nectar?

376
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:37,964
Bone-Melting Powder?

377
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,004
Where's my money?

378
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:05,363
(That's my medicine box.)

379
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:09,764
Good morning.

380
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:12,444
I'm disposing of dry waste.

381
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:14,284
If not handled properly,

382
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:15,484
it can be poisonous.

383
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,083
(Xue Hexu.)

384
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,964
(You need to die right now.)

385
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:45,843
Stepmother.

386
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,336
You stay indoors all day.

387
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,444
Let's hang out.

388
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:52,484
Dongyang.

389
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:55,004
The recent family troubles

390
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:57,403
weigh heavily on my heart.

391
00:22:58,323 --> 00:22:59,363
I feel helpless.

392
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:02,504
Stepmother.

393
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:05,524
It's been a mess these days.

394
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,444
Grandmother forbade me from going out,

395
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:09,403
but gave me lots of pocket money.

396
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:10,004
Look.

397
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:12,603
I can buy treats and toys.

398
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:15,123
All for you.

399
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:19,244
All for me?

400
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:21,444
Why?

401
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:24,843
Only a good person would choose

402
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,163
to stay with us.

403
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,123
Grandmother says

404
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:28,643
good deeds bring rewards.

405
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,843
(None of them seems evil,)

406
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,044
(but I still have to kill the guys.)

407
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:49,563
(My son.)

408
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:54,284
(It will be your death anniversary
next year on this day.)

409
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:57,736
(Deadly Powder)

410
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:02,524
Hexu.

411
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:04,643
Have some chicken soup.

412
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:18,643
Nice pinwheel.

413
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:30,083
Hexu.

414
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:31,643
- Dongyang.
- Chicken soup.

415
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:34,123
Have it now.

416
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:35,123
Alright.

417
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:47,964
Dongyang.

418
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:50,163
Have you seen Ms. Wang?

419
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,403
Why are you asking?

420
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,056
Did she touch this soup?

421
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,083
Hexu.

422
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,403
Now you're being naughty.

423
00:24:56,684 --> 00:24:58,403
Stepmother just married our father.

424
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,444
And she was terrified last night.

425
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:02,403
We can't have her cook chicken soup.

426
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:03,803
Jiaoqian made it for you.

427
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,044
Jiaoqian made it?

428
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,200
I agree that we shouldn't

429
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:09,563
bother our stepmother

430
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:11,004
with these trivial matters.

431
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,803
Tell her not to

432
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,284
go around our mansion.

433
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:15,924
Let her rest forever.

434
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:27,724
I'll have it after work.

435
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:30,163
No.

436
00:25:30,484 --> 00:25:31,363
You must have it

437
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,724
while it's hot.

438
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:33,843
Besides, look.

439
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:35,924
I got you the left drumstick.

440
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:38,284
So meaty and so tasty.

441
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:39,244
Left drumstick.

442
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:40,083
It's nice.

443
00:25:41,363 --> 00:25:41,803
Fine.

444
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:00,323
This...

445
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:01,083
This...

446
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:02,163
This...

447
00:26:02,323 --> 00:26:03,403
This...

448
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:04,803
This...

449
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:05,484
This...

450
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:08,843
