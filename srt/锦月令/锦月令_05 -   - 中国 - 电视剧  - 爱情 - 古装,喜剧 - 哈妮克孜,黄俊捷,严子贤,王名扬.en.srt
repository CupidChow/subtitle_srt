My face.

21
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:49,036
My child.

22
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:49,796
This...

23
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:54,436
What happened?

24
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:55,357
Ms. Wang.

25
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,596
What did you put in the rouge

26
00:01:57,837 --> 00:01:59,277
you just presented to me?

27
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:00,997
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

28
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:02,077
That rouge

29
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,596
was given to me by Mrs. Han.

30
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,036
You all saw it, right?

31
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:06,277
- Yes.
- You all saw it.

32
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:08,477
Drag her away!

33
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,357
Your Highness, listen to me.

34
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:11,197
She did

35
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:12,116
this on purpose.

36
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:13,477
She knew everything.

37
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:15,317
Your Highness, please spare me.

38
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,037
The Han family conspired against me.

39
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,917
Send them all to the Penal Bureau

40
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:21,077
and execute.

41
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:22,597
Your Highness, please.

42
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:24,157
Let's go.

43
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:24,796
Grand Tutor.

44
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:25,877
Save me!

45
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:26,556
Grand Tutor!

46
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:27,317
Rest assured.

47
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,077
I'll visit your graves next year.

48
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:33,396
How terrifying!

49
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:35,597
She poisoned someone here?

50
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:40,357
I feel dizzy.

51
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:48,477
Stepmother.

52
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:50,157
Stepmother.

53
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,917
Stepmother, wake up!

54
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:53,116
Stepmother, wake up!

55
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:54,716
Wake up!

56
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:55,477
Wake up!

57
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:56,236
Xue Hexu.

58
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:58,317
If you shake me one more time,

59
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:00,437
I'll kill you brutally.

60
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:05,437
Sir,

61
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,197
she isn't feeling well.

62
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,157
We're leaving.

63
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:09,236
Hurry

64
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:10,357
to take some rest.

65
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:11,236
Let's go.

66
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,528
(Jing'an Bureau)

67
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,757
You are either a fool, or an imbecile,

68
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:30,836
or you're both.

69
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:32,040
This was your plan.

70
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:33,477
Now the Princess's face is ruined.

71
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:34,757
His Majesty might blame me.

72
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,116
All expenses for the banquet

73
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,352
is deducted from your salary.

74
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,776
(Xue Street)

75
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:03,528
(Xue Mansion)

76
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,516
Why are these weaklings
of the Xue family

77
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,437
so difficult to eliminate?

78
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:32,117
Strip off.

79
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:34,516
No way.

80
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,836
Jiaoqian said I can't let anyone

81
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:37,997
see my body.

82
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:41,797
Strip off!

83
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:43,396
What are you doing?

84
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:44,396
Strip off!

85
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:45,757
Why are you stripping me again?

86
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:53,877
The former Crown Prince?

87
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:12,317
I...

88
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:13,596
Come on.

89
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:16,916
(The clue is lost.)

90
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,197
(I almost got set up
by Grand Tutor Zhou.)

91
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,237
(If it weren't for him...)

92
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:25,036
Didn't expect you to help me.

93
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:26,916
I thought...

94
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:28,557
I would harm you?

95
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:30,997
I know you don't trust me

96
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:32,956
and suspect we

97
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,437
harbor the former Crown Prince.

98
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:35,916
But now,

99
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,237
I won't harm you.

100
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,156
Now we share honor

101
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:40,077
and hardships.

102
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,077
My goal is

103
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:43,437
to protect the Xue family.

104
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:44,757
I sincerely hope

105
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:46,036
you can treat us as family.

106
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:49,716
Jiaoqian.

107
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,276
Anything to say about
what happened today?

108
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:55,156
What?

109
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:56,557
Nothing.

110
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,596
I just threw away her dish.

111
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:00,757
I don't know about the rest.

112
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,237
I knew it's you!

113
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,997
You did this on purpose.

114
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:09,916
You two tricked me!

115
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:13,237
Jiaoqian.

116
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,637
All these years here,

117
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,276
you've served Dongyang well.

118
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,036
I know you didn't mean to.

119
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:21,437
You must be fooled by someone.

120
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,437
You didn't want

121
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,596
to get Stepmother killed.

122
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,396
That person must've told you

123
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,916
to just drive her out of Xue Mansion,

124
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:31,877
right?

125
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:33,716
Gu Qianfu told me this.

126
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:35,197
- Gu Qianfu?
- Gu Qianfu?

127
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,516
Grand Tutor Zhou and the Jing'an Bureau
are up to no good.

128
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,237
Isn't Jing'an Bureau

129
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:43,077
here to protect us?

130
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:44,516
Jiaoqian.

131
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,997
In this world, aside from ourselves,

132
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:48,877
no one can truly protect us.

133
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:50,117
Listen.

134
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:51,956
She is part of Xue family.

135
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:53,836
If she alone makes a mistake,

136
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,156
our entire Xue family,

137
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:56,317
even Dongyang,

138
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:57,716
will be implicated.

139
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:01,437
Jiaoqian.

140
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:02,916
Apologize to her.

141
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,156
Me?

142
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:06,716
Apologize to her?

143
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,237
Although I did it wrong,

144
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:10,877
does she do nothing wrong?

145
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:12,916
She's always acting

146
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,197
this and that.

147
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:16,877
What do you mean?

148
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:17,877
Acting so virtuous...

149
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,197
And smart.

150
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,637
I heard you brought honor

151
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:25,836
to Xue family at the Flower Banquet.

152
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:27,956
Remarkable!

153
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,036
I knew

154
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:30,677
you are beautiful, kind,

155
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:31,836
and smart.

156
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,197
(She is beautiful,)

157
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,317
(but kind?)

158
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:37,237
More than that!

159
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,997
She treats our entire family

160
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,197
so well.

161
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:43,437
As gentle as our own mother.

162
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:47,757
(This family is truly bizarre.)

163
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:49,877
Oh, no!

164
00:07:49,997 --> 00:07:51,237
Mr. Dongyang is missing!

165
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,077
What?

166
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:54,757
Jiaoqian!

167
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:56,437
Jiaoqian!

168
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:01,716
(It must be Gu Qianfu's doing again.)

169
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,237
(It's definitely her.)

170
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:06,557
(Dragging such a heavy man,)

171
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:07,757
(he can't go far.)

172
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:11,317
Stop!

173
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:13,956
Where's Dongyang?

174
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,036
You?

175
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:25,596
Never expected

176
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,237
you to know martial arts.

177
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:29,757
But,

178
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,476
treating me this way

179
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,197
is terribly rude.

180
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,517
We have treated you with sincerity.

181
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,397
Have you no conscience?

182
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,557
I always act with integrity

183
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,356
and admit what I do.

184
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:43,277
Dongyang's missing isn't my doing.

185
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,677
Since you married my father,

186
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:46,317
you've been scheming.

187
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:48,317
Dongyang has a child's mind,

188
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:49,596
yet you dared harm him?

189
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,077
Have you no family?

190
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:56,876
My family

191
00:08:58,397 --> 00:08:58,956
is all dead.

192
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:01,636
No wonder!

193
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,596
You're so vicious.

194
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,197
I bet they

195
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:06,797
got killed because of you.

196
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:11,917
Die!

197
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,888
(Jing'an Bureau)

198
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:27,037
Hurry!

199
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:29,157
Interrogate him.

200
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:32,996
What a shame.

201
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:34,317
We're off work.

202
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:39,517
But it's not over!

203
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:40,797
There's still time.

204
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:42,077
Make an exception.

205
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:43,197
Mr. Gu,

206
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:45,836
per Jing'an Bureau
Administrative Regulations,

207
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:47,836
Chapter 3, Article 5,

208
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:49,876
please come tomorrow at Chen hour.

209
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:51,236
Then,

210
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:56,236
we'll serve you.

211
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:05,716
How can you

212
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,077
be so negligent?

213
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:08,996
This is dereliction of duty!

214
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:10,277
Are you insane?

215
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:21,996
Die!

216
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:35,996
I am indeed vicious,

217
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,797
but my family's innocent.

218
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:39,356
Xue Hexu.

219
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,317
Utter one more slander,

220
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:43,636
you must die.

221
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:45,636
Where's Dongyang?

222
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:46,636
I'll look for him.

223
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:48,517
Cut the crap.

224
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:50,996
You know well why Xue Dongyang

225
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:51,956
got kidnapped.

226
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:53,836
Whether he can return safely

227
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:55,236
depends on

228
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:57,476
if you can verify

229
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,636
he should live.

230
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:02,557
The birthmark?

231
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,716
(Gu Qianfu strips people's clothes.)

232
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:06,956
Come. I'll show you something.

233
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,437
Jiaoqian.

234
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,197
Please be fine.

235
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:13,557
Jiaoqian.

236
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:15,037
Wake up!

237
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:15,876
Why bring me back?

238
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,116
Ms. Wang,

239
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:22,876
it must be you!

240
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:24,596
I knew you were up to no good.

241
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,116
Give Dongyang back to me.

242
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:26,797
Jiaoqian.

243
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:27,517
- Jiaoqian.
- Jiaoqian.

244
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:29,197
Calm down.

245
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:34,157
Now,

246
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,397
we can't find Dongyang.

247
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,037
We'll have to use

248
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:38,596
our secret technique.

249
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:40,356
Hexu,

250
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:41,996
do you mean

251
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:42,797
that?

252
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:45,356
That?

253
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,756
Are you sure?

254
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:49,836
What's that?

255
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:54,636
What?

256
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:55,956
Listen.

257
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:58,517
Everyone in Xue family
carries a birthmark.

258
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:00,077
Seems meaningless,

259
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,236
yet it can make the divination.

260
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:10,956
(Everyone in Xue family)

261
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:13,356
(has identical birthmarks.)

262
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,596
I see.

263
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,277
What a surprise.

264
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,636
Is Dongyang safe?

265
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:29,157
According to the birthmark's divination,

266
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:31,716
he is likely trapped somewhere.

267
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,116
West?

268
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:36,116
East?

269
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:37,596
North?

270
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:39,317
Or...

271
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,956
(Gu Qianfu must've discovered
Dongyang's birthmark,)

272
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:43,756
(hence, he kidnapped him.)

273
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,037
Stepmother, give me a word.

274
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,116
Wrong.

275
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:55,037
Well, this word

276
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:56,517
means money and time.

277
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,116
Does it mean

278
00:12:58,397 --> 00:12:59,956
the kidnappers will execute Dongyang

279
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,157
if they get no money?

280
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:01,716
Wait!

281
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:02,756
Don't say nonsense.

282
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:03,716
It's 'wrong'.

283
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:05,476
It actually means

284
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,716
Dongyang is temporarily safe.

285
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,236
The kidnappers won't harm him,

286
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:11,317
avoiding alerting us.

287
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:13,557
Instead of wasting time here,

288
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:14,836
we should look for him.

289
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:33,716
Feng Zuoren.

290
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:35,996
What's wrong?

291
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:37,756
You're wrong.

292
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,037
He isn't the former Crown Prince.

293
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:41,197
What?

294
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:44,636
Everyone in Xue family has a birthmark.

295
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,797
Xue Dongyang is just an ordinary person.

296
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,517
Nonsense!

297
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:53,356
Think I'll believe that?

298
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,437
I saw it with my own eyes.

299
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,677
It must be real.

300
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:02,716
You learned I hold
the former Crown Prince,

301
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:04,636
so you pulled this trick.

302
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,517
I can prove it to you.

303
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:07,716
How?

304
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:17,956
(You've been terrified.)

305
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:19,277
(I've hired)

306
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:20,797
(an expert bath scrubber)

307
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,716
(to scrub)

308
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:23,277
(your backs.)

309
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:24,277
(Just relax.)

310
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:35,077
Can't wait to experience his skills.

311
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:44,077
I'll begin then.

312
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:48,037
Let me start with you, Mr. Xue Hexu.

313
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:54,876
Are you serious?

314
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:14,557
That hurts.

315
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:15,956
That's my birthmark,

316
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:16,876
not dirt.

317
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:18,317
Gentler.

318
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:21,437
My apologies.

319
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,152
Stop, stop.

320
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:27,304
Stop, stop!

321
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:37,116
Comfortable.

322
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,197
Harder! Harder!

323
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:51,317
Right.

324
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:52,517
Don't stop!

325
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:54,077
Scrub thoroughly.

326
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:54,996
Harder.

327
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:55,797
Scrub harder.

328
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:02,317
Harder.

329
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:06,236
Come on.

330
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:07,236
(Marks won't come off.)

331
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:09,236
(Could they truly be birthmarks?)

332
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:11,716
(What kind of family is this?)

333
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:15,197
Now you understand.

334
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,236
Xue Dongyang might not be our target.

335
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:20,557
Arrest the wrong man
and mislead superiors.

336
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,636
By Jing'an Bureau's regulations,

337
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:24,836
this is more than negligence.

338
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,116
At minimum,

339
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:27,677
you shall be exiled.

340
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,037
But it is the Crown Prince's birthmark.

341
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:34,116
What went wrong?

342
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,996
Everyone in Xue family
has this birthmark.

343
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,917
This proves even more

344
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:43,836
they're harboring
the former Crown Prince,

345
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,517
so they're protecting him in every way.

346
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,037
But I've arrested
the fat man into Jing'an Bureau.

347
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,476
Maybe

348
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:55,517
I should

349
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:57,032
silence him.

350
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:58,077
Fool!

351
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,677
The Xue family will fight to the death.

352
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:05,077
The Emperor demands discretion.

353
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:07,596
Don't insult me!

354
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:09,636
What now?

355
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:13,116
We can't alert them now.

356
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:14,517
Only one solution.

357
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,557
Break the jail.

358
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:18,156
What?

359
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:20,037
Have you gone mad?

360
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,277
We can't break

361
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:22,037
the jail.

362
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:23,317
Are you insane?

363
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:24,596
If you didn't arrest him,

364
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:25,997
we needn't do so.

365
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:27,997
Feng Zuoren.

366
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,396
I'm warning you.

367
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:30,277
I...

368
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:31,037
Exchange antidotes

369
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,477
and cooperate.

370
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:34,957
Fine.

371
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,392
(Jing'an Bureau)

372
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:16,797
What is it?

373
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,396
Now.

374
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:34,916
I'll wait by the gate.

375
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,676
Come on.

376
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:51,557
- Come on.
- Come on.

377
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,848
(Green Dragon)

378
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:08,196
I won.

379
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:09,557
13 terminal tiles?

380
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,757
How did you complete this?

381
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:15,676
I've lost all my money.

382
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:20,396
Isn't he supposed to be an idiot?

383
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:23,517
You're faking it.

384
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:24,676
I...

385
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:25,396
How dare you!

386
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:56,277
Stepmother.

387
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:01,116
Go home.

388
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:02,477
No.

389
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,237
I've won so much money.

390
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,517
I'll take all their money.

391
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:08,717
Why do you need money?

392
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:11,477
Hexu works hard

393
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:12,916
and Jiaoqian always

394
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,237
worries about me.

395
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,317
I know I'm useless.

396
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,636
Earning more money won't harm.

397
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:23,356
You're perfect as you are.

398
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:24,477
Come home with me.

399
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:25,836
We all worry about you.

400
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:38,557
Well...

401
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:39,196
Go with me.

402
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:53,957
Hurry!

403
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:56,557
How can we hurry?

404
00:20:58,517 --> 00:20:59,916
Don't touch them.

405
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:02,596
Dongyang, take it slow.

406
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:04,916
Come on.

407
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:41,277
Come on.

408
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,037
Hurry.

409
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:08,396
Your sedatives are not effective at all.

410
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:09,237
No.

411
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,077
Who are you people?

412
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:16,396
We've been exposed.

413
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:17,277
With him,

414
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:18,116
we won't escape.

415
00:22:18,116 --> 00:22:18,596
No way.

416
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:19,208
Bye then.

417
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:20,477
If you don't take him,

418
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:21,757
I'll report you.

419
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:24,676
Dongyang, let's go.

420
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,876
No, Stepmother.

421
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:26,472
Go!

422
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:32,797
How dare you

423
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:33,768
to break the jail!

424
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:53,277
Hexu.

425
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:54,997
You can't think of Stepmother

426
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,436
as evil without any evidence.

427
00:22:57,037 --> 00:22:58,797
Though she married into the family,

428
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:00,037
so did I.

429
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:01,876
We are all family.

430
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:03,624
Aren't you worried

431
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:05,277
this is her scheme to devour our assets?

432
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:08,156
So you don't trust her.

433
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:10,557
I thought you and Dongyang

434
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:11,916
were both under her spell.

435
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:14,504
At the banquet, I knew
there's something between you.

436
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,196
She's our elder.

437
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:17,636
I thought

438
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:19,477
you two...

439
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,957
Jiaoqian, what are you talking about?

440
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,676
It's clearly a forbidden love

441
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:27,836
that grows over time.

442
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,876
What did you say?

443
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:55,876
Dongyang!

444
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:56,997
Jiaoqian!

445
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:57,636
Oh my!

446
00:23:58,596 --> 00:23:59,997
Where have you been?

447
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:00,717
I was so worried.

448
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,356
I went out alone yesterday

449
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:04,396
and accidentally got lost.

450
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:05,396
Lost?

451
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:07,116
How come?

452
00:24:07,797 --> 00:24:09,077
The streets were too crowded,

453
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:10,876
so I got lost.

454
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:13,517
Dongyang.

455
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:15,836
When we return home,

456
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,596
if anyone asks where you went,

457
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:18,920
just say

458
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,717
you went out and got lost

459
00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:22,757
and I found you, okay?

460
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,156
But Stepmother,

461
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:28,237
you were so brave last night.

462
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:29,957
I want everyone to know it.

463
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:31,676
Why can't we tell them?

464
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:34,237
I don't want them to worry.

465
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,836
Let's keep this as our secret.

466
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:39,916
Secret.

467
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:41,636
Good boy.

468
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:42,596
Go.

469
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:47,916
Did you save Dongyang?

470
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,277
You're such a hero!

471
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:54,356
Stepmother, you're hurt!

472
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:55,836
Just a little fall.

473
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:57,797
I need to take some rest.

474
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:12,277
You cunning Ms. Wang!

475
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,317
Scheming to infiltrate the Xue family.

476
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,876
Your vile plot might've
already succeeded.

477
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,396
Otherwise,

478
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,156
why would I

479
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:22,077
feel so troubled?

480
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:24,116
Enough!

481
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,717
Stop that now!

482
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:28,517
She's an assassin sent by the emperor!

483
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:31,277
Young Master.

484
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:33,037
She did help us

485
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:35,237
when we needed assistance.

486
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:36,037
Right?

487
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:43,916
Ms. Wang,

488
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:45,717
you cloud my judgment.

489
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:47,836
If I don't expose your schemes,

490
00:25:48,237 --> 00:25:49,676
how can I protect the Xue family?

491
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:50,797
Wait.

492
00:25:57,636 --> 00:25:59,368
But she got injured

493
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:00,436
for saving Dongyang.

494
00:26:01,797 --> 00:26:02,517
But I think

495
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:03,356
it's improper

496
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,037
to confront her now.

497
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:13,797
She's injured.

498
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:14,916
I should help her.

499
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:16,757
Exactly.

500
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:28,008
(Wound Ointment, Stasis Dispersant)

501
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,717
(Just go with the flow)

502
00:26:39,237 --> 00:26:40,477
(and complete the mission.)

503
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,317
(Yet I saved Dongyang?)

504
00:26:44,557 --> 00:26:46,037
(That brat is full of tricks,)

505
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:47,237
(just wants me dead.)

506
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:49,916
(Feng Zuoren, oh you.)

507
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,436
(When did you become so indecisive?)

508
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:55,396
(Before,)

509
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:57,396
(you never hesitated to kill.)

510
00:26:58,596 --> 00:27:00,356
(Has the Xue family poisoned your mind?)

511
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:03,797

clouded your mind?)
