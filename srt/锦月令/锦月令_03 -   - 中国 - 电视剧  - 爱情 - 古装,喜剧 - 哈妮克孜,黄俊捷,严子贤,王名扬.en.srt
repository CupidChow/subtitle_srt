This...

This...

24
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:50,148
This soup

25
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,788
is amazing, Dongyang.

26
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:01,627
It's perfect.

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,668
Almost sweet.

28
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,588
Jiaoqian is cooking even better.

29
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,347
Lucky you.

30
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:06,827
(Why hasn't the poison)

31
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:08,388
(taken effect?)

32
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,508
She must have been shocked, too.

33
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,068
The soup smelled bitter.

34
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,547
So I added some mung beans,

35
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:17,388
licorice root, and honeysuckle.

36
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:18,747
Doesn't it taste sweet?

37
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,027
(He added all those
detoxifying ingredients?)

38
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:23,068
(So he saved this brat.)

39
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:24,747
Yeah, it does.

40
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:27,147
You're so clever.

41
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,628
You can be a chef, too.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,147
Alright.

43
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:30,027
Thanks.

44
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:30,987
Back to work.

45
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,267
(Xue Dongyang)

46
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,108
(has to die, too.)

47
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:46,348
His Majesty

48
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:47,628
wants to see you.

49
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,968
(Taiji Hall)

50
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,228
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:04,668
Take the elixir

52
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:06,228
(Mr. Immortal, Imperial Astronomer)
for this month

53
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:09,188
and you will surely be better.

54
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,792
Thank you, Mr. Immortal.

55
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:31,508
Feng Zuoren.

56
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,827
You've caused commotions repeatedly.

57
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:35,948
This time,

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,508
you even killed my messenger.

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,587
Do you confess?

60
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,309
I confess.

61
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,029
I beg Your Majesty for more time.

62
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:49,748
The Xue family

63
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,508
is deeply suspicious.

64
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:52,748
And

65
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:54,228
the Jing'an Bureau

66
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:56,424
is also looking
for the former Crown Prince.

67
00:03:56,788 --> 00:04:00,109
(Grand Tutor Zhou
abused his position at court)

68
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,149
(and acted without authorization,)

69
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,829
(showing signs of treachery.)

70
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:06,788
(I must urge Feng Zuoren on.)

71
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:10,029
You're my most valued subordinate.

72
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,829
But you've been slow on this job.

73
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,548
That's why I ordered
the Jing'an Bureau to assist.

74
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,868
The Xue Guardians will surely

75
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:19,988
kill the former Crown Prince

76
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,709
before they do.

77
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:24,069
Keep it discreet.

78
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:26,629
Don't trouble me further.

79
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:28,189
You may leave.

80
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:41,509
Mr. Immortal.

81
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,108
Is this person

82
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:45,868
still trustworthy?

83
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,228
I only know one thing.

84
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,589
Those who betray Your Majesty's trust

85
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,348
meet unfortunate ends.

86
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,189
(There are 16 people,
including servants.)

87
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,668
(The family members
are in the east wing.)

88
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,629
(When darkness falls tonight,)

89
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,949
(Xue Mansion)

90
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:07,149
(I'll storm the east wing)

91
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:08,868
(and complete the mission)

92
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,189
(before anyone notices.)

93
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:13,269
(Prepare to die.)

94
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:14,949
Yeah.

95
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,149
Are you that curious?

96
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:34,269
This must be

97
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,228
Ms. Wang, who just married
into our family.

98
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,509
You're far too thin.

99
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:44,269
Hurry.

100
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:46,280
Sit and have some food.

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,269
Come on.

102
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:51,348
Sit here.

103
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:11,709
Ms. Wang.

104
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:13,589
On your wedding day,

105
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:15,348
misfortune took place

106
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,512
and ruined your moment.

107
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,816
Hexu is thoughtful

108
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,269
and invited all the ladies of our clan

109
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,548
to gather here

110
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,428
and recreate your wedding feast.

111
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,709
(It's Xue Hexu again!)

112
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:35,468
Thank you, Madam.

113
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,069
This is Ms. Li of the third branch.

114
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,829
This is your cousin Ms. Zhao.

115
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,189
Thank you

116
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,108
for your affection.

117
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,029
I'm Lord Dingyuan's wet nurse.

118
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,269
My "son" is getting married.

119
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:17,829
How could I not come?

120
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,348
Let me have a good look.

121
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,509
What a pretty girl.

122
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:27,269
Hurry and expand the family line.

123
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,069
Lord Dingyuan is still young.

124
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:30,988
Two sons could never be enough.

125
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,589
When I nursed your husband,

126
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,348
he ate vigorously

127
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:36,509
with a great appetite.

128
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,656
He's bound to have
eight or ten children.

129
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,709
I had already retired to my hometown.

130
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,228
I never imagined

131
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:51,269
I'd live to see
another wedding for our lord.

132
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:54,269
Exactly.

133
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,029
Come on.

134
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:00,589
(I'll seat you next to my stepmother.)

135
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,988
(Kill her.)

136
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,348
(Then you will receive great rewards.)

137
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,308
Madam, please eat too.

138
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,868
What an exquisite dish.

139
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:16,908
This is...?

140
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,468
Shrimp with mixed vegetables.

141
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,868
Our lord has suffered.

142
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,908
He lost his wife too young.

143
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,389
I meant the previous one.

144
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:35,400
What an exquisite dish.

145
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,552
This is...?

146
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,856
Stewed meat with deer antler.

147
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:41,428
How unusual.

148
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:45,288
Snake!

149
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,188
Someone help!

150
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:52,428
Someone help!

151
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:55,389
Be careful. Watch your step.

152
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,708
There's a snake!

153
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,908
It's fine, Granny Liu.

154
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:02,629
It's fine.

155
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,588
How terrifying!

156
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:05,308
Don't be scared.

157
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:32,308
(Xue Hexu.)

158
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,269
Oh no. This is bad.

159
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:39,269
All settled?

160
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:40,308
Stepmother.

161
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:41,349
Are you okay?

162
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:44,136
The snake is gone?

163
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,389
Are you alright?

164
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:47,548
Were you scared?

165
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:49,749
I'm fine.

166
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,389
That snake was quite fast.

167
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:02,509
My lord, help.

168
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:05,308
My second stepson
sent an assassin to kill me.

169
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,029
(These two again.)

170
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,428
(Same moves.)

171
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:09,948
Calm down, Madam.

172
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:11,629
Please get up first.

173
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:14,269
I can't calm down, my lord.

174
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:15,668
We were hosting

175
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:18,068
a banquet for the female clan members.

176
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:19,188
However,

177
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:21,109
an imposter among the guests

178
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:22,668
tried to kill me.

179
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,828
There is the vicious assassin.

180
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:28,229
Some put her to do this.

181
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:30,149
She even

182
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,989
released a snake during the feast.

183
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:34,548
Amidst the chaos,

184
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:35,828
she drew a blade against me.

185
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,349
Failing the task,

186
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:38,948
she pretended to pass out.

187
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:41,469
See the slash on my sleeve.

188
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,588
Now observe her weapon.

189
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,229
The shape

190
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:47,509
is identical!

191
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:50,469
My son.

192
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,068
I know

193
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,828
you are against me.

194
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:55,029
But how

195
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:57,989
could you conspire with others

196
00:10:58,149 --> 00:10:59,349
to take my life?

197
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:04,509
She...

198
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:05,509
She woke up.

199
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:07,869
You villain!

200
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,788
Name your conspirators now.

201
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,588
Maybe His Honor

202
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,509
will spare you.

203
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,989
There must be a misunderstanding.

204
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:21,588
Miss.

205
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,296
You seem kind-hearted.

206
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,509
You can't be an assassin.

207
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:28,948
Are you a guest?

208
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:31,908
Yeah.

209
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:34,440
I came for the feast.

210
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,256
You brought weapons to a feast?

211
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:47,269
And so many?

212
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,948
I'm actually a butcher.

213
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,469
These are family heirlooms.

214
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:57,548
They are

215
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,308
wedding gifts for you.

216
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:00,869
That's right.

217
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,229
Stepmother.

218
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:03,788
She's family. You got her wrong.

219
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:05,788
So dramatic.

220
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:10,349
Madam.

221
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,788
Which branch does she belong to?

222
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:14,668
Yeah.

223
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,708
I meant to ask earlier.

224
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,308
Which family are you from?

225
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:28,989
My lord.

226
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,989
I've never seen her before.

227
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:41,320
In that case,

228
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,428
let me tell you the truth.

229
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:44,708
She didn't

230
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,828
come for the feast.

231
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:49,389
She came

232
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:51,788
to steal the newlywed.

233
00:12:59,389 --> 00:12:59,948
The newlywed?

234
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:01,668
Me?

235
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:02,629
No.

236
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:05,188
The newlywed.

237
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:06,989
Xue Fugui.

238
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,229
My father.

239
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:12,109
(This)

240
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:14,109
(is too far-fetched.)

241
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,389
(How else can we)

242
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:16,749
(divert their attention?)

243
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,312
Is this true?

244
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:25,668
Yes.

245
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,509
I've admired our lord for years,

246
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,389
seeking to become his wife.

247
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,389
But you snatched him first.

248
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,428
So I came to steal him.

249
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:38,109
So,

250
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:39,948
Xue Hexu let you in

251
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,256
on purpose?

252
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:42,389
What do you mean?

253
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:44,109
This young lady

254
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,428
seems deeply devoted.

255
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:46,588
So I helped her.

256
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:48,308
My father can have another wife.

257
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:49,869
And me another stepmother.

258
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:50,869
You!

259
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:53,828
Ms. Wang has barely

260
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,509
married your father,

261
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:59,869
and you're already
finding him a concubine?

262
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:02,629
He still lies unconscious.

263
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:04,188
Absurd.

264
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,109
In that case...

265
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,588
It's just a misunderstanding.

266
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,029
We've troubled you.

267
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,588
I'll take my leave now.

268
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:21,548
(They bothered me with)

269
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:22,788
(family affairs again.)

270
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:26,269
My lord.

271
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:49,149
Let me tell you, son.

272
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:50,908
I won't harm anyone in the family.

273
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:52,788
Stop opposing me at every turn.

274
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,229
I'd sooner trust

275
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:56,200
that assassin was here for my father

276
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,229
than believe you.

277
00:14:58,068 --> 00:14:58,989
What do you want?

278
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:01,269
The former Crown Prince Jia Xun.

279
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,389
Cooperate with me,

280
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:05,389
and your family will be safe.

281
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,349
The former Crown Prince?

282
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:09,029
Listen.

283
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,308
The former Crown Prince is not here.

284
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:14,749
Still lying?

285
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:16,708
Let's see

286
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,509
whether your wit

287
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:21,788
outpaces my blade.

288
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:44,308
Keep her under watch.

289
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:45,668
Keep me

290
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:46,749
updated.

291
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:47,869
Understood.

292
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:48,188
Go.

293
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:48,629
Let's go.

294
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,588
(I must keep an eye on her,)

295
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,188
(just in case she harms my family.)

296
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:09,788
Wait.

297
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,509
W-Why hasn't our lady gone to bed?

298
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:17,668
Stay on watch.

299
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:18,828
I'll take a nap.

300
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:19,989
I'll doze off.

301
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:21,672
Alright. Sleep.

302
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,068
Oh no.

303
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:51,989
Grandmother.

304
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:53,416
Grandmother.

305
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,548
Dongyang. Jiaoqian.

306
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,509
Stop shouting. How improper.

307
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:04,148
Nuannuan's missing.

308
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:09,588
What happened?

309
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,388
(Why is Gu Qianfu also
following Xue Nuannuan?)

310
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:30,828
This one's pretty.

311
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:33,749
Smells wonderful.

312
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:34,548
I'll take this.

313
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:36,828
Thank you.

314
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:37,429
Here.

315
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,029
(Could Xue Nuannuan hold clues?)

316
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,148
Help. Let go.

317
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,348
Help.

318
00:17:58,788 --> 00:17:59,509
Gu Qianfu!

319
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:00,989
How despicable.

320
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,189
Why do you keep

321
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:13,269
ruining my plans?

322
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:15,868
Stripping a woman in broad daylight?

323
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,229
A scoundrel like you

324
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:18,469
deserves to die!

325
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:22,029
So annoying.

326
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:30,429
(Darn it.)

327
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,628
(My inner energy is out of control.)

328
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:36,469
Nuannuan.

329
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,628
Are you okay?

330
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:42,709
Vile woman, let her go!

331
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:48,189
Hexu, what are you doing?

332
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,709
(Thank goodness, he's useless.)

333
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,949
(I know good deed goes unrewarded.)

334
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:21,308
Nuannuan, you alright?

335
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:23,752
Hexu.

336
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:26,029
She just saved me from a thug.

337
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,200
You've misunderstood her.

338
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:55,749
A kite.

339
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:02,189
Pastries. I'm sorry.

340
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:22,189
What poison did you put?

341
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:24,509
Bone-Melting Powder?

342
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:26,888
Cobra Pill?

343
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:28,872
Or Knockout Drops?

344
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:33,557
None of those.

345
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:39,597
Fine, forget it.

346
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:41,716
Why don't you believe

347
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:42,996
that I won't hurt your family?

348
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,048
People suspect that

349
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:57,557
we're hiding the former Crown Prince.

350
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,996
I have to stay vigilant.

351
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:04,276
My brother Dongyang

352
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:08,557
used to be clever.

353
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:10,196
When he was ten,

354
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:11,996
someone poisoned our food.

355
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:13,676
He sniffed something

356
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,956
and took the first bite.

357
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:16,837
That's how we survived.

358
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:19,276
But after that,

359
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:21,557
he suffered a raging fever

360
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:22,837
for three days

361
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:24,716
and ended up like this.

362
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:36,424
My father

363
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,956
used to be a fourth-rank clerk.

364
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,196
He won several battles and became

365
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:42,716
Lord Dingyuan.

366
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,037
How could he possibly

367
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,716
save a prince from bandits

368
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:47,877
as the rumors claim?

369
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:54,676
Even so,

370
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,597
public opinion is terrifying.

371
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:00,077
Even if I fight

372
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:01,956
one against a hundred,

373
00:22:03,117 --> 00:22:05,397
I'll protect my family.

374
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,756
Since you're being sincere,

375
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,597
I'll tell you the truth.

376
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:20,276
On my wedding day,

377
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,397
I did plan to kill your family.

378
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:24,236
It would've been easy.

379
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,317
But I am told

380
00:22:26,476 --> 00:22:27,676
to stay discreet.

381
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:29,676
Everyone is nice

382
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:31,357
except for you.

383
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,516
As long as you work with me,

384
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:37,436
we'll be one big...

385
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:43,756
Happy family.

386
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:47,357
(Lies after lies.)

387
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,157
(Vicious liar.)

388
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,436
Stepmother.

389
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:58,516
Stepmother.

390
00:22:59,077 --> 00:22:59,837
Come with me.

391
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:00,557
Hurry.

392
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:03,496
Young master.

393
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:06,117
Do you want these?

394
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:10,557
Then let's play a game, okay?

395
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:11,837
Okay.

396
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:13,797
Rules are simple.

397
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,077
We roll the dice. High roll wins.

398
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:17,476
The winner

399
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,916
gets to pick

400
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:20,476
any item here.

401
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:22,157
The loser removes

402
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:24,637
an article of clothing.

403
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:28,996
Alright.

404
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,037
I'm going home for dinner.

405
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:39,196
Let's play next time.

406
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:39,637
Bye.

407
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:40,360
Young master.

408
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:44,597
How about some new rules?

409
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:46,597
This time,

410
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:49,557
the winner removes clothing.

411
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,436
The loser

412
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,877
takes all these prizes.

413
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:57,637
Sure.

414
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:19,877
I'm done playing.

415
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:22,877
What are you doing?

416
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:25,597
What are you doing?

417
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:29,436
Come here.

418
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,357
Come here.

419
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:38,837
Come here.

420
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:41,196
- What are you doing?
- Get in.

421
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:44,516
What are you doing?

422
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,276
Let go.

423
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:49,236
Stepmother, take a look.

424
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:50,184
I got you

425
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:51,877
these fabrics this morning.

426
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,676
You don't have many clothes.

427
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,516
And Hexu ruined one of your outfits.

428
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,877
You went out so early just for this?

429
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:01,557
Exactly.

430
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:04,716
Even I am jealous.

431
00:26:05,516 --> 00:26:06,357
Stepmother, choose.

432
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:07,236
Look.

433
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:08,317
This one,

434
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:09,557
and this one,

435
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:11,676
and this one.

436
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:16,357
How about this one?

437
00:26:16,597 --> 00:26:17,077
Look.

438
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:18,597
It's for spring attire.

439
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:21,117
This woman has acquainted herself

440
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:22,397
with our entire family.

441
00:26:23,877 --> 00:26:24,357
No.

442
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:26,597
I need another plan.

443
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:29,436
Bad news, young master.

444
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:30,916
Mr. Dongyang is missing.

445
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,117
What?

446
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:32,676
What?

447
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:33,276
What?

448
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:35,276
(The Grand Tutor)

449
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:36,597
(said that Jia Xun has)

450
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:38,792
(a red crescent-shaped birthmark
on his lower back.)

451
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:40,637
(Xue Nuannuan is clearly a girl.)

452
00:26:40,877 --> 00:26:42,597
(Let me check if you have it.)

453
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:45,512
Nothing.

454
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,117
What are you doing?

455
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:54,117
