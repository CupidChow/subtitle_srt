00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:59,816
(Feng Zuoren, Xue Guardian Commander)

22
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:42,920
(Emperor Jia,
Emperor of the Hua Dynasty)

23
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,962
The Xue Guardians
have eliminated the traitors.

24
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,003
Commander Feng Zuoren, heed the command.

25
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:05,603
I command you

26
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,123
to marry into
the Xue family of Lord Dingyuan.

27
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:11,003
Jia Xun is definitely hiding there.

28
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,962
You must find him before others do

29
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,682
and bring me his head.

30
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,482
I will locate the remnants

31
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:22,123
and eradicate them

32
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,522
to protect our nation.

33
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:32,403
Get up.

34
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:36,522
It's a crucial matter.

35
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:38,123
Do not

36
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:39,883
be exposed.

37
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:43,043
Understood.

38
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,403
(His Majesty has been in poor health.)

39
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,843
(The prince is still young.)

40
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,202
(The nation)

41
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:51,962
(hangs in precarious balance.)

42
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:53,082
(Years ago,)

43
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:56,163
(His Majesty's brother Jia Xun
was the Crown Prince.)

44
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,682
(Exiled among commoners,)

45
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:00,642
(he has turned twenty this year.)

46
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:02,362
(We implore Your Majesty)

47
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:05,242
(to reclaim Jia Xun
and restore his royal status)

48
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:07,362
(to stabilize the court.)

49
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:16,136
(Xue's Textile)
A new textile shop

50
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,576
opened on Xue Street?

51
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,442
What a pretty lady.

52
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:27,442
Don't tell me she's the shopkeeper.

53
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:33,283
Are you the shopkeeper?

54
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:40,322
Where can I get this fabric?

55
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:46,763
It looks amazing.

56
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:49,922
We have new stock.

57
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:51,083
Come see inside.

58
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:52,922
Alright.

59
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:54,603
Alright.

60
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:58,843
Zhang Er'gou.

61
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,763
Get your filthy hands off her.

62
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:08,520
(Xue Hexu, Second Son of the Xue Family)

63
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,203
Xue Hexu.

64
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:11,682
You again?

65
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:14,083
What an epic entrance.

66
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:15,362
Collect your rent

67
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,963
and stay out of this.

68
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,242
You punk.

69
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,002
Don't you know who runs this place?

70
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,043
Harassing the shopkeeper

71
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,922
means opposing the Xue family.

72
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:24,922
Don't forget

73
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,482
that your mother
rents our butcher stall.

74
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:30,283
That's your family's only livelihood.

75
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:33,403
Now get lost.

76
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,843
Thank you for helping, young master.

77
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:54,362
No problem.

78
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:57,802
Since you rent from us for business,

79
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:58,632
it's our duty

80
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,283
to protect you.

81
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,562
Here's six months' rent.

82
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,763
So prompt with the rent payments.

83
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:22,482
But with such sparse business,

84
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,882
where does the money come from?

85
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:27,963
It's even newly minted.

86
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:33,002
If I hadn't intervened,

87
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:34,482
Zhang Er'gou

88
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:36,682
would've died by now, right?

89
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:54,203
Does anyone want

90
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:55,242
a rent reduction?

91
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:57,882
Mr. Xue.

92
00:06:58,442 --> 00:06:59,322
You mean it?

93
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,882
My family and I always keep our word.

94
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,403
But there's no free lunch from you.

95
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:07,242
What do you want in exchange?

96
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,882
We know your methods

97
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,203
all too well.

98
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:10,922
Nonsense.

99
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,603
This lady is trying

100
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:14,922
to make a living alone.

101
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,963
A nearby neighbor
is better than a distant family.

102
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:18,802
You will

103
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,963
keep her protected.

104
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:22,442
Keep watch on her shop

105
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:24,603
for any suspicious activity.

106
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:25,643
Keep me updated.

107
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,122
Useful leads get you

108
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:28,362
10% off on the rent

109
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:30,002
starting next month.

110
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:31,562
Alright.

111
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:32,322
I guarantee

112
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:33,802
not even a fly will get through.

113
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:36,843
Madam.

114
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:42,043
You'd better

115
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,002
not cause trouble on our turf.

116
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:45,922
If you're looking for trouble,

117
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:47,482
pack up and leave.

118
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,163
(Once I marry into your family,)

119
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,523
(the first person I kill)

120
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:54,922
(will be you.)

121
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:56,043
Mr. Xue.

122
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:57,362
Something happened.

123
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:02,760
(Xue Mansion)

124
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:09,352
(Xue Fugui, Lord Dingyuan)

125
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,643
His Majesty assigned you a bride?

126
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,163
His Majesty fell for the rumors

127
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,442
and believes that

128
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:23,163
we're hiding
the former Crown Prince Jia Xun.

129
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:26,643
He assigned me a new wife to investigate

130
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:28,002
and spy on us.

131
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:31,002
The former Crown Prince
disappeared years ago.

132
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:32,602
Why bring it up now?

133
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:36,003
His Majesty is gravely ill.

134
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:39,403
His only son is too young
to inherit the throne.

135
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:43,082
He must be recalling
his own usurpation of power

136
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,883
and fearing that Jia Xun
might return to claim the throne.

137
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:50,043
Such battles

138
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:52,163
always bring bloodshed.

139
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:55,962
Those in power
never consider the people's welfare.

140
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:58,283
With His Majesty's paranoia,

141
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:02,082
he'd rather slaughter innocents
than take risks.

142
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:06,363
Our family
stands on the brink of disaster.

143
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:10,962
Don't tell your grandmother yet.

144
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:15,883
If that new bride
makes any suspicious move...

145
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:16,744
I'll kill her.

146
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:19,643
Father,

147
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,483
I won't let anyone harm the Xue family.

148
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:26,363
You're ruthless toward outsiders.

149
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:30,523
Perhaps

150
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,363
it's good for you.

151
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:40,200
(Grand Tutor's Mansion)

152
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,802
This is madness.

153
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:47,442
They brought up the former Crown Prince

154
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:50,123
(Grand Tutor Zhou, Top Grand Tutor)
to force His Majesty's

155
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,403
abdication in his sickbed.

156
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,202
Let's kill them

157
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,403
as a warning to others.

158
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,722
Someone might have beaten you to it.

159
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:04,243
Chief Gu Qianfu of Jing'an Bureau.

160
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,523
Go to Lord Dingyuan's mansion.

161
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:08,488
Find the former Crown Prince.

162
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:10,003
And execute him

163
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,163
as a warning to others.

164
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,883
Wait. Don't kill him.

165
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:15,562
Bring him to me alive.

166
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,442
I will bring him to you.

167
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,403
You shall execute him

168
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,483
as a warning to others.

169
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:24,842
That's right.

170
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,883
Nowadays, His Majesty depends heavily

171
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:29,562
on the Xue Guardians

172
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,816
and forgets the Jing'an Bureau.

173
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,802
We must not lose to them.

174
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:35,403
Gu Qianfu.

175
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:38,043
As the backbone of the Jing'an Bureau,

176
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:40,363
you must outperform the Xue Guardians.

177
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:42,243
I'll kill them.

178
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:43,602
Get to work.

179
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:56,602
(His Majesty's schemes run deep.)

180
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,243
(You think)

181
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,842
(this can secure the throne
for your young son?)

182
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:04,043
(Once I identify
the real former Crown Prince,)

183
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:05,123
(this empire)

184
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:06,682
(will be mine.)

185
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:10,152
(Xue Mansion)

186
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:13,000
(Xue Street)

187
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,802
His Majesty
sends a new bride to our family.

188
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:31,682
(Liu Jiaoqian, Xue Dongfang's wife)
What should

189
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,896
Dongyang and I do if she bears children?

190
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:37,163
Besides, I heard
Ms. Wang is a military hero

191
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:38,283
who just returned

192
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:39,643
from the border.

193
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,123
Don't worry.

194
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:42,082
This wedding

195
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:43,082
may help Father

196
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,643
recover from illness.

197
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:27,922
Don't lift the veil yet.

198
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:29,283
The wedding isn't completed.

199
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:30,363
It's fine.

200
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,883
I care little for such formalities.

201
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:34,922
Mr. Xue.

202
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,562
The textile shop is closed.

203
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:37,363
The shopkeeper

204
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:38,763
said she's getting married.

205
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,523
I know.

206
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:40,922
She's right here.

207
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:44,802
So, you are Ms. Wang.

208
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:48,682
You're acquainted?

209
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:50,483
My father gave me a textile shop

210
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,082
to experience commoners' lives.

211
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:53,802
But I'm bad at this.

212
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:55,763
Please don't laugh at me.

213
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:58,123
From now on, we'll be family.

214
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,883
I could use your guidance
on many things, Mr. Xue.

215
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:03,403
He shouldn't be guiding you.

216
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:05,082
You'll be our stepmother.

217
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:06,922
It's you who should guide us.

218
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:07,922
Hexu, greet our

219
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:08,842
stepmother.

220
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,363
Bad news.

221
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,003
Something went wrong.

222
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,588
(Xue Dongyang,
First Son of the Xue Family)

223
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:20,363
Hurry.

224
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:21,483
Our lord is dying.

225
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:22,883
Father.

226
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:25,562
Father, are you okay?

227
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:28,682
Father.

228
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,322
(Who wanted to kill Lord Dingyuan?)

229
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,523
(Who did it?)

230
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:42,682
Father. Father.

231
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:43,802
What happened?

232
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,283
We just got married.

233
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:47,202
How am I supposed to live

234
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:50,483
if anything happens to my lord?

235
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,883
Dongyang, don't be scared.

236
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,043
Have some candy.

237
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:02,082
Tell me.

238
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:03,082
What did you see?

239
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,922
Jiaoqian wouldn't let me have candies.

240
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,523
So I came looking for candies.

241
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:12,802
I saw Father wrestling someone for fun.

242
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:14,722
I wanted to play, too.

243
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,202
Wrestling?

244
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:17,802
Father is ill.

245
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:18,722
How can he wrestle?

246
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:23,722
(Someone else was here?)

247
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:25,523
(How reckless.)

248
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:26,922
(The target is alerted.)

249
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,842
Dongyang didn't know Father

250
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,123
was under attack,

251
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,483
and he made a commotion.

252
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,043
The assassin got scared and escaped.

253
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,483
You saved Father.

254
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:39,722
You're so brave.

255
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,160
Let's report it.

256
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:50,403
Ms. Wang.

257
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:52,722
I'm afraid you won't

258
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,562
be able to marry my father.

259
00:14:59,043 --> 00:14:59,883
This is unfortunate.

260
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:00,922
We're in trouble

261
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:02,523
right on the day you came.

262
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:04,003
Why don't you stay

263
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:04,883
at home

264
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,442
in case you get implicated?

265
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:09,243
(Xue Hexu.)

266
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,483
(Second son of Xue Fugui.)

267
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:11,442
(Household manager.)

268
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:12,363
(Age 20.)

269
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:13,363
(Target No.1.)

270
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:15,483
(Xue Dongyang.)

271
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:16,842
(First son of Xue Fugui.)

272
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,043
(Husband of Liu Jiaoqian.)

273
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:18,922
(Age 23.)

274
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:19,842
(Target No.2.)

275
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:21,082
(Could be playing dumb.)

276
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:22,043
Pretty lady.

277
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:24,962
Dongyang, watch it.

278
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,123
(Xue Nuannuan.)

279
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:27,784
(Daughter of Xue Fugui.)

280
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,322
(Xue Nuannuan of Xue Family)
(Twin sister of Xue Hexu.)

281
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,202
(Age 20.)

282
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:31,602
(Could be under disguise.)

283
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:32,643
(Target No.3.)

284
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,962
(The former Crown Prince)

285
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:36,082
(could be anyone.)

286
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,322
(Kill them all
so that he can't get away.)

287
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:39,883
(Everyone is here.)

288
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:41,163
(No outsiders.)

289
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:43,442
(It's time for them to perish.)

290
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:45,842
(You can't wait)

291
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,722
(to make a move.)

292
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,272
(Grandma, Xue Mansion)

293
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,403
(She's in charge.)

294
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:58,562
Madam.

295
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,922
I am Lord Dingyuan's wife-to-be.

296
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:02,602
I consider myself his wife,

297
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,283
although we haven't held the wedding.

298
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:07,202
How can I walk away

299
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,202
when the lord is ill?

300
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,403
Good girl.

301
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:19,442
You're so devoted to my son.

302
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:20,682
Fine.

303
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:22,682
You sound devoted.

304
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:25,602
I heard that the Yuechuan River
is blessed by the river god.

305
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:27,763
We can offer you to the river god

306
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:30,403
to restore health to my father.

307
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:32,763
That's the least
you could do for my father.

308
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,408
Be sacrificed or leave.

309
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:35,163
Ms. Wang.

310
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:36,202
Your choice.

311
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,283
We are a family of military people.

312
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:41,123
How can we send her to die?

313
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:41,922
Hexu.

314
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,442
We can't break the law.

315
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:45,483
Mr. Xue.

316
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:47,442
Since I'm married

317
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,123
to your father,

318
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,123
I can't leave when my husband

319
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:53,483
is in trouble.

320
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:56,483
Good girl.

321
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:58,202
Greet your stepmother.

322
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:00,123
I suggested that

323
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:02,283
because Ms. Wang is devoted to Father.

324
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:03,523
Besides,

325
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:04,802
Father is badly ill,

326
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:05,642
and she is loyal.

327
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:06,963
My suggestion makes sense.

328
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:08,322
Hexu.

329
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:10,362
Why don't you sacrifice yourself?

330
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:12,243
She's married to your father.

331
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,043
That makes her our family.

332
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:18,162
We should look after each other.
That's what matters.

333
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:20,602
You're so against her.

334
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:22,243
Could it be...

335
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:33,683
You don't want her
to bear children and replace you

336
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:34,963
as the heir?

337
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,082
Don't be so petty.

338
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:44,322
(They look quite innocent.)

339
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:47,082
(But for His Majesty's reign,)

340
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,203
(they must all die.)

341
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:52,483
You treat me so kindly.

342
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:55,523
I don't know how to repay you.

343
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:00,122
Let me offer you tea

344
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:01,443
to express my gratitude.

345
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:22,642
Madam.

346
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,642
I'm thirsty. I'll drink first.

347
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:27,322
Thanks.

348
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:28,923
Ungrateful brat.

349
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:31,003
You shouldn't drink the tea

350
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:32,523
your stepmother offers to me.

351
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,043
Alright.

352
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:35,082
You're right.

353
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:36,162
I was wrong.

354
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,402
This tea serves as my apology.

355
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:39,963
I offer this to you.

356
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:40,602
Stepmother.

357
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:41,763
Please drink.

358
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,923
Thank you for marrying my father.

359
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:48,162
(This person is truly obstructive.)

360
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:51,602
You won't accept the tea.

361
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:52,923
Are you blaming me

362
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:54,162
for offending you?

363
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:58,402
Or perhaps,

364
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:00,723
you're behind what happened today?

365
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:15,882
Assassins!

366
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:17,802
(Jing'an Bureau's daggers.)

367
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:19,432
(Grand Tutor Zhou.)

368
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,243
(Why did he attack us?)

369
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,483
(How dare you betray His Majesty?)

370
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:24,203
Stay calm.

371
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,082
Follow our drills.

372
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:25,963
Hide first.

373
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,043
I'll secure the hall.

374
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:31,723
(They're so fast!)

375
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:03,240
(Gu Qianfu, Chief of Jing'an Bureau)

376
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:04,523
Gu Qianfu.

377
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:06,312
Feng Zuoren.

378
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,402
Long time no see.

379
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:10,963
You fools are courting death,

380
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,362
coming to my turf.

381
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:14,203
I've always thought

382
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,243
that you're a man.

383
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:17,443
Right.

384
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:20,243
Are you a guy or a girl?

385
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:21,602
How dare you!

386
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:23,963
Trying to kill me again?

387
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,203
I know what you did.

388
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:27,963
You were about to exterminate

389
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:30,443
the entire Xue family.

390
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,443
Bone-Eroding Powder.

391
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,243
It erodes the bone marrow.

392
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:41,683
You're doomed.

393
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,443
Thank goodness you're safe, Stepmother.

394
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:47,162
I was so worried.

395
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:48,483
You again?

396
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:49,802
I was worried about you.

397
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:51,923
What's that?

398
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,763
Petty trick.

399
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:05,523
I can kill your whole family.

400
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:06,683
Madam.

401
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:08,562
Why would a master like you

402
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:11,443
try to exterminate my entire family?

403
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,003
Name your price.

404
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:14,322
I can pay you.

405
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:16,203
Why do I want to kill you?

406
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:17,842
Are you really clueless?

407
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:19,802
I...

408
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,322
I'm totally clueless.

409
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,243
You came in broad daylight.

410
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,162
Everybody has seen your face.

411
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:29,003
If my family dies on the same day,

412
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:30,562
where can you

413
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:31,523
possibly hide?

414
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:33,243
The authorities will

415
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:34,283
arrest you.

416
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:35,763
Are you suicidal?

417
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:38,243
My single life

418
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:39,723
for your entire clan's lives.

419
00:21:40,043 --> 00:21:40,562
Fair trade.

420
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,763
Is there no one

421
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:46,683
you care about in this world?

422
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:56,122
Those I cared about

423
00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:58,602
all perished long ago.

424
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:05,923
Bone-Eroding Powder, huh?

425
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:07,642
Feng Zuoren.

426
00:22:22,003 --> 00:22:22,562
Gu Qianfu.

427
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:23,802
Got a death wish?

428
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:28,082
Not exactly.

429
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:29,763
Your palm strike

430
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,162
combined our inner energies

431
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:33,723
and unblocked my Ren and Du meridians.

432
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:34,723
The poison

433
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:36,882
has been forced out.

434
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:39,082
Even so,

435
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,122
your martial prowess is gone.

436
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:46,162
My inner energy.

437
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,082
I put Dispersing Powder on my chest.

438
00:22:56,963 --> 00:22:58,162
You got poisoned

439
00:22:58,683 --> 00:22:59,842
when you struck me.

440
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:01,483
Shameless.

441
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:05,003
Everyone knows about
the former Crown Prince.

442
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:07,402
You barely married into the family

443
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:09,283
and can't wait to hold a funeral.

444
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:11,362
Isn't this inappropriate?

445
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,963
Why don't you work with me to find

446
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:16,602
the former Crown Prince?

447
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:19,923
Empty promises sound sweet.

448
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:21,283
You simply

449
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,003
want to steal credit from us.

450
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:46,283
What's that smell?

451
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:52,283
