1
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,020
=Heavenly Secrets Bureau=

2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,860
There's a building over there.

4
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:55,780
Let's go.

5
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:03,651
Is this where they produce gunpowder?

6
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:08,771
Watch out! Trap!

7
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:20,980
Your Highness!

8
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,006
Gu Yuqing.

9
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:24,660
You have two hours
to find the Imperial Seal,

10
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,900
or Li Lingyue dies.

11
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:28,664
They captured Her Highness.

12
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:29,882
What do we do?

13
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:32,304
The priority is
to find the Imperial Seal.

14
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:34,242
Yes, we must find the Imperial Seal.

15
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,180
Where do we start?

16
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,460
My father mentioned

17
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,169
the Imperial Seal is hidden

18
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:42,788
in the Imperial Palace. From one
to nine, don't enter from the center.

19
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,606
Xiao Ye.

20
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:43,931
Yes?

21
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:45,042
Try to think.

22
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:47,660
Is there any palace building
with the word "center"?

23
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,260
Center?

24
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,993
Center?

25
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,309
Zhongdu Court.

26
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,100
It literally has
the word "center" in it.

27
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:56,144
But it's been abandoned for years.

28
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,282
No one lives there.

29
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,233
And it's too huge to search.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,433
No time. Let's move.

31
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:01,529
Is it there?

32
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,360
(Zhongdu Court)

33
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:11,700
Hey.

34
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,335
Nothing on my side.

35
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:14,260
You?

36
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:15,980
Nothing either.

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,189
Told you.

38
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,629
Zhongdu Court is huge.

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,980
How do we even search for it?

40
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,220
We need to narrow it down.

41
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,375
Narrow it down?

42
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,491
Right.

43
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,926
Zhongdu Court has nine courtyards,

44
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:31,909
each with a well.

45
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,900
They're lined up from south to north
in ascending order.

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,491
Let's check the wells.

47
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:37,246
Let's go.

48
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:38,091
Sure. Let's go.

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,380
Over there.

50
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,620
Mr. Gu,

51
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,940
Zhongdu Court has been abandoned
for years.

52
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,309
The well must be dried up.

53
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,548
Let's leave.

54
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:55,460
Open it.

55
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,580
I'll do it.

56
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,224
I'm not doubting you.

57
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,269
But seriously?

58
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,269
Who would hide the Imperial Seal here?

59
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,331
Take a look for yourself.

60
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,220
Hm?

61
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,389
Looks like there's a box.

62
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,509
Pull it up.

63
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,660
Yes.

64
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,829
Is this the Imperial Seal?

65
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,709
Let's go.

66
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,860
Hurry.

67
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,780
What does it say?

68
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,717
Deliver the Imperial Seal
to Dasheng Alley,

69
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:06,980
Nanhua West Lane,

70
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,526
in exchange for Li Lingyue.

71
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,740
Master,

72
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,780
Gu Yuqing found the Imperial Seal.

73
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,766
Once we get it,

74
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,633
blow them up.

75
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,100
No survivors.

76
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,720
(To Bless the People)

77
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,020
Ha ha ha!

78
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,189
You're still alive.

79
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,549
How would I dare die

80
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,220
before you do?

81
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,349
Where's Her Highness?

82
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,500
Where's the Imperial Seal?

83
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,700
Hold on.

84
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,149
We exchange at the same time.

85
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,980
If you try anything,

86
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,020
I'll destroy the Imperial Seal
right now.

87
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,269
Ha ha ha.

88
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,420
No problem.

89
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,660
Follow me.

90
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:17,417
Your Highness.

91
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:19,566
Don't come in. There's a trap!

92
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,900
Sun,

93
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:29,300
can't you try something new?

94
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,113
Hmph! You ruined my plan in Leicheng.

95
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:37,349
This time,

96
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,349
we'll settle

97
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,860
both new and old scores.

98
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,469
Your Highness,

99
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,549
I saw the Ninth Princess and Guard Xiao
take a stranger

100
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,540
to the abandoned well at Zhongdu Court.

101
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,620
That place has been deserted for years.

102
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,460
What were they doing there?

103
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:04,629
They seemed

104
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,780
to be searching for something.

105
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,300
Twin Fish brings disaster to the nation.

106
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,708
Mr. Gu eliminates traitors.

107
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,500
Today,

108
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:27,526
I'll see to it
that you die without a burial.

109
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:28,460
Bah!

110
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,669
You evil.

111
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,980
You'll end up in hell one day.

112
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,900
Hmph!

113
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:33,420
Hey.

114
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,575
Untie me.

115
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:35,535
Hey.

116
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,400
Understood.

117
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,100
We're done for.

118
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,580
We're all going to die here!

119
00:06:58,123 --> 00:06:59,540
Cui,

120
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,269
we promised to grow old together.

121
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,340
But I'm leaving first.

122
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,460
It's my fault.

123
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,109
I was being thoughtless.

124
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,900
Mr. Gu,

125
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,820
I don't mean to blame you.

126
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,309
But you're usually clever

127
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,060
and composed.

128
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,100
How come whenever
it's about the Ninth Princess,

129
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,006
you just lose your head

130
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,491
and act recklessly?

131
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:21,486
It's my fault.

132
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,020
I dragged you all into this.

133
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,922
Oh no.

134
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:30,353
At least you two have each other.

135
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:33,815
I'm going to die alone.

136
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,655
Cui, I miss you.

137
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,389
I can't accept this.

138
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,242
Cui!

139
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:48,780
Untie them.

140
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,660
Uncle.

141
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,562
Uncle. We couldn't have made it
without you.

142
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,895
Are you all right, Your Highness?

143
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,220
Was my performance great just now?

144
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,144
It was...

145
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,126
Not at all.

146
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:06,584
Little Diviner,

147
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,340
was it you who asked Uncle
to come save us?

148
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,100
His Highness predicted this in advance.
I wouldn't dare take the credit.

149
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,002
Based on the 31 house deeds
you found from Li Sen,

150
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,486
I sent men to investigate each one

151
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:16,829
and eliminate them one by one,

152
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,180
and that led us here.

153
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:21,220
Were any of the other houses
hiding gunpowder

154
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,660
or anything suspicious?

155
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,820
No.

156
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,340
No?

157
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,980
A hidden door?

158
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,620
So the missing weapons
from the mine in Nandian

159
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,277
have been secretly stored
in the capital.

160
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,437
Could it be

161
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,540
that Twin Fish is planning
a rebellion here?

162
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,959
(Imperial Study)

163
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,931
Your Majesty,

164
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,509
Gu Yuqing uncovered the gunpowder scheme
in the capital.

165
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,237
He also got to the bottom
of the weapons case in Nandian

166
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:39,877
and the salt farm case in Leicheng.

167
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,460
You're Gu Yuqing?

168
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:46,300
Tell me everything you've found.

169
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,629
From Nandian to Leicheng,

170
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,900
we discovered

171
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,020
that tens of thousands of weapons

172
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,762
and thousands dan of salt disappeared.

173
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,060
If my guess is right,

174
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:59,700
those weapons and salt

175
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,220
have already fallen into the hands
of Twin Fish.

176
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,500
What do you believe their intention is?

177
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,060
All signs point to one thing.

178
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,420
Twin Fish

179
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,220
is staging a rebellion.

180
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:21,300
Based on our investigation,

181
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,140
Twin Fish

182
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:25,060
has a complicated identity.

183
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

184
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,500
Mother.

185
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:32,691
Yue,

186
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,815
you girl.

187
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,180
You just got back and ran off again.

188
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,999
You should've stayed
to keep your father company.

189
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,140
Mother,

190
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:39,349
don't scold me now.

191
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,864
I just did something big.

192
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:42,260
I saved the entire capital.

193
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,600
My father said in the letter

194
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,709
that he found that Noble Consort Chen
is Twin Fish and that she's plotting treason.

195
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,269
Look at your proud face.

196
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,126
- (My father was framed)
- I'd be grateful

197
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,680
- (for exposing her in the palace)
- if you'd stop causing trouble.

198
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,002
(and die with grievance.)
