00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,179
City lord.

4
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:03,779
This is bad.

5
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,459
The ghost soldiers are here.

6
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,676
Are these the ghost soldiers
you talked about?

7
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:09,325
Yes.

8
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,139
I shall greet them.

9
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:14,396
Be careful.

10
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,819
(The weapons from Nandian are here.)

11
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:03,939
(What exactly are
Li Sen and Lord City Sun)

12
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,579
(plotting?)

13
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,099
(The Creation of the Works of Nature?)

14
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:13,868
(Salt Production Method.)

15
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:15,459
(Thunderfire Ignition Technique.)

16
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,979
(I see now.)

17
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,828
Why is the salt

18
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,419
still not finished?

19
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,899
Prince Qifeng will be here any moment.

20
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:26,516
If you ruin my plans,

21
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:27,583
I'll have your heads.

22
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,219
I'll hurry them at once.

23
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,352
Faster.

24
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,699
Hurry up.

25
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,974
Stop dawdling. Faster.

26
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:56,627
City lord, Prince Qifeng is here.

27
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,379
All right.

28
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:41,432
See anything strange?

29
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,699
Yes.

30
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:48,059
It's a disguise.

31
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,268
Since you see through it,
there's no need to be afraid.

32
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:52,619
Then I'm not.

33
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:54,214
Their acting is terrible.

34
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:56,223
Enough talk. Go help them.

35
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,539
Watch me.

36
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:18,467
Ghost soldier, is it?

37
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:19,619
Ghost soldier.

38
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:20,588
You're quite good

39
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:21,770
at scaring people.

40
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,445
Ouch.

41
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,188
Trying to scare me?

42
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,699
- Xiao Ye. That's enough.
- Stop it.

43
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:25,805
Stop hitting me.

44
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,730
I can't, Your Highness.

45
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:30,214
People like him must be taught a lesson,

46
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,699
or he'll never learn.

47
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:32,594
I'll beat you to death.

48
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:33,645
- I'll beat you.
- Stop it.

49
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:34,454
I said stop it.

50
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:36,285
Stop hitting me. Please.

51
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:39,699
Scram.

52
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,480
We need to get to the salt farm
as quickly as possible.

53
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:44,979
He may be in danger.

54
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:52,979
Who's the "he" Uncle is talking about?

55
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:56,508
Work harder.

56
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:57,619
Faster.

57
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,779
Faster.

58
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,099
Don't dawdle.

59
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,828
Who are you?

60
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,659
How dare you barge into my warehouse?

61
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,183
Why are you off to

62
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,627
in such a hurry?

63
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:31,579
Thank you for stopping him,
Prince Qifeng.

64
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,859
This man posed as one of my men

65
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,214
and snuck into the salt farm.

66
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:37,121
His intention is unknown.

67
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:39,068
So I accidentally

68
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,339
did you a favor, City Lord Sun.

69
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,019
Your build looks like someone I know.

70
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:49,139
Does Your Highness know him?

71
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,539
More than know him.

72
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,108
He's my enemy.

73
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:55,339
I want to tear him limb from limb.

74
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,788
Then allow me to do it for you.

75
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,139
No need. I wish to do this myself.

76
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,379
Shouldn't you remove your mask now?

77
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:08,828
If I have to do it,

78
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,139
I'll take it off your corpse.

79
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,899
Nobody move.

80
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,539
Arrest City Lord Sun.

81
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:32,365
I won't trouble Prince Qifeng with that.

82
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:33,259
I'll take it off

83
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:34,694
myself.

84
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,565
Mr. Gu?

85
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,134
Mr. Gu is still alive, Your Highness.

86
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:41,681
Look.

87
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,134
I told you he has great fortune.

88
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:44,481
He wouldn't die so easily.

89
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,139
Thank you, Your Highness.

90
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:54,299
Don't mention it.

91
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:05,739
I thought I'd never see you again.

92
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,299
I thought you were dead.

93
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,863
The fire was so intense.
How did you survive?

94
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:11,468
Hey.

95
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:12,699
Little tyke.

96
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,299
You can talk to him later.

97
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,099
We'll take later.

98
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,579
Gu Yuqing, what did you find?

99
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,419
Qifeng,

100
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:32,979
what are you doing here?

101
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:34,868
I came to Leicheng

102
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:37,139
to buy salt from City Lord Sun.

103
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,419
Buy salt?

104
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:43,028
Are you aware
that this salt came from an illegal farm

105
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:45,259
that forced innocent people
into hard labor?

106
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,908
I'm the city lord of Leicheng.

107
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:50,210
I always care for my people.

108
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,154
How could you make
that false accusation?

109
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:55,754
- He arrested us.
- He arrested us and forced us to work like slaves.

110
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,619
- He exploited us.
- Beat him to death.

111
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,894
Hear that?

112
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,192
They're the proof.

113
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,579
I gave them protection.

114
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:10,659
What's wrong with having them
do some labor?

115
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,779
You used the name of the God of Thunder,

116
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,139
staged ghostly illusions,

117
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:16,059
seized the salt farm,

118
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,819
took innocent lives,
and lined your pockets for your own gain.

119
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,614
Your crime is unforgivable.

120
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,739
Ha ha ha!

121
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,579
If I'm doomed either way,

122
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:28,619
you can slander me however you want.

123
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,112
You're still denying it
even at death's door.

124
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,290
City Lord Sun said

125
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,148
that if I didn't follow what he said,

126
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,588
he'd send my entire family

127
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:37,899
to work in the salt farm.

128
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,805
I examined the bodies

129
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,899
of Batu and Jia Si.

130
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:43,747
There was no soot found

131
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,499
in their mouths or noses.

132
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:46,854
In other words,

133
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,281
they died

134
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,743
before the fire.

135
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:52,405
And the killer was you.

136
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,148
- Beat him to death.
- Beat him to death.

137
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:11,988
Beat him to death.

138
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,539
Take him to prison.

139
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:15,099
I'll interrogate him.

140
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:17,739
This is Huasheng's internal affair.

141
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:19,539
It has nothing to do with me.

142
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,339
I came only to buy salt.

143
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,360
There are still doubts
I haven't cleared up.

144
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:36,352
I was following

145
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,250
what my father told me all along.

146
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,699
I first went to Nandian

147
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:41,939
and discovered that Li Sen
had seized an iron mine

148
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,103
to forge weapons,

149
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:47,339
each marked with a twin fish emblem.

150
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:51,139
And one of those weapon carts
ended up here in Leicheng.

151
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:52,828
City Lord Sun of Leicheng

152
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:55,419
uses the same killing method as Li Sen.

153
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:56,859
As for the salt farm,

154
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:00,779
it has produced at least 8,000 dan of salt
over the past four years.

155
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:03,121
One dan equals 120 jin.

156
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,779
That's a total of 900,000 jin.

157
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:09,179
Enough to supply Leicheng for centuries.

158
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,179
900,000 jin

159
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,979
is worth at least
40,000 taels of silver.

160
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,259
They forge illegal weapons

161
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:18,059
and hoard silver.

162
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:19,499
What are they planning?

163
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,939
All of this was recorded
in my father's journal.

164
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,480
Could it be that Shanyao
had been here before?

165
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,600
(Twin Fish smuggles state salt)
Your father's doing magic again.

166
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,860
(and embezzles the national treasury.)

167
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,800
(According to the prediction
in the Tortoise Shell Divine Script,)

168
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
(the capital is in danger.)
Twin Fish? Smuggling state salt?

169
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,360
(The answer lies in the seismoscope.)
Twin fish again.

170
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:47,908
Before I came here,

171
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,979
His Majesty asked me
to deliver an edict.

172
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:55,339
The Princess must return to the palace
within three days and marry Prince Qifeng.

173
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:00,028
I'm not going back.

174
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,539
His Majesty also said

175
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:02,788
that if you refused,

176
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,463
you were to be brought back
by force if necessary.

177
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,063
I said I won't marry him.

178
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:09,743
I...

179
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,383
This little tyke.
