=Episode 23=

3
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,090
Father.

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,307
(Spirit tablet, Late Mother Bai Wanshu)

5
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:57,550
All this time,
I followed the guidance in your notes

6
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,950
and tracked down the twin fish.

7
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,078
Now that their forces
have been wiped out,

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,670
Father,

9
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,950
you can have peace now.

10
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,190
I didn't let you down.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,847
Father,

12
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:10,598
what are you drawing?

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,470
I'm mapping out the stars.

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,330
What's the point
of all these little dots?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,110
Stargazing.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,399
It helps us see the world,

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,799
and understand human affairs,

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,150
and even the human heart.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,127
Every star in the sky

20
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:30,359
mirrors something in our world.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,879
The rise and fall of nations,

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,470
the good and evil in people,

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,550
are all hidden among these stars.

24
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:37,821
Father,

25
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:38,990
are you saying

26
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:40,710
these stars in the sky

27
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:43,790
can actually tell us
what's going to happen?

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,950
The stars are like a mirror.

29
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,110
They reflect everything in the world.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,759
Look.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,959
That's the Venus star.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,200
If Venus enters the Dipper constellation,
within five days,

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,670
there will definitely be rain.

34
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:00,194
That's so cool.

35
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:01,056
I want to learn too.

36
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:03,319
I want to hear the stars talk to me.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,790
If you want to hear the stars,

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,990
you have to study
astronomy and geography.

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,839
And more importantly, you must know

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,159
right from wrong

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,310
and stand for justice.

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,910
But most of all,
you need a kind and upright heart.

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,336
Justice?

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,518
Kindness?

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,479
You came to see

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,870
how pathetic a traitor
from the last dynasty

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,710
has become.

48
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:43,519
Is hatred really that important?

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,030
I hate them.

50
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,190
They took everything from me.

51
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,670
My home, my family!

52
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,599
But do you even realize

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,870
how many people

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,270
your plan has hurt?

55
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,403
Nandian,

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,590
Leicheng,

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,950
and so many innocent people.

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,790
And also...

59
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:04,190
my birth mother.

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,154
What did she ever do wrong?

61
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:08,230
I just wanted to take back
what was mine!

62
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,579
Is that wrong?

63
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,038
Yes!

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,110
You never truly had
any of it to begin with.

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,692
You've let hatred blind you.

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,830
You've lost yourself.

67
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,936
You nearly destroyed yourself too.

68
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,439
They did it.

69
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
They're the ones who ruined me!

70
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,634
They ruined my whole life!

71
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:28,870
So now you're going
to ruin your daughter's life too?

72
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,318
Noble Consort Chen!

73
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,430
Let go of your hatred.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,350
Only by letting go

75
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,150
can you truly be free.

76
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:48,745
Only then can you
find your true self again.

77
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,230
Yue.

78
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,110
I'm...

79
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,550
sorry.

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,559
In the end,

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,590
it all amounts to nothing.

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,670
If there is a next life,

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,750
I just want to be an ordinary person.

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,230
Don't you think the sound
of cicadas in the trees is soothing?

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,150
Boring.

86
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,990
You know,

87
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:06,510
for most of their lives,

88
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:08,430
cicadas live underground.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,150
In darkness,

90
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:11,314
dampness,

91
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:12,150
and loneliness.

92
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:14,959
But they work hard
to break through the soil.

93
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,687
After a long wait,

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,599
they finally become cicadas

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,790
to see the sunlight.

96
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:22,781
We're just like cicadas.

97
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:25,550
After all the pain
and hardship we go through,

98
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,910
it all

99
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:29,545
makes us stronger.

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,310
What are you trying to say?

101
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,670
I know you're really upset.

102
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,030
But everything will be alright.

103
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:52,230
If you feel like crying,

104
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:53,670
just let it out.

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,399
There is another thing
that has been troubling me.

106
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,781
I can't stop worrying about it.

107
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,790
Brother,

108
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,190
do speak freely.

109
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,510
As you know,

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,159
Yuncang State

111
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,670
has always been eyeing Huasheng.

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,599
They're planning

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,265
to take over our country.

114
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,865
I arranged the marriage
between Yue and Prince Qifeng

115
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,079
mainly

116
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,030
to buy us some time.

117
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,990
I understand.

118
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,056
The Ministry of War

119
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,750
just sent in a secret report.

120
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,381
Take a look.

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,750
Tens of thousands of weapons

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,990
and salt bricks from Nandian

123
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,630
have been smuggled to Yuncang State.

124
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:20,350
That's right.

125
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,710
I suspect

126
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,270
the one orchestrating all this

127
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,990
is none other than the Western Lord
the late emperor appointed.

128
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,510
The Western Lord?

129
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:32,630
Brother,

130
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:33,910
I understand.

131
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,439
I'll head to the West

132
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,790
to investigate this.

133
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:37,834
Good.

134
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,199
But the journey

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,510
is long and dangerous.

136
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,376
There are threats all along the way.

137
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:43,132
I...

138
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:45,190
I just can't help worrying about you.

139
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:48,283
I have an idea.

140
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,910
Let Gu Yuqing

141
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,670
go with you.

142
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,510
He is sharp-minded,

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,599
and he's skilled

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,070
in the art of divination.

145
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,830
With him by your side,

146
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,870
I'll feel a lot more at ease.

147
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:01,750
Very well.

148
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,865
With his help,

149
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,670
I'll be twice as effective.

150
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,519
There's no time to waste.

151
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,430
Brother,

152
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,350
I'll take my leave now.

153
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:25,572
Father has already issued the decree

154
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:27,474
to cancel our engagement.

155
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,856
I know.

156
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,972
I came to say goodbye.

157
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:33,959
I came

158
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,123
because I wanted to say I'm sorry.

159
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,170
Is this about what happened in Leicheng

160
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,705
or the time you framed Gu Yuqing?

161
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,750
I let jealousy get the better of me.

162
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,390
I didn't consider how you felt.

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,510
Forget it.

164
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:57,830
It's all in the past.

165
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,167
Honestly, in my heart,

166
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,670
I always thought of you as a friend.

167
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,710
You used to look out for me as a kid.

168
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,638
Back then,

169
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,870
we were truly happy.

170
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,932
It's a shame.

171
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:17,150
We can't go back to that anymore,

172
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:18,470
can we?

173
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,310
Gu Yuqing is the kind

174
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,359
who is stubborn

175
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,430
and rigid.

176
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:29,190
But whenever there is danger,

177
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:31,270
he is the one
who risks his life for you.

178
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,070
That is a quality

179
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,710
I can't compare with.

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,603
Gu Yuqing,

181
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:55,079
do you know why I came to see you today?

182
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,692
If I have to guess,

183
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:59,430
it's about the missing
weapons and salt, isn't it?

184
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:03,501
His Majesty was right about you.

185
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,034
You catch on quick.

186
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:06,354
The situation's even

187
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,159
more complicated
than in Nandian and Leicheng.

188
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,630
And a lot more dangerous.

189
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,030
Will you go with me beyond
Yanmen Pass to uncover the truth?

190
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,310
Do you really think I'd say no?

191
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,990
Little Diviner.

192
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,639
Hey!

193
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,870
Little Diviner!

194
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:28,119
You two are so sneaky.

195
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,901
Heading off to the West
without inviting me to tag along?

196
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:31,847
Exactly!

197
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,639
I knew this crazy girl would show up.

198
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,527
This journey

199
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:35,314
is long

200
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:36,385
and full of danger.

201
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,545
Are you sure you want to come?

202
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:38,772
Of course I do!

203
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:40,421
Since when have I ever been scared?

204
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,492
Besides,

205
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,625
with you around, Little Diviner,

206
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,230
what do I have to be afraid of?

207
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:46,510
Xiao Ye.

208
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:46,839
Yes?

209
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,070
Where's your dear Cui?

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,270
She's already waiting
at the Yanmen outpost ahead.

211
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,887
So let's stop chatting

212
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:52,887
and get going.

213
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,159
Looks like Mr. Xiao

214
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,096
is about to get lucky.

215
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:55,607
Hey now.

216
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,670
Your Highness saw through me.

217
00:10:58,142 --> 00:11:00,199
After all, I already held her hand.

218
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,150
Having a baby is only a matter of time.

219
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:02,963
Mr. Gu,

220
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:05,323
do pick an auspicious day

221
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:06,376
for me this time

222
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,139
so I can propose to Cui.

223
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,590
I know one thing.

224
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:11,769
As long as two people
are happy together,

225
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,074
every day is auspicious, isn't it?

226
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,825
Yeah.

227
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,163
That's not helpful at all.

228
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,959
Mr. Gu!

229
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,999
- Ignore her.
- Xiao Ye!

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,532
Have I spoiled you too much?

231
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:22,990
Mr. Gu, just pick me a good date!

232
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,370
(The End)
