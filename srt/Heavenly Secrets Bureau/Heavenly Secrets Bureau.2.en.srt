00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,570
Stop it, Your Highness.

4
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,730
Behave.

5
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,650
It's a ghost!

6
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,890
Xiao Ye!

7
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,330
It's a ghost!

8
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,021
You all see that, right?

9
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:13,530
I wasn't seeing things.

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,530
Come back.

11
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,770
Wait for me.

12
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,010
That was terrifying.

13
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,290
Absolutely terrifying.

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,090
That must be

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,579
Lady Gu's spirit

16
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,130
Xiaojuzi talked about.

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,130
Let's leave this place.

18
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,650
Waiter.

19
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,779
Coming. We have three guests here.

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,600
Would you like just a meal
or to stay the night?

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,979
Both.

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,579
We need three proper rooms.

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,179
Also, serve all your signature dishes.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,690
Righty-o. Please sit.

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,259
Waiter.

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,659
Why was your inn closed

27
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,379
last night?

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,859
We knocked on the door for so long.

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,779
Didn't you hear it?

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,399
Exactly.

31
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,219
Yesterday was the third day
of the third month.

32
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,610
A special day.

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,900
We apologize for our poor hospitality.
Please forgive us.

34
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,139
Because your inn was closed,

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,019
I had to lodge in an abandoned temple
and met Lady Gu there

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,419
in the middle of the night.

37
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,170
Exactly.

38
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,570
You run into Lady Gu?

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,539
Well,

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,699
she had her hair down,

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,579
crawling on the ground.

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,579
Is that Lady Gu?

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,979
Ah! Help!

44
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,730
Oh no.

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,930
Hurry and leave.

46
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,970
Run.

47
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:33,059
Quick.

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,859
Gentlemen, please go to other inns.

49
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,779
My inn is too small

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,379
to accommodate you.

51
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,210
Uh...

52
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,619
Did I say something wrong?

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,570
Why's everyone

54
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,019
gone?

55
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,810
You blabber too much.

56
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,370
Young master,

57
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,739
you see,

58
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,379
with Lady Gu that spirit here,

59
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,610
I suggest

60
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,250
we return to the palace.

61
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,770
If you want to leave, go yourself.

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,370
It's not easy for me to come back here.

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,330
He's right.

64
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,859
This place is too dangerous.

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,090
We should leave at once.

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,939
Right.

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,299
Ninth Princess,

68
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,419
you're of noble birth.

69
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,170
It's best to leave quickly.

70
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,770
Hmm?

71
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,410
How do you know who I am?

72
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,530
I made a divination.

73
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,899
You really think we'd fall for your lie?

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,400
Come clean. What's your intention
in approaching Her Highness?

75
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,099
Who are you?

76
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,699
Who are you?

77
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,170
Who I am doesn't matter.

78
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,819
But why would the Ninth Princess

79
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,090
leave behind a life of luxury
in the palace

80
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,859
only to suffer in an abandoned temple
in Nandian?

81
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,139
It baffles me.

82
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,130
How dare you?

83
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,850
What I do is none of your business.

84
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,970
Hmph!

85
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,250
Put your sword away.

86
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,539
Oh, right. Our order.

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,930
I'll go check on it.

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,390
(Capital)

89
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,050
Gu Yuqing has departed for Nandian.

90
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,450
Oh?

91
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,450
The seed Gu Shanyao planted
has finally begun to sprout.

92
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,730
Has he found anything?

93
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,250
Pardon me. I haven't found out yet.

94
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,539
Gu Yuqing is cautious.

95
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,170
He's not someone to be underestimated.

96
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,810
Go to Nandian at once.

97
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,250
Keep close watch
on Gu Yuqing's every move.

98
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,010
Remember. Do not alert him.

99
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,370
See what Gu Shanyao left behind for him.

100
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,930
Yes.

101
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,459
Your Highness.

102
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,690
What again?

103
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,530
I'd like to discuss something with you.

104
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,450
Speak.

105
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,850
Even if I have to sleep on the streets
tonight,

106
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,810
I'd never stay in that abandoned temple.

107
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,379
It's either you stay in the temple

108
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,859
or return to the palace.

109
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,779
Your choice.

110
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,499
- Then I choose the palace.
- Very well. That means the temple it is.

111
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,090
- I said I want to go back...
- Wait.

112
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,410
Say,

113
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,450
you saved my life.

114
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,650
Did you do that to make money from me?

115
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,499
Of course. I earned it with my skills.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,290
Oh.

117
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,770
You're quite frank.

118
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,970
Take this.

119
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,490
Do you know what this silver is for?

120
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,739
This is hush money.

121
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,459
Hmm.

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,330
If anyone inquires
about the Ninth Princess,

123
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,370
whether it should be said

124
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,459
or not, keep your mouth shut.

125
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,410
Hmm.

126
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,899
If not, I won't go easy on you.

127
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,850
Hmm.

128
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,450
Don't worry.

129
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,939
People in the martial arts world call
Princess Lingyue the poison expert.

130
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,930
How could a humble man like me
possibly know her?

131
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,610
Now that's more like it.

132
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,739
Tell me.

133
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,050
What do people say

134
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,010
about me?

135
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,099
They say

136
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,170
Princess Lingyue

137
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,370
is good at performing poison.

138
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,659
Her skills are flawless

139
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,939
beyond compare.

140
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,330
It's impossible to guard against.

141
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,250
Though she was taught by
the poison master, Mr. Wan,

142
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,490
she surpassed her master in every way.

143
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,250
None in the martial arts world
does not know of her name.

144
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,250
I must say those rumors are quite right.

145
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,850
Go on.

146
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,890
Silver.

147
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,170
Cheapskate. Take it.

148
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,499
They also say

149
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,610
Princess Lingyue

150
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,899
is so cruel

151
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,821
and wicked that everyone...

152
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:13,663
Stop.

153
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,690
Slander.

154
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,690
That's slander.

155
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,490
Right.

156
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,890
Wasted my three taels of silver.

157
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,130
Give that to me.

158
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,010
Your Highness,

159
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,810
maybe

160
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,330
we should return to the palace.

161
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,179
Say another word,

162
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,650
and I'll poison you.

163
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,690
Give it some more thought.

164
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,570
Your Highness.

165
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,819
Shut up. I have no strength
to poison you anymore.

166
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,859
Gentlemen,

167
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,170
we meet again.

168
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,770
Please come in.

169
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,730
Coming.

170
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,410
Here you go.

171
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,890
Please enjoy.

172
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,619
By the way,

173
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,099
I think we saw

174
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,779
Lady Gu you spoke of

175
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,730
last night.

176
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,570
Do you know

177
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,530
what happens to those

178
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,290
who see Lady Gu?

179
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,890
What happens?

180
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,490
The first to see her was a little girl.

181
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,379
On the third day of the third month,
spring flowers bloom.

182
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,339
My mother returns home.

183
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,859
On the third day of the third month,

184
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,730
spring flowers bloom.

185
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,490
From that day on,

186
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,699
she lost her mind.

187
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,050
She claimed

188
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,330
that there were many butterflies
biting her.

189
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,939
So the villagers performed a ritual
to send Lady Gu's spirit away.

190
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,410
The spirit child from a thousand Miles
brings a soul forth.

191
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,019
Folks,

192
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,690
the spirit of Lady Gu
has been sealed away.

193
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,490
Burn the coffin.

194
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,770
Her corpse was burned to ashes
in the fire.

195
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,770
Everyone believed

196
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,570
she would no longer bring harm.

197
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,090
But on the third day of the third month
of the following year.

198
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,019
I'm not drunk.

199
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,210
I can still drink.

200
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,890
I want to drink more.

201
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,730
This is ridiculous!

202
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,819
Two more people were harmed
in just two years.

203
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,770
What did the county magistrate
and those runners do?

204
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,330
The magistrate said

205
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,610
Lady Gu was a ghost from the underworld,

206
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,850
and living men couldn't deal with her.

207
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,547
So he brought in a shaman
to perform a ritual.

208
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:46,395
Mr. Li, please help us.

209
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:47,968
- Please help us.
- Right!

210
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,179
- Please help us.
- Help us.

211
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,979
I've summoned a powerful shaman

212
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,850
to banish the ghost
with Soul-sending Art

213
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,939
to rid us of the poison Gu's harm

214
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,739
and bring peace to the people.

215
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,419
Excellent!

216
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,210
To ensure peace,

217
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,939
the townsfolk pooled money

218
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,259
to hold a ritual at the end of
the second month of the following year.

219
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,059
That looks like Lady Gu's wedding dress.

220
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,480
Right.

221
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,939
It's said that the Send-sending Art

222
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,610
requires the deceased's
most treasured possession

223
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,659
to guide their spirit away.

224
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,730
Now I call upon all divines.

225
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,410
Retrieve

226
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,419
the spirit of Xiu, Lady Gu,

227
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,650
and return it to her body.

228
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,130
Heaven's gate opens.

229
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,690
Earth's gate opens.

230
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,770
Divine lords,

231
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,930
send the soul.

232
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,810
The shaman said

233
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,179
the art could guide Lady Gu's spirit

234
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,690
to the underworld.

235
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,290
He merely performed trickery.

236
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,170
All the villagers saw
with their own eyes

237
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,410
that Lady Gu's spirit

238
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,650
rose into the sky.

239
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,250
Everyone breathed a sigh of relief

240
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,130
and tore down the talismans.

241
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,059
Lady Gu was gone at last.

242
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,779
The talisman

243
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,890
can be removed now.

244
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,330
Everyone thought
she would never return again.

245
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,859
But on the third day of the third month
in the third year, she came back.

246
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,530
And this time, the victim

247
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,130
was a peddler.
