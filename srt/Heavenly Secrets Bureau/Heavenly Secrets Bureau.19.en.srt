00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,190
Chen Huaiyu.

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,310
Chen Huaiyu.

5
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,790
Chen Huaiyu.

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,710
Chen Huaiyu.

7
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,910
The well...

8
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,950
It's so cold.

9
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,270
So cold.

10
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,870
Chen Huaiyu.

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,830
Chen Huaiyu.

12
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:45,670
Give me back my child.

13
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,350
Give me back my child.

14
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,870
Give me back my child.

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,990
Give me back my child.

16
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:54,736
Ah!

17
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:56,199
A ghost!

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,150
Someone!

19
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:58,354
There's a ghost!

20
00:01:58,355 --> 00:01:59,390
Someone!

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,785
There's a ghost!

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,034
Your Highness,

23
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,230
what happened?

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,874
Nanny.

25
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,959
Outside.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,399
There's a ghost outside.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,323
Did you see it?

28
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,621
Did you see it?

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,199
No.

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,670
Nothing out there.

31
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,559
Your Highness,

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,110
you must've been wrong.

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,510
It was her.

34
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:18,479
She's back.

35
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,679
She's back.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,790
She came for me.

37
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:22,910
She came to take her child.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,439
Your Highness, based on what I've found,

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,879
there's only one palace maid
from the former dynasty

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,590
still alive.

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,390
Only one?

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,972
Where is she?

43
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:40,510
We're still searching.

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,310
Why did you summon me
in the middle of the night?

45
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:52,376
There's a ghost in my place.

46
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,190
There's a ghost in my place.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,390
It's her.

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,221
It's really her.

49
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,256
She's back.

50
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:58,576
She wants her child back.

51
00:02:58,577 --> 00:02:59,990
She wants her child back.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,470
That's impossible.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,759
Didn't you

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,945
throw her into the well yourself?

55
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:06,047
It's her.

56
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:07,687
It's really her.

57
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:09,470
She's come to take her child.

58
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,950
She wants her child.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,465
She wants her child.

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,219
Did you hear?

61
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,319
There was a haunting
at Noble Consort Chen's last night.

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,745
What?

63
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:20,727
Really?

64
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,350
Haunting?

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,079
Where?

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,327
Your Highness,

67
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:28,030
at Noble Consort Chen's court.

68
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,910
Mother.

69
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,319
You may leave now.

70
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,230
Yes, Your Highness.

71
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,399
Father was just asking for me.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,959
Let's go.

73
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,630
Let's go visit Mother.

74
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:40,630
Your Highness,

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,834
um...

76
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:44,265
do I have to go?

77
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,794
I just got back.

78
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,523
I know what you're thinking about.

79
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,159
Go ahead.

80
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,750
Go find your dear Cui.

81
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:51,732
I'm off.

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,710
Qifeng,

83
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,470
next month is your wedding with Yue.

84
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,510
I'll entrust her

85
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,750
to you.

86
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,238
I hope you'll cherish her

87
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,790
and keep her safe.

88
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:10,256
If she suffers even a little,

89
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:11,310
I will never

90
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,341
forgive you.

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,999
This marriage alliance

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,710
concerns both our states.

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,341
All the rites must be observed.

94
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:21,280
Please rest assured,
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

95
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,590
I'll do everything in my power
to make Yue happy.

96
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,150
Even if it costs my life,
I'll protect her well.

97
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:30,270
My vow is witnessed by Heaven and Earth.

98
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,038
Mother.

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,105
- Father, Mother.
- Yue.

100
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,030
Did you ask for me?

101
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:40,910
Yue, you came at the perfect time.

102
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:43,990
We were discussing your marriage
with Qifeng.

103
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,767
Mother,

104
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,790
I want to stay with you and Father.

105
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:51,390
I don't want to get married.

106
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,159
Yue.

107
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,359
Mother, let's not talk about this.

108
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,425
Just now,

109
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:57,967
I heard that there's been a haunting
in your palace lately.

110
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,496
What happened?

111
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,838
Haunting?

112
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,932
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

113
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,381
Maybe I was seeing things

114
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,550
out of exhaustion.

115
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,914
Dear, don't worry.

116
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:14,750
I'll summon a priest
to have a look for you.

117
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,883
Priest?

118
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,110
Oh, right, Father.

119
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,639
Gu Yuqing

120
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,870
is also known as Little Diviner.

121
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:23,794
He's well-versed in astronomy, geography,

122
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,439
and the arts of divination.

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,599
He's really amazing.

124
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,630
Why not have him take a look
at Mother's place?

125
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:34,870
I'll leave this to you, then.

126
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:36,616
Yes, Father.

127
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:38,487
I'll go find Gu Yuqing now.

128
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:39,550
Lingyue.

129
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:42,647
I've had your wedding gown
sent to your residence.

130
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:44,825
Try it on and see if it fits.

131
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,190
Tck.

132
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:52,870
Master,

133
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:55,470
this is the Imperial Seal
Gu Yuqing found.

134
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,083
With it,

135
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,319
we can rally the old forces of Xia.

136
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,532
Now

137
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,016
we have weapons, funding, and troops.

138
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,590
Everything is ready,

139
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:11,510
except for one last thing.

140
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,679
The restoration of Xia

141
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,403
is within reach.

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,350
Ha ha ha!

143
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,599
You're dismissed.

144
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,718
Yes, Master.

145
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,790
Don't come here again.

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,047
This wasn't my fault.

147
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:06,559
Little Diviner,

148
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,421
take a look around.

149
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:09,016
Is there anything wrong here?

150
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,674
Her Highness's chamber faces south

151
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,012
and receives ample sunlight.
It's full of yang energy.

152
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,443
Supposedly,

153
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,545
it shouldn't attract any evil spirits.

154
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:28,816
How could it be haunted?

155
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:30,861
Nanny Rong,

156
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:33,730
what exactly happened here?

157
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,719
When I was sleeping outside last night,

158
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,679
I heard Her Highness
shouting about a ghost,

159
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,470
so I rushed in and checked.

160
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,670
Her Highness said she saw a ghost.

161
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,630
The ghost was asking her for a child.

162
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,799
She's back.

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,972
She's back.

164
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:47,879
She came for me.

165
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,999
She came to take her child.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,270
She came to take her child.

167
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,670
I don't quite understand
what it means either.

168
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,981
Asking for her child?

169
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,790
Where's my mother right now?

170
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,239
Her Highness took incense and offerings
to the well

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,470
this morning.

172
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:05,367
The well?

173
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:06,167
Which well?

174
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:07,279
Take us there.

175
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,767
Yes. Your Highness, please follow me.

176
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,830
Let's go.

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,279
Looks like Her Highness just left.

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,590
She was burning incense beside the well.

179
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,630
This?

180
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:32,816
Isn't this the dry well
where we found the Imperial Seal?

181
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,554
It's all rundown.

182
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,999
What's there to pay respect?

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,870
Xiao Ye.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,559
Yes?

185
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,830
Go down the well and take a look.
See what's inside.

186
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,790
Your Highness,

187
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,159
do you hear yourself?

188
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,230
This is the only new robe I have.

189
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:45,649
I...

190
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,118
Are you going down yourself,

191
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,679
or shall I push you?

192
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,230
Don't do that, Your Highness.

193
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,230
New robe, you know?

194
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,972
Don't do that to me.

195
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,630
Ugh.

196
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,190
Your Highness, we've found the maid.

197
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,234
Ever since I left the former dynasty,

198
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,510
I've never done anything bad.

199
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,292
You served in the palace back then?

200
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:18,950
Yes.

201
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,670
Have you seen this before?

202
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:28,590
No...

203
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:29,519
No, I haven't.

204
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,190
Look closely.

205
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,252
I think I've seen it somewhere.

206
00:09:36,204 --> 00:09:37,696
I remember now.

207
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,390
Now I get it.

208
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,390
Nothing good ever happens
when I'm with you.

209
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,070
First was Lady Gu's ghost,

210
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,030
then ghost soldiers chasing us,

211
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,363
and now that we're finally back
to the palace,

212
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,959
there's a haunting again.

213
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,279
Ah.

214
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,292
Hey.

215
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,643
Hmm?

216
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:57,550
You've survived ghosts

217
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:58,834
all the way.

218
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:01,096
You've become stronger.

219
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:03,994
That's something to brag about to Cui.

220
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,127
True.

221
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:06,807
She did praise me.

222
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,790
What did you find?

223
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:11,598
When she died,

224
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,839
she wasn't even twenty.

225
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,230
Her pelvis had expanded.

226
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,314
She must've just given birth.

227
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:19,634
From the color of her bones,

228
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,474
she was poisoned with a chronic toxin.

229
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:24,310
But

230
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,430
poison wasn't what killed her.

231
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:28,892
How did she die?

232
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,110
She was brutally beaten
before her death.

233
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:37,510
Multiple fractures all over her body.

234
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:39,781
She was most likely beaten to death,

235
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:42,061
then thrown into this well.

236
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,572
So, why would Mother come here

237
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,550
to pay respects?

238
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,999
(Could it be that Noble Consort Chen)

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,074
(had connections to this woman?)
