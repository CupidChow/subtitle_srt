2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,178
Wipe them all out...

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,230
Brother!

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,799
Xiao...

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,870
Xiao Ye?

7
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,270
I told you,

8
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,190
this show was going
to be worth watching.

9
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:27,790
Brother.

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,270
The so-called
Twin Fish Iron Army of yours

11
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,910
has already been taken down
by my palace guards.

12
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,790
The twin fish

13
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:44,314
isn't one person.

14
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:46,630
It's actually

15
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:48,670
two people.

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,510
My dear,

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,190
do you still remember Yuru?

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,198
Yuru?

19
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,790
Who is that?

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,670
Nanny Rong.

21
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:11,247
Let me

22
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:12,910
jog your memory, Your Highness.

23
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,287
If you're slow with your chores,

24
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,861
you'll have to finish
washing these clothes before dark,

25
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:19,710
or there's no food for you!

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,207
Alright.

27
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,567
Alright, Eunuch.

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,079
- (Yuru and I entered the palace the same year.)
- Let me help you.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,719
(We were like sisters.)

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,670
Give it here.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,230
(Yuru had a kind heart.)

32
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:35,270
- (We quickly became close friends.)
- No way you'll finish all this in time.

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,990
(Then one day,)

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,590
(Yuru told me)

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,639
(she was pregnant.)

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,790
Rong.

37
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:46,474
I'm pregnant.

38
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:47,670
What?

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,350
You're not joking, are you?

40
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,670
If anyone in the palace finds out,
it'll be a disaster.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,150
I'll go get you something
to help with the nausea.

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,950
But when I came back,

43
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:09,870
I saw the eunuchs had taken Yuru away.

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,270
What happened

45
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:22,078
to Yurou afterward?

46
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,732
I bribed one of the head eunuchs.

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,070
He told me

48
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,610
Yuru gave birth to a daughter.

49
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,612
How dare you?

50
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,119
This is utterly absurd!

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,470
And does that scare you?

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,852
Nanny Rong,

53
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:39,030
keep going.

54
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:40,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,194
Please, don't take my baby.

56
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:46,150
No!

57
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,310
Don't touch me!

58
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:48,650
No!

59
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,470
My baby!

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,310
No!

61
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,221
Give me back my child!

62
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,550
Throw her into the well!

63
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,514
Just stay out of trouble.

64
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,318
Let's go!

65
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,603
That baby girl...

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,110
Who was she?

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,710
That baby girl

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,687
was you, Your Highness.

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,950
Mother...

70
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:17,932
Mother...

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,030
This can't be true.

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,910
It's not true, is it?

73
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,110
Tell them.

74
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,687
Tell them the truth!

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,630
Father.

76
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,221
What is going on?

77
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:34,119
Tell them.

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,239
Say it's not true.

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,661
Say it isn't true.

80
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:37,990
When I was young,

81
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,590
(I made mistakes.)

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,941
(The late emperor often punished me)

83
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:43,754
(and made me reflect in silence.)

84
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:46,594
(Later on,)

85
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,550
(there was a young maid)

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,670
(who often brought me food.)

87
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,461
(Not long after,)

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,070
(she was carrying my child.)

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,950
But I never thought

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,470
she would just vanish like that.

91
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:11,230
All these years, I've been trying
to find out what happened to her.

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,790
Everything I've said is the truth.

93
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,550
I have another task for you.

94
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,070
Starting today,

95
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,830
you will serve Noble Consort Chen.

96
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,510
Chen Huaiyu...

97
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:26,230
I will never forgive you.

98
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,976
Chen Huaiyu.

99
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,483
The well is so cold.

100
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:33,834
Give me back my child.

101
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:34,656
Guards!

102
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:35,239
Guards!

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,127
There's a ghost!

104
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,336
Help!

105
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:38,430
There's a ghost!

106
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,790
Everything I had Nanny Rong do

107
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,790
was to

108
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,950
get them to expose themselves.

109
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:08,030
Chen Huaiyu,

110
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,354
you and your brother,

111
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:12,510
Vice Minister Chen,

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,990
along with your followers,

113
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:17,030
slaughtered the people of Huasheng,

114
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,861
seized the salt farms for yourselves,

115
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,159
forged weapons,

116
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,470
and plotted a coup.

117
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,830
These are unforgivable crimes.

118
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:26,910
But considering

119
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:29,150
you raised Yue all these years,

120
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:30,230
I shall

121
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:32,750
spare your life.

122
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,030
Vice Minister Chen

123
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,150
has committed heinous crimes.

124
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:41,265
Take him to the Meridian Gate
for execution

125
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,030
to set an example.

126
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:51,830
Impossible.

127
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:53,910
It can't be.

128
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,465
I don't believe it.

129
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,750
I don't believe it.

130
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,879
This isn't true.

131
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,150
Yue!

132
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:03,252
Xiao Ye,

133
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:04,590
watch over Her Highness.

134
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,430
Yes.

135
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,585
So much has just happened.

136
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:15,830
She's still

137
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,150
having trouble accepting it all.

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,030
She needs time to calm down.

139
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:21,941
Your Majesty,

140
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,230
there's one more thing.

141
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,519
In the well
where Yuru's body was hidden,

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,239
we found something else.

143
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,238
The Imperial Seal
from the former dynasty.

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,572
If I'm not mistaken,

145
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:33,310
you put it there, right?

146
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,070
Gu Shanyao's son

147
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:41,390
really is sharp.

148
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:43,203
So how did Your Majesty

149
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:44,230
get the seal?

150
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,070
Four years ago,

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,799
someone already

152
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,230
handed the Imperial Seal over to me.

153
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,310
Four years ago?

154
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,830
Who found it?

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,310
Gu Shanyao.

156
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,047
Gu Shanyao found
the Imperial Seal four years ago

157
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,430
and gave it to me.

158
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,230
Minister Gu,

159
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:09,701
I can't let you risk your life.

160
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:11,030
Your Majesty,

161
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:13,159
for the peace and stability of Huasheng,

162
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,710
for the safety of the people,

163
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:17,630
I'd give my life without hesitation.

164
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,790
Brother Shanyao

165
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:25,105
risked his own life for all of us.

166
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,630
He led by example.

167
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:29,541
Truly admirable.

168
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,710
Issue the decree.

169
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:39,350
(Imperial Edict)
(By the mandate of the Emperor,)

170
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:43,310
(Gu Shanyao, Director
of the Heavenly Secrets Bureau,)

171
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,519
(Tablet of Late father Gu Shanyao)
(secured the peace of the people,)

172
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,154
(offered brilliant strategy,)

173
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,879
(resolved great peril,)

174
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,750
(and gave his life for the nation.)

175
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:51,630
(Now,)

176
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,919
(the honor
of the Gu family shall be restored.)

177
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,159
(Their property will be returned.)

178
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,919
(Gu Shanyao shall be granted)

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,759
(the title of Lord Anning.)

180
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,679
(The imperial historians
will record his deeds)

181
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,030
(and pass them down
to future generations.)

182
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,705
(Imperial Guards, heed the order.)

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,590
(Wipe out the Twin Fish
rebel forces and their allies.)

184
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,910
(They are to be punished for treason.)
