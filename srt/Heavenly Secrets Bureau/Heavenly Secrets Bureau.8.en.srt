00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,940
(Leicheng)

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,550
A ghost!

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,830
Where are we going?

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,670
Little diviner.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,310
Little diviner!

8
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,359
You're walking on in silence without
saying a word, where are you taking us?

9
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,550
Exactly.

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,599
Before we entered the mine,

11
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,950
twelve carts full
of weapons had just left.

12
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:57,323
In other words,

13
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,510
based on the tracks,

14
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:01,061
they went towards the southeastern fork.

15
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,550
But the wheel marks
have long since vanished.

16
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:05,341
Doesn't that mean we've lost the trail?

17
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:06,092
Mm.

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,079
The executioner said his neighbour
drives for the mule team.

19
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,225
To be safe,

20
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:11,279
we'll ask that driver first

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,470
where the goods were taken.

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,399
Aye.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,870
Slow down, will you?

24
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:16,550
Wait for me.

25
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:27,830
What do you want?

26
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,779
Three days ago, did you transport a load

27
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,261
from the Tianling Mountain mine?

28
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:36,025
Don't kill me.

29
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:37,701
Don't kill me, I'm the only one left.

30
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,021
I'll never go back again.

31
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:40,630
I swear I'll never go back!

32
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:42,159
This guy...

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,834
He's completely unhinged.

34
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:47,670
Don't be afraid. Li Sen is dead.

35
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,430
No one's coming after you.

36
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:50,647
Just stay calm

37
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:51,536
and tell us

38
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,096
where did that cart of goods

39
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:54,158
end up?

40
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:55,727
Did it go to Leicheng?

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,550
That day,

42
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,798
Li Sen came to the mule team

43
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:03,936
and ordered us to deliver
a shipment to Leicheng overnight.

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,150
You were transporting weapons.

45
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,470
Yes.

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,532
Three hundred long sabers

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,270
and two hundred longswords.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,238
We thought the job was done
once we delivered

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,150
the load to Leicheng.

50
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:23,163
But we never expected

51
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:25,923
the ones receiving the shipment
in Leicheng weren't human.

52
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:27,390
They were ghost soldiers.

53
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:33,399
They looked like
they had crawled out of graves.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,510
Princess, this is getting
spookier and spookier.

55
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:37,799
Listen to me,

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,279
let's not go to Leicheng.

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,581
Let's just return to the palace.

58
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:42,710
Stay out of this and go home, please!

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,190
(What kind of trap
has the twin fish set in Leicheng?)

60
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:49,976
(This must be investigated.)

61
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:53,083
Then we're going to Leicheng?

62
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,110
Princess,

63
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,056
I was just saying...

64
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:56,150
Silence.

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,510
Let's go.

66
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,007
That's

67
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,123
the Underworld...

68
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,950
Ghost soldiers!

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,470
Oh no.

70
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:15,110
I was your father's closest friend.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,750
Take this whistle.

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,190
I've raised hundreds of carrier pigeons.

73
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,150
No matter where you are in the world,

74
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:27,950
just blow this whistle,

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,710
and my pigeons will come to you.

76
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,336
If you ever need help,

77
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,572
write me a letter.

78
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,047
I'll definitely help you.

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,083
(Li Sen's arm, the incense burner,)

80
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:42,861
(and the weapons in the mine
all bear the twin fish symbol.)

81
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,630
(My father's notes
also mention the twin fish.)

82
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,440
(Though the Nandian Gu case is resolved,)

83
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,839
(tens of thousands of missing weapons
remain unaccounted for.)

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,920
(The meaning behind
the twin fish is still a mystery.)

85
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,999
(Requesting assistance
in continuing the investigation.)

86
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,350
My lord, I've completed
the investigation in Leicheng.

87
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,390
Report.

88
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,310
Leicheng Peninsula is indeed,
as Master Gu said,

89
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:07,096
one of our dynasty's
three major sea salt fields.

90
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,843
Four years ago,
a typhoon triggered a tsunami,

91
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,567
which flooded the salt fields.

92
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:14,280
According to official records,
the fields were sealed off afterward.

93
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,314
They've been abandoned ever since.

94
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,132
Gu Yuqing told me

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,350
that Leicheng
is linked to the twin fish.

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,150
He implied that this symbol

97
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,390
is also tied to Gu Shanyao's death.

98
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,520
Are you sure no one in the martial world
has seen this symbol?

99
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,910
I sent men to every major sect
in the martial world.

100
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,701
No one's seen it.

101
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,990
If Gu Shanyao's death

102
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:37,670
really is connected to the twin fish,

103
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,710
then what does it represent?

104
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:43,705
And why is it in Leicheng?

105
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:46,639
During the investigation,
I discovered something strange.

106
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,510
Speak.

107
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:51,061
During the previous emperor's reign,
he issued a strange decree.

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,127
No one in the palace
was allowed to eat fish.

109
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,430
Even items or patterns bearing
fish imagery were forbidden.

110
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,760
Those who defied it
were to be executed immediately.

111
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:00,310
Twin fish...

112
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,763
The Fish Ban Decree.

113
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,630
Could Father have known
of the twin fish all along?

114
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,030
I must enter the palace.

115
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,798
(This girl...)

116
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:30,523
(She actually)

117
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,874
(look better asleep than awake.)

118
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:41,656
(What's happening to me?)

119
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,936
(Why is my heart beating so fast?)

120
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:47,510
Princess.

121
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,323
Princess.

122
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:53,496
Wake up.

123
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,581
I just fell asleep.

124
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:05,741
Don't get the wrong idea.

125
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,354
I didn't plan to do anything to you.

126
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:08,327
You...

127
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:08,745
Just now...

128
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,096
It was all me...

129
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,159
Princess...

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,519
I...

131
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,310
You what?

132
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,727
I only gave you a kiss.

133
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,800
- Why are you so flustered?
- I'm not flustered.

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,163
If you're not, then why say that?

135
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:34,270
- It's just that I've never...
- Never what?

136
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,150
Never kissed a girl before?

137
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:39,470
Ah...

138
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,630
Don't worry.
I'll take responsibility for you.

139
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:49,679
I'd better read a book.

140
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,790
My book.

141
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,170
(The Poison Manual)

142
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,190
Eunuch Gui, let me ask you something.

143
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,790
Do you remember
the late emperor's decree

144
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,310
banning fish?

145
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,750
I

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,150
remember

147
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,279
Liu Botong, the first Chief Astrologer
of the Heavenly Secrets Bureau,

148
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,990
predicted that the twin fish
would bring disaster to the nation.

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,550
That enraged the late emperor,

150
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,430
so he issued the Fish Ban Decree.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,390
I wonder

152
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,110
if this national calamity
from the twin fish is connected to all this.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,830
Who's there?

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,670
Prince Qifeng.

155
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,670
Qifeng?

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,150
Why is it you?

157
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,479
If I didn't come now,

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,030
my future princess would be stolen away.

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,399
What nonsense are you talking about?

160
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,870
Who's your princess?

161
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,159
Next month,

162
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,799
you'll return with me for the wedding,

163
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,252
and after we're married,

164
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,763
you'll be my princess.

165
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm not going back.

166
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:19,100
It's our wedding soon, you should
at least try on your wedding dress.

167
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,599
See if it fits.

168
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,550
Pah.

169
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,359
Who wants to be your princess?

170
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,585
Lingyue.

171
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:25,470
Don't touch me.

172
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,790
Little Diviner, don't listen to him.

173
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:29,074
Let's go.

174
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,470
Thunder Lord above,
bless us with safety.

175
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:57,599
- Thunder Lord above, bless us with safety.
- Thunder Lord above, bless us with safety.

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,052
Thunder God, protect us.

177
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:00,425
Keep us safe.

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,959
Thunder God bless us.

179
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,007
- Keep us safe.
- Thunder God bless us.

180
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,790
Bless us with peace.

181
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:39,910
What are these people

182
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,798
all doing?

183
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:45,070
Today is the ninth of April, one of
the Four Inauspicious Days in legend.

184
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,280
The day when the gates
of the underworld open wide.

185
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:54,843
Young master,

186
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,470
what hexagram did you divine?

187
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,087
Water-Thunder 'Tun' Hexagram.

188
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:00,327
It's a dangerous sign.

189
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:01,701
Here you go again.

190
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:04,240
Every time you cast a divination,
it's always something ominous.

191
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,994
I don't believe in such nonsense.

192
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:08,270
Princess, mind what you say.

193
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,385
I told you, avoid speaking of bad omens.

194
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,456
I feel like Leicheng
is even more cursed than Nandian.

195
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,910
- Let's quickly...
- Shut up.

196
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,279
Thunder Lord above,

197
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,412
protect all living beings.

198
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:35,199
Drive away evil spirits.

199
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,821
Watch over our Leicheng.

200
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,674
Come back.

201
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:43,287
Come back...

202
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:44,558
Mate.

203
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,470
Who are those people?

204
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,967
What are they doing?

205
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,350
Leicheng has seen all sorts
of strange happenings lately.

206
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,461
The common folk are living in fear.

207
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,078
They're all praying to the Thunder Lord.

208
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:57,141
Those people are his descendants.

209
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,070
They're inviting a Thunder God statue
to drive away evil.

210
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:03,412
Young master!

211
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:07,090
Come here.

212
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,510
Bunch of superstitious nonsense.

213
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,600
There's no such thing
as a Thunder Lord in this world.
