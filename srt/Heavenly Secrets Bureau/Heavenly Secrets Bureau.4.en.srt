2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,449
What are you trying to do?

4
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,840
You're all infected with Gu poison.

5
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,129
You don't have much time left.

6
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,320
You need a ritual to expel the poison.

7
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,920
I'd like to see

8
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,640
what tricks they're playing.

9
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,480
Fine. We'll go with you.

10
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,800
Lead the way.

11
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,080
Go.

12
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,480
Taishang Laojun
has commanded me to capture spirits.

13
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,449
What god would defy me?

14
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,160
What ghost would dare stand in my way?

15
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,200
So theatrical.

16
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,560
What nonsense.

17
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,569
Wearing a shaman mask,

18
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,360
chanting Taoist spells,

19
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,209
offering Buddhist statues,

20
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,080
and dressed in Bon robes.

21
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,329
This great shaman

22
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,080
has truly mastered
all the teachings under heaven.

23
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,609
Oh dear.

24
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,489
Young master, you're truly one of us.

25
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,520
Pah!

26
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,049
You two are just charlatans.

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,560
One's even worse than the other.

28
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,000
Here's the deal.

29
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,609
As long as you honestly tell us

30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,249
why you've come to Nandian,

31
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,489
and what your connection is
with Lady Gu, Xiu.

32
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,249
After all,
you're infected with Gu poison.

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,489
You're not long for this world.

34
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,000
If you cooperate,

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,440
once you're dead,

36
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,569
I'll hold a ritual for you,

37
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,200
and guide your souls

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,080
to be free from the torments of hell.

39
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,720
You...

40
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,960
You've offended the spirits.

41
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,840
You've unleashed evil upon the world.

42
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,080
The gods won't forgive you.

43
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,120
Still pretending
to summon spirits in front of me?

44
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,120
You've got some nerve.

45
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,649
You...

46
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,129
Such defiance!

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,000
Seize them!

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,800
Xiao!

49
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,089
You...

50
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,480
Just you wait!

51
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,769
Fellow Taoist,

52
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,920
farewell.

53
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,569
Xiao Ye.

54
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,129
Mm?

55
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,080
Go check on
the drunkard and the peddler.

56
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,049
The two of us

57
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,240
will visit the girl's home.

58
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,160
What's this?

59
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,920
Incense. It's called Butterfly Lure.

60
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,320
It's coming.

61
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,649
This butterfly
is called Ghostface Butterfly.

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,040
It loves flower nectar.

63
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,680
It's not poisonous itself,

64
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,320
but the fine hairs on its wings
contain powerful toxins.

65
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,120
These toxins
can cause hallucinations at best,

66
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,400
or severe
neurological disorders at worst.

67
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,280
I see.

68
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,600
Looks like the girl
wasn't cursed with Gu.

69
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,160
She was poisoned
by contact with the butterfly.

70
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,489
That's what caused her hysteria.

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,240
Mm.

72
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,160
The Ghostface Butterfly's toxin

73
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,200
has already reached her heart meridian.

74
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,889
I'll need to use acupuncture

75
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,760
to draw the poison out of her.

76
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,880
Mum.

77
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,560
I dreamt
of so many Ghostface Butterflies.

78
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,920
They wanted to eat me.

79
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,409
The toxins in her body

80
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,760
have already
been expelled with silver needles.

81
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,040
Make sure she doesn't come into contact
with Ghostface Butterflies again.

82
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,840
Who told you the child
was cursed by butterfly Gu?

83
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,409
The great shaman
said she saw Lady Gu's spirit,

84
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,840
and it was she who cast the curse.

85
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,040
Who exactly

86
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,200
made up this rumor about Lady Gu?

87
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,440
And Zhong Dagao's death...

88
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,680
What connection is there
between the two events?

89
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,320
I've been to both the drunkard's
and the peddler's homes.

90
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,400
There's something they have in common.

91
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,320
Come with me.

92
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,200
The master says you must capture

93
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,840
Ninth Princess and Gu Yuqing.

94
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,329
One is an expert in poison,

95
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,129
the other is a master of Qinggong.

96
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,560
And they're protected
by a skilled bodyguard.

97
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,080
This mission won't be easy.

98
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,000
If they don't die,

99
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,320
then you will.

100
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,760
Don't forget how you survived,

101
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,960
or how you became deputy magistrate.

102
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,280
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,840
This is the place.

104
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,600
Both of them

105
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,200
drank water from this well

106
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,480
before they saw Lady Gu's ghost.

107
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,040
Why was this well sealed?

108
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,120
Now that's the right question.

109
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,880
According to them,

110
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,680
the water in this well

111
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,040
was also cursed by Lady Gu.

112
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,840
Who would dare drink it, then?

113
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,680
There's something wrong with this water.

114
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,480
Xiao Ye.

115
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,240
Yeah?

116
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,880
Where are you going?

117
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,449
Follow her.

118
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,049
Where are we going?

119
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,200
Come with me.

120
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,120
She's back!

121
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,840
She's back!

122
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,960
Lady Gu, Xiu!

123
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,120
Run!

124
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,200
Run!

125
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,800
Lady Gu, Xiu is back!

126
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,960
Run!

127
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,800
Run!

128
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,720
He's delirious.

129
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,960
We won't get anything from him.

130
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,440
We're here.

131
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,520
This is the peddler's home.

132
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,520
According to my investigation,

133
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,920
ever since the peddler
saw Lady Gu's ghost that night,

134
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,569
he locked himself in the house

135
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,200
and never stepped outside again.

136
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,320
The records in the archive room say

137
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,880
that ever since the night
he encountered Lady Gu,

138
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,440
he was scared out of his wits

139
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,120
and ended up like this.

140
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,120
There's something strange
about this case.

141
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,080
Earlier today, in the well water,

142
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,800
I found rotting plant residue.

143
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,080
Inside it,

144
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,569
was clearly Strychnine

145
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,800
and Datura flowers.

146
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,960
Strychnine is also known as Maqianzi.

147
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,560
It can cause headaches,
palpitations, and seizures.

148
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,760
Datura is also called Jimsonweed.

149
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,720
It causes hallucinations.

150
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,640
So I believe

151
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,320
the peddler and the drunkard

152
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,880
didn't really see Lady Gu's ghost.

153
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,880
They hallucinated
after drinking the water

154
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,680
from that well.

155
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,329
It wasn't a hallucination.

156
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,249
It wasn't!

157
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,320
I really saw Lady Gu, Xiu!

158
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,960
She was right in front of me.

159
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,400
That wasn't an illusion.

160
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,769
She was a real person!

161
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,480
Are you sure
it was really her that you saw?

162
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,080
It was her.

163
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,640
She had a shadow!

164
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,680
Could it be

165
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,400
that Lady Gu is still alive?

166
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,809
(Grave of the late Xiu)

167
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,920
This is where Lady Gu, Xiu is buried.

168
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,240
Princess.

169
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,360
There's a ghost.
