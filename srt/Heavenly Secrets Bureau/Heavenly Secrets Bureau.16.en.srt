00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,340
Master.

4
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:58,740
The forces at Leicheng and Nandian
have all been wiped out.

5
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,100
What have you done?

6
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:02,620
Useless fools.

7
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,940
Where is Han Da?

8
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:07,893
Mr. Han got me out of prison.

9
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,442
He said
he had something important to do.

10
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:11,773
Perhaps

11
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,900
he went to trace the whereabouts
of the Imperial Seal.

12
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:20,500
Keep a close eye on their every move.

13
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,940
Yes, Master.

14
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,308
Here it is.

15
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,260
This should be it.

16
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,060
The twin fish...

17
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,180
The Imperial Seal is placed...

18
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,060
Brat.

19
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,460
You played me, huh?

20
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,980
That's right.

21
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,380
Ever since Nandian,

22
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,220
I've been suspicious of you.

23
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:36,837
I'll tell you.

24
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,149
Young Master!

25
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,180
Young Master!

26
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,326
Mr. Da?

27
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:50,824
Get out of the way.

28
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,260
You're the one who killed Li Sen

29
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:56,740
and ambushed me, right?

30
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,340
You all work for the twin fish.

31
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,340
You're sharp, I'll give you that.

32
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,660
Having laid low
in my household all these years,

33
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,880
why didn't you just kill me?

34
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,220
Since we've been
master and servant for years,

35
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,615
I'll let you die knowing the truth.

36
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:16,820
I was the bodyguard of Mr. Bai Yang,
the Crown Prince of the former dynasty.

37
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,060
If Li hadn't usurped the throne,

38
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,940
we wouldn't have had to hide our identities
and plot in secret for years.

39
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:28,660
What does the former dynasty
have to do with my family?

40
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,060
To restore Xia,

41
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,740
we must first find the Imperial Seal.

42
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,220
Only by retrieving it

43
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,660
can we rally the scattered Xia loyalists
among the people.

44
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,740
And only your father knew
where it was hidden.

45
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:44,949
So I had to

46
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,540
infiltrate your household,

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,980
waiting for the chance
to locate the seal.

48
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:54,700
Well,

49
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,024
how did my father die?

50
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:01,277
Gu Shanyao left the capital for Nandian
without permission.

51
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,749
He discovered weapons from Nandian

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,140
were being shipped
to the twin fish's Iron Army's main base.

53
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,560
We played a little trick

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,375
and had the Heavenly Secrets Bureau
calculate the wrong auspicious date.

55
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,220
Thus, the imperial rites were delayed.

56
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,140
Gu Shanyao was charged
with serious dereliction of duty.

57
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,869
When he returned to the capital,

58
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,820
His Majesty became infuriated

59
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,540
and ordered the guards to flog him.

60
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,300
We instructed the guards
to show no mercy.

61
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,140
So it was you

62
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,060
who beat my father to death.

63
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:38,140
That's right.

64
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,220
We couldn't let him ruin
the Crown Prince's restoration plan.

65
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:44,100
So he had to die.

66
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,944
How cruel.

67
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,220
You're all so cruel!

68
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,940
Now

69
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,540
I'll send you
to reunite with your family.

70
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,180
Who exactly is the twin fish?

71
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,620
You'll end up just like your father.

72
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,220
No one can stop me.

73
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,740
Xia shall be revived!

74
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:25,180
Master.

75
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,949
Mr. Han killed himself
after falling into Gu Yuqing's trap.

76
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,006
It's time for the Iron Army
to fight back.

77
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,069
No way.

78
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,017
The Imperial Seal
is not yet to be found.

79
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,673
The Iron Army must not act

80
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,020
until everything is set to stone.

81
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,300
I've been tailing Mr. Han all along.

82
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,615
Before he died,
he saw a letter written by Gu Shanyao.

83
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:47,709
The letter mentioned
the location of the Imperial Seal.

84
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,309
Gu Shanyao's letter
mentioned the Imperial Seal?

85
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,380
Yes.

86
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,420
The letter is in Gu Yuqing's hands.

87
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,109
That boy's skilled in qinggong.

88
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,860
I've tried to catch him several times,
but he slipped away each time.

89
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,460
Understood.

90
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:03,140
How's the gunpowder preparation
coming along?

91
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:05,469
It's still in the making.

92
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:05,989
Good.

93
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,020
Once the gunpowder is ready,

94
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:11,282
we'll fire the first shot
of the twin fish's Iron Army.

95
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,572
My father wrote in his letter
that the late Emperor had

96
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,900
the first director
of the Heavenly Secrets Bureau, Liu Botong,

97
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,640
predict the national fortune
of Huasheng State.

98
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:35,397
After the calculation,
he wrote the Tortoise Shell Divine Script.

99
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:37,340
I've heard of this.

100
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,900
It enraged the late Emperor.

101
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,780
That's why he issued this ban on fish.

102
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,260
Are you saying

103
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,949
the late Emperor

104
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,460
knew something was wrong back then?

105
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,991
In the thirtieth year of its reign,
crimson clouds obscure the sun.

106
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,300
Heaven and earth collapse.

107
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,820
Huasheng State suffers defeat.

108
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,500
What does that mean?

109
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,620
The thirtieth year refers to the thirtieth year
since the founding of our dynasty,

110
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:00,731
which is next year.

111
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,993
Crimson clouds obscure the sun.
That's an omen in the skies.

112
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:06,664
Just like this current red sky.

113
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,500
Crimson clouds obscure the sun...

114
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,400
His Majesty once asked
the Heavenly Secrets Bureau about it.

115
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,060
He was told this phenomenon
foretells the fall of a nation.

116
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,140
Auspices cannot be reversed,

117
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:17,011
but anomalies

118
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,197
can be man-made.

119
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:21,049
For example, the resurrection of Lady Gu
or a thunder fire.

120
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:24,120
As for the lines, "heaven and earth collapse,"
and "Huasheng State suffers defeat",

121
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,460
what do they imply?

122
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,740
"Heaven and earth collapse"
refers to a geological omen.

123
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,486
Our land lies on a flat plain.

124
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,877
Logically speaking,

125
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,851
it shouldn't suffer land collapses,

126
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,331
earthquakes, or upheaval.

127
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,326
In other words, no great quake.

128
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:39,388
The line "Huasheng State suffers defeat"
should mean

129
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,771
Huasheng State
will face a military catastrophe.

130
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,620
Oh, right.

131
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:45,460
My father also wrote in the letter

132
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,100
that he discovered that Noble Consort Chen
is the so-called twin fish.

133
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,380
She's been plotting a rebellion.

134
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,731
It shows that

135
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,335
there's a mastermind behind all this.

136
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,460
This is a grave matter.

137
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:59,620
Consort Chen is His Majesty's favorite.

138
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,629
Her late father
was a Grand Tutor under two dynasties.

139
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,940
Her brother, Vice Minister Chen,

140
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,460
is a senior court official.

141
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,140
Without solid proof,

142
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:08,824
we must not act rashly.

143
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,540
Leave Noble Consort Chen's matter

144
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,140
to me.

145
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,380
Sure.

146
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,980
Your Majesty.

147
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:19,989
This kumquat and pear soup helps
moisten the lungs and replenish fluids.

148
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,140
Please have a taste.

149
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,460
How thoughtful of you.

150
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,989
By the way,

151
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,740
how is that silly girl doing?

152
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,540
Thanks to Your Majesty's concern,

153
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,860
the imperial physician said
she's fully recovered.

154
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,900
That girl is unbelievable.

155
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:38,526
She ran out
of the palace again just now.

156
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,517
Greetings, Your Majesty.

157
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,584
Greetings, sister.

158
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:47,980
Greetings, Father.

159
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,651
May you be ever healthy and blessed.

160
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,620
What are you two doing here?

161
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,095
I heard Your Majesty has been troubled

162
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:58,384
and sleepless lately.

163
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,126
So I made some ginseng soup
to nourish your vitality.

164
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:02,095
Good.

165
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,380
Leave it there.

166
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:11,913
Noble Consort Chen, you've been caring
for that silly girl day and night.

167
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,909
Well,

168
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,740
you've lost much weight.

169
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,300
Thank you for that.

170
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:20,304
You may have the ginseng soup instead.

171
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:22,762
Thank you, Your Majesty.

172
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:26,780
Thank you, sister.

173
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:30,757
It's my greatest honor

174
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:32,388
to be serving you and His Majesty.

175
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,109
Father.

176
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,846
Mother spent hours
stewing that ginseng soup

177
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,020
especially for you.

178
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:40,677
Please don't let her efforts
go to waste.

179
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:48,420
Since when

180
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:51,020
did you have the right
to tell me what to do?

181
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,620
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,100
The Third Prince is young and ignorant.

183
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:56,900
He spoke out of turn.

184
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,117
Please forgive him.

185
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,100
Mother.

186
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:00,442
I'm just telling the truth.

187
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:01,335
Father is biased.

188
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:02,433
I can't accept it!

189
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:02,833
Son...

190
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,011
Let me finish, Mother!

191
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,269
Silence! Not another word!

192
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,420
Don't stop him!

193
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,500
Let him speak.

194
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,480
Father, am I not your son too?

195
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,669
Why do you only care
about Noble Consort Chen and Lingyue?

196
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,020
What about me and my mother?

197
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:16,660
What's so good about Li Lingyue?

198
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:20,020
She flaunts her poison skills,
acts arrogantly, and commits countless sins.

199
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,517
Even Heaven and Earth would condemn her!

200
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,749
So it's you who've been spreading

201
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,349
rumors slandering Lingyue?

202
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,680
What did I say wrong?

203
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,120
When she poisoned me and my mother,
did you ever question her?

204
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,460
Did you ever hold her accountable?

205
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,009
You show her favor and treat us unfairly!

206
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,717
I won't accept it!

207
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,100
Never!

208
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,264
How dare you!

209
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,660
You unfilial son.

210
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:40,420
You're being reckless and defiant.

211
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,740
Leave.

212
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,940
You may not enter this hall
without my permission.

213
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:46,389
Your Majesty, calm down.

214
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,460
Leave!

215
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:51,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,020
Your Majesty.

217
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,180
Please calm down.

218
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,780
Anger doesn't do your health good.

219
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:10,580
Mother, Father is unfair.

220
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:11,820
I hate him.

221
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,580
Since he's heartless,

222
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:16,602
don't blame me for being ruthless, then.
