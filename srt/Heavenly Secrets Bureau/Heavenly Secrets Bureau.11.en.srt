00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,880
Who's that?

4
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,760
Forget it, Xiao.

5
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:57,920
The dart is poisoned.

6
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,760
We need to get out of here now.

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,880
Come.

8
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,120
You good-for-nothings!

9
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,155
What good are you?

10
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:13,640
How careless!

11
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,240
Gu Yuqing almost found out
about the salt farm.

12
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:18,880
If he had found out about it,

13
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:21,497
we'd have to cancel
our deal with Qifeng.

14
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,280
If I hadn't stopped him in time,

15
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:25,640
there would be

16
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,116
dire consequences!

17
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:28,160
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,440
It was my fault.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,120
Thank you for your immediate help.

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,120
However, they need to go.

21
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,227
Whether or not the court
is looking into that,

22
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:40,040
we should just proceed with the plan

23
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,480
and get rid of them.

24
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,071
Think

25
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:45,120
before you act.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,121
I'm dull.

27
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:50,800
Please tell me what to do, sir.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,400
What if

29
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,880
the God of Thunder kills them?

30
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:05,480
Alright, I've gotten rid of the poison.

31
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,605
This poisoned dart
is the same as the one used

32
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:09,600
to assassinate Li Sen.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,857
Well, if it hadn't been for me,

34
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:14,751
who's the disciple
of the top poison master,

35
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,116
you would've been killed.

36
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,200
Indeed.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,400
The one who assassinated Li Sen
and the one who tried to kill me

38
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,000
are probably the same person.

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,160
Could it be that that killer

40
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:32,524
came all the way to Leicheng
from Nandian?

41
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,139
Doesn't that mean...

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,640
Move. Those behind there.

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,680
Go check on it.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,177
Who's that?

45
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,320
What an adorable puppy!

46
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:50,099
Wait.

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,392
You can't eat this.

48
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:53,022
This cotton is poisoned.

49
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,760
Young Master.

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,400
What's happened to you?

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,459
I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

52
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,844
My goodness. Please be careful.

53
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,716
If anything happened to you,

54
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,800
how would I explain myself
to your late parents?

55
00:03:06,206 --> 00:03:07,880
Don't worry.
I'll get well in two months.

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm glad to hear that.

57
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,930
I bet it smells the meat.

58
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,720
Oh, right. I've got you
some sugar pancakes and braised meat.

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,760
Eat them while they're still warm.
Go ahead.

60
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,280
You move that way.

61
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:33,200
You go that way.

62
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,560
What are you up to, mister?
You've been making a lot of noises.

63
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,179
I'm a mason.

64
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,004
And I'm here to do some repair work.

65
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,480
Repair work?

66
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:44,320
Why is that needed?

67
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:45,619
Batu

68
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,619
was burned to death by thunder
in this inn.

69
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,200
The top floor is now a mess.

70
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,080
No one dares stay in this inn.

71
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:52,520
Also, its former owner has run away.

72
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,165
Someone has now taken over it,

73
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,520
so some repair work is a must.

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,680
You're right.

75
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:58,899
Well, keep it down.

76
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,400
There are other occupants up there.

77
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,262
Sure.

78
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:43,819
What smoke is this?

79
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,182
- I'm choking!
- What's going on here?

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,097
Anyone there?

81
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,280
It's glutinous rice flour.

82
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,680
Glutinous rice flour?

83
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,880
Iron rod. Glutinous rice flour. Thunder.

84
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,179
Someone's trying to create
a dust explosion using lightning.

85
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,240
A dust explosion?

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,099
This is bad!

87
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,619
Run!

88
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,360
Ah!

89
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,765
Your Highness! This is bad!

90
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,480
The inn where Her Highness is in
is on fire!

91
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,244
It's on fire.

92
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,840
We're trapped here.

93
00:05:51,855 --> 00:05:52,884
Are you alright?

94
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,800
That way.

95
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,271
Let's go.

96
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,040
Quick!

97
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,320
Which way should we go?

98
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,360
Watch out!

99
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,067
Little Diviner!

100
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,102
Your Highness!

101
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,499
- Your Highness! It's too late.
- Little Diviner!

102
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,640
- Let go of me! Little Diviner!
- That's too late! Let's go now!

103
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:19,761
- Little Diviner!
- We should go!

104
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:20,720
Let's go!

105
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,257
Little Diviner!

106
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,111
Young Master!

107
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,094
Your Master!

108
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,339
- Little Diviner!
- Young Master!

109
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,617
My young master is still in there!

110
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,669
- Let go on me, Xiao Ye!
- Young Master!

111
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,249
- Little Diviner is still in there!
- Calm down, Your Highness! Mr. Gu is...

112
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,079
- No, I don't believe it!
- Young Master!

113
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
- He's still alive!
- Young Master!

114
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,507
He's still alive...

115
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:45,019
- He's still alive!
- Young Master!

116
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,120
He's still alive!

117
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,480
My young master is still in there.

118
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:55,920
Aren't you a skilled fighter
in the imperial palace?

119
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,680
My young master is still in there!

120
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,040
Young Master!

121
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,875
Little Diviner!

122
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,511
Guards!

123
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,751
Get them all!

124
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:17,619
How dare you upset the God of Thunder
here in Leicheng?

125
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,112
The inn has now been destroyed
by the thunder.

126
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:21,960
You deserve nothing but death!

127
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:23,240
Stop it!

128
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,506
You're still alive, Little Diviner.

129
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,027
City Lord Sun.

130
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:35,076
I've warned you

131
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:36,480
to not mess with my princess consort.

132
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,121
Ha ha ha!

133
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,893
Calm down, Your Highness.

134
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,760
I wasn't aware

135
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,739
she's your woman.

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,853
Don't you try to play tricks on me!

137
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,017
You'd better behave yourself.

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,520
You can't afford to hurt the princess!

139
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,360
This city is beyond our ruler's control.

140
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:55,822
Leicheng

141
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:58,352
is under my command now.

142
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,804
It's under your command?

143
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:01,737
Fine.

144
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:03,835
How about we cancel the deal?

145
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:07,752
Ha ha ha!

146
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,102
Please calm down, Your Highness.

147
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:12,280
We can talk this out.

148
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:14,360
At least you know what's good for you.

149
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,280
These people are coming with me.

150
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:20,880
You can have both of them.

151
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,920
But that old man must stay.

152
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,636
His young master
had upset the God of Thunder.

153
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,924
I need to make up for it with a life.

154
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,339
Take him away!

155
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,240
No way.

156
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,120
We can't let them take Mr. Da away.

157
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:43,502
Lingyue!

158
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:44,974
He's just a servant...

159
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,697
He's not a servant!

160
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,450
Little Diviner has always seen him
as his family.

161
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:51,139
Enough! He's dead!

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,857
He was killed in the fire!

163
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,604
Your Highness.

164
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:57,160
Just let them take me away.

165
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,200
With Young Master's departure,

166
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,840
I have no reason

167
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,859
to live.

168
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,979
What are you waiting for?

169
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,080
Take him away!

170
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:06,524
No!

171
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,259
Mr. Da!

172
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,382
Mr. Da!

173
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,400
Little Diviner!

174
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:53,099
Keep an eye on him.

175
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,179
Don't let him run away.

176
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,920
If there's any mishap,

177
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,600
I'll behead you.

178
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,330
Yes, sir!

179
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,631
Young Master!
