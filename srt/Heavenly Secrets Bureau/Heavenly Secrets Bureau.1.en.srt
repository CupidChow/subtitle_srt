00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,579
(On the third day of the third month,)

4
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,179
(spring flowers bloom.)

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,730
(My mother returns home.)

6
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,659
(On the third day of the third month,)

7
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,299
(spring water shows an emerald hue.)

8
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,770
(I follow my mother to the opera.)

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,430
(Three days earlier)

10
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,850
It's been three consecutive days.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,850
The sky remains blood red.

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,299
What's going on?

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,619
The previous dynasty
had a similar celestial event before.

14
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,130
In the tenth year of the Xia Dynasty,

15
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,850
the sky turned crimson.

16
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,259
And not long after...

17
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,539
What happened?

18
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,010
Then, a new sovereign took over,

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,530
and Xia fell.

20
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,930
Are you saying that this country
is about to fall?

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,339
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,219
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,259
I'm not making up
a baseless superstition.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,139
It's written in the ancient records.

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,240
Please see the truth for yourself,
Your Majesty.

26
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,770
The Heavenly Secrets Bureau

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,490
has been downhill over the generations.

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,419
Your Majesty,

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,170
the princess left the palace again.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,490
This little tyke is getting married
in two months.

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,490
Just let her be.

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,250
Hyah.

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,570
Your Highness.

34
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,099
Yes?

35
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,490
We just ran off like this.

36
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,250
If His Majesty finds out,

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,539
he'll skin me alive.

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,930
Don't worry.

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,779
I've left him

40
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,970
a letter.

41
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,859
I told him

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,490
I'm going to pay my master a visit.

43
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,810
Xiao, why did you suddenly stop?

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,970
Your Highness, something feels off.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,850
Don't!

46
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,499
Thank you for saving me.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,970
It's not free of charge. Ten taels, please.

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,859
I'll pay you later.
Quick. He's coming. Help me!

49
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,939
Add another ten taels.

50
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,810
Fifty taels. Help me!

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,850
(Next move:
Horizontal slash from the left)

52
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,730
Whoa.

53
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:04,770
(Leap forward. Forward his lower part.)

54
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,730
Whoa.

55
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,539
Impressive.

56
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,690
He dodged that.

57
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,970
Hey.

58
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,850
Where are you going?

59
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,499
Nandian.

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,219
Perfect.

61
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,499
I'm heading there too.

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,039
I have money, and you have skills.

63
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:29,379
Here's the deal.
I'll cover your food, lodging, and carriage.

64
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,379
All-in-one

65
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,019
for one price,

66
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,659
100 taels.

67
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,810
What do you say?

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,010
Deal.

69
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,539
Are you all right, Young Master?

70
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,690
I'm good.

71
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,419
This is our partner now.

72
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,090
We'll head to Nandian together.

73
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,139
Master, the assassination failed.

74
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,410
She escaped.

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,850
Please pardon me.

76
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,899
The princess has someone highly skilled
helping her. I couldn't even get close to her.

77
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,170
Useless trash.

78
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,739
You're dismissed.

79
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,730
Yes.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,790
(Nandian)

81
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,130
Anyone there?

82
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,930
We'd like to stay for the night.

83
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,450
Let's go.

84
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,890
Young master.

85
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,370
Why do they close so early?

86
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,410
Gentlemen,

87
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,299
please come inside.

88
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,570
Oh?

89
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,690
Let's go.

90
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,059
What would you like to eat?

91
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,560
Three bowls of beef noodles, please.

92
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,099
No beef noodles.

93
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,899
We have rice noodles.

94
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,939
- Then three bowls of rice noodles.
- All right.

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,250
Three bowls of rice noodles.

96
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,290
Young master,

97
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,539
you know what?

98
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,099
The one thing I've hated the most

99
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,210
since I was a kid is rice noodles.

100
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,610
Do you know

101
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,850
I can poison you and make you mute?

102
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,219
I don't know why,

103
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,139
but rice noodles have suddenly
become my favorite.

104
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,379
Don't you think it's strange?

105
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,410
Ha ha ha.

106
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,930
Here you go.

107
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,659
Excuse me.

108
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,850
May I ask,

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,650
is this Nandian Town?

110
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,610
Yes,

111
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,579
this is Nandian town,

112
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,330
a place of eternal spring
and scenic views.

113
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,130
Why is such a beautiful town

114
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,090
so empty?

115
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,139
It's the Xu hour now.

116
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,850
It's supposed to be peak time.

117
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,939
This town should have
at least over a thousand households.

118
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,250
Why is no one around?

119
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,570
Why?

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,730
Gentlemen,

121
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,290
you've come on the wrong day.

122
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,339
Today's the third day
of the third month.

123
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,050
The third day of the third month?

124
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,330
What's wrong with that?

125
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,970
On the third day of the third month,

126
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,010
Lady Gu's soul

127
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,490
returns.

128
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,859
On the third day of the third month,

129
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,459
spring flowers bloom.

130
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,010
My mother returns home.

131
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,939
On the third day of the third month,

132
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,810
spring water shows an emerald hue.

133
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,240
(You must go to Nandian)

134
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,879
(to find out the truth
behind Lady Gu's death.)

135
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,290
Nandian?

136
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,930
Lady Gu?

137
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,930
Lady Gu?

138
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,130
Young master,

139
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,730
we should leave immediately.

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,899
There's a ghost.

141
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,210
What ghost?

142
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,770
Don't talk nonsense.

143
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,779
Even if an immortal comes today,

144
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,530
no one can stop me
from eating rice noodles.

145
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,579
Young lady,

146
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,050
why don't you tell us
the story of Lady Gu?

147
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,250
Four years ago,

148
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,090
there was a murder in town.

149
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,290
An officer

150
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,690
was poisoned by Lady Gu.

151
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,530
Later, the county office
captured the culprit

152
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,090
and

153
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,130
executed her in public.

154
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,850
Execute her.

155
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,410
Xiu, Lady Gu, is executed on the spot.

156
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,610
From now on, she could no longer
harm anyone with Gu poison.

157
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,299
When the shaman and villagers

158
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,645
tried to bury her,

159
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,410
- something spooky happened.
- Wandering souls

160
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,890
have nowhere to go.

161
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,772
Three souls descend,

162
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,170
and seven spirits are approaching.

163
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,059
You...

164
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,290
(Burial)
You foul spirit!

165
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,290
Don't you dare cause trouble!

166
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,779
Xiu is back.

167
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,419
Run!

168
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,859
Run!

169
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,239
Quick!

170
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,790
(Burial)

171
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,810
Since then,

172
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,370
Lady Gu's vengeful soul has lingered.

173
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,770
Every year on the third day
of the third month,

174
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,010
she returns.

175
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,170
Mother, I'm scared.

176
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,139
Hush.

177
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,890
Don't make a noise.

178
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,890
Young master,

179
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,610
hurry and eat.

180
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,819
Then we'll find an inn
to rest for the night

181
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,970
and leave first thing in the morning.

182
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,850
I'm also closing up.

183
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,170
No inns will open tonight.

184
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,970
What?

185
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,370
Then, where are we supposed to stay?

186
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,019
There's an abandoned temple
on the outskirts.

187
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,379
If you have nowhere to stay,
you can make do there.

188
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,019
We don't sleep rough.

189
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,450
How could we just make do?

190
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,650
We'd like to stay for the night.
We'll pay double. We've got silver.

191
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,210
That young girl was right.

192
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,130
All the inns in town are closed.

193
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,450
Looks like

194
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,050
we have to stay in the abandoned temple
tonight.

195
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,370
Huh?

196
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,090
No.

197
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,819
Think about it again.

198
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,290
Are you really sure about that?

199
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,090
Slow down.

200
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,490
Young master,

201
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,970
there's an old saying.

202
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,210
"One mustn't enter a temple alone.

203
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,539
Two mustn't peer into a well together."

204
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,610
If there are three,

205
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,219
then you two must listen to me.

206
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,619
Let's not go in.

207
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,170
What are you rambling about?

208
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,179
I'm tired now.

209
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,330
Quick.

210
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,659
That's the ancient wisdom.

211
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,850
You know?

212
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,530
Young master.

213
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,130
What?

214
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,379
There's wind blowing from all directions.

215
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,739
Who knows what lurks here?

216
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,619
This place isn't meant for people.

217
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,099
I haven't said a word,
and yet you're already whining.

218
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,370
If you're making me sleep here,

219
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,850
I'd rather stay outside and stand guard.

220
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,570
You!

221
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,610
He's being dramatic.

222
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,130
That's a good spot.

223
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,610
Father,

224
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,730
where are you?

225
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,619
(Prisoner)

226
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,170
Father!

227
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,290
Hey.

228
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,090
What's wrong?

229
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,810
Ah!

230
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,970
You shameless.

231
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,090
What were you trying to do to me?

232
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,770
I...

233
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,370
You were the one who touched me,

234
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,939
and now you're accusing me instead?

235
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,770
I...

236
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,810
I won't sleep.

237
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,970
Stop it, Your Highness.

238
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,250
Stop it, Your Highness.

239
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,890
Behave.

240
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,010
It's a ghost!
