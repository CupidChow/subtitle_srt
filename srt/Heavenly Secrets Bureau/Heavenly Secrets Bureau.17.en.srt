2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,290
"From one to nine, don't enter
from the center." Where's this place?

4
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,850
From one to nine...

5
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:00,450
Little Diviner, come out.

6
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:04,441
Little Diviner.

7
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:06,383
I fainted in Leicheng,

8
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,547
and you let Qifeng bring me back
to the palace?

9
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:09,872
What were you thinking?

10
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:10,805
I...

11
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:15,103
I'm sure he meant it literally.

12
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:17,881
Qifeng had the antidote.

13
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:19,370
He did it for your sake.

14
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:24,227
Fine, then.

15
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:25,556
If that's the case,

16
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:26,641
I'll forgive you.

17
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,547
But don't you dare
leave me behind again.

18
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:29,870
We'll leave together.

19
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:35,841
The ground is shaking.

20
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:37,552
It's an earthquake!

21
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,829
Don't leave me behind again, Little Diviner.
You're running off again.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,690
Hey.

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,045
What's there to see?

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,298
It smells like gunpowder.

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,130
What?

26
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,459
Why would it smell like gunpowder
after an earthquake?

27
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,850
The capital sits on flat land.

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,716
There shouldn't be earthquakes here.

29
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,210
Besides,

30
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:16,250
none of the other buildings collapsed,

31
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,090
only this one did.

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,490
Then... If it wasn't an earthquake,
what caused the collapse?

33
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:23,392
If there's gunpowder,

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,587
then

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,859
it was likely blown up.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,765
Blown up?

37
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,112
Let's dig

38
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,383
and check

39
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:31,103
if there's more gunpowder underneath.

40
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,690
What's written here?

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,490
In six hours,

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,499
hand over the Imperial Seal of Xia.

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,450
Otherwise,

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,090
it won't be just an empty house.

45
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:51,530
What does that mean?

46
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:54,130
This is serious.
We must go to Lord Xian now.

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,392
- Xiao Ye.
- Xiao Ye.

48
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,445
- Stay here.
- Stay here.

49
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:57,045
I know.

50
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,010
Clever.

51
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,814
I dug up the grave,

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,703
now I'm digging the rubble.

53
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:04,356
Let's get started.

54
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:06,310
(Lord Xian's Residence)

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,490
This is a threat.

56
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:13,090
They might go after
the innocent people next.

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,490
We found gunpowder

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,690
at the scene.

59
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,410
Before Mr. Da died,

60
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:21,119
he said the only way
to rally Xia's old forces

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,290
was to recover the Imperial Seal.

62
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,010
Why did he ask you to look for it?

63
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:26,530
Do you know where it is?

64
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,299
My father

65
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,459
did leave clues

66
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,419
in his letters.

67
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,410
What did he say?

68
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,810
"From one to nine,
don't enter from the center."

69
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,210
What does that mean?

70
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,010
It's from Taiyi Divination.

71
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,850
If it refers to spatial arrangement,

72
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,903
arrange the numbers
from one to nine in order,

73
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,890
then the Imperial Seal

74
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,530
should be

75
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,610
at the center.

76
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,490
I see.

77
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,970
This is serious.

78
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,499
We must first find
where the gunpowder is hidden

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,680
before more people get hurt.

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,720
I'll enter the palace
and seek His Majesty's audience.

81
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,543
Xiao Ye.

82
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:06,783
Did you find anything?

83
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,659
Mr. Gu was right.

84
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,330
There's gunpowder underneath.

85
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,987
We need to find out

86
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,565
who owns that house.

87
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,170
It'll be too late when you find it.

88
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:19,850
I already checked.

89
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,876
Do you remember Li Sen from Nandian?

90
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,250
This house belongs to

91
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,010
him.

92
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,659
Li Sen is the owner?

93
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,650
Right.

94
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:32,330
Did he buy so many houses in the capital

95
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,450
to store gunpowder?

96
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,699
We must do something now.

97
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,361
Let's find his land deed.

98
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,779
I remember Governor Cao said

99
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,827
the Nandian Gu Poison case file

100
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,379
was sent to
the Court of Judicial Review,

101
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,614
along with Li Sen's house deeds.

102
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:47,156
Thirty-one in total.

103
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,699
I went there.

104
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,570
They don't have any record of this case.

105
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,419
So

106
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,570
we have no way to find out
where his other houses.

107
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,387
Oh, right.

108
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,679
All property sales in the country

109
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,867
must be registered with
Provincial Administration Commission.

110
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,899
We might find something there.

111
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,352
You're faster than me.

112
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,027
Let's go.

113
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:11,023
Let's go.

114
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,699
You're really something, Mr. Gu.

115
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,619
(Imperial Study)

116
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,236
So you're saying

117
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:19,210
that all of this ties back to Twin Fish?

118
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:22,650
How's the investigation going?

119
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,490
Gu Yuqing and that little tyke
are on the case.

120
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,059
Do you think it's necessary

121
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,810
to send in the Imperial Guards to help?

122
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,730
Twin Fish hides in the shadow,

123
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,770
and we act in the open.

124
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,970
Let them investigate for now.

125
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,290
Here are all the land registries from
Provincial Administration Commission.

126
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,370
This is the last stack.

127
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:57,290
One near Mount Niushou at Fang Alley.

128
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,970
One near the Confucius Temple.

129
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,650
One near Xuanhu Lake.

130
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,370
All right.

131
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:07,730
That's settled.

132
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:08,930
Seven houses in total.

133
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:11,250
All situated in the busiest quarters
of the capital.

134
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,979
The one on Xihua Street
has the largest crowd.

135
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,810
Let's go.

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,650
Let's go.

137
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,808
We're too late.

138
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,459
- Fire!
- Fire!

139
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,454
- Put out the fire!
- Fire!

140
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,890
What does it say?

141
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,770
Two hours have passed.

142
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,290
Punishment delivered.

143
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,299
If you fail to find the Imperial Seal

144
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,690
within four more hours,

145
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,512
more people will die.

146
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,290
Li Sen had 31 properties in the capital.

147
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,930
We've now confirmed
the locations of seven.

148
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,130
From south to north,

149
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,090
the next one is

150
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,410
Lord Xian's Residence.

151
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,490
Master,

152
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,090
the second operation is ready.

153
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,779
If nothing goes wrong,

154
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,250
there will be no more
Lord Xian's Residence in the capital.

155
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:54,139
Lord Xian has been a thorn long enough.

156
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,970
It's time to get rid of it.

157
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:57,579
He was close to Gu Shanyao

158
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,290
before the latter died.

159
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:03,898
Now they can reunite in death.

160
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,870
(Lord Xian's Residence)

161
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,054
That was close.

162
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,850
We got here just in time.

163
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,707
Otherwise,

164
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,610
more innocent lives would've been lost.

165
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,410
Gunpowder production

166
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:38,147
requires large quantities of sulfur.

167
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,205
The extraction process
releases thick fumes.

168
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:42,770
Crushing saltpeter also gives out
heavy dust.

169
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,761
The mix of fumes and dust

170
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,570
creates haze.

171
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,090
Over time,

172
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,770
it condensed into a reddish cloud.

173
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,610
And it looks like that.

174
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:54,810
No wonder Cui has been
coughing so much lately.

175
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,850
It's all because of that.

176
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,103
Look.

177
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,530
The red clouds in the north
is the thickest.

178
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:01,899
Xiao Ye.

179
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,303
Yes?

180
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:04,134
Is there a honey locust grove
in the north?

181
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:07,450
What does that have to do with anything?

182
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,090
That's right.

183
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,379
Honey locust, saltpeter, and sulfur

184
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,979
are the three key ingredients
for gunpowder.

185
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,530
You're very knowledgeable,
Your Highness.

186
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,890
There's a honey locust grove
in the north.

187
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,539
Cui wanted to wash clothes,

188
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,379
so she asked me to pick some for her.

189
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,032
Take us there now.

190
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:26,836
Let's go.

191
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:27,605
Let's go.

192
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,010
I remember it's just up ahead.

193
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,350
We're almost there.

194
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:42,859
Master,

195
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,810
Gu Yuqing and his group
stopped the second explosion.

196
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,250
Gu Yuqing

197
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,427
seems even smarter than Gu Shanyao.

198
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:52,174
Right.

199
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,530
I failed to perform my task.

200
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:54,907
I just received word

201
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,659
that Gu Yuqing is heading toward
the gunpowder factory.

202
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,539
Oh?

203
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,490
He found it already?

204
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,619
No wonder things went awry
in Nandian and Leicheng.

205
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,570
This man is indeed cunning.

206
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,570
No matter how cunning the fox,

207
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,770
it can't dodge the hunter's arrow.

208
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,130
Master, we must eliminate him now.

209
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,530
I'll lead the men
to blow up the factory.

210
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,979
Anyway, keeping those people
will only bring us more trouble.

211
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,721
Let them all die with Gu Yuqing.

212
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,587
Fool!

213
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:23,739
If he dies,

214
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,707
who will find us the Imperial Seal?

215
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:26,810
Yes, Master.

216
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,130
What do we do?

217
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,232
We'll strike

218
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,730
at his weakness.

219
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:34,232
Gu Yuqing may be meticulous,

220
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,530
but he isn't always untouchable.

221
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:39,930
Mr. Han once said

222
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,979
Gu Yuqing is composed

223
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,330
and calculating.

224
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:47,410
The only person who can shake him

225
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,685
is Li Lingyue.
