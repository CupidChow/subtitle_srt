00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,950
But on the third day of the third month
in the third year, Lady Gu came back.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,950
And this time, the victim

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,390
was a peddler.

6
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,470
No one would've expected

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,430
that in the fourth year,

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,230
Lady Gu would come for you.

9
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,470
Since we've become acquainted,

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,310
you can have the noodles for free.

11
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,590
Gentlemen,

12
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,399
you'd better start preparing.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,039
Prepare for what?

14
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm alive and well.

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,380
The moment you encountered Lady Gu,
you'd already been poisoned with Gu.

16
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,279
Poisoned?

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,150
Yes.

18
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,159
Rosey-cheeked.

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,479
Strong pulse.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,190
Internal heat and restlessness.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,030
What about me?

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,399
Dull complexion.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,839
Darkness on your forehead.

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,359
Your kidneys, spleen, yang energy,
qi, and blood are all weak.

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,479
Weak in every way.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,110
Weak in every way?

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,839
I'm done for.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,590
I've been poisoned with Gu.

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,159
Yes. You're dying.

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,199
I don't want to die.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,510
You're scaring yourself to death.

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,310
As for me,

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,470
empty stomach.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,919
Apparently, I'm hungry.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,910
None of us is poisoned.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,639
Eat up.

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,470
Are you sure?

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,630
Don't take it lightly.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,559
The shaman said Lady Gu
is a thousand-year-old ghost.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,670
No one escapes her Gu poison.

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,630
Not even the Soul-sending Art
works on her.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,519
If she's a thousand-year-old ghost,

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,270
then I'm a ten-thousand-year-old demon.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,230
The Gu poison will take effect
within twelve hours.

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,590
You don't have much time left.

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,030
Too little time left!

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,190
Cui,

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,239
I have failed you.

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,639
Cui?

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,390
- I can't leave you. I...
- Wait.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,390
No wonder Cui has been
so distracted lately.

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,150
It's all because of you!

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,270
Own up.

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,510
How far

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,790
have you two gone?

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,319
No.

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,519
I never said anything about Cui.

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,444
- You just said her name. Cui.
- I said wonton.

59
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:21,919
Cui.

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,599
Wonton.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,990
We'll deal with that later.

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,390
Let's focus on Lady Gu.

63
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,839
What's there to discuss?

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,750
We must get to the bottom of this.

65
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,999
I'd like to see

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,599
who this Lady Gu really is.

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,110
I will uncover the truth.

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,150
What does this have to do with you?

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,630
What does this have to do with you?

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,190
Father,

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,470
I know you're innocent.

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,070
Don't worry.

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,950
I'll definitely clear your name

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,790
and uncover the truth.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,030
(My son, I hope this letter
finds you well.)

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,310
(If anything happens to me,)

77
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,190
(it may be tied to
Tortoise Shell Divine Script.)

78
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,999
(You must go to Nandian)

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,190
(to find out the truth
behind Lady Gu's death.)

80
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,110
Nandian?

81
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,310
Lady Gu?

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,639
To be frank,

83
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,870
my father's death
may be connected to this.

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,230
Then we must investigate.

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,990
So many innocent people have died.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,470
His Majesty...

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,039
My father cherishes the people
as if they were his own children.

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,319
If he knew,

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,550
he would definitely want me
to expose the culprit.

90
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,839
We've been through
desperate times together.

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,879
I'll help you as a friend.

92
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,030
Kill one bird with two stones.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,799
Gu poison is still poison.

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,879
I'd like to see

95
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,839
if I, the poison expert, am stronger,

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,470
or if Lady Gu is.

97
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,190
(Is she really the Ninth Princess?)

98
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,950
(She's nothing like the rumors.)

99
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,479
Xiaojuzi said

100
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,879
the first victim was an officer.

101
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,510
We'll start from there.

102
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,099
All right.

103
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,890
(County Office)

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,470
Four years ago,

105
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,830
the first victim in the Gu poison case

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
was an officer in Nandian
sent by the Heavenly Secrets Bureau.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,910
His duty was to deliver documents.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,070
He also served at the county office
as a clerk.

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,750
His name was Zhong Dagao.

110
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,470
He was buried on North Hill.

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,164
Mr. Li.

112
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:56,537
Yes?

113
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm counting on you.

114
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,230
What?

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,363
Count on me?

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,430
For what?

117
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,439
Go down there and help out.

118
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,830
Impossible! I won't leave your side.

119
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,310
You're timid.

120
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,590
Did you do something
you feel guilty about?

121
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,230
That's not true.

122
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,350
I've got nothing to hide.

123
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,439
It's because I'm your personal guard.

124
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,999
It's my duty to protect your safety.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,479
Say another word,

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,590
and you'll be lying down there too.

127
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,630
Your Highness,

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,550
that was really unkind of you.

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,630
Three.

130
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,990
You know?

131
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,839
Two.

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,150
We shouldn't say ominous things
in front of him.

133
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,359
Come on.

134
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,950
Let's do this.

135
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,670
The case file stated Zhong Dagao died
from Golden Silkworm Gu poison.

136
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,630
Ridiculous.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,150
What's wrong with that?

138
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,110
There was no sign of poison
on his remains.

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,310
His neck wasn't broken naturally.

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,470
Instead, it was crushed
with fast, great force.

141
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,359
A clean,

142
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,670
precise, and ruthless strike.

143
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,350
Not something an ordinary man could do.

144
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,590
A normal strike would
just fracture the bone.

145
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,910
But his neck was shattered.

146
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,590
That takes immense inner strength.

147
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,630
The person who did this

148
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,790
must have terrifying skills.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,710
Better than me?

150
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,270
Zhong Dagao didn't die from Gu poison.

151
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,870
There's another killer behind this.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,639
My husband died a horrible death.

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,470
The coroner from the county office said

154
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,359
he was poisoned
by Golden Silkworm Gu poison,

155
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,470
which was made
from twelve poisonous worms.

156
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,279
County Li took his men

157
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,310
to search Lady Gu's house.

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,430
They found the poisonous bugs there,

159
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,390
which matched the Golden Silkworm
Gu poison the coroner discovered.

160
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,510
But if Lady Gu was the killer,

161
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,590
why would she keep
such obvious evidence?

162
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,319
Think carefully.

163
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,790
Was there anything you overlooked?

164
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,710
Right.

165
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,919
At that time, my husband was drafting
a weather report

166
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,350
for the Heavenly Secrets Bureau.

167
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,830
Do you recall what it said?

168
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,830
It reported the weather in Nandian.

169
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,030
There was a moderate rainfall

170
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,310
that caused no natural disasters.

171
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,119
But then,

172
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,110
Mr. Gu from the bureau

173
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,790
came with a different report.

174
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,919
It claimed that Nandian had rained
for three days

175
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,550
and caused a mudslide.

176
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,519
I found it odd.

177
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,119
My husband's report
was never even delivered.

178
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,670
Where did the bureau's report come from?

179
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,910
I recognized my husband's handwriting.

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,190
The one Mr. Gu had wasn't his.

181
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,230
You're saying

182
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,070
the bureau received a forged report?

183
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,110
But why fake

184
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,950
a mudslide?

185
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,759
Mr. Gu had the same question.

186
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,439
There hadn't been
a serious weather disaster

187
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,919
in Nandian for ten years.

188
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,799
Yet the county office issued a notice

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,239
claiming to seal off Tianling Mine

190
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,039
due to a mudslide.

191
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,990
They also forbade the townsfolk
from mining there.

192
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,070
Tianling Mine has been abandoned
since then.

193
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,710
Tianling Mine?

194
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,719
(County Office)

195
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,119
Sir,

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,799
something has happened.

197
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,310
Who is it? You're disturbing my sleep.

198
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,959
Where's the fire?

199
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,550
Do you have no sense of propriety?

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,190
Speak. What is it?

201
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,390
Sir,

202
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,790
Zhao Dagao's grave has been dug up.

203
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,630
Zong Dagao?

204
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,230
Who's that?

205
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,199
The officer

206
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,839
from the Heavenly Secrets Bureau

207
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,560
who was killed by Lady Gu
four years ago.

208
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,830
That case was closed long ago.

209
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,479
What does his grave being dug up

210
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,110
have to do with me?

211
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,270
The ones who dug it up
are investigating the Lady Gu case.

212
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,759
Who are they?
Have they discovered anything?

213
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,959
They're from the capital.

214
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,640
I noticed the archive room's lock
was broken while I was on patrol.

215
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,630
Besides, someone touched
Lady Gu's case file.

216
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,599
Then what are you waiting for?

217
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,879
Gather the men immediately.

218
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,030
Yes, sir.

219
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,990
Come back.

220
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,839
Bring me that shaman.

221
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,990
Yes, sir.

222
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,439
The governor will be visiting Nandian
very soon.

223
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,230
We cannot afford a single mistake.

224
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,670
Why has Lady Gu shown up again?

225
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,110
Did you arrange this?

226
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,030
No, not me.

227
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,800
There are rumors that someone saw
Lady Gu's spirit again.

228
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,630
I don't know what's going on.

229
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,350
Something's wrong.

230
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,270
Could it be those outsiders behind this?

231
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,310
Why are they investigating
the Lady Gu case?

232
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,750
Hmph!

233
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,910
No matter who they are,

234
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,910
if they dare interfere with my plan,

235
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,030
they won't leave here alive.
