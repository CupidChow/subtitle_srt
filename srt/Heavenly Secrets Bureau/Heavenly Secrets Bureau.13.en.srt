2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,950
Let's save Mr. Da first.

4
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:56,799
After that,

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,830
we'll meet City Lord Sun.

6
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:02,123
But

7
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,519
it's just two of us.

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,456
Wouldn't that be

9
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:06,416
rather reckless?

10
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,230
Why?

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,510
Are you scared?

12
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:09,336
Not at all.

13
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,074
I'm just worried about you.

14
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:13,221
Your safety is my concern here.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,674
Wait.

16
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,438
Mr. Gu, if you're seeing this,

17
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:25,030
please bless Your Highness
and ensure her safety.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,430
Please.

19
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:43,496
That's Mr. Da.

20
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:50,919
Mr. Da. Hurry up.
We're getting you out of here.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,350
- Quick, Mr. Da. Come.
- Let' go now.

22
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,163
Your Highness.

23
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:56,009
- Mr. Xiao. Why are you here?
- We came to get you out of here.

24
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,360
- That's right. Let's go now.
- Let's go.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,838
Otherwise, it'd be too late.

26
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:00,376
Your Highness.

27
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,576
I appreciate your kind thought,

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,510
but I can't leave.

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,843
Mr. Da.

30
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,536
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,758
Young Master angered the God of Thunder
and drew down the thunder fire.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,167
I

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,576
will atone on his behalf.

34
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,799
Mr. Da, stop being stubborn.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,590
God of Thunder? Thunder fire?

36
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,243
City Lord Sun came up with that trick

37
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,941
to fool you.

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,910
Say no more, Mr. Xiao.

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,350
I

40
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:30,794
have made up my mind.

41
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:33,967
We're running out of time, Mr. Da.
Let's get out of here first. Come on.

42
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:36,745
- Xiao Ye.
- There's no time left. You...

43
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:39,661
Forget it.

44
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:45,870
Let's go.

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,830
We'll deal with City Lord Sun first.

46
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:53,652
You stubborn fool.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,350
Hyah!

48
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:31,439
Send my order to Xiangcheng.

49
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,639
Summon the Xiangcheng garrison
to Leicheng at once.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,720
There must be no mishaps.

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,692
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

52
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:13,390
This is bad!

53
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,839
It's a trap!

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,990
Run!

55
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:29,519
Well, I've been expecting you two.

56
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,630
You rogue!

57
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,150
What a brilliant move, sir.

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,945
Everything unfolded
just as you predicted.

59
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,087
Our top priority now
is the goods at the salt farm.

60
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,198
At this critical moment,

61
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,456
nothing can go wrong.

62
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,719
Understood.

63
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,350
I've already sent someone to oversee it.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,319
Within two days,

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,145
ten carts of salt will be ready

66
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,781
to be delivered to Prince Qifeng.

67
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,492
You must be there
to oversee it yourself.

68
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,350
Ensure there are no errors.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,070
I'll see to that now.

70
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,990
Wait.

71
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:04,839
Ninth Princess

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,621
remains our threat.

73
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:07,945
Rest assured, sir.

74
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:11,510
I'll make sure she disappears
without a trace.

75
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:17,514
You jerks!

76
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,327
Open your darn eyes!

77
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,799
I am the Ninth Princess.

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,390
Lay a finger on me

79
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,821
and I'll wipe out your whole clan!

80
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,150
If you were a princess,

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,123
that'd make me the Jade Emperor!

82
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:28,590
Untie me

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,745
and I'll kill you right here!

84
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,052
Call me "Master"

85
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:33,310
and I'll give you a swift death.

86
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,185
You ignorant fools.

87
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,279
I'll haunt you even after death!

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,221
Then I'll send you to hell right now!

89
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:41,087
Ah!

90
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:45,670
Uncle.

91
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:47,452
Why are you here?

92
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,150
Gu Yuqing sent me a pigeon post

93
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:50,830
saying you were in danger in Leicheng.

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,550
I dared not have a moment of delay,

95
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:54,590
and I traveled day and night
to get here.

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,990
To my surprise, I'd arrive just in time.

97
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,150
Oh, right.

98
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,510
Where's Gu Yuqing?

99
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,230
Mr. Gu perished in the fire

100
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:09,150
from trying to save us.

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,038
Watch him. I'm going to relieve myself.

102
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,865
The mansion is under control, Your Highness.
But City Lord Sun is nowhere to be found.

103
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:18,990
However, we did find
some suspicious items in his study.

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,870
Bring us there.

105
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,570
(Memorial tablet of Mr. Yang)

106
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,350
It's Mr. Yang again.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
Deputy Magistrate Li of Nandian

108
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,630
also worshiped Mr. Yang.

109
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,590
According to Governor Cao...

110
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,950
The crown prince of the former dynasty,
Yang Wen, also known as Mr. Bai Yang,

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,870
has been dead for thirty years.

112
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,190
When the former dynasty fell,

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,719
he set the palace ablaze

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,270
and burned himself alive inside.

115
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:53,910
Could it be

116
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,310
that everything happened
in Nandian and Leicheng

117
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,590
is tied to the fallen dynasty?

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,750
The former regime was tyrannical.

119
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,430
Yang Gao was an inept ruler.

120
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,670
Before his passing, he handed military power
to Prince Yang Wen.

121
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,950
When the late emperor
stormed the palace,

122
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:10,639
the main hall of the old dynasty

123
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,270
was consumed by flames.

124
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,047
Thirty-seven charred corpses
were found inside.

125
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,670
The eunuchs confirmed

126
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,870
they were all royal relatives
of the former dynasty.

127
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,150
All confirmed to be
of the former royal bloodline?

128
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:23,270
Yes.

129
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,870
It's thirty-seven in total,
including Prince Yang Wen,

130
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:26,950
Third Prince,

131
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:28,670
and the emperor's concubines.

132
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,280
There were men, women and children.

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,630
They all perished in the flames.

134
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:35,190
Looks like

135
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:39,590
Li Sen and City Lord Sun are remnants
of the former dynasty.

136
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,519
They seized the salt farm

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,021
and amassed great wealth.

138
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,510
I bet they must be hiding something.

139
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,950
Let's go to the salt farm.

140
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,950
It's not accessible.

141
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,470
Your Highness.

142
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,030
Her Highness is right.

143
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,990
We can't go there.

144
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:56,790
There are ghost soldiers,

145
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,910
bones, skulls,

146
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:00,510
and flying swords there.

147
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,310
There was a great fog
when we were last there.

148
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,470
Even the compass wasn't working then.

149
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:08,590
Don't worry.

150
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,190
I know the way to get into it.

151
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:11,150
Let's go.

152
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,710
Your Highness, should we just...

153
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,030
Princess.

154
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,070
Why don't they listen to me?

155
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,799
Quick!

156
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,639
Hurry up!

157
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,439
Hurry!

158
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,279
Quick!

159
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,999
Move!

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,959
Hurry up!

161
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,070
Faster!

162
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,487
Get to work.

163
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:27,701
Quick!

164
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:28,890
Hurry!

165
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,230
Stop dilly-dallying!

166
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,630
Do you have a death wish?

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,750
Scram!

168
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,439
Have mercy on me!

169
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,959
Can't you do your job well? Get up!

170
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,870
Get up!

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,839
Get up!

172
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,790
Get up!

173
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,750
What a good-for-nothing!

174
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,510
Uncle.

175
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,510
What exactly are you looking for?

176
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,630
We'll travel following this mark.

177
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,319
What mark is that?

178
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,710
You'll know soon.

179
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,176
Let's go, Your Highness.
