=Heavenly Secrets Bureau=

2
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,078
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,244
She was brutally beaten
before her death.

4
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:58,350
Multiple fractures all over her body.

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,007
She was most likely beaten to death,

6
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,790
then thrown into the well.

7
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,914
So, why would Mother have come

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,599
to pay respects?

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,039
(Could it be that Noble Consort Chen)

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,994
(had connections to this woman?)

11
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:22,145
Oh, right.

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,150
Since you were able to detect poison
in her body,

13
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:28,030
can you tell what kind it was?

14
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:31,065
It seems to be the Gut-severing Grass.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,590
That's not a common herb.

16
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:36,576
Ordinary people wouldn't be able
to get it easily.

17
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,287
One more thing.

18
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,687
If she gave birth in the palace,

19
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:43,830
she must've been a concubine
of the Emperor.

20
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:47,270
Or maybe

21
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,590
a palace maid.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,190
That's not possible.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,470
It's the Emperor we're talking about.

24
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:56,701
His Majesty.

25
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:59,243
You know who His Majesty is?
He's the ruler...

26
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,310
Well, one question.

27
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:06,430
Is Cui

28
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,950
a palace maid?

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,230
Palace maid.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,239
I'll take my leave first.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,825
Cui was looking for me.

32
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,950
Cui,

33
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,750
I'm coming!

34
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,950
If that person could use
the Gut-severing Grass in the palace,

35
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,110
they must've had a fairly high status.

36
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:28,950
Who could it be?

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,910
I'll give you the answer.

38
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:32,750
Hmm?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,910
What?

40
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:35,830
What answer?

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,710
He's acting weirdly.

42
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:41,354
Lingyue.

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,345
It's you again.

44
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:51,559
What are you doing?

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,016
There's a little bug.

46
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,670
That's ridiculous.

47
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,590
Nanny Rong.

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,070
Mr...

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,430
Mr. Gu.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,879
Were you trying

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,990
to tell me something?

52
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:20,350
Why did Yue suddenly faint?

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,550
Don't worry, Your Highness.

54
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:24,270
I'll make sure she's unharmed.

55
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,070
Why did you do that?

56
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,421
Oh, right, Your Highness.

57
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,999
Gu Yuqing found out
someone had gone to the well.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,670
He recovered a body from it.

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,376
With his intelligence,

60
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:45,470
he'll uncover the truth in no time.

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,390
What are you trying to say?

62
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:52,079
I'm not interested

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,203
in your secret.

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,150
I only care about the Princess.

65
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:58,945
But

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,750
we share a common enemy

67
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,510
that must be eliminated.

68
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,070
Gu Yuqing,

69
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,110
how dare you poison the Princess!

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,230
What did you say?

71
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:20,550
Her Highness has been poisoned?

72
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:22,350
Don't try to deny it.

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,990
You were the last one to see her.

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,430
If it wasn't you, then who?

75
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:28,007
Archers.

76
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:28,639
Yes.

77
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,710
Hold.

78
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,719
You're a foreign prince.

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,870
How dare you draw your bow on my people
inside the palace of Huasheng?

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,030
Have you thought about the consequences?

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,216
You misunderstood me, Lord Xian.

82
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,465
The Princess suddenly fainted
and won't wake up.

83
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,240
The imperial physician says
she's been poisoned.

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,159
As far as I'm concerned,

85
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,790
she's been with Gu Yuqing lately.

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,550
So

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,270
I came here to question him.

88
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,870
That little tyke has been poisoned?

89
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:15,790
How is Her Highness?

90
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,390
The imperial physician says

91
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,750
her fetal poison acts up again.

92
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,390
She could be in grave danger.

93
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,910
Impossible.

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,172
I only gave her
a bit of knockout powder.

95
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:27,047
How could that trigger the fetal poison?

96
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,270
Knockout powder?

97
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:35,110
I would never harm her.

98
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,043
I just wanted her to sleep
for a few days.

99
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,430
Don't you have the antidote
for her poison?

100
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,670
The poison

101
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,270
is all used up.

102
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:45,470
What?

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,150
I told you that was the last bottle.

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,119
Yes.

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,230
You did say that.

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,150
Right.

107
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,990
Judging by the time,

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
Mr. Wan should be back
in his bamboo cottage outside the city.

109
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,305
Let's go.

110
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:07,239
Seriously?

111
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,870
That little witch's poison
flared up again?

112
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,185
That's exactly what I heard.

113
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,972
Kill Wan Nianqing

114
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:16,718
before they get the antidote.

115
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,745
Yes, Your Highness.

116
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,030
Little witch,

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,741
your number is up.

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,999
Master,

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,070
when I first reached out
to those old men of Xia,

120
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:35,821
they were as stubborn as a mule.

121
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,750
They suspected my identity.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,790
After all, Xia has fallen
for almost thirty years.

123
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,963
That's understandable.

124
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,799
Fortunately,

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,870
I had the Imperial Seal with me.

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,439
The moment they saw it,

127
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,950
they were stunned.

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,159
So,

129
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,816
are they willing to offer support?

130
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,603
Of course.

131
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,350
They're willing to pledge loyalty
to you

132
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,327
and forsake their lives

133
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:00,750
for the restoration of Xia.

134
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:02,692
Oh.

135
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:03,470
By the way,

136
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,550
a scout just reported

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,310
that Lord Xian found a palace maid
who served in your father's household.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,879
Looks like

139
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,514
they're getting closer to the truth.

140
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:23,883
Wait.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,190
Someone came here.

142
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,550
Isn't he Consort Xiao's servant?

143
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,510
Mr. Wan.

144
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,670
Mr. Wan.

145
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:29,336
This is the antidote prescription
for Her Highness's fetal poison.

146
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,096
Mr. Wan!

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,870
Lord Xian has found
that trafficking broker.

148
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,190
Which means

149
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:52,949
the identity of Twin Fish

150
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,505
can't stay hidden anymore.

151
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,950
The time has come.

152
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,830
There's no need to keep hiding.

153
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,630
You're awake.

154
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,550
What happened to me?

155
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:26,710
Your poison flared up again.

156
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,910
Do you feel anything else?

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,301
Why did it flare up again?

158
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,919
So,

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,830
how did you get the antidote?

160
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,870
Did my master come back?

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,990
Why didn't he come visit me?

162
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,230
This old man.

163
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:55,110
What happened?

164
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,292
We

165
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,394
got the antidote prescription

166
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,985
from your master.

167
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,398
But...

168
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,750
What are you talking about?

169
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,981
What happened to him?

170
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:14,990
We were

171
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,958
too late.

172
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,750
By the time we arrived,

173
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,070
Mr. Wan had already been

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,790
murdered.

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,959
But before he died,

176
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,510
he managed to develop
a complete antidote for your poison.

177
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,110
What do you mean by "murdered"?

178
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,270
What do you mean by "murdered"?

179
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,954
What happened to my master?

180
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:42,670
What happened to him?

181
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,390
Who did it?

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,070
Who did it?

183
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,510
He spent his whole life

184
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,350
saving people.

185
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,350
He never hurt anyone.

186
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:00,847
Who did it?

187
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,110
Consort Xiao's men.

188
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,234
Consort Xiao?

189
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,779
Consort Xiao again.

190
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,230
Consort Xiao again!

191
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:09,039
Consort Xiao...

192
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,270
Little tyke.

193
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,039
Little tyke, calm down.

194
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,710
How am I supposed to calm down?

195
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,279
She killed my master.

196
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,327
She killed my master!

197
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,981
I understand you're furious.

198
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:22,040
But if you accuse her recklessly
without proof,

199
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,440
it'll only give others something
to use against you.

200
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,350
Consort Xiao has always
been overbearing.

201
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,310
His Majesty has long been
displeased with her.

202
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,465
Now she's crossed the line.

203
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,807
His Majesty will surely
avenge your master.

204
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:35,199
Your Highness,

205
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,919
the Imperial Guards
closed the city gates.

206
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,705
Whose order?

207
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:38,750
Third Prince.
