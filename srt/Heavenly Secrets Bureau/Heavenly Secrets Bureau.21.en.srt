=Episode 21=

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
Consort Xiao has always
been domineering.

4
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,910
My brother has long
been fed up with her.

5
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,630
I didn't expect her
to go this far this time.

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,750
He'll definitely avenge your master.

7
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:01,479
Your Highness.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,459
The Imperial Guards have
shut the city gates.

9
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,599
Who gave the order?

10
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,790
The Third Prince.

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,390
Mother!

12
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,630
You're a prince.
Stop acting like a flustered fool.

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,585
The men we sent to kill Wan Nianqing

14
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:21,110
have all been exposed.

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,390
So what?

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,825
Did you carry out my order?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,350
I've brought the Imperial Guards
under my command.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,919
The entire palace is now
under our control.

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,870
Well done.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,950
There's one more thing
I need you to do.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,825
What is it?

22
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:40,630
Bring a few key court officials

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,190
into the palace.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,470
Good idea.

25
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,363
Consider it done.

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,154
Xiao Ye.

27
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:05,416
Mobilize the palace guards.

28
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,296
Yes.

29
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:07,599
Bring the broker.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,270
Got it.

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,970
(Imperial Study)

32
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:17,221
Greetings, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,559
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,719
I personally made you
some Four-Treasure Soup

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,230
to help nourish your body.

36
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:24,541
Bring it here.

37
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:52,763
Mm.

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,239
Your Majesty.

39
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,870
I shall take my leave.

40
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,247
Go ahead.

41
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,690
(Imperial Study)

42
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:31,994
The place is off limits.

43
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,319
We need to see His Majesty.

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,510
I'll inform him.

45
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:42,883
Your Highness,

46
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:45,190
Lord Xian and Her Highness
are here to see His Majesty.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,172
Let them in.

48
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:48,030
Yes.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,630
Perfect timing.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,470
This saves us the trouble
of going after them.

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,430
Let them through.

52
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:02,310
Come on.

53
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,478
Father.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,310
What have you done to my father?

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,719
His Majesty suddenly fell gravely ill.

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,212
Even the imperial physicians
are at a loss.

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,078
He may not have much time left.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,390
Nonsense!

59
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:21,370
My father was perfectly fine.

60
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,510
You must have done something to him.

61
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:24,389
What did you do to him?

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,363
Silly girl.

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,470
Calm down.

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,510
Consort Xiao,

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,630
you took command of the Imperial Guards

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,350
and seized the palace.

67
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:35,310
Are you staging a coup?

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,579
Lord Xian, your words are too harsh.

69
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,452
What I did

70
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:41,279
was all for the sake
of Huasheng's peace and stability.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,310
Is that so?

72
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,510
Explain yourself.

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,812
Now that His Majesty is ill,

74
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:47,910
I fear that certain traitors

75
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,727
may seize the chance to rebel.

76
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,705
Traitors?

77
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:52,847
I think it's you

78
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:54,941
who are the worst traitors of all.

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,159
A nation cannot go
a single day without a ruler.

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,110
At such a critical time,

81
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:05,754
I hope all of you can
choose a crown prince

82
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,390
to inherit the throne of our nation.

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
By tradition, the crown prince
should succeed the throne.

84
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,643
But the crown prince

85
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:21,879
is frail and sickly.

86
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,119
He has been bedridden for years.

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,679
He can't bear the burden.

88
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,030
Among all the princes,

89
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,727
only the Third Prince has
both virtue and talent.

90
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,981
He is strong and healthy.

91
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,950
He is the best candidate
to inherit the throne.

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,750
That can't be allowed!

93
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,919
The prince is wayward and ignorant,

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,190
and also too violent.

95
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:45,105
He'd beaten five palace maids to death.

96
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:47,314
We can't entrust the country
to someone like that.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,643
Since you are so eager to die,

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,603
I will grant your wish.

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,270
Anyone else?

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,279
Any objections?

101
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,119
Right now, throughout the entire court,

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,594
only Your Highness is fit

103
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:09,750
to inherit the throne.

104
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:10,719
Yes.

105
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,559
You excel in both civil
and military affairs.

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,754
You have great qualities.

107
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,087
We are willing to support Your Highness!

108
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,430
Master,

109
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,390
the old Xia troops have gathered.

110
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,070
They are heading toward the palace.

111
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,030
Good.

112
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,092
Meet up with them at once.

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,283
Yes, sir.

114
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,870
We finally made it to this day.

115
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,438
The Third Prince will ascend
the throne tomorrow.

116
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,016
Ministers,

117
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,759
do you have any objections?

118
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,190
We have no objections.

119
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,625
Uncle,

120
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:44,950
what should we do?

121
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,967
Brother.

122
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:54,896
I really can't keep up this act anymore.

123
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:58,150
Ha-ha-ha!

124
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,194
Ha-ha-ha!

125
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,199
Father.

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,550
Thank goodness!

127
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,896
I was so worried about you.

128
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,470
I'm fine, Yue.

129
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:11,430
Your Majesty,

130
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,527
weren't you supposed to...

131
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:15,047
Supposed to what?

132
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:17,910
Supposed to have eaten
that poisoned dish you made?

133
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,127
No.

134
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,399
Then what was it?

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,225
Your Majesty.

136
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:42,185
Spare me, please.

137
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:43,879
I made a silly mistake!

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,719
Your Majesty.

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,430
You really underestimated me.

140
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,519
Father.

141
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,123
I was wrong.

142
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:51,379
Take Consort Xiao, the Third Prince,
and their conspirators to the prison.

143
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,465
They will await punishment.

144
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,230
- Have mercy, Your Majesty!
- Father!

145
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,905
- Please, Your Majesty!
- I was wrong, Father!

146
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,799
Spare me, Your Majesty!

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,572
- Father! Have mercy!
- Your Majesty! Please!

148
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,070
- Have mercy, Your Majesty!
- Please, Your Majesty!

149
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,719
(Imperial Study)

150
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,630
Father,

151
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,430
what's going on here?

152
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:18,114
Your Majesty.

153
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:21,030
I heard you had
suddenly fallen gravely ill,

154
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,705
so I came to visit.

155
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:24,710
Is Your Majesty feeling any better?

156
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,950
I'm fine.

157
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,283
Mother,

158
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:29,065
you won't believe it.

159
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:32,150
Consort Xiao and the Third Prince
actually tried to seize the throne.

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,430
Father could've beheaded them.

161
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:35,892
Is that true?

162
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:36,710
Mm.

163
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,270
Your Majesty.

164
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,639
My father wrote in his letter

165
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,710
that the twin fish

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,772
refers to Noble Consort Chen.

167
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,950
Gu Yuqing.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,230
What nonsense is that?

169
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,750
How could my mother
be connected to the twin fish?

170
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,799
Come in,

171
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,590
broker.

172
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,581
At your service, Your Majesty.

173
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,830
Stand and speak.

174
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,270
Do you recognize this symbol?

175
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:05,763
Yes.

176
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:08,336
The crest of the Crown Prince's manor
from the previous dynasty.

177
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,203
All the guards there had this tattoo.

178
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:13,536
Tell us everything you know.

179
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,559
I was a palace maid

180
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,398
in Taiqing Palace
during the former dynasty.

181
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,359
I served Crown Prince Yang Wen.

182
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,936
Yang Wen had a pair of twins,

183
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,403
a son and a daughter

184
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,341
His Majesty was very fond of them.

185
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:26,727
He had an artist draw

186
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,679
a crest for twins.

187
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,994
It was those two fish.

188
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:32,790
It's been ages.

189
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,559
Do you

190
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,990
still recognize them?

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,590
I only remember the princess
had a red birthmark on her back.

192
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,790
You may leave.

193
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:47,918
Yes, Your Majesty.

194
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,910
My Consort,

195
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:56,110
do you have a red birthmark
on your body?

196
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:57,883
Father,

197
00:09:57,884 --> 00:09:59,012
what are you talking about?

198
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,670
Brother.

199
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,950
Don't move.

200
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,630
You're right.

201
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,670
We are the twin fish.

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,879
We are the Crown Prince's princess

203
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,687
and prince from the former dynasty.

204
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,399
Gu Yuqing,

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,919
I must hand it to you.

206
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,238
You almost ruined our grand plan.

207
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:26,510
The Twin Fish Iron Army
is right outside.

208
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,430
All I have to do is give the order,

209
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,110
and they will storm in.

210
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,559
They will wipe out...

211
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,510
Brother!
