00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,286
Nobody move.

4
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,255
You trespassed
into a government-sealed mine,

5
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:59,055
released the spirit of the Lady Gu,

6
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:02,481
and endangered the people,
causing chaos throughout Nandian.

7
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,055
Unforgivable crimes.

8
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,206
Seize them.

9
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,166
Careful!

10
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:31,136
Xiao Ye!

11
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,095
You've been poisoned by me.

12
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:36,966
If you use your inner force again,
you'll die instantly.

13
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:43,244
Inhale this.
It will neutralize the poison.

14
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,633
But it'll take an hour
for your inner strength to return.

15
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:46,407
Now,

16
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:47,735
Take Xiaojuzi and leave.

17
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:48,935
If we all stay here,

18
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,046
none of us will escape.

19
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,052
No, Princess.

20
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,246
- I'm your guard!
- Enough!

21
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:56,907
I am a princess.

22
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,321
They won't dare lay a finger on me.

23
00:01:58,322 --> 00:01:59,520
I heard from my royal father

24
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,966
that Governor Cao
has already arrived in Nandian.

25
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,006
Go now and get reinforcements.

26
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:05,686
Hurry.

27
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,369
I am Princess Li Lingyue of the empire.

28
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,974
I'd like to see
which of you dares touch me.

29
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:20,895
Hmph.

30
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:23,217
The Ninth Princess is of noble blood.

31
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:24,495
She should be safe in the palace.

32
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:26,615
How could she possibly
be here in Nandian?

33
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,940
You're just a wicked woman,
lawless and wild.

34
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,166
And you dare impersonate
a princess? Arrest her!

35
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:42,366
Xiaojuzi.

36
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,044
Go find Governor Cao and call for help.

37
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,166
What about you?

38
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:47,126
I can't leave the princess. Go!

39
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,895
The court is trying
the Lady Gu's accomplices!

40
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,326
Everyone, come and watch!

41
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:56,455
This woman

42
00:02:56,456 --> 00:03:00,286
has been impersonating a princess
and poisoning people in Nandian.

43
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:03,846
These two villains
are the Lady Gu's accomplices.

44
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,655
Now, they've finally been captured.

45
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,566
For the sake of public peace,

46
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,886
I will sentence them to death by fire.

47
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,010
- Yes!
- Burn them!

48
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:15,127
- Burn them!
- From now on,

49
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,563
- Burn them all!
- you can finally live in peace.

50
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:19,166
Remember this.

51
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,543
If you discover any suspicious people,

52
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,263
Little Diviner.

53
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:23,600
you must report them to the authorities.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Aren't you supposed to be all-powerful
and able to tell fortunes?

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,975
Tell me, can we escape this?

56
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:29,015
We must eliminate these demons,

57
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:31,160
- Since we can't escape this fate,
- only then can the people

58
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,720
- we might as well face it.
- live a good life.

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,175
Everyone,

60
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,344
- only then can we truly live in peace.
- Do you regret it?

61
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:37,015
What's there to regret?

62
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,575
If any of you discover
these demons' accomplices,

63
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,015
You could have escaped with Xiao Ye.

64
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,455
or any suspicious people

65
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,358
You're no different.

66
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:45,400
ask you about

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,580
- If it weren't for us holding you back,
- other information

68
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,846
- you might've already gotten away.
- or anything strange,

69
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:53,920
- You're not like the rumors say.
- you can report it to the authorities.

70
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,395
If there really is reliable information,

71
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:58,055
Dying with you would be worth it.

72
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:01,539
- At least we'd have each other in the afterlife.
- the authorities will reward you accordingly.

73
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,206
- Though you usually act cold, aloof and unkind.
- Everyone understand now?

74
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,535
Still,

75
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:08,055
These devils...

76
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:09,766
Since you're not too bad-looking,

77
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,881
I suppose I'll settle for you.

78
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:13,921
Many thanks for the honor, Princess.

79
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:17,646
I too feel that being able to accompany
Your Highness on the road to the underworld

80
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,228
makes this trip worthwhile.

81
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:23,526
Time's up. Begin the execution.

82
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,306
Light the fire!

83
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:39,286
Xiao!

84
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:40,286
Princess!

85
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:41,610
I'm sorry I'm late.

86
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,775
Be careful of that official, Li Sen.
He's highly skilled in martial arts.

87
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:45,935
Perfect timing.

88
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:48,166
I'll send you all to hell together.

89
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,166
Seize them!

90
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,655
Useless.

91
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:14,006
A bunch of useless fools.

92
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,432
It's the Twin Fish.

93
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:24,499
That symbol again.

94
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,757
Arrest Li Sen and his accomplices!

95
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:43,477
Princess, are you hurt?

96
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,135
I'm fine.

97
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,063
Princess!

98
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,317
I arrived too late to protect you.

99
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:49,583
Please forgive me, Princess.

100
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:50,446
Rise.

101
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:51,366
Go.

102
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:53,806
Interrogate that official, Li Sen.

103
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:55,206
Thank you, Princess.

104
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,206
Bold Li Sen, how dare you
attempt to harm the Princess?

105
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,850
Do you not admit your guilt?

106
00:06:02,118 --> 00:06:04,566
I didn't know she was the Princess.

107
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:05,828
Besides,

108
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:06,992
ignorance is

109
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:07,921
no crime.

110
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:08,668
You...

111
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,170
Then I'll make sure you confess.

112
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:11,739
Xiaojuzi.

113
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:16,406
Li Sen.

114
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,548
You've ruined my life.

115
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,717
You murdered Zhong Dagao

116
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,466
and framed Xiu for the crime.

117
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,095
You even fabricated
the entire Lady Gu tale.

118
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,246
Just your words?

119
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:35,726
That counts as evidence?

120
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,535
The way you killed Zhong Dagao

121
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,454
is exactly the same as
how you killed those soldiers just now.

122
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:47,206
That's right.

123
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,019
The fracture in Zhong Dagao's
neck was identical.

124
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,646
There were no signs
of poisoning in his remains.

125
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:57,397
He was killed by a powerful,
swift strike that crushed his bones.

126
00:06:58,531 --> 00:06:59,895
This is a frame-up!

127
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:03,401
Then explain the poison found in your room,
the same one used to frame Xiu.

128
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:04,906
How do you explain that?

129
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,326
You.

130
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,646
You pretended
to help Lady Gu's spirit return.

131
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,895
And tricked those infected
with the Gu poison

132
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,935
into drinking
your so-called divine water,

133
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,486
and wearing your talismans.

134
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:23,246
Those all contained
the deadly poison Qianji Powder.

135
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,646
All of this

136
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:26,775
was your doing, wasn't it?

137
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:28,134
Have mercy, Princess!

138
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:29,872
It was him.

139
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,015
It was all Li Sen's idea.

140
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,570
He ordered me to do it.

141
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:33,606
It was him.

142
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:37,370
He made me sell the talismans
and the miracle water.

143
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,126
And collected money from the townsfolk.

144
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,295
I only took a tiny bit of silver.

145
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,535
The majority

146
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,241
was all taken by Li Sen!

147
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:45,499
If I didn't obey,

148
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,906
he said he'd kill me!

149
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:54,526
Well done, Li Sen.

150
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:57,695
You're just a petty
seventh-rank county magistrate,

151
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:59,646
earning only thirty taels a year,

152
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,512
yet you bought dozens
of estates in the capital!

153
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:04,112
And you still deny it?

154
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:05,650
He's corrupted

155
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,166
and murderous! Kill him!

156
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,072
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

157
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,086
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

158
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,015
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

159
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,815
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

160
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:12,659
- Lord Cao!
- Kill him!

161
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,388
Spare me.

162
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,477
Please, spare me!

163
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,343
I was just confused for a moment!

164
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,254
Were you really
just confused for a moment?

165
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,846
I don't know what you're talking about.

166
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,785
The incense burner in your study

167
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:25,681
and the cave on Tianling Mountain
that you wouldn't let anyone approach.

168
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:26,926
On the weapons inside,

169
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:28,946
they all bear the Twin Fish symbol.

170
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,126
Tell me.

171
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:37,286
What does

172
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:38,526
Twin Fish represent?

173
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:40,126
If you tell the truth,

174
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,006
I will spare your life.

175
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,486
Fine.

176
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,063
I'll tell.

177
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:50,966
I...

178
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:55,686
Watch out!

179
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,077
Catch the assassin!

180
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,543
Hurry, catch the assassin!

181
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:06,317
Qifeng greets Your Highness
the Noble Consort.

182
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:11,259
Prince Qifeng, what unfortunate timing.

183
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,646
Yue'er is not in the palace.

184
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,080
I came here specifically
to visit you, Your Highness.

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,752
In just over a month,
I'll be marrying Yue'er.

186
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,295
To thank Your Highness for raising her,

187
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,526
I've prepared a small gift.

188
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:25,446
Yun Cang's golden-thread orchid
promotes beauty and longevity.

189
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:26,646
Please accept it.

190
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:29,146
How thoughtful of you.

191
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,606
I'm glad Your Highness likes it.

192
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,108
The Emperor and I have
seen your devotion to Yue'er.

193
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:36,846
Having her marry you

194
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:38,583
puts our minds at ease.

195
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,952
I thank the Emperor
and Your Highness for your blessing.

196
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:45,326
That girl has been spoiled
by the Emperor and me.

197
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,814
Who knows where she's off
to playing around again?

198
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,583
I, Qifeng,
enjoy meeting people far and wide.

199
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,628
I've made some friends
in the martial world.

200
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,863
I believe finding
the Princess won't be too difficult.

201
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,206
Then I'll leave it to you.

202
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,637
However,

203
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,446
Yue'er has always been willful.

204
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:05,855
What if she refuses to return with you?

205
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,086
Does Your Highness have a solution?

206
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,686
Here, take this.

207
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,015
This is...

208
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:21,214
Yue'er was born
with a congenital poison.

209
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:24,681
This antidote was developed
by her master, Wan Nianqing.

210
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:27,988
Her condition
only improved because of it.

211
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:31,219
But it only alleviated the symptoms.

212
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:34,157
Every six months, it will still recur.

213
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,006
And that time is almost upon us.

214
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:40,086
You might find this useful.

215
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:41,406
Understood.

216
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,175
Thanks to Ninth Princess
and Young Master Gu

217
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:50,166
for uncovering
the witchcraft case in Nandian.

218
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,486
Justice has been served for the people.

219
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:55,086
This is truly satisfying.

220
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,570
Young Master.

221
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:58,699
Young Master.

222
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,712
Uncle Da?

223
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:01,486
Young Master.

224
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:04,046
Young Master.

225
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,686
I finally found you.

226
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,130
Uncle Da, why are you here?

227
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,397
You've been gone so long without word,

228
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:10,935
how could I not worry?

229
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,386
Sorry, I forgot
to send a letter to ease your mind.

230
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,406
Ninth Princess,

231
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,283
this matter of the tens of thousands
of missing weapons

232
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:19,375
from Tianling Mountain in Nandian

233
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:20,766
is of great importance.

234
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:23,495
I have already drafted a secret memorial

235
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,406
to report to His Majesty.

236
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,766
Good. Then I'll entrust
the investigation of the weapons

237
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,295
to you, Lord Cao.

238
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:31,246
Hmm.

239
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,526
Guards.

240
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:35,317
Mount a fast horse at once.

241
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:37,886
Deliver this memorial
to the imperial palace.

242
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,246
Yes.

243
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:44,655
Lord Cao, there's still one mystery left
in the Nandian witchcraft case.

244
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:46,695
Li Sen kept a memorial tablet
for Master Yang at home.

245
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:48,632
Who is this Master Yang?

246
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,646
Master Yang...

247
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:55,526
Could it be referring to Master Baiyang?

248
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:57,846
The former Crown Prince, Yang Wen,

249
00:11:57,856 --> 00:11:59,846
known as Master Baiyang,

250
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,766
has been dead for thirty years.

251
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:04,126
When the former dynasty fell,

252
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,726
he set fire to himself

253
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,166
in the palace.

254
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:10,166
Master Baiyang?

255
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:13,846
Master Baiyang...

256
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:15,886
(Could it be that the Nandian case)

257
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,546
(is linked to the former dynasty?)

258
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:47,346
(The memorial)

259
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:10,066
(Leicheng)
