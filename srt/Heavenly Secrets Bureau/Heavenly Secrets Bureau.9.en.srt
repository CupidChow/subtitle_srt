00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,390
Young master.

4
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:55,590
Come here.

5
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,970
Putting on such a show.

6
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:01,516
There's no such thing as God of Thunder.

7
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,139
God of Thunder.

8
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,019
Protect the people.

9
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,059
Ward off evil spirits.

10
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,290
Protect Leicheng.

11
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,919
God of Thunder.

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,059
- Protect the people.
- Please protect us, God of Thunder.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,730
- Ward off evil spirits. Protect Leicheng.
- Please protect us, God of Thunder.

14
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,058
Twin fish?

15
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:36,636
Get up.

16
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:39,436
God of Thunder.

17
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,570
Jeez.

18
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,370
That darn Jia Si promised to deliver a cart
of salt to the tavern in three days.

19
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:52,490
Now it's already the third day.

20
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,499
Look at the time.

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,583
Not a single sack of salt in sight!

22
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,050
Young master, please eat something.

23
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,139
Young master,

24
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,770
do you like the Ninth Princess?

25
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,370
No.

26
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,410
That's good.

27
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,650
The Ninth Princess is of royal birth.

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,459
She's going to marry Prince Qifeng.

29
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,650
Nothing will happen between you.

30
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,130
You misunderstood, Mr. Da.

31
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,290
I only want to clear my father's name.

32
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,770
I have no other intentions.

33
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,943
That's good.

34
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,418
Eat and rest early.

35
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:19,081
Twin fish bring disaster
to the nation.

36
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,410
Who is it?

37
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,570
Can you stop pestering me?

38
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,650
This is for you.

39
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,250
What's this?

40
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:42,747
Poinsettia.

41
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:45,245
It only grows in my country,
the Yuncang State.

42
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,170
Beautiful, isn't it?

43
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:49,512
I know you want something from me.

44
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:51,272
What are you plotting?

45
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,321
I know you like to study
poisonous plants.

46
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,379
This flower

47
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,627
is highly toxic.

48
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,361
Very well.

49
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:01,876
Aren't you afraid
I'll poison you with it?

50
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,370
No.

51
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,690
I've lived among venomous snakes
since I was little.

52
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,810
I'm immune to all poisons.

53
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,899
And you,

54
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,890
you're the disciple
of the Huasheng State's poison master.

55
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,859
We're meant to be a perfect pair.

56
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,441
You!

57
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:17,579
We aren't meant to be a pair.
Don't flatter yourself.

58
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,707
I've already decided.

59
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,316
Once we're married,

60
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,432
I'll help you study every poison
in the world.

61
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,641
Won't that be wonderful?

62
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:25,730
Hold your horses.

63
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,570
If you like that, do it on your own.

64
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:29,872
Don't count me in.

65
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:30,579
I'm going to sleep.

66
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,236
Leave me alone.

67
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,632
Lingyue.

68
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:35,543
What must I do to please you?

69
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,201
That's easy.

70
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,516
Break off the engagement,
and stay far away from me.

71
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:41,910
See yourself out.

72
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,103
Why isn't he here yet?

73
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:06,299
Someone, please come!

74
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,050
Someone's dead!

75
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,770
Ahem.

76
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:18,290
It was the thunder fire
from the God of Thunder.

77
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:19,179
It burned...

78
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,970
It burned Batu.

79
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:26,850
Thunder fire?

80
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,250
Little Diviner, come look.

81
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,027
No soot

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,005
in his mouth or nose.

83
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,587
Are you saying

84
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:46,930
that he didn't die from the fire?

85
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:50,210
You two really think alike.

86
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,410
You're right.

87
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:59,170
Mr. Gu and I

88
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:03,130
are often very much in sync.

89
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,010
Sir,

90
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,365
who was the deceased?

91
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,414
His name was Batu,

92
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,365
a merchant from the North.

93
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,907
He came to Leicheng to buy salt.

94
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,503
He was waiting for someone named Jia Si,

95
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:17,174
who helped him transport a cart of salt.

96
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:17,979
Smuggling salt

97
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,370
is a serious crime.

98
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,850
They are outlaws.

99
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,090
Lingyue,

100
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,130
this is complicated.

101
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:28,481
For your safety,

102
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:30,890
I advise you not to get involved.

103
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,130
I'm afraid

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,579
someone might use you.

105
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,570
Will you stop already?

106
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:37,330
It's me who wants
to investigate the case.

107
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,307
Even if someone is used,
it'll be me using him.

108
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm very busy. I don't have time
to chat with you. Please leave.

109
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,610
Why are you defending him?

110
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:46,770
Don't forget, we're engaged.

111
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:49,660
What you're doing right now
is embarrassing me.

112
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,920
It also concerns the diplomatic ties
between our two states.

113
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,770
I...

114
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,179
God of Thunder.

115
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,165
It must be the God of Thunder!

116
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,979
Their illegal salt trade

117
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,530
has angered the God of Thunder.

118
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,650
No one

119
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:06,183
can escape his punishment.

120
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,218
Whom did you say he was waiting for?

121
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:11,218
Jia Si?

122
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:12,747
Jia Si.

123
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,699
I'm meeting Batu

124
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,619
for the handoff tonight.

125
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,072
Hurry up.

126
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:50,099
- Fire!
- Fire!

127
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,530
- Put out the fire!
- Fire!

128
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,179
- Run! Fire!
- Fire!

129
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,270
(God of Thunder Temple)

130
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,018
City Lord Sun,

131
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:07,170
why have you called me?

132
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,067
Your Highness,

133
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,645
the goods you asked for

134
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:11,850
are ready.

135
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,476
I just hope you'll keep your promise

136
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:18,298
and pay up soon.

137
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:21,419
I'm the prince of Cangyun.

138
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,939
You think I'd shortchange you?

139
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,890
Of course not.

140
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:30,610
Let me remind you, City Lord Sun.

141
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:33,170
I don't care about whatever deals
you're doing here

142
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,370
in Leicheng.

143
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:37,050
But you'd better not stand in my way.

144
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,263
Otherwise,

145
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,290
everything you've worked for
will go down the drain.

146
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:52,570
Sir,

147
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,401
you heard that.

148
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:55,179
Qifeng...

149
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,490
Stay calm.

150
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,610
It's not too late to act

151
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:00,370
after we get the payment for the salt.

152
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,610
Gu Yuqing and the Princess are
still investigating the thunder fire.

153
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,712
If they discover anything,

154
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,379
our effort will be wasted.

155
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,676
Why not kill them?

156
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,818
Foolish.

157
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,690
If we kill them now,

158
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:17,650
the imperial court will investigate.

159
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:21,387
Everything we're doing in Leicheng
will be exposed.

160
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,947
We'll only end up ruining Master's plan.

161
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:27,410
I'm just afraid

162
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:30,316
Leicheng will end up like Nandian.

163
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,970
Li Sen...

164
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,290
I've done him in.

165
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,739
Luckily, the weapons
were transported out

166
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,530
before he died.

167
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:43,930
Your task now is to watch
the deal with Qifeng

168
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,770
and make sure we receive the payment
quickly.

169
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:49,450
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,050
Now we have the weapons,

171
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:53,956
everything is ready,

172
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:55,694
except for the military funds.

173
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:58,743
Master's great cause

174
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:00,730
is just within reach.

175
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:06,343
Look closely, everyone.

176
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:07,410
This is

177
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:10,187
the fate of salt smugglers.

178
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:12,667
They angered the God of Thunder

179
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,299
and were struck by thunder fire,

180
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,370
reduced to ashes.

181
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,450
Why was the God of Thunder so angry?

182
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,245
Because someone outrageously sells

183
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,619
illegal salt

184
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,690
and disrupts the order of Leicheng.

185
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,765
Batu, the Hu merchant,
came here to buy illegal salt.

186
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,970
Jia Si, Wang Erma, and Zhang Laosan

187
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,894
were blind by greed

188
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,810
and made deals with him,

189
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,200
which brought down the wrath
of the God of Thunder

190
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,370
and he sent down thunder fire

191
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,770
to burn them alive.

192
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:48,512
To calm the God of Thunder's anger,

193
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:51,854
we have to offer the families
of these salt smugglers

194
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,561
as a sacrifice

195
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:56,365
to beg for his forgiveness

196
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:58,850
and ask him
to continue protecting Leicheng.

197
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,165
If anyone dares to smuggle salt again

198
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,538
and anger the God of Thunder,

199
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,241
they shall be severely punished.

200
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:09,903
These fools.

201
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:10,836
Xiao Ye,

202
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:12,427
follow them.

203
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,450
We'll go check Jia Si's house.

204
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:45,090
Torch.

205
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:53,819
Looks like these two fires

206
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,299
weren't accidents at all, and neither was
the so-called thunder fire punishment

207
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,770
from the God of Thunder.

208
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,490
Someone deliberately

209
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,667
set both fires.

210
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,779
Would Jia Si,

211
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,699
Wang Erma,

212
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,730
and Zhang Laosan

213
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:10,734
all die the same way

214
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,165
as Batu?

215
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:21,890
Where are you going, Little Diviner?
