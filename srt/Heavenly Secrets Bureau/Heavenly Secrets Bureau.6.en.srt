00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,890
Xiu? You mean Lady Gu?

4
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,219
She was a good person.

5
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,499
She knew medicine
and even saved my wife.

6
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,010
Unfortunately, her husband died young.

7
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,179
Leaving her a widow and child,

8
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,610
so pitiful.

9
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,170
Lady Gu, Xiu never actually died,

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,130
did she?

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,010
No, she didn't.

12
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,090
I thought you
were from the County Office,

13
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,930
so I lied to you.

14
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,619
So, this Xiu,

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,379
did she die or not?

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,370
Xiu was innocent.

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,650
I knew she would never harm anyone.

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,530
I was the executioner
at the County Office.

19
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,819
To save Xiu,

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,970
I came up with a plan.

21
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,970
Brother Wang,

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,890
I didn't kill Zhong Dagao.

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,170
I know.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,170
My daughter's still so young.
I don't want to die.

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,499
Shh.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,810
Listen to me.

27
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,619
Behind the gallows,

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,859
I secretly installed a pulley system.

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,659
I tied a rope to it.

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,859
The rope was tied around Xiu's waist.

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,859
When I carried out the execution,

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,379
the rope was pulled up.

33
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,330
Xiu was lifted into the air by the rope.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,979
Although the rope was at her neck,

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,810
it didn't actually strangle her.

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,419
But didn't Deputy Li notice?

37
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,330
Right.

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,770
Breath can be held in,

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,499
but not the pulse.

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,090
How did you manage that?

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,059
I secretly added trance powder

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,130
to the final drink before execution.

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,090
This was the execution wine.

44
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,250
Drink it.

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,490
Time's up. Carry out the execution.

46
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,819
After she drank it,
she entered a state of feigned death.

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,859
Her heartbeat and breathing stopped.

48
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,570
That fooled
both Deputy Li and the coroner.

49
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,539
There's a mountain near here,

50
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,099
Tianling Mine.
It used to belong to the authorities.

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,179
Later, a landslide
buried the mine tunnels.

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,050
The mine became deserted.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,890
I hid Xiu in the mountains.

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,450
Um...

55
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,650
There's something I've always wondered.

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,739
Why does Lady Gu's ghost

57
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,619
only return to Nandian on the third day
of the third lunar month?

58
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,090
Every single year?

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,770
Xiaojuzi, why don't you explain?

60
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,330
What do you mean?

61
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,490
What does this have to do with Xiaojuzi?

62
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,579
From the moment we entered Nandian,

63
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,290
I've been suspicious of her.

64
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,930
On the third of the third,
when Lady Gu returns,

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,290
the whole of Nandian Town was deserted.

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,410
But Xiaojuzi
was still out selling things.

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,859
Please come in.

68
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,690
Then she told us Lady Gu's story

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,659
and guided us
to stay at the ruined temple.

70
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,659
There's an abandoned temple
outside town.

71
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,370
If you've got nowhere to go,
you can rest there for the night.

72
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,090
Coincidentally,

73
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,490
that night, we ran into Lady Gu's ghost.

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,570
A ghost!

75
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,970
Wasn't it you dressed up as Lady Gu?

76
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,219
This must be the ghost of Lady Gu

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,010
that Xiaojuzi spoke of.

78
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,690
That night,
I found footprints at the scene.

79
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,290
And those prints

80
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,099
matched the size

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,530
of Xiaojuzi's shoes.

82
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,099
And during our investigation
of the drunkard

83
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,970
and the peddler, all along the way,

84
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,610
you were secretly following us.

85
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,330
Speak. What exactly is your purpose?

86
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,210
Actually,

87
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,890
Xiu is my mother.

88
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,970
The third of the third

89
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,770
is my birthday.

90
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,650
On the third of the third,

91
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,050
when spring blossoms bloom,
my mother comes home again.

92
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,610
What a beautiful song.

93
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,767
Let me go!

94
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:22,619
Xiaojuzi!

95
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,780
Zhong Dagao came to our home
to take shelter from the rain.

96
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,690
My mother kindly let him stay.

97
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,932
But Li Sen
falsely accused her of murder.

98
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,330
Mum!

99
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,370
Mum!

100
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:33,979
Mum!

101
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,930
Xiaojuzi!

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,264
Xiaojuzi!

103
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:36,749
Mum!

104
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,019
Xiaojuzi!

105
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,794
Mum...

106
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,836
Mum...

107
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,330
Let me go!

108
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:49,450
Let me go!

109
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,506
Mum!

110
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,815
Mum!

111
00:05:58,713 --> 00:05:59,579
Let me go!

112
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,579
My mother was wronged.

113
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,210
I did everything I could
to clear her name.

114
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:06,333
Thankfully, Heaven has eyes

115
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,172
and sent the three of you to me.

116
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:12,099
I've seen
Young Master Gu's compass before.

117
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,160
It belongs to Lord Gu
of the Heavenly Secrets Bureau.

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,170
He's been to Nandian.

119
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,040
Young Master Li carries acupuncture
needles and medicine bottles,

120
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,739
he knows medicine.

121
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,920
If we are to reopen the witchcraft case,
the authorities will surely try to stop us.

122
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,884
But with Brother Xiao's martial prowess,
he'll surely see us through danger.

123
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,459
So,

124
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,819
I deliberately told the story
of Lady Gu's return,

125
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,610
to get your attention.

126
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,530
Take us inside.

127
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,010
Mum...

128
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,970
Mum.

129
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,250
Mum.

130
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,210
Young Master Gu and the others
will clear our names.

131
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,370
Thank you.

132
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,250
Thank you.

133
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,459
Thank you all
for helping my mother and me.

134
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,099
No need to be so polite.

135
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,219
For our young master, this kind of thing

136
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,810
is as easy as lifting a hand.

137
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,010
Don't boast.

138
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,090
Right, there's one more strange thing.

139
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,450
There are many people
hiding in the mountains.

140
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,619
At night, there are clanging noises

141
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,939
like mining and blacksmithing.

142
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,090
Wait a second.

143
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,490
Wasn't this mountain
officially sealed off long ago?

144
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,170
Are you sure you heard right?

145
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,290
The echoes in these mountains are loud.

146
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,130
Every night it's noisy.

147
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,170
I heard it loud and clear.

148
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,339
Not just the sound of wheels,

149
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,650
but footsteps too.

150
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,770
And voices.

151
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,939
Since we're already here,

152
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,170
why don't we

153
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,659
go take a look?

154
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,339
There's absolutely no need for that.

155
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,610
Shut up.

156
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,610
What's wrong?

157
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,570
Scared?

158
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,179
Let's go.

159
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,610
I'll take you there.

160
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,090
Alright.

161
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,101
Xiao Ye.

162
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:15,508
Huh?

163
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:16,960
You walk in front and protect Xiaojuzi.

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,739
I'm not going.
I don't know the way anyway.

165
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,290
Then maybe you can go feed the wolves.

166
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,003
Hey.

167
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,210
Hey...

168
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:24,584
Come on, seriously.

169
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:25,554
Give it here.

170
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:26,659
Let's go.

171
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,570
Lead the way.

172
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,330
Oh dear.

173
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:32,908
Wait a moment.

174
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,103
The axle is five feet long.

175
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,290
And it was carrying something heavy.

176
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,330
The marks are fresh.

177
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,930
Not long ago,

178
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,490
a total of twelve carts left here.

179
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,810
One of the carts

180
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,930
went in a different direction.

181
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,899
Here.

182
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,930
This is the place Xiu mentioned,
they're forging iron here.

183
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,019
I've seen this symbol before,
on the incense burner in Li Sen's home.

184
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,370
Two fish.

185
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,330
Could it be

186
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,770
a weapons workshop?

187
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,050
That's impossible.

188
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,659
The weapons workshop is in the capital.
Why would it be in Nandian?

189
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,010
Then isn't this...

190
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,600
The mine has been officially
closed for four years,

191
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:05,730
yet a group of people
has been smelting iron here all along.

192
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,735
And judging by the quantity,

193
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,419
at least tens of thousands
of items were shipped out.

194
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,524
But there hasn't been
any war in recent years.

195
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,300
There's no need for that many weapons.

196
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,850
Which means...

197
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,362
They're forging these weapons
for some other purpose.

198
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:21,426
Tens of thousands?

199
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,659
Xiao Ye.

200
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,219
Hmm?

201
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,530
How many troops
are in the Imperial Guard?

202
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,539
About fifty thousand.

203
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,819
However,

204
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,850
His Majesty promotes peace and rest.

205
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:34,130
Most of the soldiers
have returned home to farm.

206
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,972
So currently,
the number of active troops

207
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,099
is around twenty thousand.

208
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,708
Twenty thousand?

209
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,739
(Father left this note for me)

210
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,250
(to bring me to Nandian.)

211
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,410
(What was he trying to tell me?)

212
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,051
(Double Fish is secretly using
the Tianling Mountain mine to forge weapons)

213
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:59,747
(and even set up a trap in Leicheng.)

214
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:02,050
- (My son, hurry to Leicheng.)
- Double Fish...

215
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:04,428
Leicheng?

216
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,330
Little Mystic,

217
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,890
this message was written with tea.

218
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,930
The tannin in tea
turns black when it meets iron.

219
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,010
And this is an iron-forging place.

220
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,490
There's iron vapour floating in the air.

221
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,419
So when we entered the cave,

222
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,330
the writing became visible.

223
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,090
Your father...

224
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,970
Who exactly is he?

225
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,370
He's well-versed in the Book of Changes,
and also knows a bit of Taiyi Divination.

226
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,859
Your father's impressive.

227
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,530
Quite something, really.

228
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,644
The princess is impressive too.

229
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:40,819
Nothing special.

230
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,970
Nobody move.
