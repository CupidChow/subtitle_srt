00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,290
Your Highness.

4
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,410
There's a ghostly presence.

5
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,610
Ghost my foot!

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,610
Stand straight.

7
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,650
Hold the lantern.

8
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,610
There's only burned wood here.

9
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,459
No human bones at all.

10
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,490
Hmm?

11
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,090
Search more carefully.

12
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,050
There's really nothing.

13
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,619
She's Lady Gu reborn.

14
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,850
Why won't you believe it?

15
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,139
Stop!

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,939
Stop!

17
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,090
Who's there?

18
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,890
You three

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,539
dug up Lady Gu's grave

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,290
and released her spirit.

21
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,579
Yet you still want to run.

22
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,195
It's a grave offense.

23
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,357
Arrest them!

24
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,610
I'd like to see you try!

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,939
Come with me.

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,410
Let's go, Your Highness. Come on.

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,770
Who are you?

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,370
Xiao Juzi?

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,650
County officers are everywhere outside.

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,419
If you don't mind,

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,979
you can hide at my house.

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,619
Of course we don't mind.

33
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,120
No matter how shabby, your place
is better than a ruined temple.

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,250
Right, sir? Let's go.

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,619
Then...

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,570
Sorry for the trouble, Ms. Xiao Juzi.

37
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,010
Let's go.

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,479
Okay. Follow me.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,699
(Bless and Protect the People)

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,770
- A new notice. Let's check it out.
- A new notice. Check it out.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,810
These three are followers of Lady Gu.

42
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,179
(Wanted Notice)
They released her ghost.

43
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,320
It's a grave offense.

44
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,219
They're wanted citywide.

45
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,699
No one may shelter them.

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,459
If you find them,
report to authorities immediately!

47
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,850
Or you'll be punished for hiding them.

48
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,099
Is anyone home?

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,250
Anyone home?

50
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,810
Coming!

51
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,379
Have you seen
any suspicious people lately?

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,530
No.

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,459
Anyone else inside?

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,779
No, I live alone.

55
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,890
There's no one else.

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,736
If you see Lady Gu's followers,
report to the authorities immediately.

57
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,640
Don't shelter them.

58
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,130
I'll keep an eye out.

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,530
Take care, officers.

60
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,250
Come on out.

61
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:42,170
Thank you for saving us.

62
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:43,250
Thank you.

63
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:44,450
Sir.

64
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:47,370
A female ghost found us at night.

65
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,530
Officers are chasing us in the day.

66
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:50,759
At this rate,

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,730
we're doomed sooner or later.

68
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:54,330
What's there to fear?

69
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:55,392
You can fight the soldiers,

70
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:56,410
And he'll handle the ghost.

71
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,410
The officials are after us

72
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,812
because we're Lady Gu's followers

73
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,610
and we released her ghost.

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,327
Doesn't that seem strange?

75
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,658
What's so strange about that?

76
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,047
Those said to be poisoned

77
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:12,271
were poisoned two, three years ago.

78
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,650
The toxins should be long gone.

79
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,250
Why are they

80
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,556
still affected by Gu poison?

81
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,810
When you put it that way, it is strange.

82
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,739
According to toxicology,

83
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,170
the human body can clear
most toxins within six months.

84
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,210
It won't be delayed for so long.

85
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:32,979
I remember now.

86
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,379
Every year the Great Shaman
performs rituals for those poisoned.

87
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,539
She gives them holy water and talismans,

88
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,370
claiming they'll protect them
and ward evil away.

89
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,090
This is it.

90
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:00,490
- Something's wrong with this talisman.
- What's wrong with it?

91
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,864
It smells like devil's trumpet.

92
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,927
What is devil's trumpet?

93
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,579
It's a sedative and a hallucinogen.

94
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,210
Long-term use causes chronic poisoning.

95
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:17,010
You'll get dizziness,
confusion and hallucinations.

96
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:20,548
Same symptoms as those
supposedly poisoned with Gu poison.

97
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,180
I get it now.

98
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,370
Great Shaman has been

99
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:27,136
slowly poisoning them with talismans

100
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,730
containing devil's trumpet.

101
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:30,370
She's back.

102
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,610
Devil's trumpet again.

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,810
In Zhong Dagao's case,

104
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:41,460
Deputy Magistrate Li
charged Lady Gu, Xiu.

105
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:45,770
He claimed she used Gu poison
to kill Zhong Dagao,

106
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,899
but your autopsy showed

107
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,570
he died from a broken neck.

108
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,780
This proves Lady Gu is innocent.

109
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,299
And that girl's illness

110
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,276
was caused by the toxin
from Ghostface Butterfly's scales.

111
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:57,810
It has nothing to do with Gu poison.

112
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,189
Then there's the drunk and the vendor.

113
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,499
They were poisoned
from drinking well water poisoned

114
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,666
with devil's trumpet.

115
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,308
It has nothing to do
with Lady Gu Xiu or Gu poison.

116
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:10,651
Instead, it was Great Shaman

117
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:12,859
who used talismans and holy water

118
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,410
with devil's trumpet poison
to control the victims.

119
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,850
And he

120
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,810
was trusted by Deputy Magistrate Li.

121
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,450
Could it be...

122
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,570
that this was a conspiracy
they planned together?

123
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,819
That's why Deputy Magistrate Li
is in a hurry to arrest us.

124
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,530
He even labeled us Lady Gu's accomplices

125
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,979
just to stop us from investigating

126
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,130
and exposing them.

127
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
There must be something wrong
with Deputy Magistrate Li.

128
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,570
One more thing.

129
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,699
Lady Gu Xiu was executed

130
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,090
in front of everyone.

131
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,250
If she survived,

132
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,130
how did she make it out alive?

133
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,890
One person

134
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,770
will know the truth.

135
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,819
Who?

136
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,890
The executioner.

137
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,850
Huh?

138
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,290
The executioner?

139
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,890
I know him.

140
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,979
What are we waiting for then?
Let's split up.

141
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,099
Xiao Ye investigates Li,

142
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,570
while we find the executioner.

143
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,450
Yes.

144
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,330
A pattern of two fish.

145
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,190
(Mr. Yang's Memorial Tablet)

146
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,730
Who is this Mr. Yang?

147
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,050
This is the datura
Her Highness spoke of.

148
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,650
Property deeds.

149
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,450
So many residences were purchased.

150
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,410
Sir.

151
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,179
Someone found
the items in the secret room.

152
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,939
Should we capture him now?

153
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,339
Did he come alone?

154
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,170
Yes.

155
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,570
Follow him.

156
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,770
Capture them all.

157
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,530
Who are you looking for?

158
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,530
Did you execute Xiu?

159
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,890
Yes.

160
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,130
Xiu really died?

161
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,219
Yes. When I pulled the rope,

162
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,850
she was hanged up.

163
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,970
Her feet was off the ground.
She stopped breathing.

164
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,650
Deputy Magistrate Li
and the coroner confirmed it.

165
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,010
Xiu is definitely dead.

166
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,608
In the basement
of Deputy Magistrate Li's study,

167
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:55,919
I found scorpions,

168
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:59,050
snakes and insects I couldn't name.

169
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,530
There were also

170
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,567
these property deeds.

171
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,650
This Li Sen

172
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,699
grows poisonous flowers

173
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,210
and breeds toxic insects.

174
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,530
Li Sen,

175
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,099
a seventh-rank official.

176
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,810
He makes 30 taels a year.

177
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,050
He was appointed
as Nandian's deputy magistrate.

178
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,330
Vice Minister Chen recommended him.

179
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,899
My uncle recommended him?

180
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,730
Yes.

181
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,772
He's a seventh-rank official

182
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:31,119
earning 20 to 30 taels a year.

183
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,459
How could he afford
to buy so much property?

184
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,416
Every year, people have to pay fees

185
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,299
for the ghost-expelling rituals.

186
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,050
I paid three taels.

187
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,259
Seems like Li Sen used Lady Gu's return

188
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,050
to poison the people

189
