=Episode 12=

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
Inform the salt farm

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,359
to process all remaining salt

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,640
within two days.

6
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,679
City lord,

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,039
I'll see to it now.

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,160
Wait.

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,720
Tell them this.

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,800
If they can't finish it in time,

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,893
I'll chop off their heads.

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,479
Yes,

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,600
sir.

14
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:29,050
Please eat something.

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,742
You haven't eaten all day.

16
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:44,857
I must help Gu Yuqing

17
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,857
finish what he couldn't do.

18
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,613
You want to help Mr. Gu

19
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:56,860
clear his father's name?

20
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:57,800
Yes.

21
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,960
But before that,

22
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,617
I need to find out

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,000
the truth behind the thunder fire.

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
Indeed.

25
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:13,346
That fire was strange.

26
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:15,720
He once said

27
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,026
the iron rod attracts lightning,

28
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:21,693
and lightning ignites powder.

29
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,017
But where does the powder

30
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,133
come from?

31
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,776
I'm a mason.

32
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:32,546
This place is under renovation.

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,040
Your Highness,

34
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,760
I know where the powder came from.

35
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:40,040
It must've been that mason.

36
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:42,280
He was acting weird that day.
He's suspicious.

37
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:45,480
Let's go.

38
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:46,560
Let's go.

39
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,120
Lingyue,

40
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:57,372
I hope you'll leave Leicheng
as soon as possible.

41
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,440
I'll assign men to escort you
back to the palace.

42
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:00,736
No need.

43
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,639
Leicheng is more complicated
than you imagine.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,120
I'm doing this for your own good.

45
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:04,799
Prince Qifeng,

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,523
you'd best worry about yourself.

47
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:07,634
What do you mean?

48
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,600
You know exactly what I mean.

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,520
What's your intention
coming to Leicheng?

50
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:17,320
I came here

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,999
for you, of course.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,280
For me?

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,440
Do you think I'd believe that?

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,240
You must have another reason.

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
What are you hiding?

56
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:32,880
There's nothing for me to hide.

57
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Is that so?

58
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:37,360
Hope so.

59
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:39,280
Let's go.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,714
Don't use it

61
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:49,480
unless you really have to.

62
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,200
This is the antidote created
by his master, Wan Nianqing.

63
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,040
My hunch tells me

64
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:04,800
Gu Yuqing

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,920
is still alive.

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,480
Well...

67
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,204
That's impossible.

68
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,653
The explosion was massive.

69
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:16,520
No matter how amazing he is,
he wouldn't have survived.

70
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,120
It's better to be cautious.

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
Send men to search the ruin
for his body.

72
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:25,551
I want him found,

73
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:27,080
dead or alive.

74
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,400
Yes, sir. I'll send them right away.

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,360
Even if we have to turn the whole place
upside down, we'll find Gu Yuqing's body.

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,280
Where are we supposed to start?

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,656
Mister, excuse me.

78
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:11,336
Yes?

79
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,474
May I ask you something?

80
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:13,101
Sure.

81
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:14,640
My roof is leaking.

82
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,199
I'm looking for a mason to fix it,
but I have no idea where to find one.

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,059
Go to the tile market on the east side
of the city. There are plenty there.

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,502
You can try your luck.

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,400
Thank you.

86
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:25,080
Let's go.

87
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,607
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find a mason?

88
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:33,554
No idea.

89
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:34,880
Thank you.

90
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,856
Excuse me.

91
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,674
Do you know where I can find a mason?

92
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:39,563
Don't know.

93
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,892
Mister, can I ask,

94
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:42,199
where can I find a mason?

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,089
No idea.

96
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,360
- I don't know.
- I'm not sure.

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,057
Don't know.

98
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,288
No idea.

99
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,670
Sir, serve tea.

100
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:56,977
Please have a seat.

101
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,839
Please enjoy.

102
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,680
Thank you.

103
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,600
Your Highness, drink some tea.

104
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,181
We can't keep searching like this.

105
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:17,139
Leicheng is huge.

106
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,359
Finding the mason
from the inn that night

107
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
is like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

108
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,599
Compared to what Gu Yuqing did,

109
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,800
our effort is nothing.

110
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:26,728
He gave up his life

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440
to save me.

112
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,480
No one could've predicted that.

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,479
We really need to try something else.

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,440
If not, we won't be able to
find any clues.

115
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,440
I'm a mason.

116
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,239
Your Highness,

117
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,160
that's him.

118
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,279
That sneaky fellow

119
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
from the inn that night.

120
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,190
I'd recognize him
even if he turned to dust.

121
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,790
I leave the silver here.

122
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,684
Sure. Have a good day.

123
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,279
We've been searching all morning

124
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,919
but found nothing.

125
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,079
The fire was intense.

126
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,390
Even iron would've melted to slag,

127
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:24,243
let alone a human body.

128
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,074
Sir,

129
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:26,720
the inn's burnt to the ground.

130
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,096
There's nothing left to find.

131
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:28,959
Stop searching.

132
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,760
I'll report back to the city lord.

133
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,314
Disperse.

134
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:33,160
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:37,742
Let's follow him.

136
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,967
Xiaolongbao for sale!

137
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,816
Xiaolongbao for sale!

138
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:57,137
Fresh Xiaolongbao!

139
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,506
Have a taste.

140
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,915
He's left.

141
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:27,906
Let's split up.

142
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,782
All right.

143
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,599
City lord,

144
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,941
we've searched Leifu Inn thoroughly.

145
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,875
We didn't find Gu Yuqing's body.

146
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,399
All right. You may go.

147
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,520
Yes.

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,960
Sir,

149
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
perhaps you're overthinking this.

150
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
I hope so.

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,480
Before I asked you to kill him,

152
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,839
I overlooked something important.

153
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
What is it?

154
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,160
Gu Yuqing was holding
something very important.

155
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:10,439
Without it,

156
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,359
even if we have weapons and funding,

157
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,040
we can't complete the plan.

158
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,031
What is it that's so important?

159
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,653
You'll know when the time comes.

160
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,466
Don't ask.

161
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:23,960
Yes, sir. I spoke out of turn.

162
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
Stand right there.

163
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,422
Stand right there.

164
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,017
Keep running.

165
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:34,680
You're cunning.

166
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,560
Let's see where you run now.

167
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:38,039
Spare me.

168
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,360
Please spare me, lady.

169
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,523
I had no choice.

170
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:42,560
Who forced you?

171
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,386
It was City Lord Sun.

172
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:46,119
He made me do this.

173
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,804
Him again.

174
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:49,920
Go on.

175
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:51,319
I...

176
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,680
I installed an iron rod on the roof

177
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,470
and placed a few bags
of glutinous rice powder.

178
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,333
But I swear I was forced.

179
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,332
City Lord Sun said
that if I didn't follow orders,

180
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,687
he'd send my entire family

181
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,185
to work at the salt farm.

182
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,342
Salt farm?

183
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,920
Wasn't it shut down long ago?

184
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:10,426
No.

185
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,640
City Lord Sun has been
secretly producing salt all the time.

186
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,079
He's made a fortune from it.

187
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,720
Do you know where the salt farm is?

188
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,604
I really don't.

189
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,391
I've only heard things.

190
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,189
That place...

191
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,839
That place is full of weird fog.

192
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,360
Once you enter, you'd get lost.

193
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:27,300
It's like hell.

194
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:29,435
And the ghost soldiers guard it.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,666
No one has ever come out alive.

196
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,800
For the sake of your family,
I'll spare you.

197
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:36,959
Now get lost.

198
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,999
Thank you, lady.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,431
Thank you, lady.

200
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,172
I'll get out.

201
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,262
- I'm going now.
- Now.

202
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,127
City Lord Sun?

203
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:48,980
They shall be severely punished.

204
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,443
A hellish salt farm.

205
00:10:50,444 --> 00:10:51,759
We now offer

206
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
the families of the criminals
as sacrifices to the God of Thunder.

207
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,746
Ghost soldiers.

208
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:00,555
Could the sacrifice

209
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,182
be his excuse

210
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:06,617
to force commoners into hard labor
at the salt farm?

211
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,745
That makes sense, Your Highness.

212
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,280
What do we do next?

213
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,360
We'll rescue Mr. Da first.

214
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,084
And then,

215
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,475
we'll pay City Lord Sun a visit.
