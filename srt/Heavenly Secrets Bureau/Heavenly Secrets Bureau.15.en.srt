2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,830
Cheers.

4
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,290
Thank you for saving my life, sir.

5
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,281
Hurry to the capital
and report to Master

6
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:24,845
that the salt farm in Leicheng
has been exposed.

7
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:28,032
Implore him to find another way
to gather military funds.

8
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,850
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,810
What about you, sir?

10
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,050
I have my own plan.

11
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,890
What's going on?

12
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,619
Have you forgotten, Your Highness?

13
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,979
Her Highness was born

14
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,539
with fetal poison in her body.

15
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,610
None of the imperial physicians
could cure it.

16
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:52,610
His Majesty searched far and wide
for someone who could.

17
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:55,019
Fortunately, the poison master,
Wan Nianqing,

18
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,290
appeared in time

19
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:58,010
and developed an antidote for her.

20
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,330
But the antidote only lasts
for half a year.

21
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:02,885
Once the time is up, the poison flares up
and causes her to faint.

22
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:05,227
That must be an early flare-up.

23
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:06,787
She was triggered by emotional distress.

24
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,099
Where's the antidote?

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,370
Give it to her.

26
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,010
It's all used up.

27
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:13,387
The ingredients are rare,

28
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:14,779
so Mr. Wan

29
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,890
could produce only a limited supply
each time.

30
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,320
Where's Mr. Wan, then?

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,827
He and Her Highness agreed to meet

32
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:24,170
in the bamboo forest outside the palace
every year on Double Ninth Festival.

33
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:25,405
He'd removed the toxins in her

34
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,019
while teaching her about poisons.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,370
No one would've thought
the poison would act up early.

36
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,770
What do we do now?

37
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,970
You saw for yourself
what condition Her Highness is in.

38
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,450
What are you trying to say?

39
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:49,290
I met her when we were six years old.

40
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:52,476
The first time I saw her,
her poison flared up.

41
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:54,650
But she never gave in or complained.

42
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,090
She was steadfast and cheerful.
I was deeply captivated.

43
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,850
From then on,

44
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:05,298
she filled my entire childhood.

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,600
No matter how beautiful the past was,
it's still the past.

46
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:09,894
I care more about the present.

47
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:12,907
Gu Yuqing,

48
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,750
don't say I didn't warn you.

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,170
Her past, present, and future
belong only to me.

50
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:23,063
But don't you think the truest feelings
come from mutual affection?

51
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,050
Forcing her to love you

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,681
will only make her dislike you more.

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,667
Since we were kids,
we've been a compatible pair.

54
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,654
We trust each other.

55
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:31,579
I know what she likes

56
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,259
or dislikes

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,823
like the back of my hand.

58
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:35,316
What do you know?

59
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:38,250
I know that
when Her Highness is unconscious

60
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,450
from a poisoning episode,

61
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,587
we all should work together
to find Mr. Wan

62
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:42,725
and get her cured.

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,090
What do you think?

64
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,730
I have the last antidote
Mr. Wan left for Lingyue.

65
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,410
So only I can save her.

66
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,810
Say, Mr. Gu.

67
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:01,561
I'm going to marry her in one month.

68
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:04,250
I do hope you'll give us your blessing.

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,605
Her Highness is pure and kind.

70
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,450
Please treat her well.

71
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,210
I plan to bring the little tyke
back to the capital.

72
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,370
That's good.

73
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,760
Shanyao was investigating something
all the way to here.

74
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,570
He must've found something

75
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:47,690
that got him killed.

76
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,160
Return to the capital with me
to seek His Majesty's an audience.

77
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:51,930
Please go on ahead, Your Highness.

78
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:55,010
There's something
I need to take care of first.

79
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:56,890
But before I begin,

80
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,010
I need your support.

81
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,530
Young master.

82
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,170
Young master.

83
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,039
Young master, you're still alive.

84
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,383
Great! You're so fortunate.

85
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,965
You survived.

86
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,014
Mr. Da,

87
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:22,930
I'm all right.

88
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:23,912
Ah.

89
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:27,374
It must be Madam and Master
watching over you from above.

90
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,405
It's good you're safe.

91
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,863
It's good.

92
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,770
I thought I'd never see you again.

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,050
Where's Her Highness?

94
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:37,570
She went back to the capital
with Lord Xian.

95
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,450
I see.

96
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:40,419
That's good.

97
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,094
Good.

98
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,952
Oh, right, Mr. Da,

99
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:45,530
my father had a seismoscope.

100
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,010
Do you remember that?

101
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,579
Seismoscope?

102
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,530
Yes.

103
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,339
If I'm not mistaken,

104
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,210
it should be in the study
at our mansion in the capital.

105
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,410
Good.

106
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,449
Let's leave for the capital now.

107
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,059
All right.

108
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,747
Yes.

109
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,810
I'll start packing.

110
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,430
(Capital)

111
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,570
Cui?

112
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,876
Why am I back at the palace?

113
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,787
Your Highness,
the poison flared up early.

114
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:42,054
It was Prince Qifeng
who gave you the antidote.

115
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,130
You've been unconscious
for three days and three nights.

116
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,570
I slept that long?

117
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,481
Yes.

118
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:51,005
What about Xiao Ye and Gu Yuqing?

119
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,459
I knew you'd ask.

120
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,716
Xiao said

121
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,747
Mr. Gu has returned to the capital.

122
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:57,085
Don't worry.

123
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:58,210
Hm.

124
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,290
Oh, right.

125
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:01,810
And Qifeng,

126
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:02,570
he's gone, right?

127
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:05,850
Prince Qifeng has been waiting
at Chunhua Court.

128
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:07,890
He sticks to you like glue.

129
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:10,699
Xiao was afraid you'd be upset
when you woke up,

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,890
so he drove him away.

131
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,939
Good.

132
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,565
He was right.

133
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:15,650
Qifeng

134
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,859
really sticks to me

135
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,259
like glue.

136
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,659
Xiao also said...

137
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,730
Wait.

138
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,730
Xiao?

139
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:26,650
You're calling him that so sweetly.

140
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,250
Something's going on between you two.

141
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:31,170
No, Your Highness.

142
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,125
I don't know what you're talking about.

143
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:34,254
Don't pretend.

144
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,507
Your Xiao told me everything.

145
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:38,414
What?

146
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,290
Did he tell you he held my hand?

147
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,481
He touched your hand?

148
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,450
That Xiao Ye!

149
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,325
He actually flirts with my maid
right under my nose.

150
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:50,699
I must chop off his hand.

151
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,699
Which one did he use?

152
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,583
Left or right?

153
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,094
Please don't chop off his hand.

154
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:55,490
I see.

155
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,250
Chop off his head instead, right?

156
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,521
You see, Cui.

157
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,374
He's my guard.

158
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,570
That's too cruel.

159
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:02,779
I'll just chop off his hand.

160
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,063
Should I chop off
his left hand or right hand?

161
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:06,499
If you must punish someone,

162
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,939
chop off mine.

163
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,174
Absolutely not!

164
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,970
How could you do that, Your Highness?

165
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:16,636
It's me, Xiao Ye.
Your most thoughtful guard.

166
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,756
From Nandian to Leicheng,

167
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,890
I've been so loyal to you.

168
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,245
Though I've gotten you into danger
time and again,

169
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:25,743
I risked my life to protect you.

170
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:27,099
I had no choice.

171
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,321
You...

172
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,450
And?

173
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:30,956
Don't be like that.

174
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,490
The two of you.

175
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,890
You're acting all lovey-dovey
in front of me.

176
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,110
How dare you?

177
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,570
I'll take it.

178
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:41,770
Your Highness.

179
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,534
I'm to blame, Your Highness.

180
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,970
I couldn't control myself

181
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,770
and held Cui's hand.

182
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:51,592
If there must be punishment,
let it be on me alone.

183
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:52,810
Very well.

184
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,890
Then I'll punish you.

185
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,690
You can only love Cui for life
without taking a concubine.

186
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,285
As you command.

187
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:15,405
I've missed you terribly these days.

188
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:16,890
Ah.

189
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,063
You were being reckless,

190
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:19,979
weren't you?

191
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,490
Noble Consort Chen has arrived.

192
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,605
Cui, I leave this to you.

193
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,459
Xiao Ye, let's go.

194
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,539
Hey.

195
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,530
Uh...

196
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,294
Ah.

197
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,974
Where's the Ninth Princess?

198
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,334
Her Highness...

199
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,970
Her Highness went out for a walk.

200
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,156
This little tyke

201
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:47,090
just woke up,
and she's already running around.

202
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,410
What am I going to do with her?

203
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,730
Useless fools.

204
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,854
They couldn't even handle a sick girl.

205
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,579
She's actually back alive.

206
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,250
Mother, Li Lingyue
has always been cunning.

207
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,530
She's good at using poison.

208
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,290
She's truly not easy to deal with.

209
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,979
What spell did she cast on His Majesty?

210
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,450
Why does he dote on her so much?

211
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:13,250
Noble Consort Chen rose to favor
because of her.

212
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,863
Now His Majesty visits her every day.

213
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,370
If this continues,

214
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,690
she'll bear a prince sooner or later.

215
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,130
Don't worry, Mother.

216
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,139
Even if she does,
by the time the child grows up,

217
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,419
Father will be gone.

218
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,999
Once we take control
of the imperial court,

219
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,670
we can kill that brat.

220
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,379
Do you have no brain?

221
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,272
His Majesty hasn't named an empress
all these years

222
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:36,578
because Noble Consort Chen
hasn't borne a prince.

223
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,481
If she does,

224
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:41,570
the title of Empress will go to her.

225
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,339
Her brother, Vice Minister Chen,
holds a powerful position.

226
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,530
With his support, she could seize control
of the imperial court.

227
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,916
Then what should we do?

228
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,410
In this palace,

229
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:57,130
without power,

230
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:59,281
we're at others' mercy.

231
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,850
Your father will never name you
crown prince.

232
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,587
So we'll take it for ourselves.

233
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,730
Take it?

234
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,525
Then I'll seize it now.

235
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:10,330
Come back.

236
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,321
Do you even know how?

237
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,472
How? Please teach me.

238
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,410
First of all,

239
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,450
get rid of Li Lingyue.

240
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,099
I heard she had an early flare-up.

241
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,979
Without Wan's antidote,

242
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,979
she'll die

243
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,250
even without us doing anything.

244
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,739
You're right.

245
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,290
Cutting off her antidote
is the only option.

246
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,730
Are you suggesting that...

247
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:43,450
I'll see to it now.

248
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,094
Twin Fish?

249
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:57,734
The Imperial Seal is...
