2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,575
The Exorcist Lord, Feijie Master,

4
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:05,035
we pray for clear skies and rainfall
so our harvests may thrive,

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,120
and for the rainbow to be cut off
that drought may end.

6
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,835
Today,

7
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,524
we offer the families of the criminals

8
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,457
to the God of Thunder

9
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,568
to show the sincerity
of the people of Leicheng,

10
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,284
and to beg his continued protection

11
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,666
over our city.

12
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:36,475
Heavenly thunder roars
and breaks the dawn.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,715
The wrath of the God of Thunder
descends upon the mortal realm.

14
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:42,315
Move. Faster.

15
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:45,750
- Divine punishment thunders in rage.
- Quick.

16
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:51,070
Intimidating all four directions,
and subduing the eight wilds.

17
00:01:58,342 --> 00:01:59,835
These three corpses

18
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,115
have no soot in their mouths or noses.

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,574
That means

20
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,617
they weren't choked by smoke or ashes.

21
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:08,323
Right.

22
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:11,715
Look.

23
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,235
His neck was broken.

24
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:15,715
Just like how Batu died.

25
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,372
Broken neck?

26
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,804
Isn't that the same method

27
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,901
Li Sen used to kill?

28
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:29,315
Yes.

29
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,368
Exactly the same.

30
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,995
Their necks were shattered.

31
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:39,515
But Li Sen is already dead.

32
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:41,435
We saw it with our own eyes.

33
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,572
I'll confess..

34
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,075
There must be more

35
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,235
going on here.

36
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,915
Easy. It's me.

37
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,195
I knew

38
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:01,884
I'd know you
in a creepy place like this.

39
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:02,844
Cut the chatter.

40
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:04,355
Did you find anything?

41
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:06,835
I found out

42
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,555
where the families being sacrificed

43
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,355
were taken.

44
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:35,715
Look.

45
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:38,044
They have the same twin fish tattoo

46
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:40,355
as Li Sen.

47
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:43,475
I noticed that
the first day we arrived in Leicheng.

48
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,275
These people might have
a second identity.

49
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,275
Were Batu and Jia Si

50
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:50,435
killed by them?

51
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,075
Highly likely.

52
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,604
I was observing them this whole time,

53
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,564
and I think they're well-trained.

54
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:56,915
They're not ordinary folks.

55
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:59,955
Right. They're bold.

56
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,715
They must have powerful backing.

57
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:08,235
(What does twin fish mean?)

58
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:15,035
Why is it getting foggy all of a sudden?

59
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:20,044
Heavenly thunder roars
and breaks the dawn.

60
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:24,395
The wrath of the God of Thunder
descends upon the mortal realm.

61
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,762
Divine punishment thunders in rage.

62
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:32,815
Intimidating all four directions,
and subduing the eight wilds.

63
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:44,604
This place is strange.

64
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,004
Let's leave.

65
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,004
Leave, my foot.

66
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:47,444
Shut up.

67
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:48,084
Let's go

68
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:49,644
before it's too late.

69
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:50,084
Shh.

70
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:50,915
You...

71
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:52,635
Look at that.

72
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,075
Ghost soldiers.

73
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,995
They really exist.

74
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:14,124
The coachman was telling the truth.

75
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,995
Stop making a fuss.

76
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,435
Let's follow them.

77
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:50,035
Hey.

78
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:51,324
Your Highness.

79
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:52,755
There are ghost soldiers in the fog.

80
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,764
We can't go.

81
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,195
Or else, we can't go back alive.

82
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:58,404
Trust me. I'm still young.
I don't want to die.

83
00:05:58,405 --> 00:05:59,684
Then hurry up and move.

84
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,400
If you don't, I'll beat you to death
and feed you to the ghost soldiers.

85
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,435
Your Highness!

86
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,475
Ever since I started following you two,
nothing good has happened.

87
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:10,595
All you do is sneak out of the palace.

88
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:13,520
You're going to
get yourself killed one day.

89
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:27,195
Lingyue.

90
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:30,715
Lingyue.

91
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,355
Prince Qifeng.

92
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,595
Are you looking for the Ninth Princess?

93
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,435
Is she not in her room?

94
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,355
Her Highness went out
with Young Master Gu.

95
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:45,275
Gu Yuqing.

96
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,546
Why did you stop?

97
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,475
They disappeared.

98
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,932
Dark clouds loom above,

99
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,501
covering the stars and the moon.

100
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,555
The stars can't guide our way.

101
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:17,977
What should we do now?

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,035
Someone is over there.

103
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,195
They're gone.

104
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:43,675
The compass isn't working.

105
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,675
Your Highness.

106
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:50,835
Mr. Gu,

107
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:53,724
I feel like someone is watching us.

108
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:55,355
- Don't talk nonsense.
- It's true.

109
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:57,635
Watch out!

110
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:08,066
Let go of my princess consort.

111
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:11,070
I'm not your princess consort.

112
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:11,795
Qifeng,

113
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:12,684
say another word,

114
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,075
I won't hold back.

115
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,124
Gu Yuqing,

116
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,715
how dare you

117
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,115
bring the Princess to a place like this?

118
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:21,435
Mind your own business.

119
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:24,075
Where I go is none of your concern.

120
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:26,315
You three are having fun, aren't you?

121
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,875
Running off to the wilderness
in the middle of the night

122
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,755
and almost losing your lives.

123
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,297
I wonder what sweet words Gu Yuqing used

124
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,475
to trick you out here.

125
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:38,155
Mind your word, Mr. Qifeng.

126
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,995
There's nothing improper between us.

127
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,555
Besides, Her Highness
is of noble status.

128
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,520
She's not someone you can insult
as you please.

129
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:47,079
Nothing improper?

130
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,675
I doubt that.

131
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,572
Gu Yuqing, let me warn you.

132
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,204
Stay away from my princess consort.

133
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:54,355
Qifeng,

134
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,408
I never agreed to be your consort.

135
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,075
Whoever made that promise, go find them.

136
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,275
Now get out of my sight.

137
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,915
Immediately.

138
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:03,824
Otherwise...

139
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:04,568
Very well.

140
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:07,284
Since my princess consort
wants me to leave,

141
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:09,101
I'll do as you wish.

142
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:11,003
I'll leave.

143
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,306
Stop calling me that.

144
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:13,590
I'm not your consort.

145
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,110
All right, Princess Consort.

146
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,195
By the way, Mr. Gu,

147
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:18,835
no need to thank me for saving you.

148
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,328
I only did it for my princess consort.

149
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,235
I...

150
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,155
Your Highness,

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,964
Prince Qifeng is impossible
to shake off like a tail.

152
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,755
He's so annoying.

153
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:37,315
Still, to be fair,

154
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,915
he does seem to have real feelings
for you.

155
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,755
Believe it or not,

156
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:47,835
I can crack your head open.

157
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,395
I do. I do.

158
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,035
Your Highness, Mr. Gu,

159
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,435
did you notice

160
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:56,732
something strange about this place?

161
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,604
That fog came and went

162
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:00,035
in an instant.

163
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,595
Those ghost soldiers were here just now.

164
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,995
My experience tells me

165
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,875
this must be where the underworld
and the mortal realm intersect.

166
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,324
Seriously?

167
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,257
You think so too?

168
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:16,915
This forest belongs to the mountain
on Leicheng Peninsula.

169
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:19,546
Surrounded by the sea on three sides.
High humidity.

170
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,595
Plus, the terrain is unique.

171
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:23,675
So

172
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:26,715
the fog forms and disperses
unusually fast.

173
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:27,617
Uh...

174
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:29,715
I don't know what you're talking about.

175
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,577
What about your compass?

176
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:33,675
It was spinning like crazy.

177
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:34,972
Can you explain that?

178
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:36,604
The rocks around here

179
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,257
contain magnetite.

180
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:40,292
Magnetite?

181
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,355
A kind of natural magnetic stone.

182
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,075
Not only can it attract iron,

183
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,612
but it can also disrupt magnetic fields.

184
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,875
That's why my compass isn't working.

185
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,048
The ghost soldiers.

186
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,675
We all saw them, right?

187
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,897
How do you explain that?

188
00:10:58,898 --> 00:10:59,932
Enough.

189
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,070
Look.

190
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:03,235
There's a symbol

191
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:04,328
on this sword.

192
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,995
It's the twin fish again.

193
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,239
Why is it everywhere?

194
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:16,395
What is that?

195
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:18,266
Sea salt.
