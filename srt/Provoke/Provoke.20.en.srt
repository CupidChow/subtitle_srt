3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,500
Xunyu,

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,220
take off your clothes right here.

5
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,300
Xiaocui,

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,420
help Young Master take off his clothes.

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,860
Why don't you correct your own error?

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,060
I...

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,420
Young...

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,500
Do you still want to work here?

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,180
You hired thug!

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,340
How dare you threaten my maid?

13
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,500
Ma'am.

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,220
You even gave your own son
a hard time.

15
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,260
Xiaocui,

16
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,620
let's go.

17
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,820
Dad,

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,300
I'm going to get changed.

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,060
(Is it possible that
the death certificate)

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,900
(was forged by Liang Wujing?)

21
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,660
(If Xunyu is fake,)

22
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,100
(what's his purpose)

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,460
(for staying by my side for two years?)

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,780
(He got stabbed for my sake.)

25
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,100
(He couldn't)

26
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,100
(fake that kind of thing.)

27
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,300
Dad,

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,860
why do you get up so early?

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,740
What were you doing

30
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,260
in Mistress Jiang's room?

31
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,860
Well,

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,740
when we went to the orphanage,

33
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,780
Mistress Jiang left her thing in my car.

34
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,540
I returned it to her just now.

35
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,460
According to Mr. Liang,

36
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,900
the financial situation of the company
has been poor recently.

37
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,300
If we don't sort it out,

38
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,420
he'll consider taking back your business.

39
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,460
Sir.

40
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,060
Sir.

41
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,220
Mr. Liang requires us

42
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,540
to hand over Young Master's business.

43
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,740
Have you made a decision?

44
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,500
Secretary Luo,

45
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,580
you've seen

46
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,860
what Xunyu has done for me

47
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,860
over the last year.

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,340
He is my only son.

49
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,820
So...

50
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,860
What we have now

51
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,940
can't prove that he is fake.

52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,500
Perhaps Mr. Liang made a mistake,

53
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,980
or

54
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,460
this is his test for me and my son.

55
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,620
I really understand how you feel.

56
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,460
But

57
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,380
Mr. Liang has delivered an ultimatum.

58
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,140
You must make a decision

59
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,380
and give him an answer.

60
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,740
Young Master's situation is special.

61
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,580
He was separated from you for many years

62
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,740
and his mother passed away early.

63
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,540
Though we can't guarantee
the authenticity of the certificate,

64
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,020
nothing can prove

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,380
he is your real son.

66
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
What's up, sir?

67
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Sir.

68
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,460
He's coming. Hurry.

69
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,940
Come on.

70
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,860
Face me.

71
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,140
Hurry up.

72
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,660
What's the rush?

73
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,180
Don't be shy.

74
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,460
Hurry.

75
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,460
Xingzhi,

76
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,660
you're already exposed at his gunpoint.

77
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,220
And you don't know

78
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
when he will pull the trigger.

79
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,100
We can't sit still
and await destruction.

80
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,380
We must seize the initiative.

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
What do you want to do?

82
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,780
About your identity,

83
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,740
we must pull off the upset.

84
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,380
He minds our relationship

85
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,580
very much.

86
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,860
Think about it.

87
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,820
Would a purposeful fake son

88
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,300
be so impatient

89
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,900
to approach his father's concubine

90
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,700
under the nose of his father?

91
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,420
As long as you do something

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,980
a fake son would never do,

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,820
you may be able to
pass off the fake as the real thing.

94
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,580
No.

95
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,980
I can't drag you into the water.

96
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,100
Do you remember when we

97
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,500
set fire to save ourselves?

98
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,820
This time,

99
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,540
I won't let you face it alone.

100
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,380
Kiss me for real.

101
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,700

(it will buy you time more or less.)

119
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,820
(Sir.)

120
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,620
(It seems that you're right.)

121
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,340
(You can educate an unfilial son,)

(but you don't have to kill him.)

123
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,020
He left.

124
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,660
Now,

125
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,220
he should believe it, right?

126
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,740
Well, I'll drive...

127
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,460
No.

128
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,340
I'll get off first.

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,100
OK.

130
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,500
Sir.

131
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,140
What did you see?

132
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,260
I saw Young Master and Mistress Jiang...

133
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,740
I saw nothing.

134
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,900
Nothing.

135
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,300
Say it again!

136
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,940
Sir,

137
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,260
I won't say a word.

138
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
I've followed you for many years.

139
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,740
You know me.

140
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,820
I have the final say

141
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,140
on the authenticity of my son.

142
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,940
Go see Zeng Baoqi tomorrow

143
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,900
and ask him whether

144
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,140
he has the thing I want.

145
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,900
Tell Mr. Liang

146
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,180
to give me a little more time.

147
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,900
Alright.

148
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,380
Got it.

149
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,380
I'm leaving now.

150
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,900
(They caught Zeng Baoqi.)

151
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,660
(Smoking or Open Flames Prohibited)

152
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,140
Sir,

153
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,780
stop, or you'll kill him.

154
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,020
I don't have the thing you want.

155
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,220
Even if you kill me,

156
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,420
I won't change my words.

157
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,740
By the way,

158
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,500
let me tell you a secret

159
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,820
about your concubine.

160
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,700
My concubine?

161
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,820
You don't know your son

162
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,540
and your concubine are a pair...

163
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,300
A pair of what?

164
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,180
A pair of

165
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,780
good friends.

166
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,900
Have a good rest, then.

167
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,060
Entertain him well.

168
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,340
Kill him.

169
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,220
What are you doing?

170
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,980
Du Jingchuang,

171
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,860
kill me with your own hands
if you have the guts.

172
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,140
I don't want to be killed by shrimps.

173

Du Xunyu.

174
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,740
Behave if you want to live.

175
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,580
