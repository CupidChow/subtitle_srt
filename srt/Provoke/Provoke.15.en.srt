3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,150
Mr. Du, hello.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,520
Hello.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,550
Mr. Du.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,550
Hello.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,070
Mr. Du.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,760
Mr. Du.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,550
Mr. Du.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,600
Hello.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,120
Hello.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,550
Mr. Du.

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,440
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,950
Mr. Du.

15
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,880
Mr. Zhou.

16
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,310
Mr. Du, how are you doing recently?

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,240
This is Mr. Zhou of
Changxing Trading Company.

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,430
Nice to meet you.

19
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,720
Mistress Jiang.

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,310
Mr. Du, you have good taste.

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,880
Mr. Du, you're really lucky.

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,310
I'm flattered.

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,110
Mr. Du, would you excuse me?

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,310
OK.

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,310
Master,

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,560
I need to go to the restroom first.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Mr. Du,

28
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,120
I haven't seen you for a long time.

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,000
Mrs. Du is here, too?

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,400
Where are your son and Ying?

31
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,830
Would you excuse me?

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,440
OK.

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,800
Give me the aloe powder.

34
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,230
Don't do such a risky thing.

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,720
Give it to me.

36
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,000
I won't give up

37
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,390
such a good opportunity.

38
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
Do you know

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,750
Du Jingchuang won't be unprepared?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,910
I told you.

41
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,440
Give me back.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,630
Come with me.

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,160
Sorry to interrupt.

44
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,720
Who's he?

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,030
- Weird.
- I don't know.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,550
Cheers.

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,390
Miss Wang, you're quite forthright.

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,080
Master.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,080
Ying.

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,670
Mistress Jiang doesn't feel well.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,670
I just had some wine
and it made me allergic.

52
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,830
Let me see.

53
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,080
It's so bad.

54
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,520
I feel awful now.

55
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,830
May I go home first?

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,720
OK.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
You go home first.

58
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,960
Secretary Luo,
drive Mistress Jiang back.

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
Yes.

60
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,800
Don't bother.

61
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,110
Would you excuse me?

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,470
OK.

63
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,270
Master.

64
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,240
Sit down and have a drink with me.

65
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,760
OK.

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,200
Master,

67
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,830
you haven't
taken me out for a long time.

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,830
I've been busy
with the business recently.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,070
I didn't find time
to attend such parties.

70
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,390
That's true.

71
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,200
When I was away,

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,390
how did you get along

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,160
with Xunyu and Mistress Jiang?

74
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,790
Them?

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,670
(Did they tell on me?)

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,760
They usually...

77
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,950
What?

78
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,200
They usually

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,670
echo each other.

80
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,550
I think

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,760
they must be a pair...

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,640
A pair?

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,320
A pair of what?

84
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,600
A pair of good friends.

85
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,160
They're about the same age, after all.

86
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,920
They must have much in common.

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,350
Master.

88
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,790
Master.

89
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,550
What are you doing?

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
Give me the gun.

91
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,440
Give me the gun.

92
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,110
What's wrong, sir?

93
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,550
Nothing.

94
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,830
I had a nightmare.

95
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,600
Secretary Luo,

96
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,950
that day,

97
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,920
in the lavatory on the train,

98
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,760
was the couple

99
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,510
Xunyu and Mistress Jiang?

100
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,790
You shouldn't open the door.

101
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you doing? Let go.

102
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,350
It isn't a good place to talk.

103
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,910
Let me go, Du Xunyu.

104
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,150
Let go.

105
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,590
Didn't we agree to work together?

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,080
Why do you work alone?

107
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,280
I have to find something.

108
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,960
It's important. Don't try and stop me.

109
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,230
You really don't know him.

110
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,110
He made a mark
on the door of the study.

111
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,320
If you got in,

112
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,790
the mark would be broken.

113
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,000
Then you, who left in the middle
of the party, would be the suspect.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,110
Since you know about the mark,

115
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,200
help me make another one
when I come out,

116
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,230
will you?

117
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Not today.

118
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,280
Why?

119
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,080
I've been around him for a year.

120
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,710
He doesn't seem right today.

121
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,000
Believe me.

122
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,960
Here.

123
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,960
What's this?

124
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
Anti-allergy medicine.

125
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,960
Those rashes will spread
all over your body

126
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,640
if you don't take them seriously.

127
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,110
Do you still want to meet people?

128
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,110
It's cold tonight.

129
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,000
Wear more when you go out next time.

130
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,520
I have to go.

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,520
