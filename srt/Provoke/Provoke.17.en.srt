00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,140
The car is fixed.

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,500
Let's grab a bite.

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,060
Where did you get the food?

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,060
It's the food Qin Wanyi

7
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,660
put on the back seat of my car.

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,060
I picked some.

9
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,220
I don't want to eat. I'm not hungry.

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,500
You shouldn't eat, either.

11
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,620
You eat her food without permission.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,300
How will you explain to her?

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,060
It's no big deal
to have some of her bread.

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,500
It isn't a good thing.

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,020
You should have some, too.

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,380
Xiaocui. Xiaocui.

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,820
Where is Master?

18
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,980
Go have a look.

19
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,540
Master said

20
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,780
the scenery up there was unique.

21
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,780
Ma'am, wait a moment.

22
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,820
I think they'll be back soon.

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,780
What's there worth seeing?

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,820
Unbelievable.

25
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,420
What's wrong?

26
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
Nothing.

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,420
Are you really fine?

28
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,780
Du Xunyu.

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,220
What's wrong?

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,100
This...

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,660
What's wrong with the bread?

32
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,860
It's...

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
What?

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,540
Is it poisonous?

35
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,100
Vomit the bread you just ate.

36
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,180
Wait for a minute.

37
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,700
I'll see if I can start the car.

38
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,180
Wait. Wait for me.

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,580
Wait for me.

40
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,340
I was joking with you.

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,380
The food is fine.

42
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,860
Why are you so nervous?

43
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,780
It's no big deal

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
to eat some of her food.

45
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,940
It's quite tasty.

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,180
What are you doing?

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,460
You were joking?

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,300
How dare you?

49
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,180

50
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,140
It hurts.

51
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,340
Stop there!

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,020

53

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,340

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,660

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,180
every time your mom cooked,

100
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,340
she would roast me two sweet potatoes.

101
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,580

102
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,260

she roasted for me.

every time a sweet potato was done,

113
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,100
is a big deal.

114
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,660
Don't get burned.

119

Yuanbao,

121
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,140
you insisted on taking the first one.

122
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,660
You shouldn't blame me for that.

123
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,900
Xunyu, help Miss Jiang to roast it.

124
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,020

132
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,260

135
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,740

136
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,180

138
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,140
Later,

139
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,540
I'll join you.

140
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,780
- No. I want you to come now.
- Let's go.

141
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,700

- Come.
- Come with us.

144
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,540

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,180
I've always slept alone.

152
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,860
Tonight,

153
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,940
can you stay with me?

154
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,940
It's been a long day.

155
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,500

Jingchuang,

157
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,940
we can try something different.

158
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,060
My uncle recommended

159
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,740
a famous Western doctor to me.

160
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,820
Perhaps we can...

161
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,620
I'll tell you one last time.

162
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,900
I've got everything I own

163
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,580
through my own efforts.

164
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,300
If you dare mention your uncle again,

165
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,260
go back home right now!

166
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,420
Jingchuang,

167
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,900
why are you doing this to me?

168
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,220
Why?

169
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,460
Your uncle is like a dagger

170
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,260
against my neck,

171
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,140
oppressing me and threatening me.

172
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,500
I can't even breathe.

173
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,620

174
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,020
Over the years,

175
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,620
you've never told me about

176
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,740
what you are doing.

177
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,700
But I'm your legal wife.

178
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,660
How about this?

179
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,380
I'll ask my uncle

180
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,660
what's going on when I go back.

it weren't for your uncle,

184
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,500
I wouldn't even give you a glance.
