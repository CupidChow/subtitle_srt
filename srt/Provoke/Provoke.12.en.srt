3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,780
Xiaocui,

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,860
why haven't I seen
Mistress Jiang these days?

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,780
I hear that she's sick.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,220
How could she be sick?

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,740
I think she's being histrionic

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,180
in case Master is back.

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,380
It's been days.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,180
Hasn't Master called yet?

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,180
The last time Master left home so long

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,620
wasn't long ago.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,860
What's wrong, Ma'am?

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,820
Master brought
a lovechild home last time.

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,020
He isn't going to
bring another son home, is he?

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,460
No way.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,220
I'm going to ask Secretary Luo

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,540
what's happening.

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,900
Ma'am,

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,260
we have a big problem!

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,460
What problem?

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,580
Why do you curse me again?

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,860
The housekeeper...

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,500
The housekeeper was killed

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,980
by lightning last night.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,420
What?

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,620
As you instructed,

28
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,340
I told them the housekeeper
was killed by lightning.

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,220
By the way,

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,140
have you

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,060
heard any news of Zeng Baoqi?

32
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,540
No.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,860
He just vanished into thin air.

34
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,620
We sent many people out,

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,420
but no one has got any information.

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,380
(Mr. Zeng is dead.)

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,020
(Zeng Baoqi)

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,530
(can no longer live a rich
or pampered life.)

39
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,740
(Has he holed up)

40
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,980
(or been silenced?)

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,380
(Wangyue Lane)

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,100
Liang.

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,540
Liang.

44
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Young Master.

45
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,060
Look,

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,020
the woman over there
looks like Mistress Jiang.

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,220
(Wangyue Lane)

48
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,620
What...

49
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,340
What's she doing?

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,620
(Wangyue Lane)

51
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,460
Only when I reached
the same position as her,

52
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,660
did I realize why she

53
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,460
moved the sign.

54
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,020
Only those who have been
soaked in the rain

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,220
will think of
holding an umbrella for others.

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,020
Only those who have been
living in the darkness

57
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,260
will think of

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,940
giving light to the grass in stones.

59
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,940
Aren't you the same?

60
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,740
In order to investigate Du Jingchuang

61
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,900
and do justice to the Jiang Family,

62
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,700
you turn yourself

63
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,180
from a surgeon

64
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,060
to what you are now.

65
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,940
Now you finally know she's alive.

66
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,620
Aren't you going to tell her?

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
No.

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
She doesn't need to know
I'm Shen Xingzhi.

69
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,820
You've come.

70
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,260
Why did you ask me secretly

71
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,180
to come over here
at twelve in the morning?

72
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,940
I want to have a snack with you.

73
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,540

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,780

to see a doctor.

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,380
Sick? What's the disease?

165
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,900

166
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,340
Do I have to explain to you

167
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,180

173
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,020
Got it, Mr. Du.

174

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,820
I was afraid it would damage your brain,

193
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,260
so I used a low dose.

194
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,660
How dare you still say that?

195
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,020
It's my fault.

196
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,500
I put it too close.

197
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,420
I'll get even with you later.

198
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,860
- Let go of me!
- The train is running.

199
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,860
Where are you going?

200
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,420
Shut up. Let go of me.

201
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,140
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
My wife is fighting with me.

203
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Who is your wife?

204
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,340
Are you insane?

205
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Let go.

206
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,300
What are you doing?

207
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,700
Don't move.

208
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,820
Luo Qian is behind you.

209
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,500
Don't look.

210
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,460
Go.

211
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,060
Look what you have done.

212
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,620
It will be OK.

213
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,620
Go.

214
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,740
Du Jingchuang.

215
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,580
Hurry.

216
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,100
So, did you find him?

217
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,060
I made a mistake.

218
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,660
That man shouldn't be Zeng Baoqi.

219
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,220
They are looking for Zeng Baoqi.

220
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,660
Keep looking.

221
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,900
Have you seen this man?

222
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,340
No, I haven't.

223
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,260
Open the door.

224
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,780
Are you the passengers of

225
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
the 3rd and 4th seats of Row Six?

226
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,260
Come out and show your tickets.

227
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,340
Open the door.

228
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,420
Come out.

229
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,180
Are you OK?

230
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,660
Open the door.

231
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,820
Jiang Ying,

232
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,820
what's wrong?

233
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,860
You can't jump off the train.

234
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,460
- Jiang Ying.
- Let go.

235
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,900
- Let go of me.
- Calm down.

236
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,460
We can't let them see us.

237
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,020
Calm down.

238
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,300
Let me out.

239
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,140
Calm down.

240
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,860
I won't.

241
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,340
Just hang on a bit longer, Jiang Ying.

242
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,820
Let me out.
