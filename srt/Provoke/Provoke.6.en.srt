3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,580
What's the secret?

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,460
Dad bought your favorite record

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,220
and learned to dance secretly.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,980
He'll ask you

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,620
to waltz with him tonight.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
He doesn't dance well.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,980
Don't laugh at him.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,820
OK.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,980
I'll pretend not to know anything, OK?

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,460
Mom,

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,100
look, a butterfly!

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,660
Mom, look.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,780
The butterfly is flying freely.

16
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,100
(Dad,)

17
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,260
(Mom,)

18
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,460
(I've finally)

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,980
(come back to our home.)

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,820
Miss Jiang.

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,700
Miss Jiang.

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,500
Miss Jiang, please come with me.

23
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,540
OK.

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,060
Ma'am is in the living room.

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,020
I'm going to tell her.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,260
Miss Jiang, take a seat first.

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,500
OK. I brought this cake for Ma'am.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,860
Please wait for a second.

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,420
My Susu is the prettiest
little princess.

30
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,740
(Dad,)

31
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,500
(I'll drive them all away)

32
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,980
(step by step.)

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,700
Have a taste.

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,860
Xunyu,

35
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,620
why don't you drink?

36
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,820
I heard that

37
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,740
coffee is bitter.

38
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,060
Of course coffee is

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,300
a little bitter,

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,740
but you'll get used to it.

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,860
Try it.

42
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,220
Ma'am,

43
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,820
do you have

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,300
something to say?

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,620
Since you asked,

46
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,220
I'll cut to the chase.

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,420
Isn't your dad

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,260
going to marry a singer?

49
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,180
Even though I don't like you,

50
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,060
we're a family.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,580
But Jiang Ying is different.

52
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,660
You...

53
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,940
Do you understand?

54
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
You and I

55
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,140
are a family.

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,340
I'm glad you get it.

57
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,340
Take more sips.

58
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,980
It's too bitter.

59
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,980
I don't like it.

60
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,180
I have to go.

61
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
Already?

62
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,060
He didn't drink.

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,540
Take more sips.

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,340
Xiaocui,

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,620
he didn't drink much.

66
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,940
Is the drug potent enough?

67
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,900
I was told

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,500
it could knock out a cow.

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,940
For how long?

70
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,220
About half an hour.

71
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,540
Xunyu.

72
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
Xunyu.

73
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,340
Does the drug take effect so fast?

74
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,940
Where is she?

75
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,820
I asked her to wait here.

76
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,460
I don't know where she is.

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,660
Find her.

78
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,420
If she left,

79
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,340
I would have schemed in vain.

80
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,220
Yes.

81
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,180
Wu,

82
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,940
since you're here,
help me to look for someone.

83
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,140
(Memorial)

84
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,700
(Tablets of Xu Yinglan, Jiang Yezhou,
Jiang Susu)

85
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,100
Du...

86
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,500
Du Jingchuang.

87
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,660
Du Jingchuang.

88
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,420
It isn't my fault.

89
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,820
Why is she here?

90
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,700
I haven't hit her yet.

91
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,260
Such horrible things

92
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,860
would scare anyone to death.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,340
What are you waiting for?

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,780
Let's put her in the bed.

95
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,500
Be careful.

96
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,500
Xiaocui.

97
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,500
(What do they want to do?)

98
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,660
Ma'am,

99
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,340
he is too heavy.

100
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,940
Wu.

101
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,820
Wu, don't stand there.

102
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,180
- Lend her a hand.
- Ma'am.

103
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
Come on.

104
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,220
Come.

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,300
Lift his feet.

106
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,900
Come.

107
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,100
No, no.

108
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,940
Come. Push her.

109
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,340
Let me do it.

110
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,900
Come on.

111
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,460
OK. Leave.

112
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,340
Ma'am,

113
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,140
Master doesn't let us
into this room, what if...

114
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,820
That's why I want Master

115
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,700
to see the dirty thing they've done.

116
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,380
Let's go.

117
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,980
Lock the door.

118
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,900
Yes.

119
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,220
Wake up.

120
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,460
Wake up.

121
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,140
Du Xunyu.

122
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,860
They played such a trick on me.

123
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,140
Du Xunyu.

124
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,260
What are you doing?

125
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,980
Do you know you were drugged?

126
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,140
I know!

127
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,860
Fortunately, I woke you up.

128
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,420
Thank you very much.

129
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,420
What should we do now?

130
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,660
We must leave here

131
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,020
before Du Jingchuang is back.

132
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,740
Ma'am.

133
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,940
Is Master coming home?

134
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,340
Secretary Luo said on the phone

135
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,900
that he just left the company.

136
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,380
OK.

137
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,180
Get ready.

138
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,220
Yes.

139
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,260
OK.

140
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,820
This position isn't bad.

141
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,260
I may sprain my ankle at most
if I jump down from here.

142
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,740
Jiang Ying.

143
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,900
You tried to get even with me

144
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,140
at such a critical moment?

145
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,220
I tried to save you.

146
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,660
I have a plan.

147
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,660
I'm going to set fire here.

148
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,700
Qin Wanyi doesn't want us to die.

149
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,220
They'll come to save us for sure.

150
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,900
Wait. Wait.

151
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,340
Do you have to set fire?

152
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,060
Du Jingchuang isn't a fool.

153
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,220
He wouldn't believe

154
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,220
such a stupid scheme.

155
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,740
He's extremely sensitive
about his reputation.

156
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,500
Though he wouldn't believe it,

157
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,980
he has no tolerance for mistakes.

158
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,780
If he sees us together,

159
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,220
he won't spare you.

160
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,540
What if nobody finds out about the fire?

161
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
I have a master key.

162
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,660
I'll let you go.

163
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,100
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

164
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,300
Can you still deny that

165
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,700
you splashed water over me
to get even with me?

166
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,420
