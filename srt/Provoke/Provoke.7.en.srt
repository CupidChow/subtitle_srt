If Master sees that,

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,550
he'll never marry her.

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,360
Xiaocui, do you agree?

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,590
What if

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,680
Master doesn't see it?

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,910
How is that possible?

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,360
Ma'am, Ma'am.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,520
We're in trouble.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,560
What trouble?

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Don't curse me, OK?

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,000
The room on the second floor is on fire.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,110
What?

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
This way.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,110
We're done for.

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,470
What should we do?

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,240
Well...

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,630
- Hurry.
- Hurry up.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,680
Hurry, get more water.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,310
Go fetch water.

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,870
- OK.
- Here.

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:08,760
Take it.

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,760
Hurry up.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,550
Quickly.

27
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,190

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,870

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,950

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,950

Wu.

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,310
Wu, what does it look like inside?

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,910
All burnt out.

34
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,440
What about them?

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,630
Ma'am, don't worry. We're fine.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,590
Fortunately, you're fine.

37
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,550
I'm glad you're fine.

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,080
Xiaocui,

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,190
is the soup still on the kitchen range?
Let's go check.

40
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,440
Mrs. Du,

41
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,550
may I have a word with you?

42
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,550
Xiaocui,

43
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,760
has Master come back yet?

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,800
Ma'am,

45
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,550
Secretary Luo said something came up.

46
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,040
Master returned to the company.

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,110
Thank goodness.

48
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,240
Luckily, he hasn't come back.

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,830
Ma'am.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,110
What do you want to say?

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,470
Sit down and talk.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Ma'am,

53
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,880
try this cake, please.

54
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,440
It's made by a famous pastry chef
in Tangcheng.

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Ma'am, don't worry.

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,720
There's no drug

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,320
in this cake.

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,670
Say what you want.

59
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,800
If you want to tell Master,

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,830
I'm not afraid.

61
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,030
I came with a cake to have tea with you

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,030
on your invitation.

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,190
We had been chatting here all the time.

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,270
I passed by

65
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,360
and had a cup of your coffee.

66
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,320
Suddenly, the servants came over

67
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,240
and said there was a fire.

68
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,080
I was so scared that
I knocked over the coffee

69
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,390
and got my clothes dirty.

70
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,240
I must thank you

71
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,830
for lending me your clothes.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,440
That's what happened today.

73
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,470
None of us had been in that room,

74
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,630
right, Ma'am?

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,670
Yes.

76
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,240
Ma'am and I are a family.

77
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,470
The room burned down.

78
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,190
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,240
Right?

80
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,910
Yes.

81
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm sorry, too.

82
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Ma'am,

83
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,320
you'd better take a bite of the cake.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,160
My dad is busy with business.

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,390
He won't be back soon.

86
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,160
Miss Jiang, let me drive you home.

87
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,520
Ma'am,

88
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,270
see you, then.

89
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,270
Miss Jiang,

90
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,760
please.

91
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,160
Thanks, Mr. Du.

92
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,550
Xiaocui, Xiaocui.

93
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,640
If I say that,

94
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,070
will Master believe it?

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,390
Master.

96
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,440
Well,

97
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,950
have you decided?

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,160
Do you really want to marry him?

99
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,760
If you regret it now,

100
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,480
you still have a choice.

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,160
I had no choice long ago.

102
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,720
Wait.

103
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,670
This is for you.

104
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,510
What was going on?

105
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,880
Today, Miss Jiang

106
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,550
came for coffee with a cake.

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,110
We had been chatting here all the time.

108
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,880
Then Young Master passed by

109
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,790
and had a cup of coffee, too.

110
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,270
Suddenly, Wu came over

111
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
and said there was a fire in the room.

112
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,920
Miss Jiang knocked over her coffee

113
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,110
and wet her clothes.

114
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,040
Ma'am then lent her clothes
to Miss Jiang.

115
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,920
That's what happened today.

116
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,230
The fire was an accident.

117
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,880
I feel sorry.

118
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,640
I'm sorry, too.

119
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,830
Forget it.

120
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,070
It doesn't matter.

121
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,720
I should let them go.

122
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,760
Let bygones

123
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,720
be bygones.

124
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,390
Does he really buy it?

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,550
Master isn't mad?

00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,320
How can you let that happen?

194
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,760
It's my fault.

195
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,590
But our people are keeping an eye
on all the docks.

196
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,880
He can't run away.

197
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,030
I want the outcome.

198
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,400
I get it.

199
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,080
Will do.

200
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,590
Ying,

201
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,280
I brought you the veil.

202
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,440
I've packed all the clothes

203
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,000
you usually wear.

204
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,400
When Ying marries Mr. Du,

205
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,550
she'll live in ease and comfort.

206
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,080
She no longer needs those clothes.

207
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,640
Exactly.

208
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,200
Right?

209
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,550
If you like,

210
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,790
you can take them.

211
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,350
Really?

212
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,150
We're happy to take them.

213
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,280
Thanks, Ying.

214
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,230
It's getting late.

215
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,670
Come on, the veil.

216
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,640
Ying,

217
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,710
in the entire club,

218
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,400
no, in the entire city,

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,520
few girls

220
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,880
are as lucky as you.

221
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,840
Look at the veil.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,150
It's so heavy that you can barely
lift your head, right?

223
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,520
So beautiful.

224
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,230
Yes.

225
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,110
It's really heavy.

226
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,320
It's suffocating.

227
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,080
The matchmaker keeps hurrying us.

228
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,640
Almost done. Stop hurrying.
