3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,380
Long time no see.

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,300
Uncle Wu,

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,260
do you recognize me?

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,380
I'm Jiang Susu,

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,020
Jiang Yezhou

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,180
(Tablets of Xu Yinglan, Jiang Yezhou)
and Xu Yinglan's daughter.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,660
(Impossible.)

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,820
(Jiang Ying.)

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,380
(Jiang Susu.)

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,740
(Jiang Ying.)

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,020
(Jiang Susu.)

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,260
Was the night you buried me alive

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
similar to this night?

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,780
Are you curious about

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,220
how I escaped from the sack

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,980
you tied so tightly?

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,620
I was forced!

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,020
I was forced!

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,260
The sack was tied so tightly.

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,380
The rain that night

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,100
was as cold as
it was going to cut my skin.

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,780
I thought I would die.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,860
I never thought

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,460
I would wake up alive.

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,820
I curled in the sack.

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,580
I felt that the dirt and water

29
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,460
seeped in

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,340
bit by bit,

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,020
covering every inch of my skin.

32
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,420
But fate favored me.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,980
It let the heavy rain wash away

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,380
the dirt you covered on me.

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,100
I used all my strength

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,780
to cut the sack,

37
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,060
and crawled out of it

38
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,620
little by little.

39
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,420
(Susu,)

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,300
(it's really you.)

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,540
Miss,

42
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,820
Du Jingchuang asked me to
come back and check it out.

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
I found that you weren't there.

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,580
I knew

45
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,540
you didn't die.

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,940
I didn't say a word.

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,180
He doesn't know anything.

48
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Should I thank you for that?

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,060
No, that's not what I mean.

50
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,460
For all these years,

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,420
I've never stopped being penitent.

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,580
How would you rascals
who stole from people

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,780
and got turfed off a ship

54
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,180
be penitent?

55
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,100
My dad sympathized with you

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,300
for having to make a living
and treat your sick wife and children.

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,740
My dad looked beyond your mistakes

58
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,180
and let you work in Yongsheng still.

59
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,660
My dad let me call you

60
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,500
Uncle Wu.

61
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,420
What about you?

62
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,500
You and that ungrateful traitor,

63
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,060
Du Jingchuang,

64
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,380
what did you do?

65
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,580
You smuggled opium

66
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,540
and betrayed my family.

67
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,620
You killed my parents

68
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,180
and buried their daughter alive.

69
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,980
How would you be penitent?

70
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,860
Du Jingchuang has never

71
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,380
involved me in his business.

72
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,940
I don't know anything.

73
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,700
That day,

74
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,980
his conversation with Mr. Jiang

75
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,180
was recorded on a record.

76
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,580
What record?

77
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,300
It's in

78
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,620
Du Jingchuang's study.

79
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,500
That's the proof of his guilt.

80
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,260
Miss,

81
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,580
send me to hell.

82
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,740
(Tombs of Xu Yinglan, Jiang Yezhou,
Jiang Susu)

83
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,300
I won't kill you.

84
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,580
I want you to suffer every rainy night.

85
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,060
(Tombs of Xu Yinglan, Jiang Yezhou,
Jiang Susu) I want you to be haunted

86
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,700
by your own sins.

87
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,500
Hell?

88
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,940
You're already in hell.

89
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,940
(I'm breathing fresh air again.)

90
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780

91

92

93

Why hasn't the light been fixed?

Wu disappeared.

147
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,860
I couldn't find him anywhere.

148
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,940
I've asked someone else to fix it.

149
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,420
Where did he go in this weather?

150
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,460
Ma'am,

151
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,140
if you can't sleep,

152
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,100
I can cook you
some tranquilizing soup.

153
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,460
Xiaocui,

154
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
you don't

155
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,100
have to cook soup.

156
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,540
Stay here and keep me company.

157
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm a little scared.

158
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,700
OK.

159
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
Xiaocui,

160
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,740
thank you.

161
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,580
Over the years,

162
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,940
whether Master is home or not,

163
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,300
whether thunder or lightning,

164
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,500
you're always there for me.

165
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,540
Ma'am, don't say that.

166
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,940
I'm your maid.

167
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,060
Do you know why Master

168
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,540
dislikes me?

169
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,580
I think

170
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,260
Master doesn't dislike you,

171
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,660
only that he likes another woman.

172
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,500
May I come in?

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Come in.

174
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,020
The power is back.

175
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,660
Dry your hair first.

176
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,900
I'll leave the congee
and medicine here.

177
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,340
Don't forget them.

178
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,500
Wait.

179
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,940
Where did you find me?

180
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
The backyard.

181
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,060
When I was fixing the electricity,

182
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,180
you lied on the ground there.

183
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,060
Backyard?

184
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,460
Backyard.

185
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,260
What's wrong?

186
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,780
Let me help you.

187
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,140
No.

188
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,180
