3
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,700
Master,

4
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,580
that house

5
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,580
has trapped me for a long time.

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,940
Now I can finally leave.

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,740
From now on,

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,180
whether you live

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,580
or die,

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
whether you love me

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,900
or hate me,

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,780
they're all meaningless.

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,540
Wanyi.

14
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,940
Ma'am.

15
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,220
Master.

16
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,380
You need a rest cure now.

17
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Don't get excited.

18
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,060
Master, you must be curious.

19
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,020
Why was the bomb in your car?

20
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,180
You are

21
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,740
as ruthless as always.

22
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,380
But this time,

23
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,500
the ill man finally has his ill day.

24
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,180
You asked Secretary Luo

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,940
to plant the bomb in Du Xunyu's car.

26
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,420
But no one thought that

27
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,460
Zeng Baoqi would see everything.

28
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,740
He took the bomb out

29
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,100
and hid it in your car.

30
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,180
As a result,

31
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,380
Du Xunyu, the good man, is well rewarded.

32
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,900
That's why we are both alive.

33
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,540
Master, are you disappointed?

34
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,540
Let me tell you
something more disappointing.

35
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,860
In fact, I'm still alive,

36
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,580
Uncle Du.

37
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,740
Uncle Du, you're right about some things

38
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,980
and wrong about other things.

39
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,820
I wonder if you still remember me.

40
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,300
I'm Jiang Susu,

41
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,900
the daughter of Jiang Yezhou
and Xu Yinglan.

42
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,180
So, Master, you mustn't die.

43
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,140
You must witness the day

44
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,220
I avenge my family.

45
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,060
Have a good rest.

46
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,660
By the way,

47
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,300
I think I should

48
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,220
remind you of something.

49
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,060
I've never married you.

50
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,730
You said it yourself

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
that the man who married me

52
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,340
was Du Xunyu.

53
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,900
No.

54
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,820
Perhaps you don't know his real name.

55
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,020
It's Shen Xingzhi.

56
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,340
What's wrong?

57
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,980
Nothing.

58
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,020
I was thinking.

59
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,980
It's winter now.

60
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,300
Keep yourself warm.

61
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,060
Thanks.

62
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,100
I was thinking about

63
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,100
what we should do next

64
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,020
to uncover the mastermind

65
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,900
behind all this.

66
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,740
Look.

67
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
What?

68
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,420
Could you empty

69
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,620
your mind

70
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,780
and just watch the stars?

71
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,020
Leave the rest

72
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,220
to me.

73
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,100
But there are no stars tonight.

74
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,140
There are.

75
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,340
Where are they?

76
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,660
Don't move.

77
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
What are you doing?

78
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,580
What's this?

79
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,740
A starry sky kaleidoscope.

80
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,020
Starry sky kaleidoscope?

81
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,540
Try and rotate it.

82
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,500
It will present various starry skies.

83
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,900
Amazing!

84
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,660
With this,

85
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,860
from now on,

86
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,300
you can see the starry sky anytime.

87
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,980
Is this the Big Bang

88
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,620
that the professor

89
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,780
mentioned before?

90

Du Xunyu,

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,140
you once hurt me and I once hurt you.

114
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,380
We were kind of even.

115
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,740
But you didn't let her kill me
last time.

116
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,780
And you also saved me.

117
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,900
I distinguish kindness
and hatred clearly.

118
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,260
So I returned you a favor.

119
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,140
But your father killed my father.

120
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,380
And I almost killed your father.

121
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,860
There's enmity between us.

122
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
We're destined not to be friends.

123
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,860
Actually, he isn't my father.

124
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,740

125

In short,

127
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,460

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,820
No?

129
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,460
I'm not Jiang Ying, either.

What the heck?

131
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,220
I don't get it.

132
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,500
So, we can be friends after all.
