go and close the kitchen window.

5
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,390
The howl of the wind is terrifying.

6
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,830
Mr. Wu, what are you doing here?

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,040
This...

8
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,630

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,190
It's going to be smothered.

Uncle Wu.

11
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,390
Uncle Wu,

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
are you OK?

13
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,910
Uncle Wu,

14
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,550
you seem to be afraid of me.

15
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,110
My tombstone is dirty.

16
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,240
Could you clean it for me?

17
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,550
OK, I'll go.

18
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,880
I'll go.

It's raining so heavily.

21
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,800
The thunder and rain

22
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,390
are scary.

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,470
Why is the electricity off?

27
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,390
Wu!

28
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,600
I... I'm going now.

29
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,830

Wu,

32
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,790
why haven't you
turned off the phonograph?

33
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,110

45
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,790
I'm telling you,

46
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,880
clean up this room,

47
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,640

48
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,480
