=Episode 9 Dangerous Her=

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,070
What are you doing?

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,040
What do you think
I'm doing in the kitchen?

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,880
Are you hungry?

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,470
I haven't eaten all day.

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,040
How can I not be hungry?

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,150
I saw you walking here and there,

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,000
back and forth with a knife.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,240
Were you looking for food?

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,150
There isn't any food

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,790
in this kitchen.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,310
Weird.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,750
How do you know where the food is?

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,680
You act like you were at your own home.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,230
Don't you know how to cook?

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm done talking with you.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,190
If you continue to chop like this,

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,830
you'll awaken the whole family.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,910
Watch me.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,160
Eat.

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,910
Eat.

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,360
How do you like it?

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,360
Good.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,830
Take your time.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,590
It's all yours.

27
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,550
What smells so good
in the middle of the night?

28
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,550
You almost scared me to death.

29
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,270
What are you doing?

30
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,470
Ma'am, I was hungry at night.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,190
So I came downstairs
and got something to eat.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,960
No wonder it smells so good.

33
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,830
Why is there an extra portion?

34
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,720
I made an extra.

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,750
Would you like to eat?

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm not hungry.

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,030
An extra, huh?

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,600
We'd better not waste it.

39
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,960
It isn't bad.

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,550
I'll make do with it.

41
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,360
Shall I make you another one?

42
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,460
(Operating Room)

43
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,320
No wonder Du Jingchuang was so anxious
to go on the trip.

44
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,880
It turns out that our people

45
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,550
destroyed his opium business in Yuezhou.

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,960
It's such a shame.

47
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,390
We haven't uncovered the person
behind Du Jingchuang.

48
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,190
I must earn his trust
as soon as possible

49
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,160
so he'll take me to smuggle opium.

50
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,190
By the way,

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,190
how are things going with the Du Family?

52
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,960
There's a little situation.

53
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,030
But

54
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,670
nothing will go wrong.

55
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,960
Only now Mr. Zeng is dead,

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,670
and we can't find any clue about

57
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,080
Du Jingchuang using
the ship of Yongsheng to smuggle opium.

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,670
It's even harder to clear the name

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,880
of the Jiang Family.

60
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,960
What?

61
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,600
Do you think of Jiang Susu again?

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
I always have an illusion that

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,070
Susu is still alive.

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,230
If Du Jingchuang wasn't useful,

65
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,320
I would kill the traitor

66
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,790
right now.

67
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,510
(What is she doing now?)

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,950
Young Master.

69
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,510
Where is Mistress Jiang?

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,320
She is in the kitchen.

71
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Young Master.

72
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,760
Mistress Jiang.

73
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,000
Young Master.

74
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,070
Xiaocui,

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,390
what soup do we have today?

76
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,160
West Lake Beef Soup.

77
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,880
Ma'am.

78
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,950
What's wrong?

79
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,950
There seemed to be a fly.

80
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,510
Ma'am.

81
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,600
What's wrong again?

82
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,540
This dish,

83
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,900
the cook told me it was salty.

84
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,460
You'd better not try it.

85
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,260
It isn't salty.

86
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,180
Ma'am.

87
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,020
What's wrong this time?

88
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,060
This dish...

89
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,620
Look at that tofu.

90
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,780
It looks dark and stale.

91
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,860
It definitely tastes bad.

92
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,380
I'm full.

93
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,260
Enjoy yourselves.

94
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,620
Already?

95
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,220
She just left like that?

96
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,860
It's rude.

97
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,900
Is this edible?

98
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,340
Sure.

99
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,060
(Jiang Ying,)

100
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,540
It's spicy.

101
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,820
(no matter what your purpose is,)

102
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,300
Who cooked this?

103
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,060
(I'll keep an eye on you.)

104
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,860
Young Master.

105
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,060
I found this guy.

106
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,820
Du...

107
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,660
Mr. Du, what can I do for you?

108
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,060
What did you trade with a woman

109
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,660
here yesterday?

110
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,020
Dr. Li,

111
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,500
what's this?

112
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,380
This is a new type of medicine,

113
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,940
which should've been
smuggled from abroad.

114
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,060
It's used for calming patients.

115
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,980
Speaking of which,

116
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,980
has your friend suffered from

117
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,780
serious mental irritation?

118
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,580
Serious mental irritation.

119
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,500
Do you mean

120
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,980
she is mentally disturbed?

121
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,180
Wu.

122
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,380
Ma'am.

123
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,380
Close the door.

124
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,460
Come here.

125
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,460
I asked you to keep an eye on
Mistress Jiang and Young Master.

126
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,380
Why haven't you found out
about anything?

127
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,060
There's nothing between

128
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,820
Mistress Jiang and Young Master.

129
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,940
All right.

130
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,180
Keep watching them.

131
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,940
Mistress Jiang went to...

132
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,580
Just go.

133
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,460
OK.

134
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,980
Ma'am, soup is ready.

135
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,420
Do you want to have some now?

136
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,780
Master isn't home.

137
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,380
Why would I want to eat soup?

138
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,740
I can't believe him.

139
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,260
He's been away for days

140
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,940
without a phone call.

141
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,860
How could he ask me

142
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,500
to look after his precious concubine?

143
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,140
What did you say?

144
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,660
Ma'am, Master asked you to
look after Mistress Jiang.

145
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,860
Shall I save her a bowl of soup?

146
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,820
Are you kidding?

147
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,740
Don't save her any rice or dishes.

148
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,740
Maybe some rice, no dishes.

149
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Is she really

150
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,380
(mentally disturbed?)

151
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,300
(She took great pains to move in,)

152
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,820
(but she didn't do anything after that.)

153
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,460
(She's like a landmine)

154
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,540
(that makes people shake with fear.)

155
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,180
(So,)

156
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,380
(is her target Du Jingchuang?)

157
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,260
(Forget it.)

158
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,460
(As long as she doesn't
disturb my plan,)

159
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,860
(I don't care.)

160
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,860
(What is this guy thinking?)

161
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,020
(Isn't he tired of)

162
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,660
(following me?)

163
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,900
What's their problem?

164
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,980
Not saying a word,

165
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,700
they just eat rice quietly.

166
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,140
Why?

167
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,580
Because they have no dishes.

168
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,220
Why don't they?

169
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,860
Because...

170
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
That's your order.

171
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,220
Uncle Wu.

172
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,060
That's my red hair tie.

173
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,220
Could you please return it to me?

174
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,580
(Clean up this room,)

175
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,020
or you'll be the murderer
on the front page tomorrow.

176
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,780
This is the hair tie
I used when I was a child.

177
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,780
My dad bought it for me personally

178
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,180
when he was still alive.

179
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,260
I liked it very much.

180
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,820
Thanks for finding it for me.

181
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,900
Uncle Wu, could you let me go?

182
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,020
Miss.

183
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,700
Don't blame me.

185
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,660
Uncle Wu, don't.

186
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,700
Uncle Wu.

187
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,220
No, Uncle Wu.

188
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,860
No.

189
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,580
Uncle Wu.

190
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,020
I still have work to do.

191
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,620
