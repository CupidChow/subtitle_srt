Xunyu,

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,580
you're a man.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,020
A scar is nothing to you.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,340
Why don't you

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,740
show it to Mr. Zeng?

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,540
What are you waiting for?

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,860
Hurry up.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,020
You'll be a dead man
if there's one stitch missing.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,660
It can't be right.

12
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,180
You must...

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,020
Save it, Mr. Zeng.

14
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,180
I have

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,820
many other scars.

16
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,340
In those years when I wasn't
living with my father,

17
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,140
I fought all the fights I could have.

18
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,700
You did all these things today

19
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,260
just to humiliate my father, didn't you?

20
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,660
Are you satisfied?

21
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,020
You brat.

22
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,980
How dare you talk to me in this way?

23
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,580
Shoot me.

24
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,820
Do you think I dare not?

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,420
Mr. Zeng.

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,100
Mr. Zeng,

27
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,260
what are you doing?

28
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,180
Why can't you

29
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,380
control your temper for once?

30
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,300
Look,

31
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,460
we've been

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,340
working together for years.

33
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,900
No matter your temper

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,500
or my temper,

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,780
we know well about it.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,100
If anything happens

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,420
to Xunyu today,

38
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,260
I don't know how many people
will be buried with him.

39
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,620
What do you think, Baoqi?

40
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,940
Dad.

41
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,820
Fine.

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,820
I'll spare him today, OK?

43
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
Go!

44
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,300
What a coincidence, Mr. Du.

45
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,620
We meet again,

46
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,980
Miss Jiang.

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,380
What can I do for you?

48
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,540
I come here to thank you.

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,340
If it weren't for you,

50
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,100
I wouldn't be able to
confirm my identity.

51

52

53
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,780
Go.

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,540
Mr. Du, you really have a special way

55
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,900
to say thank you.

56
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,900
Cut the crap.

57
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,660
How did you know my identity?

58
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,300
In the years when I studied abroad,

59
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,420
the real Du Xunyu was my classmate.

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,940
And?

61
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,700
What else do you know?

62
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,660
I also know you have a weak point.

63
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,220
You're softhearted.

64
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,140
How about this?

65
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
You can still be Du Xunyu,

66
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,350
and I'm still Jiang Ying.

67
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,390
Let's not cross the line.

68
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,380
What has Jiang Ying

69
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,060
- been doing recently?
- Here we are.

70
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,700
In the last few days,

71
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,580
she didn't go anywhere special

72
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,420
other than New Xianlin.

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
Our people have been
keeping an eye on her.

74
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,900
Thanks.

75
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,660
No problem.

76
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,780
Liang,

77
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,100
are those men our people?

78
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,260
No.

79
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,140
Go check them.

80
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,060
OK.

81
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,420
Hurry.

82
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,500
Say it.

83
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,500
Who sent you to follow me?

84
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,700
Young Master,

85
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,740
I kind of know those guys.

86
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,260
They seem to work for Zeng Baoqi.

87
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,140
Zeng Baoqi?

88
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,220
Hello, Miss Jiang.

89
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,860
Mr. Zeng?

90
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,020
We have no enmity against each other.

91
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,820
Why did you catch me?

92
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,660
(Smoking or Open Flames Prohibited)

93
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,100
I can't afford to provoke Du Jingchuang.

94
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,900
I can't beat his son, either.

95
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,820
But I can at least

96
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,020
fix his mistress.

97
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,620
What's that look?

98
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,500
The look that despises you.

99
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,540
Despises me?

100
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,900
I'll make you respect me today.

101
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,180
I'm going to cut your face.

102
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,540
Let's see if Du Jingchuang
will still like you.

103
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,060
What happened?

104
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,660
Go check.

105
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,780
