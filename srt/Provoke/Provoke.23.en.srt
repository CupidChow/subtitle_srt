00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,620
Du Jingchuang died so easily.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,220
What a shame.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,780
Now that Du Jingchuang is dead,

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,380
someone will definitely come forward.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,740
The one who jumps out at this moment

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,220
must be the real mastermind

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,380
behind his opium business.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,780
The man behind him?

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,460
You haven't slept for two days.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,780
What are you looking for?

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,020
The record.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,140
I searched the entire house

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,260
but didn't find it.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,700
But I always feel that

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,940
it must be hidden somewhere.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,580
I think

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,700
I must have missed something.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,740
Could you please

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,620
take a short break?

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,980
But I have to find the record

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,180
to reclaim my identity

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,980
and clear the name of my family.

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,060
Jiang Susu.

26
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,900
If you were the same Jiang Susu
you used to be,

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,980
you should

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,740
go to school

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,580
at this age.

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,980
But I'm no longer the same Jiang Susu.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,220
Then could you pretend to be

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,500
the same Jiang Susu for one day?

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,660
How could I?

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,500
Let me take you out.

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,660
No.

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,740
Du Jingchuang just died.

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,300
There is gossip flying around.

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,580
If we go out together before

39
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,140
recovering our original identities,

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,180
people will point fingers
and laugh at us.

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,820
I'll go get prepared.

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,380

I just pick you up in passing.

200
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,620
In passing?

201
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,580
