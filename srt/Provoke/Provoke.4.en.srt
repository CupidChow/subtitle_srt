140
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,340
Is this your personal grudge

141
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,540
or the internal contradiction
of your company?

142
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,060

158
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,060
Mr. Du treats me very kindly

159
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,100

160
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,540

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,980
Mr. Zeng,

195
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,460
did you really kidnap Miss Jiang?

196
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,220
Really, Mr. Zeng?

197
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,660
Did you cause her injuries?

198
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,020
Yeah, give us an explanation.

199
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,220
Please answer us, Mr. Zeng.

200
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,580
Give us an explanation.

201
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,220
Say something.

202
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,940
- Please explain.
- Say something.

203
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,220
Say something. Make a comment.

204
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,660
Get out of the way.

205
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,300
Stop shooting.

206
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,020
Step aside.

207
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,740
Stop shooting.

208
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,820
Sorry to make you suffer.

209
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,300
Great!

210
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,280
Congratulations, Mr. Du.

211
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,220
(Fate treats me
both cruelly and kindly.)

212
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,580
(Every time I stand by the abyss,)

213
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,540
(I either fall down or)

214
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,020
(take a step further.)

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Congratulations.

216
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,220
You won again.

217
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,660
It's too early to say that.

218
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,620
We'll see.

219
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,180
Mr. Zeng,

220
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,580
this is the second time
you've pointed a gun at me.

221
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,180
Don't worry.

222
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,100
There won't be a third time.

223
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,780
Mr. Zeng,

224
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,140
calm down, let's talk.

225
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,780
Don't worry.

226
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,380
It'll soon be your turn.

227
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,100
Mr. Zeng,

228
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,700
don't push me.

229
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,380
If you dare to move,

230
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,060
I'll shoot her first.

231
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,540
What does she have to do with me?

232
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,300
Kill her if you'd like.

233
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,020
But do you think it's worth it

234
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,620
to trade your life for hers?

235
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,380
Brat.

236
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,060
Wanna scare me?

237
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,980
