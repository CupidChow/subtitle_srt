I'll shoot her first.

Kill her if you'd like.

7

But do you think it's worth it

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,300
to trade your life for hers?

I'm sorry

It was urgent yesterday.

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,580
I didn't ask your permission

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,820
before I decided to

28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,460
announce I would marry you.

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,660
I was abrupt.

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,420
I understand.

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,340
You tried to protect me.

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,500
I know as a humble singer,

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,220
I'm not worthy of you.

34
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,500
That's not what I mean.

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,820
I want to say,

36
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,380
if you're with me,

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,100
you'll probably face more danger.

stay in bed to recuperate.

When you recover,

43
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,260
we'll choose an auspicious day
for our wedding.

I have news.

51
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,540

Yes.

I never thought that

Du Jingchuang would kill Mr. Zeng.

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,500
They didn't divide the spoils evenly.

57
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,740
Mr. Zeng would challenge
Du Jingchuang sooner or later.

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,380
Only that you gave

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,380
Du Jingchuang an opportunity.

60
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,100
But still,

61
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,820
it was really dangerous.

62
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,260
The gun was pointing at your head.

63
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,380
If he hadn't put me in that position,

64
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
I couldn't have proved my identity.

65
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,260
Now that Mr. Zeng is dead,

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,260
I'm afraid that

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,620

68
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,660

Jiang Yezhou already knew
something was wrong with the ship.

82

83
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,060

behaved well.

you brought Du Xunyu home a year ago.

123
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,660
I put up with it.

124
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,660
After all, I didn't bear a child
for the family.

125
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,580
But Jiang Ying

126
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,660
is just a humble singer.

127
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,100

129
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,340

She's just a concubine.

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,060
She isn't worth bothering about.

135
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,780
In my uncle's opinion,

136
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,020
you're not taking a concubine,

137
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,540

147
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,020
you're going to take a concubine.

148
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,580
It's natural for me to pitch a tantrum.

149
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,180
You gave me this jade bracelet

150
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,300
when we got married.

151
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,020
I'm ready to

152
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,460
give it to her as a welcome gift.

153
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,380
You're the backbone

154
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,940
of our family and the company.

155
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,860

156
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,660
we've been married for years.

157
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,260
You needn't do this.

158
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,700
Don't worry.

159
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,580
You're the only

160
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,300
Mrs. Du.

161
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,300
I thought Jingchuang wasn't
interested in other women.

162
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,180
Then suddenly, he decided to
take a concubine.

163
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,620
Xiaocui,

164
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,260
what do you think he is thinking?

165
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,980
Maybe,

166
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,860
Master wants to get you a companion.

167
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,260
Are you insane?

168
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,500
What are you talking about?

169
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,020
Ma'am, don't be mad.

170
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,780
She's just a concubine.

171
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,540
I'll get you some soup.

172
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm too angry to have soup.

173
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,820
Take it to his precious son.

174
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,500
Stop.

175
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,700
Where are you going?

176
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,980
Take it to Young Master.

177
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,780
Don't you know I was talking ironically?

178
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,420
When Jiang Ying joins the family,

179
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,260
are you going to
serve both of them soup?

180
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,820
I dare not.

181
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,500
Both of them?

182
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,700
Xiaocui,

183
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,780
invite Miss Jiang over tomorrow.

184
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,300
We're going to be a family, after all.

185
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,100
I'll teach her

186
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,020
some rules in advance.

187
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,340
Get on.

188
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,580
I thought you were
trading your life for money,

189
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,860
not expecting that you wanted to
trade your life for life.

190
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,740
But I must remind you of one thing.

191
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
I don't care why you want to

192
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,300
infiltrate the Du Family,

193
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,380
but every member of the family
is important to me.

194
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,100
You can't touch them.

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,940
Do you hear me?

196
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,100
OK.

197
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,940
I promise.

198
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,460
Ying,

199
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,220
why did you come back so late?

200
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,820
I was delayed by something.

201
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,500
I tell you what,

202
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,020
you shouldn't tangle with Du Xunyu.

203
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,980
Instead, you should focus your mind

204
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,260
on Mr. Du.

205
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,580
As long as you can please him,

206
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,100
he'll give you anything.

207
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,900
Yeah.

208
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,780
I shouldn't waste time on him.

209
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,740
I should please Mr. Du

210
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,980
and take back everything I want.

211
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,140
By the way,

212
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,620
Mrs. Du sent someone today.

213
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,860
She asked you to stop by her house
tomorrow morning.

214
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,740
Mrs. Du?

215
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,460
Qin Wanyi?

216
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,700
I tell you what,

217
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,060
she's the niece of Mr. Liang,

218
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,180
the president of
Tangcheng Chamber of Commerce.

219
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,060
You must be careful.

220
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,260
She's difficult to deal with.

221
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,780
I see.

222
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
Do you want me to teach you

223
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,620
something about the upper class...

224
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,260
Nasty temper.

225
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,180
Sir,

226
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,860
let's work with him this time, sir.

227
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,740
Shall we?

228
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,140
Impossible.

229
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,780
(Tablet of Jiang Yezhou)
You killed Master.

230
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,100
You won't get away with it. You won't!

231
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,180
(Memorial)

232
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,380
Master,

233
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,180
will you come back for dinner tonight?

234
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
What's up?

235
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,220
Nothing.

236
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,740
I invited Miss Jiang over.

237
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,140
I thought we would be a family soon,

238
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,740
and we'd better have dinner together.

239
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,100
You invited Miss Jiang over?

240
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,060
Why didn't you tell me about

241
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,100
such an important thing?

242
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,940
I'm unprepared.

243
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,260
Don't worry.

244
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,260
I've prepared a generous gift

245
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,340
for Miss Jiang.

246
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,820
OK, then.

247
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,340
Bye.

250
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,660
I told Young Master.

251
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,460
He'll stay at home today.

252
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,060
