3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,300
(Death Certificate Object: Du Xunyu)

4
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,500
Secretary Luo,

5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,300
do you think Xunyu

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,460
is really dead?

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,020
Is there a mistake

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,020
in that document?

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,340
Many things have happened

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,340
since Young Master was back.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,140
Lots of our information has been leaked.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,580
If you think it over,

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,980
Young Master is indeed
the most suspicious one.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,340
Mr. Liang has never

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,780
believed Young Master's identity.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,780
He's been investigating him.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,940
He doesn't want to fall out with you,

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,900
so he has kept it secret till now.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,620
When Young Master comes,

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,420
it would be perfect
if you can make him confess.

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,740
If you can't,

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,140
keep him alive.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,220
Yes.

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,100
(Smoking or Open Flames Prohibited)

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,940
It's you!

26
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,420
Why are you here?

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,780
Why am I here?

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,900
Your father killed my father.

29
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,860
You did so many nasty things to me.

30
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,780
I wish I could kill you!

31
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,580
Zeng Baoqi, calm down!

32
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,820
Go to hell!

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,100
Jiang Ying?

34
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,740
Du Jingchuang is searching for you
around the city.

35
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,340
You can't even take a train now.

36
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,620
Here is a new identity

37
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,540
and a shipping ticket

38
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,940
for you to get out of here.

39
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,060
Are you OK?

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,220
Yes.

41
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,100
Why are you here?

42
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,820
Du Jingchuang knows your identity.

43
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
It's a trap.

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,780
We must leave now.

45
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,740
How dare you fool me?

46
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,860
Why don't you use the gun?

47
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,580
Shoot me if you dare!

48
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,900
Don't kill him.

49
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,780
If I don't kill him,

50
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,500
he'll tell people about

51
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,660
seeing us tonight.

52
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,580
Then we'll both die.

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,820
Calm down.

54
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,020
Go to hell!

55
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,020
Zeng Baoqi,

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,340
your father didn't educate you well.

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,780
I'll give you a lesson on his behalf.

58
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,620
If you still take me as a friend,

59
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
don't kill him.

60
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,980
He isn't a bad guy.

61
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,500
I hurt him first.

62
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,380
Then Du Jingchuang killed his father.

63
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,860
Just spare his life.

64
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,460
Leave now!

65
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,740
Hurry. Let's get out of here.

66
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,140
Let me take you to the hospital.

67
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,060
I didn't know you could drive.

68
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,620
Awesome.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,300
Stop talking now.

70
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,380
Hang in there.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,820
We'll be at the hospital soon.

72
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,780
Go to the hospital on Chengqian Street.

73
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,420
Why do we have to go there?

74
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,420
Do as I say.

75
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,860
If you hesitate,

76
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,580
my blood will drain away.

77
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,500
OK.

78
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,180
OK.

79
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,500
Be careful.

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,940
Help me to the bed.

81
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,540
Come.

82
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,660
But there's no doctor.

83
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,700
How can I help you?

84
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,700
On my left.

85
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,860
There is a cabinet on my left.

86
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,420
Behind it is a secret room.

87
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,500
Go get me some clean clothes.

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,500
Don't come out

89
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,580
before I call you.

90
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,460
Go.

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,260
Be careful.

92
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,860
It'll accompany you

93
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,980

Zeng Baoqi?

Cheers.

159
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,020
No worries. I'm used to it.

160
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,660
You were a crybaby when we were young.

161
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,260
But now you're so stubborn.

162
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,420
I didn't recognize you in the beginning.

163
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,100
You're different from

164
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,180
the young Shen Xingzhi either.

165
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820

Previously,

167
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,340
when I was playing Du Xunyu,

168
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,340
I offended you.

169
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,820
Pardon me.

170
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,180
I'll drink this as a forfeit.

171
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,180
Stop. Don't drink so much.

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,620
Shen Xingzhi, I've got a...

173
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,860
This is...

174
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,940
Jiang Susu.

175
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,020
This is Dr. Li,

176
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
who works with me on the

177

Du Jingchuang's smuggling case.

178
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,940
Hello, Miss Jiang.

179
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,660
Hello, Dr. Li.

180
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,980
I come over to check if you're fine.

181
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,900
Now that you're drinking,

182
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,380
I assume there's nothing serious.

183
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,580
So,

184
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,180
you continue.

185
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,140

186
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,340
See you.

♪Like a disorderly movie♪

190
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,260
How did you become Du Xunyu?

191
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,220
When I was abroad

192
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,780
studying and doing my internships,

193
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,060
I met Du Xunyu,
who often fought and caused trouble.

194
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,020
Then I returned to China
and went to Yuezhou,

195
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,420
not expecting that

196
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,620
he stole back into China, too.

197
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,300
Later, he was infected with tetanus

198
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,740
and died from not being treated timely.

199
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,420
I knew Du Jingchuang
was looking for him.

200
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,380
So I used his identity

201
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,170
to get myself into the Du Family.

202
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,130
♪It felt a little unfamiliar♪

203
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,900
I never thought that

204
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,820
we once stayed in the same place.

205
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,940
After I narrowly escaped death,

206
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,300
I was homeless for a while.

207
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,980
Then a couple adopted me
and took me abroad.

208
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,340
They gave me a good life

209
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,700
and sent me to school.

210
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,140
That was when

211
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,100
I met the real Du Xunyu

212
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,980
and became his classmate.

213
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
Then, my foster parents died of illness.

214
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,660
So I came back.

215
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,020
Susu,

216
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,460
Uncle Jiang was my life savior.

217

You can leave
the rest of the thing to me.

218
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,900
I'll help you finish it.

219
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,100
I knew exactly

220
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,060
when we talked things out,

221
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,060
you would say that.

222
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
I must avenge my family on my own.

223
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,500
Susu.

224
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,940
You...

225
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,820
I'm not doing it
only for you and your family.

226
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,620
He is my target too.

227
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,180
Only by rooting out this man

228
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,420
and the chain of interests behind him,

229
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,860
could I save people

230
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,300
from disasters.

231
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,820
I won't stop you.

232
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,300
You shouldn't stop me, either.

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,820
What I need now

235
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,740
isn't a brother

236
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,860
that can protect my safety,

237
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,100
but a man who can

238
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,700
fight side by side with me.

239
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,740
What's your next plan?

240
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,300
Wu told me

241
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,940
there was a record

242
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,580
that recorded the conversation

243
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,580
between my dad and Du Jingchuang
on the day of the incident.

244
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,900
The content of the record

245
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,620
can not only restore
the reputation of my family,

246
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,860
but also expose all the crimes

247
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,180
Du Jingchuang committed.

248
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,260
He said the record was in his study.

249
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,940
But I didn't find it there.

250
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,500
Since it's proof of his guilt,
he should have destroyed it.

251
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,700
Why would he keep it?

252
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,380
We can only know about it

253
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,380
after finding the record.

254
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,260
By the way,

255
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,460
I found Du Xunyu's

256
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,500
death certificate in the study.

257
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,260
Du Jingchuang already knows that
you are fake.

258
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,660
So it was a trap.

259
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,140
If Du Jingchuang knows I'm fake,

260
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,620
he'll definitely do something.

261
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,340
What are you going to do?

262
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,220
Now that we're both playing tricks,

263
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,220
let's see who will win.

264
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,540
We've searched Zeng Baoqi.

265
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,540
We didn't find anything

266
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,780
other than this dagger.

267
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,980
There's blood outside the warehouse

268
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,860
and on the dagger,

269
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,180
but he doesn't have any knife wounds.

270
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,740
You mean...

271
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,940
I suspect that

272
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,380
the pool of blood may
belong to Young Master.

273
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,140
He was there.

274
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,180
Ma'am, your soup.

275
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,900
Xunyu, are you OK?

276
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,900
You don't look well lately.

277
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,100
No worries. I'm just

278
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,420
a little tired.

279
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,380
Xiaocui,

280
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,300
get Xunyu a bowl of soup.

281
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,940
Yes, Master.

282
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,220
I'm sorry. Sorry, Young Master.

283
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,660
It's OK.

284
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,900
Xiaocui, what's wrong with you?

285
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,260
The soup is so hot!

286
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,860
It's OK. No worries.

287
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,900
Help Young Master
take off his clothes quickly.

288
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,260
No, thanks.

289
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,460
I only need to towel it.

290
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,300
I'll get a towel.

291
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,780
Sit down.

292
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,140
Sit.

293
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,260
Xiaocui,

294
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,820
what are you waiting for?

295
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,540
Take off Young Master's clothes.

296
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,780
It's OK.

297
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,820
I have thick skin.

298
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,860
I'll just go take a shower.

299
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,500
Xunyu,

300
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,740
