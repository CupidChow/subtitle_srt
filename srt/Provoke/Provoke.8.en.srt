00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,460
Come.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,500
Master,

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,340
from now on,

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,580
Mistress Jiang and I

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,140
will be sure to see much of each other.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,460
You're always busy outside.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,180
I really don't know

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,460
how I should get along with her.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,100
You're the madam of the family.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,820
Ying is a

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,420

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,380
After she moves in,

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,060
you just need to take care of her.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,620
OK.

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,060
Master,

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,380
Secretary Luo came.

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,220
Excuse me.

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,340
Sir.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,780
What's up?

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,540
Get ready.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
We're setting off now.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,740
Yes.

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,820
Set off now?

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,460
Master, are you going on a trip?

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,580
Should the wedding continue?

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,300
By the way,

32
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,660
shall we take off the decorations?

33
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,340
Find a way to put it up.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:47,860
Yes. Young Master.

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,820
Yes, Young Master.

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,300
Master, are you in such a hurry?

37
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,670
When will you come back?

38
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,200
Dad.

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,140
Dad,

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,900
she's just a concubine,
the red silk flowers...

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,540
What's wrong, Dad?

42
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,620
We have trouble in Yuezhou.

43
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,700
I have to take care of it.

44
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,860
By the way,

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,020
as for Miss Jiang,

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,980
you pick her up for me.

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,940
Me?

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,180
Tell her

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,020
it's an emergency. Ask her to pardon me.

50
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,340
She's a sensible woman
who can see the big picture.

51
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,340
She shouldn't
care much about the ritual.

52
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,940
OK.

53
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,100
Master,

54
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,300
what about the tea ceremony?

55
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,220
You make arrangements for it.

56
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,540
Go.
