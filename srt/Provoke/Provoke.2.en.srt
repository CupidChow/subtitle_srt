13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,790
What do you need?

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,720
Dad,

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
why did you suddenly entrust me

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,630
with such an important business

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,840
as the cargo business?

18
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,520
Xunyu,

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,520
come.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,150
Have a cup of tea with me.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,720
Xunyu,

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,270
since you were little,

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,800
you hadn't been with me.

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,480
When you were six,

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,120
I left you and your mom.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,550
In the last 16 years,

27
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,230
you suffered a lot.

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,510
Now we're finally reunited.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
Let me make it up to you.

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,000
I owe this to your mom.

31
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,360
I should share

32
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,760
your cares and burdens.

33
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,440
Then I should entrust you

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,510
with the company business.

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,800
Dad,

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,160
I won't let you down.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,400
Go for it.

38
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,000
Get back to work.

00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,190
look,

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,270
once you appeared on the stage,

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,190
you attracted much attention
from many dignitaries.

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,830
You only agreed to
do two shows a week.

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,550
How am I supposed to satisfy them?

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,440
Listen.

46
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,750
They are about to make a scene.

Lan,

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,240
we agreed that

49
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,750
I would only
do two shows a week

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,110
and you would get 70% of the earning.

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,110
This is not about money.

52
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,320
I can't afford to

53
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,960
offend those people outside.

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960

Good. I'll do it.

57
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,390
Good, Sugar.

58
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll tell them to add a show.

59
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,800
Add a show.

Why are you here?

63
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,520
It's only been a few days.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,910
Miss Jiang,

65
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,390

Thanks to me,

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,720
Mr. Du, you'd better make it clear

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,000
so that I can understand.

71
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,360

72
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,470

after arriving in Tangcheng?

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,390
What's your real intention?

77
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,160

- Well,

81
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,230
could you let me in?

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,670

191
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,420
Only that

192
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,100
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,820
I let your mom down.

194
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,500
I shouldn't have touched your sore spot.

195
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,260
Let's not talk about this.

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,140
Here's to you, Dad.

197
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,420
Cheers.

198
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,020
Ying,

199
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,980
why haven't you got changed?

200
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,620
The next show will soon begin.

201
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,620
All of you, don't move.

202
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,140
Sit down.

203
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
Lan,

204
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,900
there won't be another show.

205
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,740
What are you looking at?

206
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,420
Well...

207
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,050
Sit down.

208
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,260
What...

209
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,420
What do you mean?

210
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,340
Mr. Zeng.

211
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,180
Go away.

212
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,460
Move.

213
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,460
(File Packet)

214
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,540
Sit down, all of you.

215
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,420
No peeking.

216
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,020
Look down at your waistband.

217
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
Mr. Zeng,

218
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,060
what brings you

219
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,420
here today?

220
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,620
Du Jingchuang,

221
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
your son is fake.

222
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,980
Mr. Zeng, don't speak at random.

223
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,220
You'd better show me evidence.

224
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,780
Here.

225
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,660
The evidence you want.

226
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,540
Open it and see for yourself.

227
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,300
Mr. Zeng,

228
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,940
I don't mind if you dislike me.

229
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,500
But there's no need

230
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,540
to embarrass my dad

231
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,220
in public.

232
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,660
I'm not gonna talk to you.

233
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,780
Du Jingchuang,

234
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,580
your son got stabbed in a fight

235
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,860
at a dock in Yuezhou five years ago.

236
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,660
He got a two-inch wound
on the right side of his abdomen,

237
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,620
which was closed with 12 stitches.

238
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,700
(Certificate Issued by Yuezhou Hospital)
This is the record of Yuezhou Hospital.

239
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,940
If he doesn't have a scar,

240
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,380
he is fake.

241
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,380
Dad,

242
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,340
the guy has smooth skin.

243
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,220
How could he have any scars?

244
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,340
Zeng Lao'er,

245
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,820
I get it now.

246
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,300
You took all this trouble

247
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,860
to compete for the wretched business.

248
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,100
Is it worth it?

249
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,140
Xunyu,

250
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,900
you're a man.

251
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,340
A scar is nothing to you.

252
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,660
Why don't you

253
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,060
