=Episode 21 Dead End=

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,100
I told you to leave quickly,

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,460
but you still got caught.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,700
You're really stupid.

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,860
Your father wants me dead.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,140
But you saved me and gave me money.

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,460
What's wrong with your family?

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,860
He won't

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,260
give up until he sees

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,300
your dead body.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,940
I've let someone pick you up.

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,620
Take the money and hide.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,980
Do you also want what I have?

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,020
Try to survive.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,740
Or the thing you have

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,860
will belong to me sooner or later.

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,500
Your father didn't let you
interfere in his business

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,140
because he wanted to protect you.

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,460
Do whatever you want.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,980
If you want yourself to be killed,

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,780
I won't stop you.

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,100
Sir,

24
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,780
Mr. Liang wants to see you.

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,180
(If I leave now,)

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,460
(all my efforts will be in vain.)

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,300
(I can only get well prepared)

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,980
(and consolidate at every step.)

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,180
Master.

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,540
What were you thinking?

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,540
Did I scare you?

32
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,620
No.

33
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,380
I'm just a little surprised.

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,900
Ying.

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,700
You're so pretty.

36
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,460
At the first sight of you,

37
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,700
I felt butterflies in my stomach.

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,020
You are the only woman

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,860
I've admired over the years.

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,140
If I were 20 years younger,

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,860
what a perfect match we would be!

42
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,940
Master,

43
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,300
what are you talking about?

44
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,700
Aren't we a perfect match?

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,540
It's a shame.

46
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,740
What shame?

47
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,900
It's a shame that you didn't marry me
when I was young.

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,180
Master, why do you say that?

49
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,340
Nothing.

50
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,300
I just want you to know

51
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,540
I really care about you.

52
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,180
Go to sleep.

53
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
By the way,

54
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,660
we'll have an anniversary celebration
for the company tomorrow.

55
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,620
You go with me.

56
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,100
Wear your dark blue cheongsam.

57
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,980
You look the most beautiful

58
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,260
in that one.

59
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,060
OK.

60
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,620
Sir,

61
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,220
this is Mr. Liang's final decision.

62
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Why?

63
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,900
Why would he do this to me?

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
What else?

65
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,060
Mr. Liang also said that

66
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,060
if you couldn't bear to do it,

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,540
he would do it.

68
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,380
Then let the pair of good friends

69
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
stay in their car forever.

70
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,060
Got it.

71
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Be quick.

72
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,180
Dad, you seem to enjoy drinking tea
in the side hall.

73
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,420
Drinking tea here

74
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,780
always reminds me of the past.

75
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,660
You mean your struggle experiences?

76
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,860
I'd like to hear about it.

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,340
I mean your mom.

78
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,020
I left you and your mom early.

79
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,940
I can't recall many things now.

80
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,260
I even don't remember your looks
when you were a child.

81
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,740
I always feel that

82
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,380
you look different now.

83
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,020
What's different?

84
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,020
You don't look like me.

85
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,780
But you look like your mom.

86
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,420
Perhaps.

87
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,340
(It seems that)

88
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,340
(I should prepare for the worst.)

89
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,620
(Though I haven't found the record,)

90
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,180
(I've got enough proof.)

91
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,020
(Let's end it all)

92
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,580
(at the party.)

93
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,580
Your uncles and elders
can't wait to see you.

94
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860

96
