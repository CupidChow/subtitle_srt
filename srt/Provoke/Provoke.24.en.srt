3
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,660
Sir, he wouldn't say.

4
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,060
I'm a businessman.

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,620
I don't want to waste my time on you.

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,780
I know you're not Du Xunyu.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,370
As long as you tell me

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,500
who else is in your organization,

9
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,520
where they are,

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,900
and what they want to do,

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,180
I'll let you go immediately.

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,780
Moreover, I'll give you

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,820
all of Du Jingchuang's business

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,860
in Tangcheng.

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,260
I ensure you'll enjoy

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,940
endless glory and wealth.

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,700
Since you're so stubborn,

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,660
I may as well entertain the other one.

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,660
Xunyu.

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,380
Wait.

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,980
What's there to show off
of bullying a woman?

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,660
Come torture me if you have balls!

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,020
Finally, you talk.

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,060
OK.

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,380
I know what I should do now.

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,620
What a pretty face.

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,940
Will it get prettier if I

28
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,380
cut it with this knife?

29
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,820
Kill me if you want.

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,340
Just cut the crap.

31
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,150
I said I was a businessman.

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,740
I don't like fighting or killing.

33
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,020
Wait.

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,780
Speak.

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,980
Do you know

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,060
Du Jingchuang had a record?

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,460
Go on.

38
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,940
Do you think

39
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,100
he got nothing on you

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,660
after working with you for years?

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,540
The record is the proof of your crime.

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,460
I'd like to trade the record

43
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
for her life.

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,340
Du Xunyu,

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,220
what are you talking about?

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,860
The record, we...

47
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,580
Untie her.

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,060
Yes.

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,300
Look clearly at his face.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,860
I'll give you two hours.

51
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,980
If you don't come back
with the record in two hours,

52
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,780
you'll never

53
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,580
see each other again.

54
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,940
Do you know where the record is?

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,580
In a place with light.

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,980
You can see it
if you stand in the light.

57
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,580
I'll stay here.

58
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,620
I know we can't
show up at the same time.

59
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,500

someone was going to get you.

Liang Wujing?

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,460
How come?

122
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,220
We lied to Liang Wujing that

123
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,300
we had a record
that could prove his guilt.

124
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,540

How is it going?

129
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,820
Have you found anything?

130
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,500
Nothing.

131
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
What about you?

132
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,580
I've searched the entire house

133
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,140
without finding anything.

134
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,700
What should we do?

135
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,060
Liang Wujing only gave me two hours.

136
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,860
It's almost time.

137
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,980
Don't worry.
We still have one and a half hours.

138
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,820
Don't be upset.

139
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,100
The clock is broken.

140
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,420
It hasn't been fixed yet.

141
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,220
What are you doing?

142
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,140
Master, the clock is slow.

143
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,580
Ma'am asked me to fix it.

144
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,540
Don't bother.

145
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,860

146
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,620
Yes.

147
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,260
Hasn't the clock been fixed yet?

148
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,860
It's always one hour slow.

149
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,540

No.

155
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,940
Record!

156
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,260
Here is the record.

157
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,780
You've kept your word.

158
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,500

159
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,340
Why do you come back?

160
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,740
Where did you get the record?

161
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,700
In a place with light.

162
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,620
I've made it clear.

163
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,860
I won't do such things with you that

164
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,100
will harm the country and people.

165
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,900
Mr. Jiang,

166
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,700
you can barely protect yourself now.

167
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,460
I'm kind enough to

168
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,820
give you a hand.

169
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,660
Kind?

170
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,980
If you didn't smuggle opium,

171
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,860
how could my ship be robbed?

172
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,060
180 people died.

173
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,460
I'll definitely make it public.

174
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,740
Jingchuang,

175
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,220
see him out.

176
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,260
OK.

177
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Anyway,

178
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,500
I've done my best.

179
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,420

180
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,220
take care of him.

181
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,980
Sir, I'm sorry,

182
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,060
I don't have a choice.

183
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,540
Let's work with him for once,

184
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,220
sir,

185
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,540
- OK?
- No way!

186
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,140
Du Jingchuang,

187
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,580

189
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,780

190

192
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm begging you.

193
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,060
Sir, listen to me.

194
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,900
Please,

195
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,980
listen to me for once.

196
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,300
Just once.

197
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,220
Let's work with him for once, OK?

198
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
Sir.

199
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,780
Mr. Liang.

200
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Mr. Liang.

201
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,580
You're such a wuss.

202
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,500
Take care of this.

203
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,220
Otherwise,

204
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,900
you'll be the murderer tomorrow.

205
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,740
Sir.

206
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,580
Yezhou.

207
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,540
It wasn't me.

208
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,500
Ma'am.

209
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,620
Du Jingchuang.

210
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,540
It wasn't me.

211
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,980
Ma'am,

212
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,380
it wasn't me.

213
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,660
Ma'am.

214
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,580
Ma'am.

215
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,300
It wasn't me. Listen to me.

216
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,500
It wasn't me, Ma'am.

217
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,620
You killed my husband.

218
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:36,940
It wasn't me.

219
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,980
You can't get away with it.

220
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,620
It wasn't me.

221
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,740
You can't get away with it.

222
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,060
I...

223
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,460
Ma'am.

224
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,020
I told you.

225
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,220
It wasn't me.

226
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,900
Now that you've got the record,

227
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,100
let her go.

228
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,420
Whoops.

229
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,420
The record is finished.

230
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,580
You are

231
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,300
finished, too.

232
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,900
You villain!

233
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,940
I told you

234
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,260
I was a businessman.

235
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,500
Liang Wujing,

236
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,540
are you stupid enough

237
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,260
to take it as the original?

238
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,220
It was just a copy.

239
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,780
I've made arrangements
on my way here.

240
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,220
In half an hour,

241
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,220
if you don't let us go,

242
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,380
the newspaper offices in the city

243
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,180
will each receive a record.

244
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,940
By then,

245
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,780
your crimes will be made public.

246
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,100
The reputation you've built for years

247
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,140
will be ruined by the journalists' pen.

248
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,860
You're threatening me?

249
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,860
It's useless.

250
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,180
Do you know how many people
work for me in Tangcheng?

251
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,940
In that case,

252
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,410
I'll let you

253
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,490
die without regret.

254
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,140
You guys,

255
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
stay here and watch them.

256
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,860
Make sure everything is burned.

257
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,780
