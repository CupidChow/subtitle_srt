3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
There are enough.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,120
Don't worry.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,840
I want one. I want one.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,430
Give me.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,500
I want one.

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,550
Here.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,000
(How many children)

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,000
- (are left in the orphanage?)
- No hurry.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,360
A dozen.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,840
(Many have been adopted.)

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,200
- (It seems that)
- Xiaocui.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,080
(there are still)

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,560
(many kind people in this world.)

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,950
- (They responded)
- Ma'am,

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,560
- (to your benevolence.)
- don't you feel well?

18
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,840
Shall I ask Master to come?

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,520
Xiaocui,

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,430
tell me,

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,240
has Master ever loved me?

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,740
How could he not love you?

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,820
Don't think too much.

24
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,500
I'll cook you soup when we get back.

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,500
Don't do that.

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,340
I won't eat any soup again.

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,500
It's no use

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,340
eating any more soup.

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,820
How old are these children?

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,820
The little ones are between
three to four.

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,340
The older ones are between
six to seven.

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,660
Some have stayed here for several years.

33
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,300
This place

34
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,500
can shelter them from the wind and rain.

35
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,460
You first.

36
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,190
After you.

37
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,020
Mr. Du.

38
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,260
Mr. Du, Mr. Du.

39
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,420
Thank you for funding the children.

40
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,660
You're welcome.

41
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,940
Just let me know if you need anything.

42
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,020
Thank you, Mr. Du.

43
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,980
This is yours.

44
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,980
Ying.

45
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,380
Master.

46
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,300
Mr. Du, I won't keep you any longer.

47
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,220
Xiaocui,

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,780
I'm tired. Let's get in the car.

49
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,020
Yes.

50
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,700
On our way home,

51
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,700
you ride in the same car as me.

52
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,780
What about Ma'am?

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't push.

54
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,840
Don't worry about her.

55
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,540
She can ride in the other car.

56
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,900
Don't push, everyone.

57
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,300
Come on, line up.

58
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,340
In my whole life,

59
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,340
today may be the only day
I want to ride in your car.

60
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,550
May I?

61
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,740
OK, Ma'am.

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,850
No hurry. No hurry.

63
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,380
- Don't snatch.
- There are enough.

64
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,860
There are more.

65
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,180
Let's go, then.

66
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,340
Director,

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,540
we have to go now.

68
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,780
(Bye, Mr. Du.)

69
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,980
(Take care.)

70
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,480
- Take care.
- (Anyone who doesn't have one?)

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,120
(Me.)

72
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,060
Stop there!

73
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,460
Don't run!

74
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,220
Master,

75
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
what's wrong?

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,980
Nothing.

77
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,620
I suddenly remember that

78
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,380
you spent a long time

79
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,420
fixing the car yesterday.

80
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,420
Perhaps...

81
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
Perhaps Young Master
isn't very good at repairing cars.

82
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,220
So he fiddled with it

83
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,940
for a long time.

84
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,500
I see.

85
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,980
By the way,

86
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,420
I feel like you know

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,220
him well.

88
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,900
But a while ago,

89
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,660
you were unfamiliar with each other.

90
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,220
How did he please you?

91
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,780
Master, don't make fun of me.

92
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,700
We're a family now.

93
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,460
And he is your son.

94
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,340
We should get along well

95
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,540
and not let outsiders

96
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,540
laugh at our family, right?

97
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,020
He is my only son.

98
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,580
Of course, we can't let outsiders
laugh at us.

99
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,780
Wanyi,

100
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,340
let's...

101
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,180
Did anything happen on the way?

102
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,340
Nothing.

103
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
It's been a long journey.

104
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,540
Let's go back to our rooms to rest.

105
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,660
OK.

106
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,940
I'll help you back.

107
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,980
(Don't act recklessly. Wait and see.)

108
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,580
I said no one was allowed in.

109
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Sir.

110
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,220
Don't you understand my words?

111
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,020
Sorry, Mr. Liang, I...

112
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,420
Do you sit comfortably

113
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,420
in this seat?

114
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,980
Recently,

115
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,620
you've taken out Zeng Lao'er,

116
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,220
and taken over his territory.

117
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,020
Yuezhou Warehouse got in trouble.

118
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,820
And you haven't found the mole.

119
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,100
If I don't come,

120
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,420
are you going to take your son

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,260
to smuggle opium?

122
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Mr. Liang, I'm sorry.

123
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,860
I brought you a gift.

124
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,980
Take a good look at it.

125
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,420
Something came up about the warehouse.

126
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,140
How could they drop the ball

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,420
at the last minute?

128
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,380
Sorry, it's my fault.

129
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,780
Wanyi,

130
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,940
I can't go to Mr. Liang's

131
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,500
birthday party tonight.

132
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,660
Will you explain to him?

133
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,300
Master, you can do

134
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,980
whatever you want.

135
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,300
Xunyu,

136
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,100
I'm going to the
Xixingshan Warehouse tonight.

137
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,260
I prepared a lavish gift for your uncle.

138
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,540
Give it to him on my behalf.

139
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,380
OK.

140
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,460
Get the car ready.

141
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,380
Yes.

142
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,620
You enjoy yourselves.

143
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,420
I have to go.

144
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,900
Yes, Master.

145
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,940
Bye, Dad.

146
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Xiaocui,

147
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,500
accompany me to get changed.

148
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,220
I have to go out tonight.

149
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,780
Don't act alone.

150
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,140
(Operating Room)

151
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,340
Qin Wanyi's uncle is the chairman
of the Chamber of Commerce.

152
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,820
As important as their relationship is,

153
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,380
Du Jingchuang isn't going to his party

154
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,820
because of an emergency.

155
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,700
Is the Xixingshan Warehouse

156
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,900
where Du Jingchuang is going

157
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,060
the opium warehouse

158
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,340
we've been looking for?

159
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,260
Probably.

160
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,700
Tonight is an opportunity.

161
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,540
I'll try to follow him.

162
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,100
If it's really the opium warehouse,

163
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,620
we'll find a way to

164
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,980
trace the source of the opium.

165
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,180
You must be careful.

166
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,260
By the way,

167
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,900
last time you asked us to inquire about

168
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,140
the whereabouts of Zeng Baoqi.

169
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,460
Based on the clues we've got,

170
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,020
he should be in Tangcheng.

171
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,500
Du Jingchuang is searching for him
throughout the city.

172
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,220
He must have something important.

173
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,380
Du Jingchuang, you scumbag.

174
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,220
You killed my dad
and now you're trying to catch me.

175
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,060
I'm not going anywhere

176
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,740
other than the place under your nose.

177
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,740
Look what you've done to me.

178
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,820

179
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,980
Wait and see.

180
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,500
