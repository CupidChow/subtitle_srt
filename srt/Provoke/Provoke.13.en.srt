You can't jump off the train.

Jiang Ying.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,260
- Let go of me.
- Calm down.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,740
- Let go of me.
- Just hang on a bit longer.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,540
Jiang Ying.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,700
Let me out, I...

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,620
Look at me.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,220
Look at me.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,780
If you don't open the door,

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,500
I'll open it with a key.

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,740
What are you doing?

14
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,620
Get out now!

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,620
Let me check your tickets.

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,220
What are you doing?

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,620
Don't peep inside.

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,940
This is the lavatory.

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,340
If you want to use it,

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,060
go to the next carriage.

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,940
You guys,

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,300
I'm waiting for you at the door.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,100
Come out quickly.

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,380
Let me check your tickets.

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
It's OK now.

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,940
Calm down.

27
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,060
What's wrong?

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,780
Do you feel better?

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,460
I asked if you felt better.

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,420
Do I feel better?

31
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,940
What do you think?

32
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,580
Do you think I'm better?

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,940
I care about you.

34
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,820
Why do you hit me?

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,700
You care about me?

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,820
That's how you care about me?

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,300
I wonder why you were so good to me

38
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,820
and cooked me noodles at night.

39
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,740
It turns out you wanted to drug me,
take me on the train

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,020
and sell me, didn't you?

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,420
I'm not a human trafficker.

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,700
Why would I sell you?

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,140
Who knows whether you're
a human trafficker or not?

44
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,220
Even the identity of Du Xunyu is fake.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
What if you are...

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,300
You...

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,900
I... I'm what?

48
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,940
Anyway, I won't believe in you anymore.

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,060
Well,

50
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,620
it's getting late.

51
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,660
We can't walk back, can we?

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,580
Shut up.

53
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
Don't talk.

54
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,460
No,

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,940
you can't walk back in heels.

56
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,180
You really can't.

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,540
Let me carry you on my back.

58
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,340
Or we can get changed first.

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,380
Stop talking, will you?

60
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,540
Master, are you tired?

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,860
It's OK. I can handle it.

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
Didn't you bring anyone home this time?

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,460
Do you want me to bring someone?

64
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,420
No, I don't.

65
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,660
Where is Ying?

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,380
How could I know?

67
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,620
I haven't seen her.

68
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,900
You haven't seen her?

69
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,540
How did you take care of her?

70
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,820
Send someone to look for her right now.

71
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,860
Alright, alright. It's my negligence.

72
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,660
Let's eat first, then I'll look for her.

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,940
Come.

74
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,580
Master,

75
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,460
I asked Xiaocui

76
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,780
to cook the soup for you.

77
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,020
Try it.

78
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,380
It smells good.

79
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,780
What's this soup?

80
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,740
Yam ribs soup, Master.

81
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,140
It tastes good.

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,940
Where's Xunyu? Get him some soup.

83
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,300
Your precious son

84
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,620
has so many thoughts.

85
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,220
How could I know where he is?

86
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,460
Little brat.

87
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,140
What soup smells so good?

88
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,820
Speaking of the devil.

89
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,740
Dad.

90
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,060
You're back.

91
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,260
Why didn't you tell me?
I could've picked you up.

92
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,060
I just arrived.

93
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,380
Where did you go?

94
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,860
I...

95
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,940
Today,

96
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,260
I made arrangements for Wu's funeral.

97
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,020
Wu?

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,660
What happened to him?

99
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,420
Wu must

100
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,740
have been senile.

101
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,260
He ran out that day
into a thunderstorm for no reason.

102
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,700
I wonder what sins he committed

103
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,020
that got him killed by lightning.

104
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,460
Killed by lightning?

105
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,780
Yes.

106
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,580
(Record of Shanghai Pathe Company)

107
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,900
Who?

108
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,820
Master, it's me.

109
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Master,

110
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,780
may I come in?

111
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,980
Sorry to disappoint you at our wedding.

112
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,060
I really had an emergency that day.

113
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,020
(This should be his secret room.)

114
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,020
(The thing should be in here.)

115
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Master.

116
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,500
It's been a while.

117
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,940
Yes, it has.

118
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,620
I didn't see you when I came back.

119
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Where were you?

120
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,300
You were away from home.

121
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,620
I was bored,

122
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,500
so I went to watch a movie myself.

123
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,860
When I heard you were back,

124
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,700
I hurried back to see you.

125
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,340
I have some business to deal with.

126
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,940
I'll see you

127
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,100
in your room later.

128
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,340
Come with me.

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,660
What are you doing?

130
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,620
What are you doing?

131
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,620
I want to ask the same question.

132
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
Why did you let Du Jingchuang
go to your room?

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,500
I didn't let him.

134
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,260
He asked to go to my room.

135
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,700
Why didn't you turn him down?

136
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,340
I'm his concubine.

137
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,100
What reason do I have to do that?

138
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
You're smart.

139
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,340
You can always figure out an excuse.

140
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,420
It's none of your business.

141
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,060
Wait, I haven't finished.

142
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,100
Actually, I'm your...

143
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,220
What?

144
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,820
I'm your...
