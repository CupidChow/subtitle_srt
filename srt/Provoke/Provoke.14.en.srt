=Episode 14 On the High Wire=

3
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,020
Come in.

4
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,300
Ying.

5
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,100
Haven't you slept?

6
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,060
Master.

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,700
You said you would come.

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,820
Of course I'd wait for you.

9
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,820
How are you doing?

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,580
Are you used to living here?

11
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,340
As time goes by,

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,500
I'll eventually get used to it.

13
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,340
Ying,

14
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,980
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,100
I've been busy these days.

16
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,500
I should've given you a decent wedding.

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,980
You must feel wronged.

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,380
How could I?

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,420
Master.

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,020
Actually,

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,460
I came...

22
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,180
She is bold enough
to walk on a high wire.

23
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,100
Ying.

24
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,940
What's wrong, Master?

25
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,700
Actually, I want to say,

26
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm not young anymore.

27
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,100
So...

28
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,980
Master. Master.

29
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,580
Master, it's urgent!

30
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,620
What's wrong?

31
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,020
Ma'am is vomiting
and having loose bowels.

32
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,020
I don't know what's wrong.

33
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,900
Ma'am hasn't felt well since dinner.

34
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,260
I'll go have a look.

35
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,100
What happened?

36
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,220
I don't know.

37
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,860
Ma'am hasn't felt well since dinner.

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,900
She's been vomiting for two hours.

39
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,660
If it goes on, I'm afraid...

40
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,780
OK.

41
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,060
I get it. Wait for a minute.

42
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,180
Ying,

43
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,580
Wanyi doesn't feel well.

44
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,140
I'll go check on her.

45
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,100
Send my regards to her.

46
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,980
Master, see you.

47
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,460
Mistress Jiang,

48
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,980
you left your pen during the day.

49
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,420
Come in.

50
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,860
You haven't started yet, right?

51
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,860
Did he touch you?

52
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,220
Do you think

53
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,820
I would set a sex-trap to kill him?

54
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,620
Even if you really killed him,

55
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,980
you wouldn't be able to escape alive.

56
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,780
My goal is not to kill him.

57
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,260
I don't have to take the risk.

58
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,140
You know it's risky?

59
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,580
Do you know what would happen

60
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,420
if I didn't drug Qin Wanyi?

61
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,380
Drug?

62
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,980
Did you suspect that

63
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,660
I poisoned the food last time?

64
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,940
Only you will do such kind of thing.

65
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,860
I used laxative instead of deadly drug.

66
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,140
If you used deadly drug,

67
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,540
I would praise you for being tough.

68
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,980
Why did you use purgative?

69
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,700
Filthy.

70
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,420
I only used a low dose of...

71
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,860
No.

72
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,740
Is it a good time

73
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,540
to discuss what drug I used?

74
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,940
Next time when you make a plan,

75
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,660
could you discuss it with me in advance?

76
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,420
When you knocked me out
and took me on the train,

77
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,420
did you discuss it with me?

78
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,940
Where did you get the key?

79
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,140
Ying.

80
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,540
What's wrong, Master?

81
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
I want to say...

82
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,820
When did you learn such tricks?

83
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,460
I was homeless for a while in childhood.

84
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,940
So I must learn to

85
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,420
do things stealthily

86
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,580
in order to survive.

87
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,420
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,620
I shouldn't have touched your sore spot.

89
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,580
I don't need your sympathy.

90
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,020
I'll believe you one more time.

91
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,420
Find a way to put the key back.

92
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,260
OK.

93
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,020
Well...

94
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,820
What? Do you have more questions?

95
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,140
Du Jingchuang won't always

96
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,500
have to leave

97
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,780
under such situation.

98
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,340
How will you deal with him again?

99
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,060
Are you really willing to...

100
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,020
Willing to what?

101
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,140
Well...

102
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,900
Use my body to

103
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,620
serve my goal?

104
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,100
Do you know why Du Jingchuang

105
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,940
cherishes you, his only son, so dearly?

106
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,740
Even if

107
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,580
you didn't drug Qin Wanyi today,

108
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,540
he would still

109
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,940
find an excuse.

110
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,620
You mean...

111
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,500
He...

112
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,980
Great.

113
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,580
What if he becomes capable again?

114
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
I don't want to discuss

115
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,700
such a vulgar thing with you.

116
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,780
Alright. Alright.

117
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,260
You don't know men.

118
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,020
Sometimes, they just...

119
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,860
Leave.

120
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,980
So I've been worried for nothing.

121
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,100
It doesn't look good if he kisses you.

122
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,220
Get out!

123
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,780
(Yongsheng Industrial Company)

124
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,260
When the warehouses in Yuezhou
were in trouble,

125
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,300
Liang Wujing let me explain to him.

126
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,060
But why must I report to him

127
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,500
about the business in Tangcheng?

128
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,660
Tangcheng is my territory.

129
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,500
If Mr. Liang is right

130
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,140
and we have a mole here,

131
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,660
could it be Zeng Baoqi?

132
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,540
Where is he?

133
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,820
We're still looking for him.

134
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,500
Think if we neglected anything

135
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,660
on the train that day.

136
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,420
There's something

137
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,180
I don't know if I should say.

138
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,540
That day, in the lavatory,

139
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,940
a man was fooling around with a woman.

140
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,300
The man looked like
Young Master from behind.

141
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,420
The woman looked like...

142
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,020
Who?

143
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,900
Like

144
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,020
Mistress Jiang.

145
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,860
But I didn't see it clearly.

146
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,620
Maybe it was just a couple...

147
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,660
Don't talk such groundless

148
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,260
nonsense in front of me again!

149
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,980
Yes.

150
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,740
Dad.

151
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,940
Be careful.

152
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
Let me help you to sit down.

153
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:08,970
Here.

154
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,460
Dad, you look

155
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,780
exhausted recently.

156
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,500
Is there

157
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,820
anything I can help with?

158
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,700
Since Mistress Jiang moved in,

159
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,860
Wanyi has been disgruntled.

160
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,260
It gives me a headache.

161
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,580
Help me to think about

162
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,860
how to improve their relationship.

163
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,460
By the way,

164
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,500
there will be a reception
in the company tomorrow.

165
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,060
I want to take both of them.

166
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,300
What do you think?

167
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,220
If Dad thinks it's OK.

168
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,300
(Du)

169
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,540
Ma'am.

170
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,300
You disgusting little slut!

171
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,300
How dare you stare at me?

172
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,860
Why don't you make it clear?

173
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,820
How dare you poison my soup?

174
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,220
Just because Master favors you,

175
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,500
it doesn't mean you can do anything.

176
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,500
Do you really think

177
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,060
you can take my place at the reception?

178
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,060
What's that attitude?

179
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,140
Speak!

180
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,540
I bear you no ill will.

181
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,700
And I have no intention to steal Master.

182
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,380
But I understand how you feel.

183
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,420
I won't mind

184
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,940
that slap.

185
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,860
You...

186
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,620
Are you pitying me?

187
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,660
(Du)

188
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,700
Are you carving Master's name
to please him?

189
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,900
Why are you leaving?

190
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,540
Stop there!

191
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,180
You slut!

192
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,180
(Du)

193
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm in trouble.

194
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,860
Mistress Jiang,

195
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,340
I'll let it pass if you didn't drug me.

196
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,100
Go.

197
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,580
How is your hand?

198
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,970
It bled so much.

199
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,060
It's OK.

200
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,540
But it bled a lot.

201
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,420
I just scared her with red ink,

202
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,740
or she could be difficult to deal with.

203
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,300
Alright, then.

204
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Wait.

205
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,780
Were you

206
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,820
worrying about me just now?

207
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,100
No.

208
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,700
Really?

209
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,060
Mr. Du,

210
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,140
don't be mad.

211
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,220
We have searched

212
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,580
the station and the dock thoroughly.

213
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,580
Zeng Baoqi

214
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,020
can't get out of Tangcheng.

215
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,460
We'll

216
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,260
find another way.

217
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,140
There are so many people
coming and going

218
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,180
every day at the station and the dock.

219
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,660
Aren't there any suspicious people

220
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,300
or people who shouldn't be there?

221
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,420
Mr. Du,

222
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,940
if you say so,

223
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,500
I don't know

224
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,140
if they are suspicious.

225
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,620
Who?

226
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,260
Mr. Du Xunyu and a woman.

227
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,340
Xunyu and a woman?

228
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,460
Yes.

229
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,500
What woman?

230
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,020
A woman in a coma,

231
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,500
slender

232
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,620
and young.

233
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,260
I didn't see her looks clearly.

234
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,100
They were at the train station,

235
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,660
on the day of your return.

236
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,300
(Half a month ago)

237
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
You little...

238
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,900
Xiaocui,

239
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,620
did I hurt you?

240
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,580
Ma'am,

241
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,140
you haven't hit anyone before.

242
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,260
You should take it seriously
on practicing.

243
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,540
What if Mistress Jiang bullies you

244
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,220
after she moves in?

245
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,060
Don't worry. Slap me.

246
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,860
I can handle it.

247
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,300
It's your face, after all.

248
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,220
I don't have the heart to do it.

249
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,940
What about this,

250
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,460
bring that hatstand over.

251
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,300
I'll practice on that.

252
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,020
You disgusting little slut.

253
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,060
Ma'am,

254
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,620
be louder if you want
yourself to sound overwhelming.

255
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,460
You disgusting little slut.

256
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,340
Louder.

257
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,540
- Louder.
- Is it OK?

258
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,380
