1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,300

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,610

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,230

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,150

6
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,850

7
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,030
 Yool.

8
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,580

9
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,230
Seo Yool!

10
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,130
  I think Seo Yool witnessed the crime.

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,690
 If, by chance, the criminal approaches Yool...

12
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,490
Seo Yool!

13
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,310
Seo Yool!

14
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,810
 Sweetie. Sweetie, where are you?

15
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,020
 Come here. Come over here.

16
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,670
 Where are you, Sweetie? Sweetie!

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,040
 Are you here?

18
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,750
 Here?

19
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,810
 Oh, you were over there!

20
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,170
Were you looking for this?

21
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,850
Please, give it back!

22
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,890
Give it to me!

23
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,030
I was passing by earlier and I saw you come out from there.

24
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,670
 You're Yool, right?

25
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,190
 Yes.

26
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,730

27
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,930
 - I heard you saw something. 
 - Saw what?

28
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,360
 I heard you brought in the dead lady's slipper.

29
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,540
 I heard you might have witnessed something.

30
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,700
 Did you really see something? Like the suspect's face?

31
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,400
 No.

32
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,020
 I just picked up the slipper. I don't even know whose it was.

33
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,730
 If you really saw something, then you have to be honest with me.

34
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,460
 You could be in danger, too, if they can't catch the criminal.

35
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,520
 If you're scared to tell me alone, do you want to tell me with your dad?

36
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,930

37
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,980

38
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,420
I looked to see if there was anything fun,

39
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,360
and there were a lot of fun things inside!

40
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,690
Why is that fun?

41
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,480
What?

42
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,170
Give it to me! It's my mom's!

43
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,060
If I don't give it to you, don't tell your dad

44
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,900
and don't tell the police, that's what I'm saying is fun!

45
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,100
Then, what are you going to do?

46
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,670
Watch it! I'm an adult!

47
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,980
What would you do with it then?

48
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,070
Damn it. Did you throw that at me, ma'am?

49
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,740
Not ma'am, the President of the Women's Association!

50
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,960
Bastard!

51
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,980
Damn it! Come here!

52
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,670
Come here!

53
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,410
What's wrong? What did you talk about with that man?

54
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,000
You better not say anything!

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Come here!

56
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,020
- Get over here! 
   - Hey, isn't that my car?

57
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,230
He did it! He did!

58
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,730
- Wait, no. This woman—  
 - Hey!!

59
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,830
You stay right there and don't move a muscle!

60
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,990
Damn it!

61
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,280
Neighbors!

62
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,490
It's over there, right?

63
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,450
I told you!

64
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,160
It makes no sense that a criminal like him still lives here!

65
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,530
He was even harassing a little child! How can we not feel scared?!

66
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,150
When did I ever...?

67
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,050
He shoved her with his hand! If I hadn't seen them in time...

68
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,180
Seo Yool!

69
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,410
So, if a criminal lives here,

70
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,880
you shouldn't have her running around at night! Look at her state!

71
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,710
Did you touch my child?

72
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,460
No... No!

73
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,180
 What's wrong with that guy?

74
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,360
Something bad could happen.

75
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,820
Are you okay?

76
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,930
Where are your shoes? Are you hurt?

77
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,600
What happened?

78
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,810
Yool, what did that guy do to you?

79
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,420
I don't know. When I saw them, she was fighting back at him

80
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,860
and he was hitting her on the head.

81
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,650
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

82
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,660
Seriously...

83
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,890
 What's going on here?

84
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,610
 - Here.  
 - It's okay.

85
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,050
I have something to ask Yool.

86
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,850
Thank you for helping me find her.

87
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,380
I'll try asking Yool.

88
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,450
Okay, go on in then.

89
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,820
 I can't believe it.

90
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,590
This is why you can't just let anyone live in this neighborhood!

91
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,700
I can't believe we let a criminal live here. Am I wrong?

92
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,140

93
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,230
So? You let 5,000 Won go like that?

94
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,490
I'm not surprised. I had a bad feeling.

95
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,610
Detective Choi is more educated than I am, and he gets results,

96
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,460
so I figured he would carry out the investigation properly.

97
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,800
I figured I was wrong. I told myself he must not be the culprit this time,

98
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,720
but we let him walk too easily.

99
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,840
All things considered, it looks like he's the criminal.

100
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,950
- No. 
 - What?

101
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,640
Why? You don't like red beans? Want the veggie one?

102
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,950
No. I don't think 5,000 Won is the criminal.

103
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,220
Right?

104
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,010
I got the same feeling.

105
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,950
Do you sense something strange?

106
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,770
I mean, if Yool was the witness,

107
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,920
when 5,000 Won was arrested or when he was admitted to the hospital, wouldn't she have said something?

108
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,450
Then he would have had no way out.

109
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,450
She could be too scared to speak up.

110
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,170
What if he threatened her thinking Yool's the witness?

111
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,280
- Yool was barefoot. 
 - What?

112
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,090
- Barefoot? 
 - Yeah.

113
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,470
As if she ran away from somewhere in a hurry.

114
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,200
If 5,000 Won kidnapped her and she ran away,

115
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,230
he wouldn't have let people see them together like that.

116
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,150
Right?

117
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,690
So she was barefoot...

118
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,420
Let me look into it then.

119
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,090
What is this?

120
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,470
Hey! What are you doing? Huh?

121
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,520
I mean, are you doing this after listening to that woman?

122
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,150
I acted that way only because the kid was so rude when I was walking by!

123
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,230
Don't open that!

124
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,430
Why? Stop it!

125
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,910
Does this neighborhood not even have basic rights or privacy?

126
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,830
Yeah, sure! Keep digging! Just dig it all up!

127
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,580
What?

128
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,800
What do you want from me?

129
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,210
What did you do with the kid's shoes?

130
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,400
Why are you looking for the kid's shoes here? Did I steal them?

131
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,110
O-Or did that kid say I stole her shoes?

132
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,610
How dare you come into someone's house without a warrant?

133
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,430
I became a police officer so I could live a stable life.

134
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,470
So what? What do you want me to do about that?

135
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,760
The apostles of justice don't hold democratic canes.

136
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,280
I know that. Thanks to you, I ran away back then.

137
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,610
  Please save me.

138
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,640
  Me…

139
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,820
  Save… me…

140
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:45,130
  Please save me.

141
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,210
  Save me.

142
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,940
That's right, I hoped you would run away.

143
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,020
You didn't do that because you wanted me to die?

144
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,590
"Run away to somewhere else and die."

145
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,260
"Like nothing ever happened in this neighborhood, it's fine as long as it's not here."

146
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,320
That's what I thought.

147
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,430
That's why, even when Dae Seong brought you in,

148
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,650
I had hoped you weren't the criminal.

149
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,380
I hoped that you two wouldn't die because of me.

150
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,870
I'm telling you that it's really not me!

151
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,580
You better hope it's not you.

152
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,840
I don't know about everything else, but I'm going to keep a close eye on you.

153
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,550
And if you do end up being the criminal,

154
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,080
the time that I let you escape,

155
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,010
I'll take responsibility for it, no matter what.

156
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,840
Responsibility? How?

157
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,680
I mean, there won't be any reason for you to take responsibility.

158
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,140
It's not me.

159
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,470
Then, don't cause any problems in the future,

160
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,630
And live quietly.

161
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,270
Yes, Senior.

162
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,210
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

163
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,440
There's definitely something else besides the missing shoes. There is,

164
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,310
but I don't know what it is.

165
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,190
Isn't it timing?

166
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,380
If you think about it, the first time you thought Yool might be the witness was

167
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,320
- earlier when you and Senior were talking in the mart. Right? 
 - That's right.

168
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,770
But it just so happens that Yool disappeared today.

169
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,230
That's right.

170
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,860
It's not like the murder cases just occurred,

171
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,750
so why did the criminal take Yool today of all days?

172
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,150
The criminal found out that you and Senior found out that Yool was a witness,

173
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,610
so he figured he would be in danger if you guys asked Yool questions.

174
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,900
Then, it makes sense for the criminal to take Yool today.

175
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,020
To either threaten or harass Yool.

176
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,950
Then, 5000 Won didn't come to the mart today, so he wouldn't have known.

177
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:15,860
Fish is... not the criminal. And the other employees were all working at the mart.

178
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,750
We're back where we started.

179
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,310
What if the criminal has an accomplice?

180
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,810
Then, things get complicated.

181
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,480

Oh, it's Geumseong.

182
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,820

183
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,200
One second.

184
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,050
Is Yool all right?

185
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,140
  Yes, she fell asleep.

186
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,180
  Besides being a little startled, I think she's okay.

187
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,880
  Have you tried talking to her?

188
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,210
Well... she says she's not.

189
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,160
But why do you and Dae Seong think Yool is a witness?

190
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,690
  Yool says she never said she was.

191
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,820
Well, that's... I'm glad if she says she's not.

192
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,120
- For the time being, try to keep a close eye on her. 
  - Shoes, shoes! (looks like he's saying sh**)

193
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,490
Why are you cursing at your mom?

194
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,940
This is Dae Seong.

195
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,360
Yes, hello.

196
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,010
Earlier, Yool didn't have her shoes. Why is that?

197
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,600
Oh, that's...

198
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,670
  I asked her, and she said she went to play at another neighborhood and the big kids picked on her.

199
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,100
  I think they took her shoes for fun.

200
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,690
Anyway, I'm sorry for making you all worry.

201
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,490
Get some rest.

202
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,920
Shoe... Shoe...

203
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,650
No!

204
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,810
Unnie, don't!

205
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,480
It's okay, it's okay.

206
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,990
Did you have a dream?

207
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,580
What do you mean, "Don't?"

208
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,400
Who is this unnie?

209
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,970
It's okay. You can tell me the truth.

210
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,310
Did you really see something?

211
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,760
Is someone bothering you because of that?

212
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,100
I just had a dream.

213
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,930
In my dream, Unnie was in it.

214
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,060
Then a monster came out.

215
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,810
I see.

216
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,300
What about Mom? When is she coming?

217
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,710
If you do as I ask and be good, she'll be back soon.

218
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,670
Go to sleep.

219
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,300
Yool, don't go to the mart alone so often.

220
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,400
Don't be alone with the uncle at the mart and don't receive gifts so easily

221
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,130
Why?

222
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,070
You have to always be careful when adult males are acting kind.

223
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,070
If that uncle asks you something again

224
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,580
or tries to look at places on your body that are hidden under your clothes, then be sure to tell me.

225
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,190
Okay.

226
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,900
Do you think we can really trust Yool's words?

227
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,740
Yool speaks well

228
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,160
and has a lot of curiosity.

229
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,430
But she doesn't reveal what she really thinks on the inside.

230
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,890
Really?

231
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,020
She even comes to buy alcohol for her dad. She catches on quickly.

232
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,550
But all this time, wasn't Yool a bit too okay?

233
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,060
The first time I saw a dead body, it wasn't even a murder, but a natural death, and I was still shaken for a while.

234
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,950
And even more, I'm a police officer.

235
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,660
But if a kid sees someone get killed or something scary,

236
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,180
it would be normal for a dad or even anybody to realize.

237
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,940
What are you thinking about?

238
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,690
Nothing.

239
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,210
Then let's try trusting Yool's words.

240
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,500
But you're still going to see if anything else happens, right?

241
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,350
Yes, I have to.

242
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,510
It's hard, right?

243
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,130
Do you want to quit?

244
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,140
It would've been nice if 5,000 Won was the criminal.

245
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,450
Because you want to confirm that 5,000 Won is

246
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,360
bad enough to kill someone?

247
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,020
No.

248
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,390
It's too hard for you to keep suspecting the mart's employees, isn't it?

249
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,930
How do I face Fish again?

250
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,770
What? Why?

251
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,790
Huh? What? Why?

252
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,490
If you have something to say, just quickly say it and leave.

253
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,310
Something to say? Me? I don't.

254
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,010

255
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,090
I'm sorry.

256
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,230
You apologized yesterday.

257
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,670
Secretly entering your house, suspecting you were the criminal,

258
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,920
looking at you with prejudice,

259
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,910
I'm sorry for all of it.

260
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,580
I get it, so stop already.

261
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,360
Also, everything you just touched, you better buy it all.

262
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,840
Okay.

263
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,870
I can grill them tomorrow.

264
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,400
We didn't even have a welcoming party for you. We can have a small party with you, me,

265
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,350
Butchery, my girlfriend, and we can grill some meat on the rooftop.

266
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,550
Sure, whatever.

267
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,360

Wait! Why is it so expensive?

268
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,500
In America, when someone moves into a neighborhood,

269
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,450
I heard they go through their occupation, family relationships, even finances,

270
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,400
and get all those documents

271
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,510
and judge them through interviews!

272
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,030
America sure sounds great!

273
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,990
President, how do you know all those things?

274
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,590
My daughter is in San Francisco.

275
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,110
Of course.

276
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:09,130
Korea is doing so much redevelopment that everyone is just blinded by the thought of making money.

277
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,480
So much so that even though a criminal is running around, people pretend not to see it, and the state of the neighborhood...

278
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,120
That's right. I was scared yesterday.

279
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,610
That's why we should open an emergency neighborhood meeting

280
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,140
and kick out that 5,000 Won or 500 Won whatever out of here!

281
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,760
No, but I heard he isn't a killer.

282
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,040
The thought of having a killer in our neighborhood gives me more chills.

283
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,960
- Did you hear? 
 - What?

284
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,190
The criminal killed someone and left them at the mart.

285
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,960
I heard that, too! That man's son!

286
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,450
It's true, I'm telling you.

287
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,330
Oh, my hand slipped.

288
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,600
It's all wet!

289
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,150
It seems so. You should hurry and go home to change.

290
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,180
You're not even going to say you're sorry?

291
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,390
I'm not sorry at all.

292
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,520
What?

293
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,030
What did you say about my son?

294
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,810
I was just telling them the neighborhood rumors!

295
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,230
Dae Seong's father, calm down. If you do this, the rumors will get worse.

296
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,670
I'm not selling to you! Also, don't ever come back here again. Okay?

297
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,600
Don't even come to our mart!

298
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,180
Does he think there's no other mart around here? Why is he like that?

299
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,520
I'll never come back!

300
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,660
President, you don't also believe in those rumors. Right?

301
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,900
I haven't even heard those rumors.

302
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,490
Who would say bad things about Dae Seong in front of me?

303
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,880
Everyone knows about our relationship.

304
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,700
Our relationship?

305
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,640
Oh, I completely forgot. I was going to check on Yool.

306
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,780
Can you pack some tangerines and things the kid can eat?

307
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,180
What does she like?

308
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,310
What are you doing?

309
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,040
Can't you see?

310
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,470
Do it properly.

311
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,620
Even though we've gotten to know each other a bit, it's not like we're close enough to squeeze each other's sides.

312
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,550
Read the room.

313
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,190
I have to tell you something, so come here.

314
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,360
Why? What is it?

315
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,210
- Butchery... 
 - Yeah?

316
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,300
- Is Butchery one of your suspects? 
 - What?

317
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,370
You're looking for the criminal.

318
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,210
You confirmed it wasn't me.

319
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,040
Didn't you think the criminal was inside the mart?

320
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:57,080
Do you think Butchery should continue to take Vegetables home?

321
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,870
Do you... know something?

322
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,600
  You should ask your husband to pick you up.

323
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,640
 What?

324
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,730
  He is working overtime these days.

325
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,680
  He's busy.

326
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,650
 Where was it?

327
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,850
Oh, I worried for nothing.

328
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,320
I already know Butchery likes Vegetables.

329
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,860
I know he shouldn't, but a person's heart—

330
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,030
Stockings, tampons, those kinds of things, did Jeong Yook buy them or not?

331
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,020
He did. He bought them, but—

332
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,440
Out of the mart's employees or customers that bought those items,

333
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,590
didn't you suspect me the most?

334
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,690
The only remaining male mart employee is Jeong Yook.

335
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,300
Before we confirm it isn't him, I think Vegetables is at risk.

336
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,470
You're going to slice your own hand at that rate.

337
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,520
When you walked Vegetables home yesterday, did anything happen?

338
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,170
Nothing happened.

339
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,450
Why the long face?

340
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,700
Do you want something to happen?

341
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,420
What are you saying?

342
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,020
Are you going to continue walking her home?

343
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,380
If a man has taken out his knife, he should slice some fat at least.

344
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,050
Do you want me to come with you?

345
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,930
Why?

346
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,370
What?

347
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,350
What if the criminal is really after Noona, will you be able to protect her alone?

348
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,580
- Would I not be able to protect her? 
 - Two is better.

349
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,210
It is. Two of us, Noona and me.

350
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,320
You need to come to your senses.

351
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,580
Don't say nonsense and leave. Do I also need to protect you?

352
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,740
I'm counting on you.

353
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,970
Even if you keep doing this, there's nothing I can do for you.

354
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:45,580
Yool! Our Yool, do you want to eat this?

355
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,550
It's organic. Drink up!

356
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,560
You're drinking it so well!

357
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,790
- Give this to Yool. 
 - Huh?

358
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,360
It's because I feel bad.

359
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,330
She's not eating properly because her mom's not around.

360
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,760
When I fed her last time, she shoved meat in her mouth like she had starved for three days.

361
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,700
President!

362
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,500
My kid likes meat a lot.

363
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,790
I'm feeding her well on my own, so you don't have to worry.

364
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,780
Where's the mom's hospital?

365
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,350
A woman needs a woman. I'll go and ask her if she needs anything and—

366
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,670
Oh, you're trying so hard.

367
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:39,930
- What? 
 - That you've gone crazy trying to buy the apartments where the murder victims lived at a lower rate,

368
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,840
the rumors are already going around.

369
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,290
If your son lives in those places when he marries, I'm so sure you'd be happy.

370
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,090
Of course, I would! He'll be close and we'll see each other often.

371
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,320
Is the fact that your daughter went to America something to brag about?

372
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,010
She left her old mother and hasn't visited for years!

373
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,070
Showing off your English pronunciation skills all the time here.

374
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,470
What's the point of that?

375
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,160
You haven't even gone to visit her in America once, so it seems like she's not very welcoming.

376
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,440
This woman really!

377
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,810
Let go! Let go!

378
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:17,970
You want to fight? You want to go?

379
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,230
You want to fight?

380
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,610
How are you just sitting there? You're not going to stop her?

381
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,560
How could you be like that?

382
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,510
Since you're so indifferent to other people's situations, that's why you don't even know the electricity is running at that empty unit.

383
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,790
I even told you and you didn't look into it, did you?

384
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:41,170
If homeowners' feelings are hurt, then it won't be long until you start losing customers.

385
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,780
Dad, I'm hungry.

386
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,640
Yool, you're hungry?

387
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,590
Then, should I buy you tonkatsu since I haven't in a while?

388
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,650
Yes, I want to eat some.

389
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,160
Let's go.

390
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,340
Should we go together?

391
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,360
- No, please take these and leave. 
 - You should keep mine.

392
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,800
- You accepted it earlier. 
 - Why are you being like this?

393
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,010
We should go eat tonkatsu together.

394
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,480
You're no help, woman.

395
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,070
Why didn't you buy these during the employee sale?

396
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,230
I have somewhere to use them.

397
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,720
Noona, are you leaving now?

398
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,670
Yes, why?

399
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,050
If you have something to do, I can just go alone.

400
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,300
No, no. Let's go. I was about to leave, too.

401
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,750
How much is it?

402
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,300
1,000 won.

403
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,730
That kid, Butchery, all day he's been

404
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,800
only focused on Vegetables today.

405
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,110
What if something happens?

406
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,580
No way!

407
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,200
Mom, why are you saying something so scary?

408
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,760
What? I was just saying. What if they get close?

409
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,790
That in itself is scary.

410
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,950
Maybe I should have taken her home.

411
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,480
Noona, let's go together.

412
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,970
Noona, what's wrong?

413
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,880
Huh?

414
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,500
I feel like someone is watching me.

415
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,200
I don't think anyone is there.

416
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,070
Do you want me to take you up to your door on the third floor?

417
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,280
No, it's okay.

418
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,970
It's fine.

419
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,540
But how did you know I lived on the third floor?

420
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,020
What?

421
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,500
What?

422
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,560
Noona, I have something to tell you.

423
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,650
What?

424
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,210
Hey, what is it you have to say? Let go of me and talk.

425
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,940
Don't do it.

426
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,870
Is he actually crazy?

427
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,650
You can tell me. I know everything.

428
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,680
Why are you being so scary? Let go of me.

429
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,870
From now on, you don't have to walk me home anymore.

430
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,590
Noona.

431
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,610
It must be because he likes her, right?

432
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,540
Please help me!

433
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,770
Please!

434
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,060

435
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,940
Are you sure it's not Butchery?

436
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,710
Sure? Well, no.

437
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,230
No, I'm not sure.

438
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,090
But I definitely saw him leave.

439
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,580
I doubt he would have come back.

440
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,990
  This is the police!

441
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,660
  Unnie, it's me.

442
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,270
  Unnie, are you in there?

443
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,050
  Unnie!

444
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,440
Unnie, it's okay.

445
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,940
Take your time and tell me.

446
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,020
 Someone pressed the password and came in.

447
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,300
Then you probably didn't see their face.

448
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,830
Didn't see it at all.

449
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,430
Did you hear their voice?

450
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,610
Did you contact your husband?

451
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,840
Why?

452
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,170
He went to the Philippines for work.

453
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,370
But you should contact him if it's this bad!

454
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,410
Officer Do.

455
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,810

456
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,740
Answer. Please answer.

457
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,820

458
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,880
Why is it so cold?

459
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:08,350
♫   Orange dream, do you remember?   ♫

460
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:14,100
♫   Those youthful days   ♫

461
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,590
♫   The times when everything seemed possible   ♫

462
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:26,870
♫   We were so passionate, our pounding hearts   ♫

463
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,610
♫   Orange dream, are you still here?   ♫

464
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,740
♫   Our blazing dreams   ♫

465
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,390
Car! Be careful.

466
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,540
♫   The time that we thought would last forever   ♫

467
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,420
What? Why are you glowing?

468
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,560
Did you put something on?

469
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,780
What do you mean?

470
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,960
♫   In that place, my dreams remain   ♫

471
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,580
Hold these there.

472
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,120
So warm.

473
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,830
♫   It seems we've come so far   ♫

474
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,710
♫   In that place, my dreams remain in an orange light   ♫

475
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,080
It's good.

476
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,580
Give me a bigger piece.

477
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,040
I have to hurry and go back in.

478
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,970
What about the fingerprint you found at Vegetables' place?

479
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,780
When do the results come out?

480
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,290
♫  Still, my heart  ♫

481
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,940
Tomorrow? Since it's not that big of a case.

482
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,180
You know about tonight, right? At the rooftop with Butchery and Fish.

483
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,670
I know.

484
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,290
Take these and share them.

485
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,670
Thank you.

486
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,700
Ah Hee.

487
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,340
Don't get hurt.

488
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,000
Don't you get hurt either, and don't cause any problems without me knowing.

489
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,630
♫   Let's remember the bright smiles we had   ♫

490
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,100
Be careful of cars!

491
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,500
I can't do this.

492
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,310
What?

493
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:02,160
Then, do you want to rest today? Or...

494
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,060
do you want to rest for a couple of days?

495
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,790
I don't know.

496
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,530
You can't keep this section empty. You should look for a new worker.

497
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,690
Noona, can we talk for a minute?

498
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,860
I don't know what it's about, but you should call her later and talk then.

499
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,540
She's got a lot of things going on.

500
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,870
I'll quit.

501
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,730
Noona.

502
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,220
I'm going to go away for a while.

503
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,590
What if the murderer is really after me?

504
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,860
I'm so scared.

505
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,550
Okay.

506
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,250
Do that.

507
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,830
Oh, oops!

508
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,980
Were you not working properly these days? Why are your legs so weak?

509
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,820
Go back to work. Take care of the vegetable section for the time being.

510
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,730
Hey, why is everyone acting strange with me?

511
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,490
You didn't pay yet.

512
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,370
- Here. 
 - Never mind!

513
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,600
It's hard-earned money, though.

514
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,970
What's going on? Why didn't you answer my call?

515
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,390
I was drawing.

516
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,750
At home?

517
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,300
Would I have been out drawing landscape that late?

518
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,160
- What are you doing after work? 
 - Why?

519
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,530
We're having a barbecue on the rooftop as a welcoming party for Fish.

520
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,930
I'm not close to Fish. You're not either.

521
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,920
So let's become close!

522
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,030
Don't leave after work. Come up to the rooftop right away.

523
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,250
Bring some ribeye. It's on me.

524
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,550
Hey, but... have you not seen my sketchbook?

525
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,330
Sketchbook?

526
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,570
 - What are you doing? 
 - Me?

527
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,260
 Butchery asked me to grab something for him.

528
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,370

529
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,910
I didn't.

530
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,660
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

531
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,510
Why is the meter going?

532
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,910

533
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,350
Huh?

534
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,950
What's on that the meter's going?

535
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,820
This is crazy.

536
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,980
What if a homeless person comes and lives here?

537
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,860
What's happening to our neighborhood?

538
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,010
Is someone coming in?

539
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,590
Looks like it was cleaned before moving in.

540
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,050
Why is the fridge so big?

541
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,820
- Mom. 
 - What?

542
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,000
Can I leave early?

543
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,140
Why?

544
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,160
Fish... I feel bad.

545
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,950
When I thought about it, everyone's been working here a long time and I don't know anything about him.

546
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,120
We're having a barbecue together. Ah Hee, too.

547
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,520
Drinks are on me, then.

548
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,080
Hey.

549
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,300
 Mom is giving us drinks.

550
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,650
Hey.

551
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,290
What's wrong with him?

552
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,120
My goodness, Yool is here!

553
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,880
Are you looking for something?

554
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,810
The slipper? It's not there anymore.

555
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,420
The police took it.

556
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,230
Oh, I see.

557
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,980
But... I didn't come for the slipper.

558
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,410
I came to buy something.

559
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,570
You did? What?

560
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,610
Did you eat yet?

561
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,140
Do you want some chocolate?

562
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,240
But... where's Ms. Vegetables?

563
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,740
She... had something scary happen, so she's taking a break.

564
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,290
Will she be okay just because she doesn't work here?

565
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,500
What do you mean?

566
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,720
Oh, honey!

567
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,990
- What's this? 
 - Honey!

568
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,050
Give me a hand!

569
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,390
Here.

570
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,550
Butchery.

571
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,160
Come on.

572
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,640
What is that?

573
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,770
I don't think the marketplace will do well...

574
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,370
I didn't mean to, but I lost my temper,

575
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,020
so people were really shocked.

576
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,430
And?

577
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,180
I thought of a new business idea.

578
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,590
The stationary store in the co-op out front is closing soon.

579
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,580
They were selling those at a huge discount!

580
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,190
I heard you can make a pretty good profit.

581
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,270
New business idea, my butt. You got taken by the stationary store owner.

582
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,660
So, how little did you pay exactly?

583
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,690
In three months, we'll make back the cost of that machine.

584
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,840
In three months, our mart could go under!

585
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,990
Then, all you'll have left is that thing!

586
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,730
I'll try to get it done in two months.

587
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,290
One month.

588
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,550
Do you have any coins?

589
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,370
What are you doing?

590
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,360
Clean up quickly and go home!

591
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,160
Okay.

592
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,940
Let's move it.

593
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,510
Do you want to give it a try?

594
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,560
Which one do you want?

595
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,400
- This one. 
 - This one?

596
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,140
Can I put it inside myself?

597
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:47,860
Of course! It's easy to get this one, but not everyone can get the ones inside the machine.

598
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,330
Let's see.

599
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,280
Please do me this favor, Puppy.

600
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,330
It'll do well. I'm sure of it!

601
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,560
Did you put it inside?

602
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,050
There.

603
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,810
Use this.

604
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,710
You're the first customer.

605
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,540
Here. Try it.

606
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,310
- Oh! 
 - Oh!

607
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,740
It's grabbing it!

608
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,980
- Too bad. 
 - Profit, my butt.

609
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,570
Try one more time.

610
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:40,470
Oh, come and sit down.

611
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,130
You know Fish.

612
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,480
You've seen Ah Hee before, right? My girlfriend.

613
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,400
I should cook the scallops.

614
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,600
I... am curious about something.

615
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,590
What is it?

616
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,650
You didn't tell me that.

617
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,440
What is it?

618
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,570
You already apologized. Are you still suspicious of me?

619
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:20,330
Not oppa but me. Not a suspicion but a question.

620
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,220
Is it because of that thing?

621
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,480
- My criminal record— 
 - Your makeup—

622
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,170
- Criminal record? 
 - Makeup?

623
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,200
Well... you were so good at doing makeup,

624
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,260
so I wanted to ask what you used.

625
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,450
I was going to tell you about my criminal record.

626
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:40,440
I'm sure that was one of the reasons you suspected me in the first place.

627
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,960
Well... I did.

628
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,070
Since Lee Young Ah was murdered in her apartment.

629
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:52,600
With 3 previous convictions, I figured breaking in would be easy, and we didn't know what was stolen, so you could be

630
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,510
- a p-pervert, too. 
 - Hey.

631
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,300
He's not, so that's enough of the bad stuff. Why go into details?

632
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,240
I didn't break in.

633
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,440
All three times, it happened at my house.

634
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,650
What?

635
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:11,150
The motorcycle was used for delivery at my parents' Chinese restaurant,

636
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,830
and the other two were money and my mom's ring.

637
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,670
And your parents reported you?

638
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,060
They didn't want to settle?

639
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,380
I didn't want to tell my parents,

640
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,800
but they would find out anyway once I got the surgery, so I came out to them.

641
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,280
But they locked me up at the prayer center and shaved my head and locked me up at home.

642
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,550
They tried to take me to the mental hospital, so I left home three times.

643
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:45,970
I roughly figured out what was owed to me while working for my parents up until then and left.

644
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,810
So your parents reported you.

645
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,330
To get you back home.

646
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,650
No. To straighten me out.

647
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,850
It's just as awful to hear it the second time around.

648
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,800
You knew?

649
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,040
Before I came, I heard from Senior Doo Hyeon.

650
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,550
That he saw me looking into Fish's past convictions,

651
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,800
and that I shouldn't misunderstand.

652
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,210
Eat up, it's warm.

653
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,460
You eat, too.

654
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,270
It's hot!

655
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,750
It's good, right?

656
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,500
Eat! Eat!

657
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,730
I'm also sorry.

658
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:53,360
You were trying to catch the criminal and you were trying to save the kid, so it's okay.

659
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,700
But it seems like...

660
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,290
you guys don't care that I'm transgender.

661
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,730
Is it okay as long as I'm not a killer?

662
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,950
Oh, right! Like I was saying!

663
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,700
Huh?

664
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,690
What makeup do you use? How do you do that?

665
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,780
I'll show you.

666
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,050
This?

667
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,230
You have all kinds of products.

668
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,460
Here. Butchery told me to give it to you.

669
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,810
- Where is he? 
 - He said he might stop by later.

670
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,830
I don't think he's in the mood for a get-together.

671
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,840
How much is it?

672
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,570
Shouldn't I pay you for delivery?

673
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:51,470
I came for the get-together.

674
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,300
Really? You've never come to our get-togethers.

675
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,030
It's been a long time since I ate beef.

676
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,390
Are you close with Ah Hee?

677
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,390
Since when?

678
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,040
Are you close with Fish? Since when did you speak informally with each other?

679
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,350
- We're not close. 
 - We're not close.

680
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:23,690
Oh, but now that I think about it, Fish speaks informally to you.

681
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,530
You're right. It was so natural that I didn't even think about it.

682
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,130
Why did you?

683
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,610
Does he seem easy to you?!

684
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,900
 - He is. 
 - He is.

685
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,900
No. Not at all.

686
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,090
It's because I don't know what to call him.

687
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,150
It is pretty tricky. Calling me "brother" is also kind of weird.

688
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,160
"Brother"...

689
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,550
It's better to speak informally to become closer.

690
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,570
Like equals, American-style.

691
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,420
Hurry and eat. She'll eat it all.

692
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,150
Eat slowly. Eat up.

693
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,680
- Let's eat more meat. 
 - Okay.

694
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:09,100
Call Butchery. This is such little meat.

695
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,610
Tell him to bring more.

696
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:17,650

697
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,380
Why isn't he answering?

698
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,580
  The person you have dialed cannot answer right now..

699
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,080
There's a lot of people who know I'm here!

700
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,470
My daughter also knows.

701
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,420
If I don't come home, my daughter will call the poli—

702
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,980
I won't tell anyone what I saw!

703
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,270
Please spare me!

704
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,280
Spare me. Spare me!

705
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:14,640
Then, have you all been living here all your lives?

706
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,700
Yes, Butchery and I went to the same elementary school,

707
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,440
and Ah Hee is our junior. She's Ah Hee's junior.

708
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,750
That's how it is here.

709
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,300
A lot of natives and familiar faces.

710
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,050
Hey, cheers.

711
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,110
Slowly, slowly.

712
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,040
Only half.

713
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,490
That's why I'm sick of this neighborhood.

714
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,270
Hey, what do you mean?

715
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,730
It's unfamiliar to me.

716
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,450
I thought this neighborhood was very peaceful.

717
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,830
Back then,

718
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:54,540
when you drove out 5,000 Won out of your mart.

719
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,500
From then on, I said I would protect the neighborhood with you and become a police officer.

720
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,560
See? It's boring.

721
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,850
Why are you achieving a dream you had as a child?

722
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,900
And you're still dating the person you liked when you were young.

723
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,440
I like that things don't change.

724
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:19,030
But after becoming a police officer...

725
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,770
this neighborhood seems unfamiliar. It's like a jungle.

726
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,430
Everyone seems weird and suspicious.

727
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,230
Everyone has at least one secret!

728
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,400
- You grew up in a bubble. 
 - Hey!

729
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:41,110
I don't know what I have to do to stop bad things from happening.

730
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:46,270
I don't know if there's anything I can do.

731
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:51,180
I feel like a little kid that doesn't know anything.

732
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,910
Ah Hee, the restroom!

733
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,440
- Just wait! 
 - I feel like I'm going to throw up.

734
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,160
Wait, wait! The restroom!

735
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,360
Ah Hee! Wait!

736
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,820
I need to return this to him.

737
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,370
Why is he drawing things that doesn't suit him?

738
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,390
What is this? Isn't this Vegetables?

739
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,530
Oppa, I want to change.

740
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,360
- Did it get wet? 
 - Yes.

741
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,090
I think you'll be cold.

742
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,180
It's okay.

743
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,860
Oh. Look at this!

744
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,740
Mom, i-it's

745
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,410
It's not like that.

746
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,720
It's not what you're thinking, Mom.

747
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,930
Mother.

748
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,190
Even if you're in a hurry, you should've started after sending the kids outside home first.

749
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,750
Start what? I told you it's not like that.

750
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:39,190
It's fine if it's not. I don't care!

751
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,720
Go do a delivery.

752
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,920
- This late? 
 - Yes.

753
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,930
I drank.

754
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,180
Then walk there and sober up.

755
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,700
Your father made a mess, so I think I need to have it out.

756
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:54,250
If I go tomorrow, the stationery shop owner will refuse, saying he only gives same-day refunds!

757
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:57,600
- What are you talking about? 
 - Mother, is there a problem?

758
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,590
Should I go?

759
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,300
No, no, it's okay.

760
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,540
You just stay here and have more fun while drinking.

761
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,710
Then, let's drink together.

762
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,580
- Your shirt. 
 - Dae Seong, hurry up with the delivery!

763
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,420
Hello.

764
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,120
- Thank you. 
 -Thank you.

765
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,140
- Yeah? 
  - I want some jjondeuki (chewy corn snack).

766
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,530
  - Aren't you full? 
 - Jjondeuki

767
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,370
  Jjeonduki jjeonduki!

768
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,660
  It'd be perfect if you had a mukbang Youtube channel.

769
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,010
I'll get some on the way back.

770
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,550
  Fatty is the best!

771
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:15,930

772
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,110
