1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,970

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,600

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,950

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,300

5
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,220

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,150

7
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,420
Is anyone there?

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,540
Excuse me?

9
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,570
Anyone there?

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,320
Detective Choi.

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,010
Detective Choi.

12
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,470

13
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,900
 Hello?!!

14
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,110
 Geumseong Real Estate

15
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,060
 Detective Choi.

16
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,370
 Anyone there?

17
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,100
What's wrong?

18
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,580
Dae Seong hasn't returned yet.

19
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,540
That's right!

20
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,970
If Detective Choi just found another excuse to drag him to the police station, then—

21
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,110
Ah Hee?

22
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,720
 Yes?

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,740
Dae Seong and Detective Choi left together. They haven't returned yet in hours.

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,840
 Where did they go?!

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,340
I don't know where they are. By any chance, are they at the police—

26
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,120
 I'm hanging up!

27
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,940
 What did she say?

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,840
I think we can confirm immediately if he is at the police station.

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,670
Really?

30
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,010
Then you come along with me to Yool's place.

31
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,510
Thinking about her being alone, I am worried.

32
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,720
Let's go. Take these bags.

33
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,590

34
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,150
Choi Ji Woong!!

35
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,020
Where is Choi Ji Woong?

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,950
Officer Do Ah Hee, he's not your friend.

37
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,180
How dare you just barge in and call out his name like that?

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,670
If what the police does is harass the public, then I want to hit him.

39
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,860
Let's forget our ranks and go toe to toe. Police vs citizen.

40
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,340
Where is Choi Ji Woong?

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,640
He brought in Ahn Dae Seong again, right?

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,620
He didn't. Should I call him?

43
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,220
Maybe he grew fond of Dae Seong.

44
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,760
He's not answering. They must be busy.

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,540
Should I leave a voicemail—

46
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,540
Officer Do Ah Hee!

47
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,130
Drink up.

48
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,400
 Detective Choi!

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,930
 Detective Choi!

50
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,770
I thought he left to find evidence of Yool's abuse. But nobody's home?

51
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,830
I don't think anybody came here.

52
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,800
Nobody is here.

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,350
Give it to me.

54
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,860
Ah Hee.

55
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,530
I-I think something is wrong. Something doesn't feel right.

56
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,810
 What's wrong, Mother?

57
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,320
Yool left the mart ages ago, but she isn't home yet.

58
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,630
And the smell here is...

59
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,540
- It's— 
 - Wait.

60
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,870
Isn't this the smell of the drain cleaner?

61
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,620
Yes, that's right!!!

62
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,870
It's the pine scent from the Quick Unclogger!

63
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,090
I smelled it last time when I was here,

64
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,040
and I still smell it!

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,600
You heard what Gong San said to Dae Seong, right?

66
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Senior! I need backup.

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,700
Please come to Geumseong Real Estate.

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,920
Dae Seong and Yool might be in danger.

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,910

70
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,300
Stay away!

71
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,020
He is alive. He is still alive.

72
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,610
This is Nawoo 2, Nawoo 2.

73
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,970
A victim was discovered at Geumseong Real Estate.

74
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,600
Call 119 immediately.

75
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,690
Senior...

76
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,130
Ahn Dae Seong, you have the right to a lawy—

77
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,710
What are you doing?

78
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,920
You should first listen to what actually happened.

79
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,000
Did you do this?

80
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,290
Yes.

81
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,290
What are you saying?

82
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,140
But you didn't do it! Seo Cheon Kyu did!

83
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,350
I wasn't able to... save the person again.

84
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,360
I-I made the situation dangerous.

85
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,760
Oppa, get yourself together.

86
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,880
What about Yool?

87
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,080
Yool is still at the mart, right?

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
I heard that she had left the mart earlier.

89
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,590
She's not at home either.

90
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,620
- Ahn Dae Seong! 
 - Senior!

91
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,780
Please. If Dae Seong is suspected again,

92
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,860
we might lose time to save Yool.

93
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,160
I don't know if I'm doing something I'll regret later again, but...

94
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,430
Thank you, Sir!

95
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,640
I will save Yool for sure.

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,820
I am trusting you and releasing him.

97
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,680
No one else can get hurt anymore.

98
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,140
Okay.

99
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,410

100
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,170
- It's not me. 
 - I know.

101
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,950
It's really not me.

102
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,390
When I was stuck in the back of the real estate office, I tried to break free. Then—

103
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,450
I said I know. I know.

104
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,910
Yool... If it's her father who took her—

105
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,650
Let's catch him.

106
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,620
Detective Choi could gain consciousness soon,

107
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,640
and even if not, we can catch him.

108
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,440
But... you'll be suspected in the meantime.

109
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,650
You are still going for it, right?

110
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,380

111
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,070
You know that man, right?

112
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,140
You should answer properly.

113
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,840
Yes.

114
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,080
 Did you follow me?

115
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,080
 You should take care of the kid well.

116
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,570
 What if she roams around at night again?

117
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,450
 So annoying...

118
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,130
 That's bad for her education-wise.

119
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,610
 Somehow, I happened to see her phone.

120
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,580
 She was taking pictures of weird things.

121
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,140
 It's good that I saw it first.

122
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,590
 If the police had seen it, it would be huge trouble.

123
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,980
 What? Why are you doing this?

124
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,520
 Me too...

125
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,630
 I took a picture, too.

126
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,100
 Something strange happened next door to me not too long ago.

127
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,140
 You know, right? The President of the Women's Association. The strange lady.

128
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,860
 She was found nearly dead.

129
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,030
 I saw her going into the apartment next door.

130
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,630
 I mean, I thought it was strange she would go into an empty unit.

131
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,620
 I followed her in without her knowing,

132
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,020
 and I secretly filmed her.

133
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:56,420
 Wow, I was so scared I could have died! I nearly peed my pants!

134
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,840
 I mean, if we work together,

135
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,480
 we might be able to help each other out with this.

136
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,430
 So, what I mean is, with this,

137
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,820
 I can send that bastard son of the mart owner

138
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,420
 with just one strike, and you...

139
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,270
 you can get off quietly.

140
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,090
 - I don't get what you're saying. 
 - I'll...

141
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,770
 say that the mart bastard did it.

142
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,840
 I will tell them he did it.

143
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,350
 So when I leave this town,

144
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,990
 you can get me a nice house somewhere quiet.

145
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,140
 Even if you get me a lease, it'll be a clean deal is what I'm saying.

146
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,330
 You must have a network of realtors.

147
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,290
 It'll be good if you could do that for me.

148
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,750
 Oh...

149
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,290
 So many freaks here.

150
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,160
 Damn it!

151
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,800
So, that man was punished.

152
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,200
He saw something he shouldn't have.

153
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,160
Do you know who else got punished?

154
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,360
I promised you when we came here.

155
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,570
I kept my promise.

156
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,830

157
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,600

158
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,710

159
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,600

160
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,720
You're working hard.

161
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,770

162
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,810
Don't you think we should go look for the realtor first?

163
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,980
According to the shopkeepers,

164
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,060
he closed up shop the day before and said he was going to go visit his wife.

165
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,180
But why was Detective Choi there?

166
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,080
He said he was going to the mart.

167
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,570
He went to the mart to put pressure since all he had was a strong feeling.

168
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,170
But if he found out something new,

169
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,020
he's not the type to go at it alone.

170
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,450
I know he's not like that! That's what I'm saying!

171
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,860
What happened exactly?

172
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,990
You call that hiding? It'll look suspicious to anyone.

173
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,680
You know the saying, it's the darkest under the lamp.

174
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,470
It's not important how I'm hiding but that we find the culprit.

175
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,770
The culprit is one thing, but we need to find Yool!

176
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,060
I know! We need to find out where she is first.

177
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,380
You're going to find out from in there? How? By magic?

178
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:01,580
No. Up until now, we tried to figure out who the culprit was by the items bought that were used for murder.

179
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,800
I can't tell what the heck you're saying! Hold on.

180
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,860
Speak through this hole.

181
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,140
From now on, we need to find out the culprit's location by the items that were bought.

182
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,750
There must be a reason why he stopped in to buy something before going away knowing I suspected him of abusing Yool!

183
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,760
Yeah?

184
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,650
He bought...

185
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,820
nothing much. A few instant food items.

186
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,550
Oh, long time no see!

187
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,290
It's been a week, right?

188
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,200
Hold on. Let me...

189
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,530
You're buying all these so you can hole up in your apartment for the next week?

190
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,050
Goodness! you should go exercise and meet up with friends, too! You play computer games, don't you?!

191
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,250
- What did you say? 
 - Never mind.

192
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,090
- Geez! 
 - Oh, right!

193
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,290
This is two for one. You must have forgotten.

194
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,200
 Hey, can you bring a two for one dumpling pack over here?!

195
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,330
No, bring five!

196
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,730
Forget it!

197
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,330
Take the dumplings with you!

198
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,430
We're having a sale on hairtail.

199
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,890
We just got the beef in today.

200
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,000
- This isn't the only lamp that's dark underneath. 
 - What are you talking about?

201
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,530
Geumseong came back to the real estate office yesterday,

202
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,870
and he came back for Yool as soon as something happened.

203
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:42,020
I have a feeling he didn't go far but is hiding out in this area.

204
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,890
 Maybe he's hiding somewhere and eating instant foods.

205
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,320
Yool, why aren't you eating?

206
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,010
I'm not hungry.

207
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,750
You haven't eaten anything today.

208
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,030
What if you get sick? You can die.

209
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,790
We can't go to the hospital, and I'm not a doctor.

210
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,390
Will you eat all this or get punished for an hour?

211
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:04,240
It would be a relief if that man from earlier was the only person who saw something he shouldn't have.

212
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,450
What did you take pictures of with your mom's phone?

213
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,410
Videos and photos.

214
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,080
Of whom?

215
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,510
Where is the phone right now?

216
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,430
Whoever sees them, they'll die, too.

217
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,380
Yool, if the police see them,

218
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,630
I'll go to jail and you'll go to an orphanage. What do you think will happen to you then?

219
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,130
You hid it in the mart, didn't you?

220
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,210
If you don't tell me the truth,

221
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,950
all the mart people will end up like that man from earlier.

222
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,460
What? Why can't soju be delivered?

223
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,200
Damn it!

224
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,250

225
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,150
I mean, look.

226
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:43,130
It's like finding a needle in a haystack! How are we supposed to search all these units?!

227
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,120
I barely managed to get it from the union manager.

228
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,320
Take a good look at it.

229
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,890
  Yeah, take a good look.

230
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,390

231
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,020
Hey. I need to go out on delivery.

232
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,120

233
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,260
Part-Timer! Watch the register!

234
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,990
Over there first.

235
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
What's this?

236
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,290
- Hello. 
 - Are the sales going well? 
 - Of course.

237
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,190
 Ah, ah, mic test, mic test. One, two, three.

238
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,240
- Ah, ah. 
 - How are things?

239
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,180
Would you like something?

240
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,280
No, I'm good.

241
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,510
Oh, that's right. This is 5,000 Won's house, right?

242
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,750
Split the apple, put it on a plate, and take that!

243
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,480
Damn it. Her son should have come.

244
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,970
This is all because of that bastard. He needs to be punished.

245
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,640
- Is something there? 
 - Nothing. Nothing.

246
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,610
Oh, you're leaving now?

247
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,450
- Work hard. 
 - Yes, go safely.

248
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,850
 Let's go. Nothing seems to be here.

249
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,040
- Turn off the CCTV. 
 - What?

250
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,760
I said turn off the CCTV.

251
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,890
Butchery, help me. I think he can come out now.

252
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,610
Grab it from the back.

253
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,020
Gosh! What smell is this?

254
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,630
Hand. Your hand...

255
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,260
Careful, careful, careful.

256
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,530
Carefully.

257
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,950
Oh, cramp!

258
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,360
Get some water, please. Thank you!

259
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,540
Fish and Butchery.

260
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,090
- Close the canopies. 
 - Okay.

261
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,540
Oh, I can't move.

262
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,980

263
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,600

264
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,290
Come on.

265
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,820
Darn it.

266
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,500
No, don't touch it.

267
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,200
Eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.

268
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,120
That's strange.

269
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,910
- What? 
 - The place where I just delivered to

270
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,230
has placed another order.

271
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,460
They must have forgotten to order something.

272
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,620
Not at all.

273
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,460
They placed the same order again.

274
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,860
Is it an error?

275
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,600

What does "505" mean?

276
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,150
Maybe it means, "I will pay you, but deliver it to Unit 505."

277
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,980
Which unit is this?

278
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,000
408.

279
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,340
Next door to 5,000 Won?

280
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,730
Mom, this is—

281
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,130
Why would they order anything? It's a vacant unit.

282
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,580
- What? 
 - The President of the Women's Association

283
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,050
nagged nonstop to Geumseong about how the meter keeps running when the unit is empty.

284
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,070
- Oh, god. 
 - Gong San, this—

285
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,260
The president fell from the fourth floor of Jinsong, right?

286
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,340
- This— 
 - They probably made a mistake with the delivery.

287
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,020
505. This is Yool.

288
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,520
 505?

289
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,230
 No, it's SOS. What it means is—

290
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,160
 I know what it means, too. I'm just saying it looks like it says 505.

291
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,390
What?

292
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,230
It's Yool.

293
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,210
Let's verify it first, and then—

294
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,910
If what Oppa is saying is right, then the serial killer is holding Yool as a hostage.

295
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,570
What if he's wrong? If Dae Seong gets arrested for being wrong, we'll be in trouble, too!

296
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,850
I'm retiring soon, but will it be okay if you get fired?

297
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,590
Let's check it out first.

298
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,880
At least for once listen to what I am saying.

299
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,070
Then we will approach from behind.

300
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,390
He won't willingly open the door, and all his focus will be on the front of the apartment.

301
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,530
Here, here.

302
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,470
Yool. Yool!

303
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,870
Yool?

304
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,500
Yool?!

305
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,860
 Yool?

306
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,740
 Yool?

307
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,310
Yool. Yool.

308
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,820
Damn!

309
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,920
 - Yool? 
 - Yool!

310
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,050
 Yool? Yool?

311
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,690
 Yool?

312
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,810
No one's home?

313
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,990
Yool!

314
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,910
 Seo Yool!

315
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,550
What? You know how to break open doors, too?

316
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,340
I learned, but I'm not good at it.

317
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,820
Yool. My daughter.

318
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,190
What are you doing?

319
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,060
You know what will happen if you don't listen to me.

320
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,790
 Open the door.

321
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,490
Open the door.

322
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,260
Open the door.

323
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,290
Hurry up.

324
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,640
I'm trying. I said I'm not that good. Hold on.

325
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,570
Can I have some light? It's too dark.

326
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,170
Got it.

327
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,050
Fish is trying to break open the door right now. They can't sense anyone inside.

328
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,570
 What's that?

329
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,290
Oh, Yool!

330
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:53,620
Yes, a child is in danger. I think we need to go over the window or break in through the front door.

331
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,490
Yes, yes!

332
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,830
It's going to take at least 10 minutes. I wonder if the ladder truck can get in here.

333
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,450
Oppa, I think we need some people out here.

334
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,480
Hey, where are you going?

335
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,430
 Just stay right there.

336
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,550
  - Don't move. 
 - Where is she?! What happened?

337
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,180
- What happened? 
 - There, there.

338
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,660
Oh, my god!

339
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,350
- Yool! 
 - Oh, Yool!

340
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,590
- Oh! 
 - Yool!

341
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,560
What do we do? Yool!

342
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,370
- Yool! Go look for something to cushion her fall in case! 
 - Cushion?!

343
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,170
Recycling! Recycling! Recycling area!

344
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,040
Don't move. Stay still!

345
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,220
That's right. Stay like that. Don't move.

346
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,750
Door lock.

347
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,290
That's right.

348
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,470
He bought a door lock.

349
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,890

350
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,510

351
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,270

352
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,410
Look for something!

353
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,900
Part-Timer, this one! This!

354
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,930
Hey, let's go!

355
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,720
Let's go!

356
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,120
- Hello, is anyone in there? 
  - Who is it?

357
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,630
This is the police!

358
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,090
 The police?

359
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,020
I'm sorry!

360
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,700
Wait!

361
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,210
Lay it down! Lay it down!

362
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,930
Lay it down here!

363
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,590
Here!

364
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,130
Here!

365
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,880
Lay it down!

366
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,200
Yool!

367
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,810
Yool! Wait a second, Yool!

368
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,080
Stay right there!

369
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,540
- Hey! 
 - Oh...

370
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,490
- H-Hey, hey, hey! 
 - Ah Hee!

371
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,960
Hold on just a little more.

372
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,310
 - What do we do? 
 - Yool, hang on!

373
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,640
What are you doing, Ahn Dae Seong? It's open.

374
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,370
This lock used to be on the real estate office's door.

375
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,770
The door lock that was bought at the mart is on the door of the real estate office.

376
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,140
Check here first. I'll look at it.

377
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,190
Be careful!

378
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,960
- Officer Do, are you crazy?! 
 - That Do Ah Hee!

379
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,740
Oh!

380
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,520
She must be crazy!

381
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,720
 - Be careful! 
   - Watch your step!

382
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
 Careful!

383
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,780
 Ah Hee!

384
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,770
 Be careful!

385
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,380
 What do we do?

386
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,160
 Oh my goodness...

387
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,330
 She's coming down! She's coming down!

388
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,870
 Oh, she's coming down!

389
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,590
Slowly!

390
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,920
Be careful! Be careful!

391
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,060
 Careful! Careful!

392
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,690
 Yool, don't move!

393
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,840
 Yool, stay where you are!

394
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,730
 Don't move!

395
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,260
 Yes.

396
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,100
 You must be happy!

397
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,380
 Be careful! Watch your step!

398
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,270
 Don't move. Don't move!

399
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,120
Yool.

400
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,010
Take my hand.

401
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,890
 It's okay! Yool!

402
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,480
It's okay.

403
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,690
I'll hold you tight and never let go.

404
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,510
Grab onto me.

405
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,140
 That's right! Take her hand!

406
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,980
 Be careful! Be careful!

407
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,140
 Be careful! Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,610
 Ah, be careful!

409
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,770
 That's right!

410
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,320
 Take her hand!

411
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,100
 That's right!

412
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,770
 That's good! It's okay!

413
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,800
 Yes, yes!

414
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,450
 It's okay!

415
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,340
 Oh, my!

416
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,290
 Ah, be careful! Be careful!

417
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,290
Be careful! Be careful!

418
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,560
Be careful! Be careful!

419
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,960
 Hold on tight!

420
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,290
  Be careful!

421
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,970
Oh, thank goodness. Thank goodness!

422
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,560
Ah, we can let it go now.

423
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,020
Yool, are you okay?

424
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,800
You must have been scared.

425
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,020
Yool.

426
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,720
Where is... your dad?

427
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,040
Yes, Yool is fine.

428
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,030
Please block the entryways, Senior.

429
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,550
Seo Cheon Kyu is still...

430
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,720
It's okay.

431
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,160
I'll be right back after checking something quickly.

432
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,640
Wait here for a little bit.

433
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,130
Oppa.

434
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,690
Ah Hee!

435
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,080
What are you?

436
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,810
You're that guy from before!

437
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,590
Not a woman or a man. You're a monster!

438
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,100
How dare you scream?

439
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,310
You're the monster. Not me.

440
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,020
I'm a friend of Kyeong Ah's whom you murdered, you worthless bastard!

441
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,070
What exactly...

442
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,500
I know that person.

443
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,950
Nguyen Thi Zhonglin.

444
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,990
Yool's mom...

445
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,900
Do you think Yool saw this?

446
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,970
 At Jinsong Apartment Unit 408,

447
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,690
- Yool. 
  - Two dead bodies found.

448
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,750
 I'm requesting backup.

449
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,450
Let's go.

450
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,350
Kids!

451
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,090
Are you okay?!

452
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,770
Mom, take Yool!

453
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,100
Unit 409! 409!

454
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,870
Oh, hey!

455
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,650
Are you okay?!

456
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,110
Stay still! Stay still!

457
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,770
Suspect found! Suspect found!

458
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,100
Moving from the hallway on the 4th floor to the 1st floor!

459
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,960
He's coming! He's coming!

460
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,670
Stop!

461
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,830
Seo Cheon Kyu! Stop!

462
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,860
This is Nawoo 2. Nawoo 2. Emergency. Emergency!

463
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,460
From Jinsong Apartment, in the direction of Nawoo Elementary School,

464
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,930
the murder suspect is on the run!

465
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,020
Did we lose him?

466
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,700
I'll be back!

467
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,730
Don't worry!

468
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,510
Are you okay?

469
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:46,230
I heard there was a child in custody. Where is she?

470
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,530
Oh, that's...

471
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,980
She's in a lot of shock, so I think it'll be too overwhelming.

472
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,790
We'll try to calm her down and bring her to the station.

473
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,590
Me too, me too, me too!

474
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,150
Can you give me a ride to the mart?

475
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,860
I'm going to try and look for Geumseong.

476
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,890
It's too hard to look while you're riding, so let me come with you.

477
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,760
Okay.

478
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,320
This is more than enough evidence.

479
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,080
The police will focus our search, so we should be able to catch him soon.

480
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,770
Then I'll take good care of Yool.

481
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,150
- Where could he have gone? 
 - He must know that he can't hide in an empty unit anymore.

482
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,350
He won't leave this neighborhood easily.

483
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:57,090
- Why? 
 - Even after he killed his wife he didn't leave.

484
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,360
There must be a reason.

485
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:43,970

486
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,180
Oh! Hold on a second.

487
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,980
Butchery.

488
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,460
Hello? Butchery! Where are you right now?

489
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,530
 He just went into the alleyway where the Hansol Study Room is!

490
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,790
Go into that alleyway!

491
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,840
Oh! There! There! Over there!

492
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,600
To the left. Left!

493
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,970
There! Hurry!

494
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,570

495
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,060
Mom. Go home, it's dangerous.

496
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,460
- The police— 
 -  I'm fine

497
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,060
I'm with Butchery right now. I'll be home soon.

498
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,750
Yool.

499
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:19,260
Dae Seong, how is Yool? She's okay, right?

500
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,880
Where is she? At the house?

501
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,190
 Yool? She's with dad—

502
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,310
Are you at the mart? If you are, check something.

503
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,920
You know the delivery order number 505? Don't deliver to 505 no matter what!

504
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,320
It's dangerous! Whatever you do, don't deliver there.

505
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,750
Why are you talking about something else?

506
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:45,050
Do as I tell you or you're dead. All I have to do is set fire to this place.

507
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:48,110
Okay. I got it.

508
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,290
I got it.

509
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,690
Ah, damn it!

510
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,350
Something's off.

511
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:15,580
505. Yool wrote that to signal SOS.

512
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,270
It's Yool. What he wants is Yool.

513
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,130
She's the reason he didn't leave this neighborhood.

514
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,910
I'll put in a request to pin the location of your mom's phone and search the vicinity.

515
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:32,540
If she calls back, don't do anything. Just pretend you don't know and stall her.

516
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,420
Oh, we got disconnected all of a sudden.

517
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,950
 Yool is at the mart with me, and dad went to the police station to speak with Doo Hyeon.

518
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,510
I was just listening to Yool.

519
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,170
 - With Yool?  
 - Yeah, we're alone.

520
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,080
The police are coming over right now, right?

521
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,930
 No. I don't think Yool will be able to speak to the police tonight.

522
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:15,890
 So it's just the two of us here. Alone.

523
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,450

524
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,310
You! Don't touch my kid or your kid.

525
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:30,390
I'll kill you if you lay a finger on either of them.

526
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,330
Well, it's too bad.

527
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:40,840
Like the other women, the two of you might both die tonight.

528
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:47,190
Whether it's my wife, my daughter, or whoever,

529
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,360
I like being able to do whatever I want.

530
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,970
But if things don't go my way, I get really angry.

531
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:58,730
What a load of bull...

532
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,730
Shut the hell up!

533
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,190
 Butchery!

534
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,520
Butchery!

535
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,460

536
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,780
Hello!

537
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,990
Mother!

538
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,190
Are you okay?!

539
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:16,550
- Ah Hee, Dae Seong is in danger! We have to go to the Mart! 
 - What?

540
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,180
Where's my daughter?

541
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,350
Whether it's Kwon Bo Yeon,

542
00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:00,030
Lee Yeong Ah, or your wife,

543
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,220
Yool's mom, Nguyen Thi Zhonglin,

544
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,850
the videos of you assaulting or killing them were handed over to the police.

545
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,710
And 5,000 Won's body was also found at your hideout, too.

546
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:15,420
Yeah, exactly.

547
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,730
I killed them all. Do you think I can't kill you?

548
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,570
You didn't kill the President of the Women's Association or Detective Choi.

549
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,780
You think being alive in that state is better?

550
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,690
Enough. Where's Yool?

551
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,410
All I need is Yool.

552
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,580
You might be able to kill me, but you can't take Yool.

553
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,830
She's my daughter!

554
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,470
I know.

555
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,120
 - Oppa! 
- Dae Seong! 
 - Dae Seong!

556
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,140
Unfortunately, she is your daughter but she's not your property.

557
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,680
Just because she's your daughter, it doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with her.

558
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,170
Think about it.

559
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,430
How can you control someone else? I can't even control myself.

560
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,590
- Dae Seong! 
 - Dae Seong! 
 - No!

561
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,890
What are you doing right now?

562
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,670
Even now, you can't do what you want.

563
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,790
- Dae Seong! 
 - Don't do that!

564
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:13,920
The fact that you think it's possible makes you the strange one.

565
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:19,310
 - Dae Seong!  
 - Dae Seong!

566
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,510
Dae Seong!

567
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,050
- Oppa! 
 - Open it!

568
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,930
 Dae Seong!

569
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:11,750
♫  Like a fool, while remembering you  ♫

570
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,960
♫  Why didn't I know  ♫

571
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,100
  Is this to take to the daycare center?

572
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,160

573
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,870
 No, it's for an adult.

574
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,920
 - What?  
  - That laundry machine is perfect for making So-maek!

575
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,690
 Really?

576
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,670
♫  I was just a pastime to you  ♫

577
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,540
 You're from Dae Seong Mart, right? This got delivered wrong.

578
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,110
 I've never ordered this.

579
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,950
 This is the 2nd time this week!

580
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,010
♫  Your strategic actions  ♫

581
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,040
 Where are your shoes? Are you hurt?

582
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,890
♫  You can tell me nothing   ♫

583
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,660
 How could this happen?

584
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,030
♫  That's enough now. I'm going to catch you  ♫

585
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,630
♫  I can no longer stand back now  ♫

586
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,070
♫  Room with no lights. The darkness has come this night  ♫

587
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,130
♫  Just how much did you have planned out  ♫

588
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,730
♫  The moon has darkened. The lies you told  ♫

589
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,030
♫  You pour everything out. You can tell me nothing  ♫

590
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:07,050
♫  You can tell me nothing. You can tell me Na ah ah  ♫

591
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:13,300
♫  You can tell me nothing. You can tell me Na ah ah  ♫

592
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,340
You idiot!

593
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:27,040
Why are you risking your life for other people's business?!

594
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:49,380

595
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,790
Push it up!

596
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,070
Hurry and lift it!

597
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,450
Dae Seong!

598
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,060
Dae Seong! Dae Seong!

599
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,420
Oppa, are you okay?

600
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,750
- My gosh. 
 - Oppa!

601
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,620
Stand up!

602
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:43,030
Seo Cheon Kyu, you're under arrest for murder.

603
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,450
You have the right to a lawyer, and you have the right to explain yourself.

604
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,120
I didn't risk my life for someone else's business.

605
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:05,130
I didn't do this to get revenge for the people that died either.

606
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,330
I just...

607
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:11,370
wanted the people who came to the store yesterday...

608
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:16,110
to come back today and tomorrow...

609
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,430
without any problems.

610
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,730
I want them to come back, that's all.

611
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,690
Hey. Hey! Who do you think you are?

612
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,100
Who do you think you are?

613
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,000
Hey. Who do you think you are?!

614
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,270
What do you mean?!

615
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:43,470
Even if it isn't his business, he can't look past it if someone has been hurt or killed.

616
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,550
He's someone who cares.

617
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,180
He's also someone who listens to what a child has to say.

618
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,710
That's right! If it wasn't for Dae Seong, would anyone have cared about what happened to a stranger?!

619
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,290
They would've just said that it wasn't their business and passed by!

620
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,240
Yeah, that's right.

621
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,840
Our Dae Seong's nosiness has caught a killer.

622
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,320
Let's go.

623
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,460
- My son. 
 - I'm sorry.

624
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,770
You did well. You did well!

625
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,990
You did so well.

626
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,380
You did well.

627
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,620
Good job.

628
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,250
Good job.

629
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,120
Good job.

630
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,030
We'll take him from here.

631
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,810
All right, let's go.

632
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:49,790
 Get in.

633
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,190
 Get in the car.

634
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,000
 Good work.

635
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:06,370
Thank you.

636
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,960
Yool, are you okay?

637
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:28,030

638
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,160
Give it to me!

639
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,640
You didn't have to come out!

640
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,610
Why did you?

641
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,470
Let's go!

642
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,630
Spinach.

643
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,260
- Two tomatoes, please. 
 - You got it.

644
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,270
- Here you go. Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

645
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,940
- Yes, okay. 
 - Hold on.

646
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:16,230
I'm working alone. There's no one else to watch the shop.

647
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,130
Yes, of course.

648
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,930
What the heck?

649
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:22,950
Hello, mic check. One, two, three.

650
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,620
This is the president speaking.

651
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,210
Today, at the apartment's marketplace,

652
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:34,820
we have a special deal of fresh organic produce directly from the farm.

653
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,110
Exactly for two hours. Limited sales.

654
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:40,780
You'll get a good deal.

655
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:45,160
Fill up your shopping bags for a great steal.

656
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,330
 My gosh! I need some!

657
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,240
I'm here on Gong San's behalf. She sent gifts over to congratulate you on your recovery.

658
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,900
Just tell her to focus on being a good president.

659
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,520
- As soon as I'm discharged— 
 - Mom.

660
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,310
How are you here?

661
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,170
I told you Gong San sent you a gift.

662
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,290
She asked around everywhere and finally got a hold of her in America.

663
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,410
My baby.

664
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,190
My baby.

665
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:39,570
♫  Time  ♫

666
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:44,970
♫  never waits for you  ♫

667
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,270
I'm taking you with me.

668
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:49,420
I'll take good care of you.

669
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,330
 Thank you.

670
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,320
 What would you like?

671
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,960
 Yes, okay.

672
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,710
Gosh, this family has an array of awards.

673
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:08,020
 Hello, there.

674
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,410
 What you did was amazing.

675
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:14,050
No, it was nothing.

676
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:18,290
Like mother like son.

677
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:21,840
♫  Accepting it  ♫

678
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,720
♫  might be easier  ♫

679
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,370
Hey, Unni. What are you doing?

680
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,760
Hurry over.

681
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,030
♫  Que sera sera  ♫

682
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:34,610
 You've gotten even prettier.

683
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:39,270
 I thought a model was walking in.

684
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,170
Yes, coming.

685
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,200
 Do you have clams?

686
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,330
Clams? Yes, I'll pack you some.

687
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,120
 Did something good happen? I barely recognized you because you've gotten so pretty.

688
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,440
 Seriously.

689
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,200
What is this?

690
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,430

691
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,260
Who did this?

692
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,420
I'm sorry about before.

693
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,150
I stopped by because I was shopping in the area.

694
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:22,110
I figured I should apologize to you, too.

695
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:26,460
I was simply trying to do my job.

696
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,340
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

697
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,320
A gift for you.

698
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,490
Never set foot in our mart...

699
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,720
Please continue using MS Mart, sir.

700
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,520
♫  It's so fun being with you, our, our  ♫

701
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,950
Yool! Hey, Yool!

702
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,240
Are you back from school?

703
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,190
 Yes.

704
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,520
 I just ate. I'm going to the academy now.

705
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,150
Where's your grandmother, Yool?

706
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,600
 Grandma!

Hi, there.

 Mister, when will you visit me?

711
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,940
 I'll visit you next month.

712
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,120
 Okay. Make sure you visit!

713
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,210
Yool, if you ever want to come back—

 Hi!

715
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,820
 I have to go to the academy now.

716
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,420
 Bye!

717
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,020
- Bye. 
 - Okay, bye!

718

720
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,340
Young man, what's your job?

721
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,070
I'm currently working as a cashier.

722
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:49,710
Then, what's your dream from now on?

723
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:52,400
♫  I picked up the courage  ♫

724
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,710
♫  to take a look  ♫

725

♫  Did you have to run away  ♫

726
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,930
♫  Goodness, look how far you ran off  ♫

727
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:07,700
♫  Try running away  ♫

728
