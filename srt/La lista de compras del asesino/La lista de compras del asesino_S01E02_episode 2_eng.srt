1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,980

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,640

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,660

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,350

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,020

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,700
 Age of 24.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,840
 What?

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,730
She was a daycare teacher.

9
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,680
She lived alone and attended a psychiatric clinic due to depression.

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,030
 That will be 14,500 won.

11
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,010
 One second.

12
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,990

13
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,160
Her hometown is Daegu, but she moved here 2 years ago.

14
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,760

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,600
 - Do you need a receipt?  
 - She had friends sleepover sometimes.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,590
She doesn't have a boyfriend though.

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,300
Oh, you knew the victim?

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,360
She's one of our mart's regular customers. Jin Song Apartments Building 3, Unit 403, Kwon Bo Yeon.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,740
Her phone number is 010-135-6674.

20
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,590
- Yes, Sir. 
 - She had over 30,000 points saved,

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,870
so she could have spent it like money.

22
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,250
Do you usually know the regular customers this well?

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,920
He's the market owner's son and lived here all his life.

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,160
Oppa, you know the phone number for that grandpa's guardian. Right?

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,220
Yeah, he lives alone, and a volunteer from the church comes over twice a week.

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,930
The volunteer's name is Jo Sook Ja. The number is 010-

27
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,120
932-2845.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,540
Okay.

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,390
Ah Hee.

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,920
That grandpa has diabetes. That's why we sell Jerusalem artichokes.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,420
What about Alzheimer's? He spins nunchucks rain or shine.

32
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,530
- I don't think so. 
 - Why not?

33
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,480
He comes to our store all the time, and he gives the exact change every time.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,920
Before I even tell him the total.

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,930
Suspicious, isn't he?

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,600
He's handsome, tall, and smart...

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,810
but so insignificant and useless that it's unsettling.

38
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,650
Anyway, thank you for your cooperation. We might contact you again, so please don't go anywhere far for the time being.

39
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,300
I don't...

40
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,560
even have a place to go.

41
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,590

42
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,220
What's the matter?

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,820
Unni! Unni, unni, unni!

44
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,670
Oh, you're here?

45
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,370
They discovered a dead body last night. Did you hear?

46
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,660
What?

47
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,290
You know the playground on the way to Jin Song

48
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,370
-  and the obscure grass thicket next to it? 
 - Yeah, yeah.

49
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,940
That's where a woman's body was discovered.

50
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,090
- That was in this neighborhood? 
 - You heard about it, too?

51
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,950
I heard some women whispering about it on my way out, but I thought it was just something on the news.

52
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,330
Oh my, oh my, oh my! How could this happen?

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,180
Unni, you didn't know?

54
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,140
- How do you not know? 
 - How would I know that?

55
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,400
Well, I heard that the person who found the body was...

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,250
Hello.

57
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,440
...him.

58
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,010
Right? Right?

59
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,790
They said that you were the one that found the body last night!

60
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,000
I went out to do a delivery and...

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,170
Oh! S-So, who was it? Is it someone we know?

62
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,170
- It's Kwon Bo Yeon. She was a daycare teacherâ€” 
 - Oh my!

63
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,460
So it was her!

64
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,100
She was the daycare's youngest teacher.

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,240
- Oh my, oh my, oh my! I think I know who you're talking about it! 
 - Right, right?

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,450
So, did you report it to the police?

67
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,680
Yeah, I told the police everything I knew.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,940
You did? Well, that's good.

69
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,430
The police will handle it from now on.

70
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,400
Stop fussing and go get dressed and get to work!

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,490
Come on.

72
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,080
 The women were all going crazy!

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,530
  So I wondered what was going on!

74
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,550
Mom, you don't have to worry too much about me.

75
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,390
Here. On those.

76
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,610
We can't give them old bags when we changed the sign.

77
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,820
Make sure you put the labels on all the bags by tomorrow.

78
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,130
But is it true that Dae Seong was the first one to discover the body?

79
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,730
Yes, I told you! How many more times do I have to tell you?

80
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,650
A dead body at the apartment complex...

81
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,700
Eww! I'm getting goosebumps.

82
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,430
Where, where, where?

83
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,550
How can we live here comfortably when it's gotten so scary?

84
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,100
I know.

85
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,630
- That's what I'm saying! 
 - The apartment value will probably go down.

86
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,020
The insides. Yup. Watch your fingers.

87
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,330
And then sprinkle some salt in it.

88
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,710
Oh, it'll be too salty if you use that much!

89
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,300
Take some out. Use a moderate amount.

90
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,660
You're doing well. If you just practice a little more, you'll get the hang of it quickly.

91
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,060
Keep practicing, okay?

92
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,460
Ahn Dae Seong! Do it properly!

93
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm going to deduct it from your paycheck! Every mistake is 10 cents.

94
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,770
The intern's salary isn't even that much...

95
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,250
Did you think making money off of strangers was that easy?

96
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,010
What do you mean strangers, Mother? How are we strangers?!

97
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,790
Oh, you're right! If we were complete strangers, it would have been so great!

98
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,000
What is this now?

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,050
Do it properly! Don't end up crying in a month because you got fired!

100
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,550
There isn't a single thing that you do right.

101
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,060

102
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,550
This is also dangerous for little kids. I can't sell it to you either.

103
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,860
What's wrong with your hand?

104
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,080
I was riding my kickboard, but I fell and scraped my hand.

105
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,740
Has the owner of those slippers still not shown up?

106
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,400
Oh...

107
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,470
I'm sure they'll show up.

108
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,990
You don't know who it belongs to?

109
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,910
I do. But where did you find this?

110
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,530
In the yard of the Catholic church. In front of the Virgin Mary statue.

111
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,200
- When? 
 - The day before yesterday.

112
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,520
Did you see anything else besides that?

113
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,700
- The officer lady.  
 - What?

114
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,330
I saw her before, and she was dressed up really nice and going somewhere.

115
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,490
 I joined DUO.

116
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,600
 I'm going to try and meet other guys.

117
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,420
Part-timer!

118
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,920
Watch my register for a while.

119
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,430
Don't sell any alcohol to Yool!

120
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,750
Go! If you try to buy alcohol again, I'll report it to the police.

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,170

122
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,930

123
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,290

124
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,750

125
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,510
"Please let me meet anyone!" Let's begin speed dating!

126
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,380
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

127
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,910
- What kind of work do you do? 
 - I'm a police officer.

128
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,260
Wow. That's so cool! I wouldn't have guessed from the way you look!

129
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,500
Oh, but it must be hard.

130
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,760
Yes. It's hard.

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,280
But how did you know that it was hard for me?

132
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,990
What is your hobby? Do you like handball by chance?

133
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,770
No. I don't really like handball.

134
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,590
I see. But since you never know, could you try throwing this?

135
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,540
Like this!

136
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,290
Do you have a good memory?

137
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,260
Do you know how many emergency exits there are here?

138
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,130
Do you remember what everyone you met coming in was wearing?

139
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,950
Ah... Why are you asking about that?

140
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,060
Oh. My ideal type is someone who remembers useless things.

141
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560

142
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,760
But this is really the end.

143
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,300
We might end up saying goodbye for good.

144
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,370
Are you that sad that this date is coming to an end?

145
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,850
There is someone I've been dating for 20 years now.

146
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,920
He was really fat when he was younger.

147
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,750
But in middle school, his fat all went to his height.

148
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,530
Anyway, he became really cool!

149
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,850
He was also really smart,

150
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,980
but he keeps failing his civil servant exam!

151
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,970
I was really going to tell him that it was okay not to take the exam.

152
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,530
 In the yard of the Catholic church. In front of the Virgin Mary statue.

153
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,460

154
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,160

155
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,200
Is that you, Dae Seong? What are you doing there?

156
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,160
- What is that? 
 - Trash. It's trash.

157
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,740
What brings you here?

158
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,540
I come here often, to pray.

159
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,090

160
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,000
You might not think it very important...

161
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,220
Yes.

162
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,900
...but I always pray for you.

163
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,650
 He didn't do anything wrong.

164
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,950
 It's all my fault.

165
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,200
 What about you? Are you hurt anywhere?

166
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,770
 Mister, it's not mom, but Iâ€” 
 - Then it's okay.

167
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,440
 Nothing's missing and no one's hurt.

168
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
 Then there's nothing wrong, right?

169
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,680
 Yes, that's right. N-N-Nothing happened.

170
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,850
 The floor is a mess. It looks like you need to clean up first.

171
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,740
 - That's not itâ€” 
 - Yes.

172
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,710
 I will clean it up. Thank you.

173
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,040
What do you pray for?

174
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,840
That Dae Seong...

175
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,330
- will stop being so nosy and please get a jobâ€” 
 - Amen!

176
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,850

177
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,350
- Detective Kang. 
 - Yes.

178
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,870
Get the lab result for this quick.

179
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,570
Ah, yes. I got it.

180
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,910

181
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,630
So many.

182
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,620
So damn many.

183
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,360

184
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,180
Why won't this even work?

185
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,380
Why don't you guys carry enough nude-colored ones here?

186
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,870
- There was only this one. 
 - It's because all the office workers near here wear coffee-colored ones.

187
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,470
People nowadays don't really wear nude-colored ones.

188
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,490
- I am getting looked down on for being old even at my regular store now. 
 - Pardon?

189
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,300
Do only young women's legs matter to you?

190
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,750
What about my legs? Are mine trotters?

191
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,790
Hey, go and see what's going on. Dae Seong seems flustered.

192
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,830
The customers are all waiting.

193
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,630
Uh, I don't want to. You go.

194
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,950
- Seriously, she's exactly like my mother-in-law.
 - Ah, go and see.

195
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,890
- Go. 
 - Unni.

196
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,420
I've been buying nude-colored stockings here for 20 years.

197
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,780
- Then how many is that? 
 - 1,040.

198
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,920
Really?

199
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,120
I did buy a lot.

200
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,790
See? I bought more than a thousand pairs, but you never keep them in stock!

201
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,320
Do you know how much I spent?

202
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,340
When you take into consideration the change in the price of the stocking, I think it's about â‚©1,696,000.

203
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,280
Really?

204
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,600
How do you calculate so fast?

205
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,430
Are you blinded by money or something?!

206
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,540
You don't take care of your regular customers and only stock the popular items.

207
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,010
Who do you think was instrumental in getting MS Mart into the marketplace at this apartment complex?

208
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,190
What good does it do if I am the only one being loyal?

209
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,530
This one comes in nude color, Ma'am.

210
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,790
President of the Women's Association.  Not Ma'am, but President of the Women's Association!

211
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,530
You want me to wear this?

212
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,760
If I stretch this to put it on, it becomes a net! A net!

213
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,140
Why are you silent? Say something.

214
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,350
Whether this stocking has a meaning for existence.

215
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,050
Say something! What is this?!

216
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,050
President! Oh, you were here.

217
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,960
- I looked for you for a long time. 
 - Why were you looking for me?

218
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,170
You need to give your confirmation in order for me to start selling.

219
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,470
You rule this neighborhood, after all.

220
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,370
You shouldn't do this when so many people are watching.

221
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,690
They'll all misunderstand that I'm on a power trip or something.

222
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,020
 Who would misunderstand, when everyone knows that you are a VIP here?

223
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,580
- Who? 
 - Goodness.

224
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,660
I will let it slide today because of our Mr. Yeong Choon,

225
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,620
but take good care of regular customers.

226
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,880
I am not doing this for no reason. I am doing it out of concern.

227
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,520
Of course, I know. I will see you at the marketplace.

228
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,750
Goodbye!

229
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,250
Our Mr. Yeong Choon?

230
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,500

231
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,670

232
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,860

233
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:38,050
 The person you are trying to reach is unable to answerâ€“

234
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,290
Just a moment, please. Officer Do!

235
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,490
It's Ahn Dae Seong, isn't it?

236
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,480
Yes, this is Officer Do Ah Hee at Nawoo Police Substation.

237
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,560
 I have information on Miss Kwon Bo Yeon's murder case.

238
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,830
Who is this?

239
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,940
 A g-g-good citizen.

240
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,700
Are you crazy?

241
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,990
If you make prank calls to the number used by actual good citizensâ€”

242
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,210
 It's not a prank call. I really wanted to tell you, Officer Do Ah Hee.

243
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,460
Oh, so you really want to die by my hands then.

244
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,760
 Kwon Bo Yeon was strangled to death, right?

245
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,380
 Death by strangulation.

246
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,150
 By something soft and elastic, like fabric.

247
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,090
 How do you know that?

248
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,760
 Who are you, you bastard?!

249
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,190
You will know when we meet.

250
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,670

251
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,700
Did I or did I not tell you that you can die if you joke with me?!

252
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,400
- What is this? 
 - The murder weapon.

253
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,280
It's probably not the one Kwon Bo Yeon wore since she always bought coffee-colored ones. This one is nude-colored.

254
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,810
Hey!

255
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,230
Did you tamper with the crime scene before the police got there?

256
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,630
No, no, I wouldn't.

257
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,360
Then, no way!

258
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,900
You didn't, right?

259
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,760
I'm an officer of the Republic of Korea.  I don't love you enough to hide a criminal.

260
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,940
- Not that much but you do love me then? 
 - Seriously...

261
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,820
I love you enough to serve spicy beef soup at your funeral to the guests if you die by my hands for joking with me.

262
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:02,150
I'm not joking. I picked that up in front of the Catholic church. I picked this up, too.

263
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,510
It's the same as the one from the crime scene, right?

264
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,490
Why did you go to the Catholic church all of a sudden?

265
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,990
One of our regular customers named Yool...  That's not what's important now.  You should hurry up and catch the culprit.

266
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,750
Why?

267
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,260
- Why? 
 - Who are you, to be concerned?

268
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,620
Whether I catch the culprit or not, why do you care?

269
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,930
Of course, I care.  I'm the police officer's boyfriend.

270
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,000
You wish!

271
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,660
It's good if I can help you catch the culprit, isn't it?

272
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,990
If you catch the culprit, you can get a promotion, too.  So, I am assisting you.

273
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,240
Then, your father might approve our relationship as well.

274
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,290
If you get his approval, then what?

275
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,480
Then... I'll be glad?

276
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,490
Ah, seriously!

277
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,240
I'll be happy!

278
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,920
What about marriage?

279
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,750
Ah Hee, marriage is still a bit...

280
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,800
Oppa, I want to get married.

281
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,700
I have a boyfriend I've been seeing for a long time, and I really want to have kids too.

282
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,330
Nowadays, everyone seems to be against having kids.

283
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,340
Who cares about everyone else?! If I want to have kids, I will.

284
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,170
Right? You should do what you want.

285
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,110
So, what you really want to do is to assist me?

286
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,310
Can you assist me all your life?

287
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,720
Supermarket owner's son. Police officer's boyfriend. How long are you going to live like that?

288
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,610
Can't you become somebody on your own?

289
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,080
She's crazy.

290
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,560
What is so special about this nude color? Ridiculous.

291
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,960
I fully stocked the high elasticity stockings, in nude color.  Let that rude customer know when she comes.

292
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,020
Okay.

293
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,790
 Goodbye. Please come again!

294
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,660
Leaving without telling anyone...

295
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,240
You have one month. If you can't increase the sales within a monthâ€”

296
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,160
I will get it back to what it was.

297
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,110
I can do it. Fighting.

298
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,860
Never mind.

299
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,040
It's time. Just go and turn on the music.

300
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,750
Yes, Boss.

301
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:25,460

302
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,510
 Oh, yay!

303
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,370
I better hurry.  I have a lot to buy today.

304
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,010
- Noona. Noona. 
 - Yes?

305
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,820
This.

306
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,250
- What is it? 
 - A customer ordered it but didn't pick it up.

307
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,740
I had specially gotten a really tasty part.

308
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,120
Really?

309
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,820

310
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,300
Hey, this is too expensive. Even at 50% off, it's still expensive.

311
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,050
It's okay.  I don't really like meat anyway.

312
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,200
How could a person not like meat?

313
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,890
That's right. She's been feeling weak lately. Let her eat it instead.

314
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,130
Noona. Hold on.

315
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,670
Hold on!

316
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,270

317
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,510
Aren't you shopping?

318
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,380
It's sale time for employees. Once a week, everything is 50% off.

319
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,050
- That much? 
 - Yes.

320
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,200

321
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,580

322
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,140

323
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,340
Is your job doable?

324
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,460
It's so-so.

325
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,500
You seem to be having a hard time.

326
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,680
You don't use the microphone either.

327
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,310
You're wrong.

328
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,190
I'm being cautious since I'm new to it.

329
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,270
But still, you should make some announcements and such.

330
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,430
Fish sales decreased quite a bit.

331
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,500
Who are you to be concerned?

332
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,850
Ah, the owner's son, is that it?

333
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,080
Why are you buying the stocking?

334
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,490
Because I need it.

335
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,770
Errand for your mother?

336
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,070
Your girlfriend?

337
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,890
With the 50% discount, it's â‚©24,150.

338
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,180
Thank you for your credit card.

339
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,600

340
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,940
Meonji!

341
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,550
Meonji!

342
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,160
I am sorry.

343
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,150
Thank you. Really, thank you.

344
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,480
Get home safely, please.

345
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,570
Thank you.

346
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,220
Bye. Don't run away from home again.

347
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,880
Excuse me.

348
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,950
Actually, my Meonji didn't run away from home.

349
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,420
If not, then?

350
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,880
My ex-boyfriend whom I broke up with...

351
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,080
Please go inside first.

352
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,240
A week ago, I told him that I wanted to break up with him.

353
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,100
My ex-boyfriend threatened me.

354
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,940
"I am not going to let you live happily by yourself."

355
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,890
But I didn't think anything would happen.

356
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,200
After the breakup, did he come to your house or follow you?

357
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,700
He came every day.

358
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,820
He sent tens of texts and emails.

359
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,280
Then, Meonji disappeared from home?

360
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,310
Yes. When I searched around, I found out that he had taken the card key that was inside a drawer.

361
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,660
Then, why didn't you report truthfully?

362
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,660
Even if I make a report, they would tell me to work things out on our own since we dated.

363
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,330
Who would say that to you?!

364
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,680
Which lowlife of a police officer?!

365
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,000
That bastard, I will arrest and send him to jail.

366
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,040
You heard of the stalking prevention law, right?

367
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,960
But they get released quickly, though.

368
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,320
No. He continuously stalked you.

369
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,640
He waited for you at your residence or broke in.

370
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,300
He used communication media.

371
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,420
He didn't use an object, but by removing your pet, tried to foster fear.  Enough conditions are met.

372
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,300
He can get up to 3 years behind bars.

373
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,070
We won't know that until we go to trial.

374
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,210
But we can get him punished.

375
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,230
So, don't worry about anything.

376
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,570
For now, please file a case report today.

377
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:52,280
Please give me text messages, and any photos or videos you have as evidence.

378
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,620

379
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,970
 Did you have dinner?

380
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,660
 Shall I buy you the braised crab that you like?

381
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,530
 Should we make a baby first?

382
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,590
 I am not confident, but I could make an effort to...

383
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,900
Where do you keep the soybean flour?

384
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,740
Soybean flour is over...

385
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,410
I will show you. Please follow me this way.

386
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,890
Who is the delivery person here?!

387
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,290
Why do we have so many rude customers nowadays?

388
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,480
We don't have a delivery person right now.  Can I help you?

389
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,180
Why do you keep delivering things I didn't even order?!

390
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,670
Excuse me?

391
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,370
We don't deliver if it's less than â‚©30,000.

392
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:08,580
This looks like it's only about â‚©10,000.

393
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,410
Then, who in the world did it?

394
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:15,240
Ah, really, why are you doing this to me?!

395
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,120
Miss, you shouldn't do this here.

396
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,610
It's not like we didn't give you what you paid for.

397
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,190
It's not like they are horrible things either.

398
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,160
Is it maybe someone who likes you that had left them there?

399
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,630
No?

400
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,620
- Look at this. 
 - Why?

401
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,460
Tampon. Tampon.

402
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,710
What is this?

403
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,120
Isn't this a s-s-stalker?  A stalker.

404
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,610
Wait, Miss.

405
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,650
Go over there! Take her with you!

406
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,870
Yool, you're here! Hello.

407
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,560
Thank you for letting her use it last time.

408
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,640
Oh, this!

409
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,720
My goodness. It must be nice since your dad's home so early!

410
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,220
Gosh, you even have new clothes!

411
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,080
It's so pretty!

412
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,700
Yool comes here often, right?

413
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,460
I heard that she tried to buy soju.

414
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,370
I didn't even tell her to, but she thought of me.

415
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,780
I'm sorry for bothering you.

416
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,680
What do you mean? We're neighbors!

417
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh! You must be shopping, so you can visit the hospital.

418
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,400
Ah, yes.

419
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,470
I heard Yool's mom got admitted. Is she really sick?

420
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,230
Yes, it seems that way.

421
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,260
But think of the kid

422
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,920
- and don't drink so much! 
 - Okay.

423
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,150
Would you like a bag?

424
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:38,070
It's 39,290 won.

425
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,860
Here you go!

426
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,120
One second, Yool.

427
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,840
I'll give you a little present!

428
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,120
Here's your present!

429
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,770
You gave this to me this last time and the time before that, too.

430
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,650
- Seo Yool. 
 - No, it's fine!

431
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,080
One second, Yool! Then how about...

432
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,200
Ta-da! This one! You always bought this when you came in with your mom.

433
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,810
Your mom is going to get better soon,

434
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,320
so don't worry and stay strong! Here!

435
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,120
Listen to your dad, too!

436
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,660
Thank you.

437
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,910
Take care.

438
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,200
Bye, Yool.

439
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,740
Did you report it to the police?

440
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,510
They said they'll try to catch the culprit,

441
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,900
but since our building is old, it doesn't have CCTV.

442
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,490
I'm scared to death.

443
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,550
Is there any place you can stay? Like a friend's house?

444
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,520
It's so scary, how can you go back home?

445
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,650
I was at my friend's house and came back yesterday.

446
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,370
But I can't keep staying there.

447
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,400

448
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,480
Those... When was that bag with the stockings hung on your door?

449
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,240
When I came back from my friend's house yesterday, they were on my door.

450
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,010
What is the order these were hung? And the dates?

451
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,740
Why? Dae Seong, do you know something?

452
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,990
Do you have anything missing at home? Like shoes maybe orâ€”

453
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,150
Anyway, Miss, it wasn't us, soâ€”

454
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,620
My membership information is here, right?

455
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,000
Please erase that for me.

456
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,070
Yes, I'll erase it for you.

457
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,540
You're Lee Kyeong Ah, right?

458
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,730
Don't I need to tell you the last four digits of my phone number for you to find it?

459
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,290
How do you know me?

460
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,330
He's always been smart.

461
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,590
He remembers everyone he sees after a couple of times!

462
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,110
Does he also do deliveries?

463
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,210
He does... do deliveries.

464
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,420
Miss, don't do this here.

465
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,910
Go talk to the police.

466
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,520
It could be one of our customers.

467
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,750
Our mart's customer, using our mart's bag, and all those things can all be purchased here.

468
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,600
Choco Pie, stockings, tampons, the customers who bought thoseâ€”

469
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,190
Why would we try and find something not even the police are searching for?

470
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,000
What if we go out of business from rumors that we doubt our customers?! What then?!

471
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,990
Miss, take those and throw them away or whatever you want with them.

472
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,320
Please leave, okay?

473
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,130
Mom, family. That's our mart's concept.

474
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,490
Family, my foot. Stop saying such nonsense.

475
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,030
Please leave, Miss. Please leave!

476
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,150
Leave, I said!

477
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,100
I don't need them!

478
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,890
This is all evidence, so I'll keep them for you! If you need them later onâ€”

479
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,400
Give it.

480
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:48,290
Is it okay to let her leave like that? What if she writes something bad online? That'd be bad.

481
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,480
Our sales are decreasing as it is. It's like pouring gas on a fire. That could put us out of business overnight.

482
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,180
Hey, hey. If you're so worried that the mart will go out of business,

483
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,510
then stop leaving your station and do your jobs properly!

484
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,920
Hey, Unnie. That sounds offensive.

485
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,790
Are you saying that sales have been going down because of me?

486
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,770
Wow, you shouldn't be like that.

487
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,570
Last month, even though you paid me two days late, I kept my mouth shut and didn't say anything.

488
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,150
I even paid late fees, which I've never done my whole life!

489
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,520
Wow. For the late water bill? The 420 won?

490
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,310
Oh, here you go. I'll even add interest to it.

491
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,450
What's the matter with you?!

492
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,320
There are rumors that you're cash-rich and that your son works for a large corporation.

493
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,420
But what? You paid late fees because you didn't have 420 won?

494
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,180
How do the facts that I'm rich and that I didn't get paid have anything to do with each other?

495
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,840
If you weren't going to pay me so I have to cover my living expenses myself,

496
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
why would I work here?!

497
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,380
Hey! They say that people who have more are worse!

498
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,870
I apologized to you already!

499
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,330
But what? You went on and on about overdue fees and how other marts are!

500
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,870
You didn't say one word? My foot!

501
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,170
Oh, Unnie. She's just worried about the mart.

502
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:08,760
Hey! What about you? You're so worried about our mart, but yet, when Sam Mart opened, you went for a job interview?

503
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,640
Boss, that was because she was worried about job stability here.

504
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,370
You don't know because we're in different positions!

505
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,450
Let's be honest!  Even if this mart goes out of business, you'll be rich if you sell this building for redevelopment!

506
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,840
What do you have to be worried about?!

507
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,920
Hey! Hey! You don't even know anything!

508
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,660
Hey, never mind. I'll hold my tongue.

509
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,100
Why? Why don't you keep talking?!

510
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,050
- Hey! 
 - Why don't you just say everything since you've started!

511
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,660
Never mind!

512
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,500
Ouch! Hey! Are you trying to start a fight?

513
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,700
- That's right! Go ahead and try! 
 - What's wrong with you guys?!

514
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,960
Mom, stop!

515
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,010
MOM! Stop! Let go!

516
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,570
MOM!

517
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,950
How dare you?!

518
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,290
Which bastard was it?!

519
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,020
Which bastard...

520
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,490
played a sick joke with our products?

521
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,660
Ah, damn!

522
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,990
- Let go. 
 - Hey, you let go!

523
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,470
Hey, fix the door. It might fall off!

524
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,900
If the door falls off, it'll be cooler and nice.

525
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,790
That's our food.

526
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,050
Hey, but will you actually be able to find who it was?

527
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,670
I'm sure there aren't many who bought all these at our mart.

528
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,850

529
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,060
Joo Seo Woon? What day?

530
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,460
- November 5th. 
 - November 5th?

531
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,020
November 5th.

532
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,140
Kim Yeon Seong.

533
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,580

534
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,710
Yoon Ra... Wow. Gong San's real name is Yoon Ra?

535
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,370

536
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,190

537
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,340

538
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,070
Why does everybody like Choco-pie so much?

539
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,010
Hey, this is a lot of people.

540
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,530
There are tons.

541
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,840
I see that.

542
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,290
But this one. It definitely seems perverted.

543
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,540
Condoms, stockings, and even that blood-stained tampon.

544
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:28,080
Hey! If we go to the police station, don't you think they can do a DNA test on that blood?

545
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,390
It wouldn't be their own blood.

546
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,970
That's true.

547
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,670
Then, from that list,

548
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,830
should we pick out the men? You know, in the past,

549
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,710
there was that man buying pads saying it was for his wife.

550
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,960
He got caught trying to be a Burberry Man in front of Nawoo Girl's High School. 
  (T/N: Burberry Man is slang for a flasher)

551
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,650
Looking at this, I can tell

552
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,850
it's the act of a pervert and stalker.

553
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,710
That means, there's no way it's a woman.

554
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,830
No, that's not certain, so we need to check diligently.

555
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,610
How will you do that?

556
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,680
First, we should ask if Lee Kyeong Ah knows any of these people from the list.

557
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,280
- And if she doesn't? 
 - The next time another bag is hung on her door,

558
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,830
we'll see if the person who bought those items is on this list.

559
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:10,470
It hasn't been long since we changed our bags, so if they use the new bag next time,

560
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,330
then we can narrow down the list by looking for people who bought the items after the bags were changed.

561
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,950
Wow, I knew it.

562
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,440
Oh, stop calling me a genius!

563
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,040
That's old news.

564
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,360
Hey, in middle school, do you remember what the homeroom teacher said to you?

565
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,460
"Curiosity will kill the cat."

566
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,580
"Being nosy might kill Ahn Dae Seong."

567
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,230
"Always remember! You have enough problems of your own."

568
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,300
You don't remember?

569
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,740
Ah, but seeing you now is reminding me of that time.

570
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:46,940
Until middle school, you were so nosy that you didn't know when you should intervene or butt out and cause problems.

571
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,760
And then suddenly one day, you changed and became really weird.

572
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,140
Like a screw came loose.

573
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,310
Back then, you were so weird that I couldn't even ask.

574
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,850
But what happened to you?

575
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,600
I guess I was like that since I didn't want to study.

576
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,130
Make sure to take all the trash you made. Don't try and sneakily leave them here.

577
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,070
You clean it up.

578
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:10,920
I'm leaving.

579
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,140

580
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,880
 Yes? Oh, Dae Seong?

581
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,520
 I'm still at the mart.

582
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,170
 Why? Do you want me to pick you up?

583
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,170
 Oh, okay. Then I'll wait for you at the mart. Come safely!

584
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,730
 Okay.

585
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,830
 My god.

586
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:10,100
 Gosh, let's see.

587
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,110
 Is that you, Dae Seong?

588
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,070
 Gosh.

589
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,830
 15,000 won.

590
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,360

591
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,960

His damn nosiness. I thought we could live well after covering it all up...

592
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,530

593
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,290
Welcome.

594
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,490

595
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,510
That'll be 16,790 won.

596
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,850
Do you need a bag?

597
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,040
Welcome!

598
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,880

599
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,770
- How old is your baby? 
  - 6 months old.

600
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,410

601
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,970
- Your total is 25,000 won (25 USD). Do you need a receipt? 
 - No.

602
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,300
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

603
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,960
What should we go eat?

604
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,310

605
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,380
Welcome

606
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,260

607
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,030

608
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,370
Welcome!

609
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,130

610
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,620

611
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,910
You bought peaches and a can opener yesterday, too.

612
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,930
Oh, I'm supposed to make house visits as part of volunteer work at the Catholic church, but I went to the hospital instead.

613
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,560
You know that the nunchuck grandfather is hospitalized from the shock.

614
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,530
He goes nuts for canned peaches!

615
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,010
He loves to eat them

616
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,000
and it made me want to try some, too.

617
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,710
Is he doing better? He must have been really shocked that day.

618
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,130
He's a faker. He doesn't get bothered by anything.

619
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,470
- Do you need a bag? 
 - Yeah.

620
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,120
Your total is 8,500 won.

621
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,310
Here you go.

622
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,080
Thank you. Get home safe.

623
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,310

624
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,420

625
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,420

626
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,810
â™ª  Even if you want to hold on to it, time  â™ª

627
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,350
â™ª  Won't wait  â™ª

628
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,460
I'll give one of these to you on the house, so try some. You know, don't you?

629
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:10,260
- Their stuff is fresh. 
  - But when will the redevelopment be decided? I haven't heard any updates.

630
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,970
What? Are you for redevelopment?!

631
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:18,030
Yeah. Isn't it a good thing for property values to go up?

632
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,520
Redevelopment would take at least 10 years.

633
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,580
In the meantime, we would be displaced,

634
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,660
and the neighborhood will become a mess with all kinds of people moving in.

635
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,730
What's so good about that?

636
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,320
You think so? But the apartments are getting so old.

637
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,250
Think about your age.

638
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,610
How many years have we lived here?

639
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,790
Would we be able to adapt if we moved somewhere else at this age?

640
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,340
What if we become ill in the meantime?

641
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,590
We might not be able to come back here but go straight to a nursing home if we're not careful!

642
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,980
You're right.

643
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,290
Isn't that right?

644
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,160
You are right, of course.

645
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:00,430
Only our kids benefit from property values going up. It's more comfortable for us to stay here.

646
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:04,270
That's true. I'll enjoy eating this!

647
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:16,930
â™ª Waiving your hand, goodbye â™ª

648
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,870
â™ª  Que Sera, Sera  â™ª

649
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,940
 It's busy at the store! Where did you go?

650
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,350
To make a delivery.

651
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,330
 What delivery do you have to make right now?

652
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,170
Not one of ours. A delivery for Sam Mart.

653
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,550
 Why would you do it?

654
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,850
I signed up to be a delivery driver.

655
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,020
 What?

656
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,740
Through a mart delivery app. Don't you know about that?

657
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,940
When I thought about it,

658
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:06,710
speedy delivery, early morning delivery, missile delivery, spaceship delivery, Bae Mart.

659
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:11,040
What beats all of those things? Instant delivery.

660
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,380
At Home!

661
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,950
At Home has its own drivers.

662
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,770
I said I signed up as a driver! What aren't you understanding?

663
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,250
 What?

664
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,600
- That's your delivery! 
  - Thank you!

665
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,570
I can make money for deliveries and check out the competitors, too.

666
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm killing two birds with one stone.

667
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,170
Wow. Mom, you really...

668
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,120
Hey! You should do some research, too!

669
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,570
I could fire you and put in a self-checkout!

670
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,660

671
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,360
Thank you.

672
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,500

673
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:22,420
â™«  The time that you've held on to so tightly  â™«

674
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:30,100
Ugh, seriously!
 â™«  It doesn't wait for you   â™«

675
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,150
â™«   The love that you've been waiting for   â™«

676
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:43,380
â™«  Is still taking its sweet time  â™«

677
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:50,850
â™«   Everything in the world   â™«

678
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:57,440
â™«  Has a path only it knows  â™«

679
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,750
â™«  Accepting things as they are  â™«

680
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:11,640
â™«  Maybe a little easier  â™«

681
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,630
Delivery!

682
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,440
Hello.

683
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,410
Thank you!

684
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,620
They still haven't caught the culprit in that daycare school teacher case?

685
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,590
It looks that way. I'm scared out of my mind every time I go home.

686
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,340
We should be careful.

687
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,390
That's why I pick my daughter up every time from the academy.

688
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,260
You can't go around alone anymore.

689
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,690
I hope they catch the culprit soon.

690
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,600

Hello.

691
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,630
I haven't seen the boss all day.

692
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,330
Nothing's going on, right?

693
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,070
She's at home...

694
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,250
She went out to do some research on the competitors.

695
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,900
Oh, I see!

696
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,680
Of course.

697
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,570
She does work really hard.

698
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,240
What is it?

699
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,800
I think we need to check on the super glue stock.

700
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,640
Just a second.

701
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,230
It looks like we need to order more.

702
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,410
What? Really?

703
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,410
Then can you check and see if we need to restock anything else?

704
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,940
Sure.

705
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,960

706
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,420

707
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,730
 This isn't something that we sell.

708
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,430

709
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:38,930

710
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,480
Boss told me to help you clean your room when there were no customers in the store.

711
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,250
She said she would pay me extra.

712
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,510
- My mom? 
 - She said she would deduct it from your paycheck. 10,000 won per hour.

713
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,840
If it's okay, I'll head up there now.

714
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,010
Wait. Why would she do whatever she wants with my paycheck?

715
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:56,230
Should I do it or not?

716
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,830
Go ahead.

717
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,990
- Thank you. Have a good day! 
 - Thank you.

718
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,570
Oh my goodness. What kind of woman is that strong?

719
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,390
How amazing!

720
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,880

721
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,820

722
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,590

723
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:35,690
What is this?

724
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,010
And they said they had nowhere to go.

725
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,590
It's a relief.

726
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:49,070
What kind of perverted bastard opens up other people's packages?

727
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,610
Wow, this works wonders.

728
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,760
If you take it, your pee comes out yellow.

729
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,560
Here, try some. Try it.

730
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,860
Have you seen any other place sell these besides us?

731
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,730
These?

732
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:32,040
We exclusively sold these in this area.

733
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,320
Exclusively? Why?

734
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,120
Hey, it's a scam.

735
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,260
The director of this company asked your dad to make a, what's it called, CM song?

736
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,820
While asking him to make the CM song, he said all kinds of things to persuade him,

737
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,300
so he signed a bulk contract with your dad.

738
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,640
Hey, even your mom only found out when the boxes came in.

739
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,230

740
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,720

741
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,550

742
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,060

743
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,320

744
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,860
What's with the trespassing homes?

745
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,530

746
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,980
He's weird but honest.

747
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:18,820
I think I've seen him before.

748
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,230
Me too. Where have I seen him?

749
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,990

750
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,410
His eyes look like...

751
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:54,570
His eyes look like?

752
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,890
It's that grandpa.

753
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,040
Grandpa?

754
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,270
That crazy grandpa. The one who twirls around those nunchucks.

755
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,980
You bastard! What kind of bastard are you?

756
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,660
What kind of bastard are you that you come to a house where a woman lives alone?!

757
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,610
You bastard!

758
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,580
Are you at the studio?

759
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,690
  Yes, talk.

760
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:46,080
Which hospital was the nunchuck grandpa admitted to? I want to visit him.

761
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,790
 Am I your information call center?

762
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,220
Are you really just visiting him?

763
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,610
  We found the body together, and I'm just worried about him, that's all.

764
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,160
Okay, then. See you at the entrance of Woon Haeng Hospital.

765
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,530
Right now... is too late.

766
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,330
  What do you mean late? That grandpa is a faker!

767
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,210
  I went to get a witness statement from him yesterday,

768
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:10,160
 but he was speaking nonsense, so I was meaning to drop by again.

769
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,790
Still, do you really need to go do that right...

770
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,310
  What are you hiding from me?

771
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:18,320
Don't even think of going alone. Get here quick.

772
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,870
- You bastard! 
 - Wait!

773
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:29,010
- Why do you have so much to say?! 
 - I'm Geumseong!

774
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:31,630
- Geumseong Real Estate. 
 - What?

775
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,350
Real estate?

776
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,720
Really, I'm not a stalker.

777
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,760
Why would you, Yool's dad, break into someone's house?

778
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,840
I-I do real estate. You know that!

779
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,390
Is that unit on the market?

780
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:52,950
No, t-the owner is in America and asked me to take care of their place.

781
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,560
The people from the unit below kept reporting there was a water leak.

782
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,610
But you must have the number of the new residents.

783
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:03,940
Y-Yes, exactly. Here. It's been so hard to get a hold of the new residents.

784
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:09,660
The phone is off too, and here are the texts.

785
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,430
The texts between me and the unit's owner.

786
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:30,120
But is that the apartment of the lady who's claiming is being stalked?

787
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,830
- Did I hurt you anywhere? 
 - I'm fine.

788
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:37,850
- You sure you don't need to go to the hospital? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

789
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:46,650
Actually, would you go in with me?

790
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:52,180
What? Me? W-Why?

791
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,950
If they're at home and not answering

792
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:59,950
and I go in suddenly by myself, I could get misunderstood like you did earlier.

793
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:05,040
I mean, even if I went in...

794
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,350
- I think it'll still be a problem. 
 - I'm really sorry.

795
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:11,360
But they don't even read their messages.

796
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,410
Please help me just once.

797
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:27,380
Look at this. I told you he's a faker.

798
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:36,070
Excuse me. Where did this person go?

799
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,630
He was just there.

800
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,210
- But who are you? 
 - I'm Officer Do Ah Hee from Nawoo Police Station.

801
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,810
Does he leave like this all the time?

802
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,660
Isn't this an insurance scam?

803
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,170
Yesterday, he was here at this time.

804
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:53,140
Wait, at least I think he was.

805
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,600
What about his guardian or family?

806
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,350
Oh, this ward is under the caretaker system.

807
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:00,300
-  No one has come by. 
 - This person doesn't have dementia, right?

808
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,000
What is your relationship with the patient?

809
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,470
I can't tell you confidential medical information without consent.

810
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,040
I'm a police officer. You can tell me.

811
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,060

812
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:15,230
52? Is this right? He's 52?

813
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,100
Yes.

814
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,910
What? With that face?

815
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:24,200
He told me he was 82!

816
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,640
I even saw his ID.

817
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,700
What's with trespassing homes?

818
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,380

819
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,760
Something feels really strange.

820
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,360
Right. Why did he lie about his age?

821
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,250
What happened there?

822
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,220
I was dealing with a drunk earlier.

823
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,420
That upsets me.

824
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,130
Wait here for a sec.

825
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,450
I'll go get some band-aids.

826
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,120
Excuse me!  You dropped...

827
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,780
Nunchuck grandpa!

828
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,120
Ah Hee, catch him!

829
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:49,440
Who are you?

830
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:35,950
Just yesterday,

831
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,890
she was still alive.

832
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:46,700

833
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:54,390
Ah Hee!!

834
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:02,000

835
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:11,920

836
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:19,430
â™«  I picked up the courage to take a look  â™«

837
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:22,730
 There must be an accomplice.

838
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,900
 Is there someone you're suspicious of?

839
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,030
  Fish. What's his deal?

840
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:30,200
  We need something more definitive.

841
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,150
 The culprit might be one of the mart workers.

842
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:37,610
  - Oppa! 
 - Even the murder weapons can be bought at our mart.

843
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:40,100
 The new suspect is Dae Seong,

844
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,660
 did you know that?

845
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,180
 What did we do wrong?

846
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:51,190
 I think I'll have to prove that the case has nothing to do with the mart.

847
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:53,420
  Did you get caught?

848
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,360
 I think I found evidence.

849
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:01,050
â™«  Stop pretending you don't know  â™«
