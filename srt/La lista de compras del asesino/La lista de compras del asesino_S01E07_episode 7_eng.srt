1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,980

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,460

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,620

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,280

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,150

6
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,110

7
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,560

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,690

9
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,130
Ring me up!

10
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,910
We're closed for the day.

11
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,720
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,810
There's still an hour left.

13
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,840
It's okay, you can check out. He's not allowed to, though.

14
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,620
Give it here.

15
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,700
- Hey! 
 - Hey?

16
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,450
I'll come by next time.

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,770
Okay, then. That's for Yool, right?

18
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,790
Yool bought the same things earlier and left them behind after paying.

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,340
Really? Then I should take—

20
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,710
Don't worry. Dae Seong went to give them to her.

21
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,620
She's at the real estate office, right?

22
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,150
Yes.

23
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,020
- But... 
 - Yes?

24
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,140
I'd like it if your son wasn't so friendly with Yool.

25
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,920
May I ask why?

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,750
It's a dangerous world, and she's a young girl, so I'm worried...

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,470
Did you hear?

28
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,850
This man's son got taken to the police station.

29
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,550
I'm the one who saw him!

30
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,350
He pushed the President of the Women's Association off the fourth floor.

31
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,690
I'm on my way home from the station after giving my witness statement.

32
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,330
You saw him do what?!

33
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,690
Like this, with a glue gun,

34
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,070
he went like this to her.

35
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,020
I can tell without seeing it in person.

36
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,530
Come on!

37
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,610
Look here. Look here.

38
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,770
His son cracked my head, and I got hurt.

39
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,190
I thought I was going to die back then!

40
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,390
Get out. Before I break your head again, get out.

41
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,590
Break it! Break it! There's even a witness here.

42
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,400
The father and son can hold hands and go to jail together.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,980
Wait a minute. You just said your son's on his way to see Yool.

44
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,660
- Are you sure he only went to deliver? 
 - Of course.

45
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,890
Don't believe what this man says.

46
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,650
Yool's father!

47
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,800
Damn it. Aren't you leaving?

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Get out.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,220
Mister, I know you didn't do it.

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,990
How? How do you know?

51
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,720
Did you really see something that day?

52
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,020
Yool, it's okay. Nothing's going to happen.

53
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,330
So tell me everything.

54
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,910
Tell you what?

55
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,780
These wounds.

56
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,860
Did your dad do it?

57
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,230
What are you doing with my child?

58
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,990
I'm warning you. Don't approach my daughter again.

59
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,490
Don't go to the mart again either.

60
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,030
- Why not? 
 - You're showing too much interest in my daughter!

61
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,900
- With what purpose— 
 - If I show interest in Yool, you're scared you'll get caught abusing her.

62
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,560
- No, my dad isn't like that! 
 - Abuse?

63
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,290
Yool, what's he talking about? Are you hurt?

64
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,280
Dad, let's go home.

65
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,830
Yool, you don't need to be scared. You can be protected.

66
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,810
If you want, you can come with me instead of your dad.

67
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,060
You know that police lady, right? You can stay away from your dad

68
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,480
so he never hurts you again.

69
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,690
- What are you— 
 - What's going on?

70
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,850
Huh?

71
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,300
What's wrong?

72
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,670
Geum Seong, what's wrong? Did you two fight?

73
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,240
I think her dad is abusing her.

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,540
But she can't tell the truth.

75
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,100
What?

76
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,590
Seo Yool.

77
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,260
Let's go. Let's go.

78
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,980
You little—!

79
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,650
You bastard!

80
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,220
Hey, you scammer bastard.

81
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,200
You live off your wife!

82
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,990
Hey, punk! You said you'd give me a commercial song if I sold toys exclusively!

83
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,860
It's not enough to trample on my musical emotions,

84
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,720
you're trying to make my son a murderer!

85
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,380
Try? I only told the truth!

86
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,920
I went to the police station and told them exactly what I saw!

87
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,510
Of course, you should go to the police station.

88
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,510
You're the culprit, right?

89
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,730
How did you get out? Do you have a cousin who works there?!

90
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,410
I got out because your son is the culprit! You freeloader punk!

91
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,050
What? Freeloader?!

92
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,810
You little—

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,090
You bastard! Die, you bastard!

94
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,650
Punk!

95
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,550
With this, I'll stab you!

96
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,120
I'll stab...

97
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,880
My "jewels"!

98
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,130
Damn it.

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,940
Come on.

100
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,760
I'll kill you!

101
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,460
Move!

102
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,900
That bastard!

103
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,090
Honey!

104
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,900
Oh my! What's wrong?

105
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,760
Did that jerk do this to you?

106
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,680
How could he do this to you? All you have is your face!

107
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,670
- That jerk! 
 - Mom!

108
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,470
Hey.

109
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,260
Why is my face the only thing I have?  I have you, Honey.

110
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,280
What is this, really!

111
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,430
Sit down, sit down.

112
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,750
Why did you all come in at once? Did something happen?

113
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,320
What's wrong with you?

114
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,680
Well, I, uh—

115
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,400
- Who are you? 
 - She... She...

116
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,790
- We're in the middle of conducting an operation. 
 - Conducting an operation.

117
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,390
- Fish? 
 - Fish.

118
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,900
So damn pretty...

119
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,060
We're on our way from the station.

120
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,950
The station—

121
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,440
The station?

122
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,560
We caught Vegetables' stalker.

123
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,090
 How could he do this to your face?

124
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,850
 Not his face, not his face!

125
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,710
Yes, I understand.

126
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,850
I'm not sure if I should say I'm relieved.

127
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,990
I don't think your ex-husband is the culprit.

128
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,500
It's confirmed that he was in the Philippines at the time, too.

129
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,300
But when you lived together, was there anything suspicious before or after the murder?

130
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,190
He was only like that to me. Outside, people said he was a great person.

131
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,020
Jerks like this are always like that.

132
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,650
Unnie, you should have asked me for help.

133
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,090
So what are you going to do now?

134
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,620
I contacted my mom.

135
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,700
I really didn't want to tell her.

136
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,850
For the time being, I'm going to go to my family home.

137
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,830

138
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,630
Hello?

139
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,310
Munji, again?!

140
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,910
- Come on, seriously? 
 - Are you okay?

141
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,420
Let me see your hand.

142
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,380
What are you doing? Do you feel bad for suspecting me?

143
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,530
No. Why would I?

144
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,010
You suspected me! In the morning in your room, you asked me if I did it.

145
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,390
That's because... I was still half asleep.

146
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,250
Should you of all people have not suspected me?

147
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,130
Even if the police suspected you, I never have! How could you!

148
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,640
Forget it.

149
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,680
Thanks to you, we saved Vegetables from getting hurt,

150
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,580
and that ex-husband punk of hers will get punished now.

151
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,730
I'm really disappointed in you.

152
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,980
I told you I didn't. I never thought it was you.

153
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,730
Now you say it? Now that everything's come to light?

154
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,910
No! Since before!

155
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,060
- Rather than you, I was thinking Gong San was— 
 - Don't be ridiculous!

156
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,380
She killed someone?!

157
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,430
Even if being suspected has been hard on you, let's not go that far.

158
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,640
She's very suspicious. And there's a motive, too.

159
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,340
Earlier, she ran into a guy and... Wake up!

160
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,630
We shouldn't be standing here like this.

161
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,050

162
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,710
Yool.

163
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,790
What?

164
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,000
Come sit down.

165
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,210
What did you talk to the mart guy about earlier?

166
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,900
I already know everything.

167
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,580
I'm asking to confirm if you're lying, not because I don't know.

168
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,980
I told you not to do that.

169
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,400
Sorry...

170
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,850
What did you talk about?

171
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,410
If you gave me my scars.

172
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,080
So what did you say?

173
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,430
I said they're not. You heard it earlier.

174
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,200
Where are we going?

175
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,430
Not us, I...

176
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,450
Until I call you, don't leave the house and stay out of trouble.

177
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,800
Where are you going?

178
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,820
To Mom.

179
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,660
To Mom?

180
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,290
Do you want to go, too?

181
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,860
Yes.

182
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,310
Where's Mom's phone?

183
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,610
The one you wore around your neck?

184
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,180
I lost it...

185
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,050
Stand up.

186
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,230
- I'm sorry. 
 - Get up!

187
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,260
This is why I can't take you to Mom.

188
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,170
You have no right to see her.

189
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,880
You meet with people I tell you to stay away from, lose precious things, and lie.

190
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,270
- Do you know what kind of a kid you are? 
 - A useless and a horrible one.

191
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,180
What did I tell you was the reason that Mom was sick and can't live with us?

192
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,720
Because of me. Because I don't listen.

193
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,650

194
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,330
♫  It's so fun being with you, our, our MS  ♫

195
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,100
What is she doing right now?

196
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,770
♫  MS is so reliable. Our family, MS  ♫

197
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,290
♫  MS Mart that brings a flowery smile  ♫

198
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,090
♫  MS Mart  ♫

199
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,710
♫  It's so fun being with you, our, our MS  ♫

200
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,130
I think she's sticking up flyers. It has a picture on it, too.

201
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,120
♫  MS Mart is always happy, happy  ♫

202
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,070

Keep your eyes open for her.

203
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,560

- See you inside. 
 - Okay.

204
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,400
♫  Everyday my heart pounds, let's do it together, MS Mart  ♫

205
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,680
It looks like someone lost a dog. The reward is 1,000,000 won.

206
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,190
She's into anything that pays.

207
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,800
No, Mom. If it was for money, she wouldn't stick that up here.

208
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,280
That's true! She would pull off the flyers

209
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,240
and go look for it by herself!

210
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,070
 - What are you doing? What?! 
 - Let's go.

211
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,640
That's it. The election for the President of the Women's Association.

212
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,770
That's right! That's it!

213
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,580
Boss, keep a lookout for the dog on your deliveries, too!

214
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,170
Is it someone you know?

215
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,070
No, well...

216
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,280
The reward is 1,000,000 won.

217
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,230
It's not easy to come by that kind of money.

218
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,820
Yeah. Helping a stranger find a lost dog...

219
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,440
You'll win the neighbors over.

220
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,910
They already like me!

221
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,080
- Hey! Come on! 
 - Come here.

222
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,700
Do we have to go this far?

223
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,720
I really don't think it's Gong San.

224
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,070
We need to make sure.

225
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,100
What's this? Why is she carrying this around?

226
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Isn't there anything more suspicious than that?!

227
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,160
- Like a weapon or something! 
 - I don't see anything!

228
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,320
What's this?

229
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,930
She's coming. She's coming! What are you doing?!

230
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,720
Hey! Seriously.

231
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,180
- Gong San. 
 - What?

232
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,850
Aren't you hungry? Do you want me to get you some red-bean buns?

233
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,020
 Why are you being strange?

234
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,680
I just ate samgyeopsal.

235
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,990
Hey! What are you doing?!

236
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,340
President Jang, when are you coming by to restock?

237
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,500
You need to hurry.

238
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,400
Yeah. Then see you soon.

239
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,550
I don't think I can do this.

240
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,660
I... pushed myself to come every day,

241
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,530
but now that I've started, I don't think I can handle the work.

242
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,470
My body can't handle it.

243
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,340
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

244
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,190
Where?

245
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,340
I have bodyaches.

246
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,750
Let me take the day off. Is that okay?

247
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,410
There aren't any customers anyway!

248
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,880
Okay. Do that then.

249
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,810
Thanks. Work hard.

250
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,090
Oh! I'm sorry.

251
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,180
It's okay.

252
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,330
Oh, I ruined your coat.

253
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,760
I know, right?

254
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,830
First, let's swap with mine.

255
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,280
If you give me your contact info, I'll dry clean your coat and bring it to you.

256
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
Never mind the coat.

257
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,370
Where's Munji?

258
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,520
Excuse me? Munji?

259
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,830
The dog.

260
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:40,080
The Pomeranian, Munji. Your ex-girlfriend Park So Hee's pet dog.

261
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,290
Oh, Munji. That's right! The dog's name was Munji.

262
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,560
But why are you asking me about someone else's dog?

263
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,960
I came knowing that you took it.

264
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,580
Then go search my house!

265
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,960
Come on! Annoying me first thing in the morning!

266
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,250
Our country's police officers have it so easy!

267
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,410
Looking for a mere dog.

268
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,380
It hasn't been long since a murder happened in this neighborhood.

269
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,100
Well, what do I expect from a female cop?

270
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,530
Mr. Jo Jun Ho, you're under arrest for special theft.

271
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,780
You have the right to an attorney and a chance to defend yourself.

272
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,520
Where is Munji? She wasn't at your house.

273
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,130
My arm! I hurt it just yesterday!

274
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,970
You won't die. Where's Munji?

275
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,460
I don't know!

276
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,480
Sir, things will only get better for you if you help us find Munji.

277
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,620
I really don't know!

278
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,100
I heard that my girlfriend...

279
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,260
reported to you that I kidnapped Munji. Do you have proof?

280
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,440
If you broke up, she's your ex now.

281
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,600
But why are you speaking informally to me?

282
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,460
Can a civil servant speak informally to a civilian?

283
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:58,050
Well, I have a habit of talking to myself.

284
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,290
What do people know about our relationship that they keep butting in?

285
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,870
We haven't broken up yet. We just fought.

286
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:10,290
And about Munji, she keeps escaping because my girlfriend keeps forgetting to lock the door properly.

287
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,950
I told her so many times to be careful.

288
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,690
Here is the house where your ex-girlfriend and Munji lived.

289
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,700
And here...

290
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,300
here...

291
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,010
here...

292
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:42,440
and finally, here are the places where Munji was found.

293
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,530
It's all recorded.

294
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,810
Sir, you held Munji by the neck like this

295
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,830
and walked by very suspiciously.

296
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,090
So what? What do you want me to do? I'll just pay the fine.

297
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,550
Where is Munji?!

298
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,730
I really don't know!

299
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,070
Why did the CCTV not catch me getting robbed?!

300
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,840
I just missed Munji,

301
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,240
and I was going to meet So Hee and return her safely.

302
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,190
But some crazy lady pushed me...

303
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,360
 Seriously...

304
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,930
So I lost Munji!

305
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,700
It's strange...

306
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,050
It's strange no matter how I look at it.

307
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,640
What is?

308
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,500
Oh. Take a look at this.

309
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,570
This?

310
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,070
Hm?

311
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,010
That's also very strange,

312
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,730
but not that, this.

313
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,070
Even the daycare teacher bought cosmetics from Gong San.

314
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,320
What about Kyeong Ah?

315
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,760
She didn't...

316
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,100
But it's a bit vague to call this evidence.

317
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,780
Especially this part.

318
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,990
Look at this mark.

319
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,280
Here.

320
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,830
- What is this? 
 - Exactly.

321
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,450
Wait. Let's check.

322
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,960

323
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,510

324
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,580

325
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,010
They're all people who live alone.

326
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,230
- How do you know that? 
 - They don't come by often and don't buy a lot.

327
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,150
And it takes them forever to rack up points.

328
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:47,120
They don't buy anything in bulk, just individual servings.

329
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,640
And this person and this person are regulars.

330
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,070
I'm sure they live alone.

331
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,730
But why is there a star symbol next to the people living alone?

332
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,810
Exactly. And next to this name, there are two stars.

333
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,020
You're right.

334
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,900
This won't do. I should go make a visit to that person.

335
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,680
What are you going to say?

336
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,210
Whatever her motive, there are two stars.

337
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,260
Then Gong Sang must have done something there, whatever it was.

338
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,060
If I go and ask questions, something's bound to come out.

339
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,020
I'll be back.

340
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,880
Be safe!

341
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,450
Munji. Munji. Where are you?

342
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,170
Munji, my goodness. Where on earth did she go?

343
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,690
Oh my.

344
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,820
It's here. It's this alley.

345
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,540
Munji!

346
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,030
Munji!

347
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,300
Munji, Munji, Munji, Munji!

348
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,200
Munji! Munji, Munji, Munji!

349
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
Munji. Munji! Where are you?

350
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,020
Oh!

351
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,310

352
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,110
Where on earth did she go?

353
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,370
Hey!

354
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,290
- Did you follow me? 
 - Huh?

355
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,940
Why?

356
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,300
You've been strange since yesterday!

357
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,890
Oh!

358
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,740
I was just looking for her. The reward is 3 month's worth of rent.

359
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,870
Stop the nonsense and give her to me!

360
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,730
Why? I found her!

361
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,360
Come on! Munji! Munji!

362
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,380
Damn you!

363
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,650
Gong San, where are you going?!

364
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,700
Get away from me!

365
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,520

366
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,820
Are you the one who called me? Have you seen my dog?

367
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,740
Well... that is... It's not that. I...

368
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,060
Um, the thing is... you know MS Mart?

369
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,470
Gong San! Why are you doing that?

370
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,940
- Oh, Munji! 
 - Here's Munji!

371
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,040
- Oh! Are you okay? 
 -   Why did you come here?!

372
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,940
Thank you. Thank you so much!

373
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,970
I found her first!

374
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,630
Thank you. If you give me your account number, I'll deposit the reward.

375
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,160
- Do you have something to write on? Modu Bank— 
 - What are you talking about?!

376
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,780
It's bad enough she was agonizing over the dog being lost.

377
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,010
Never mind. I found her, so go on in. Hurry.

378
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,710
- That bastard might come back, so stay safe. You reported him, right? 
 -  What happened?

379
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,150
Thank you.

380
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,390
Hurry up and go home.

381
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,270
But what brought you...

382
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,130
Oh, that's...

383
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,230
I don't think now's the time to talk.

384
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,340
I'll come back another time. I'm so glad you found your dog.

385
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,620
I'm so happy for you.

386
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,920
What are you doing here, Boss?

387
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,220
Well, that is... to find the dog, I had to know...

388
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,120
- more about the dog, so I wanted to ask. 
 - That's right.

389
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,060
Thank you, everyone.

390
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,480
Joon Ho went to the police station.

391
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,890
He said he's going to report you.

392
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,680
For hitting him and kidnapping Munji. Sorry for causing trouble.

393
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,360
Tell him to go ahead! I'm so sure Do Ra Hee will believe him!

394
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,150
What?

395
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:39,420
My ex. Stalking and threatening and taking the dog repeatedly.

396
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,910
Then the guy you hit yesterday was...

397
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,380
You saw that, too?!

398
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,490
Seriously, what's with you?!

399
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,040
Were you told to keep an eye on me because I took the day off of work?

400
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,200
Come on! I didn't do that!

401
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,230
Also, the person you introduced me to before...

402
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,350
- Eun Young? 
 - Yes. She wants to have dinner together to say thank you.

403
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,070
I heard you took her home after waiting the day she had to work late.

404
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,630
It was nothing!

405
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:15,100
Because I did that, I ended up seeing something so horrible!

406
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,090
- What? 
 - Oh, you don't need to know. Go on in.

407
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,550
Go in.

408
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,540
If the police ask you for a witness, let me know.

409
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,850
Thank you. Bye.

410
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,400
- Stay safe, Munji. 
 - Munji, bye!

411
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,560
What? Wait for me!

412
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,850
So...

413
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,330
putting a star next to people who live alone is because—

414
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,970
That's part of customer service. Taking care of them.

415
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,920
I see...

416
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,460
But how could you?

417
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,180
About what?

418
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,850
You put a star next to Kwon Bo Yeon's name, too.

419
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,440
If you were that concerned about her, how could you go around trying to

420
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,600
buy her place for cheap?!

421
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,570
Didn't you feel sorry?

422
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,260
The house has nothing to do with what happened!

423
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,580
The murderer is at fault.

424
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,290
That's why I tried to take care of the women who lived alone.

425
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,310
So that bad things wouldn't happen.

426
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,360
Yes, yes. I know.

427
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,020
Wait.

428
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,750
I'm getting a strange sense while answering your questions.

429
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,010
What's wrong?

430
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,700
How did you know I put a star next to names in my customers' notebook?

431
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,630
You've been following me around all of yesterday and today!

432
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,770
The fact that I tried to make a deal at the real estate office, how did the two of you know?

433
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,290
Did you suspect me of being the criminal?

434
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,490
-  No! 
 - No, we didn't!

435
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,640
- Oh, hey! 
 - Wow, you're going to hurt an innocent person!

436
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,910
Me?

437
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,930
My god, really! If you're going to suspect someone, do it properly.

438
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,740
You're so off the mark, it's no good to anyone!

439
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,000
If you want to hurry and catch the criminal, look for the drain unclogger first.

440
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,640
- Why? 
 - The one that found the President of the Women's Association fallen

441
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,950
was me.

442
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,840
But... she smelled of that.

443
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,120
The smell of bleach with a little scent of a pine tree.

444
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,320
- Quick.. 
 - Quick Unclogger. 
 - Quick Unclogger!

445
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,600
You know that one is the most unpopular, right? Because it's too strong.

446
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,590

447
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,030
  No, it wasn't chlorine gas poisoning.

448
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,670
But there were no signs of struggle or remaining DNA evidence,

449
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,170
so they think she quickly lost consciousness or was tied up.

450
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,750
And looking at the irregular bruises all over her body,

451
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,720
they think she fell while escaping after her eyes became like that.

452
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,350
Then does that mean she was trapped in such an enclosed space that the smell stayed on her?

453
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,510
Possibly.

454
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,180
Then, none of the mart's employees is the criminal.

455
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:28,790
I thought that the ex-boyfriend who kidnapped Munji could be the criminal,

456
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,920
but his alibi is airtight.

457
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,350
Are we doing it right?

458
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,220
I don't know.

459
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,290
The misunderstandings between the people we were suspicious of have been resolved.

460
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,960
But just because the misunderstandings have been resolved, doesn't confirm they're not the criminal.

461
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,500
We need to go over it again from the beginning.

462
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,930
- About what? 
 - What was the reason we started suspecting the mart's employees?

463
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:55,010
Because they were the people that bought the items that were dropped at the crime scene or the murder weapon.

464
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,530
That's right.

465
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,670
If we add the glue gun and quick unclogger to our list, would the roster change?

466
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,360
But the President of the Women's Association is a bit different than the two previous victims.

467
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,780
The investigation team thinks that it's not part of the serial killings.

468
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,460
Grab it!

469
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,330
Yes, yeah!

470
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,420

471
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,050
Not that one! Please give it back.

472
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,350
Is this time for you to be like this?

473
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,430
I know. I got it, so give me that toy.

474
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,630
Oh, why? What are you going to use this for? Are you going to boil it into some soup and eat it?

475
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,330
I want to give it to Yool as a gift.

476
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,080
What? No way. It's mine. Mine!

477
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,990
No, hurry and give it!

478
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,810
- Give it! 
 - Try and catch me!

479
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,750
Give it back!

480
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:25,040
Stop, honey! Give it back!

481
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,220
Honey!

482
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,820
Are you going on a trip?

483
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,300
Not a trip.

484
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,800
Then where?

485
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,040
My wife's condition has gotten worse

486
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,640
so I think I need to be at the hospital for a couple of days.

487
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,750
Then, what? Are you going to close the real estate office?

488
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,000
Yes.

489
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,670
What about Yool?

490
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,680
Isn't it neglect if you leave a child all alone?

491
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,310
Look...

492
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,650
Stop being interested in Yool. Her grandma took her.

493
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,360
Grandma.

494
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,030
Why today of all days are you packing like you're running away and going to the hospital?

495
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,850
Running away?

496
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:11,280
What? Does it look like I'm running away because I really abused my daughter and got caught?

497
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,760
Where is Yool's mom hurting?

498
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,870
Do I have to tell you that information?

499
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,250
Where is the hospital? I want to visit her.

500
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,430
Gong San, you said they wouldn't let you know even when you asked.

501
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,200
Did she really get admitted into the hospital?

502
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,340
I don't know why you people keep trying to visit the hospital,

503
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,350
then come. She's at Woonhaeng Hospital.

504
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,230
  She's not admitted here.

505
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,210
  - She's not here? 
 - If she came to this hospital, there's no way I wouldn't know.

506
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,490
  Being hit so much, no wonder she caught an illness.

507
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,510
Honey!

508
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,900

509
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,400

- It's 14,8900 won.

510
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,780
Whether it's you running away for a few days or even if you say you're moving, I won't stop caring about Yool.

511
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,440
- I caught you! 
 - What?

512
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,840
Whether Yool has gotten hurt, whether she's eaten,

513
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,970
if she's wearing warm clothes so she's not cold,

514
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,130
if she's had anything sad happen, I'll keep an eye out for her.

515
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,780
Who do you think you are?

516
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,070
What did you say?

517
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,230
Mind your own business.

518
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:00,960
You barely made it out of the police station, you don't want to go back in caught as a pedophile.

519
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,710
Are you going to keep going on stakeouts like this?

520
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,770
Detective Choi investigated everything and let him go,

521
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,960
so I can't just barge in.

522
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,820
I need to abide by the law and not cause problems.

523
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,500
It's obvious you're on a stakeout.

524
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,810
5,000 Won will probably know you're here from the hallway.

525
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:02,040
That's good, the neighborhood is quiet.

526
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,110
If that guy is the criminal,

527
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,360
then isn't it the best that he stays at home knowing he can't do anything?

528
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,260
What are you saying? The best thing is catching him.

529
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,540
That will happen if Detective Choi does his job. My job is this.

530
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,170
Until when?

531
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,350
Until the criminal is caught.

532
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,200
Do your job. I'm just doing mine, so don't mind me.

533
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,490
What about you investigating 5,000 Won yesterday?

534
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,320
The tool box was really there.

535
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,810
Rather than a toolbox, it was a paper box covered with something so I didn't know.

536
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,950
But the next-door neighbors also confirmed it was there.

537
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,670
No, but—

538
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,180
  Glue gun. Try investigating that.

539
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:23,230
  This bastard was wearing gloves, so I'm not sure if his fingerprints will come out.

540
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,710
  But my fingerprints are definitely on there.

541
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,530
That means he definitely saw the criminal wearing gloves.

542
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,230
He reported it first, and that means he's the eyewitness, but there's nothing else you found out?

543
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,230
That definitive eyewitness claimed you as the suspect.

544
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,720
So, if you have nothing else to say then just do your job.

545
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,320
I'll ask one thing.

546
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,630
Do I really seem like the criminal as you are investigating,

547
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,430
or is it just that you want me to be the criminal?

548
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,900
While investigating, there's always a witness that you get bad vibes from.

549
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,000
Then even after time passes, in the end, that initial gut feeling is right.

550
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,510
This is data taken from experience in the field.

551
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,260
That man isn't the criminal.

552
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,750
What?

553
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,310
Hm... Then do you know who the criminal is?

554
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,870
I just know that man isn't the criminal.

555
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,200
Detective Man, do your job properly.

556
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,850
Okay.

557
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,300
Didn't you go to your grandma's house?

558
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,750
My grandma passed away.

559
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,950
Was it your maternal grandmother?

560
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,460
My maternal grandma is in Vietnam.

561
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,280
Yeah. That's right.

562
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,670
Then, did your dad go to the hospital?

563
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,060
He went yesterday.

564
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,490
What about you?

565
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,940
Did you sleep alone last night?

566
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,630
Yes. I sleep well alone.

567
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,850
Were there other times like this?

568
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,920
A few times.

569
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,900
I said I sleep well alone.

570
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,090
If your dad doesn't come home tonight, do you want to sleep at our house? You can sleep with the auntie.

571
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,790
It's fine.

572
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,830
You can't tell my dad I came here.

573
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,000
No, but if you stay alone—

574
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,930
I'm fine by myself. My dad said he'd bring my mom home.

575
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,000
But out of all the dolls here...

576
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,510
What? Was there something you wanted?

577
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,790
You weren't supposed to pick that.

578
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,540
What's that?

579
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,900
Let me give you a phone number. Give me your phone.

580
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,420

581
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,680
Did you get a new phone?

582
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,430
My dad gave it to me.

583
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,620
What about the one that was around your neck?

584
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,910
That wasn't mine. That was my mom's.

585
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,070
I lost it.

586
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,680
If you tell me what kind of doll it was, I'll put the same doll in the machine.

587
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,020
There aren't many people who do this, right?

588
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,350
Everything else is here though.

589
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,110
Do you know who played it?

590
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,270
 Yes! Yeah! Woo-hoo!

591
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:36,990
 Give it, give it!

592
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,790
 Wait a minute, wait!

593
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,370
I think I might know.

594
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,100
I'll look into it.

595
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:47,710
If you call me tonight and you're doing well, let's discuss the dolls again.

596
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,100
What if I'm in a situation where I can't call you?

597
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,710
What?

598
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,820
What if I'm sick or if someone won't let me call?

599
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,040
Then, just call and let it ring.

600
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,640
If you don't say anything, I'll run to you.

601
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,360
Come here.

602
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,480
505?

603
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,550
No, SOS!

604
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,960
- So, this is— 
 - I know what this is.

605
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,770
I just said that the letters looked like 505.

606
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,130
Okay.

607
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,410
Anyway, if you're sick or in a scary situation,

608
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,850
call me and blow this whistle so everyone can hear.

609
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,680
You can do it, right?

610
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,930
Please move!

611
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:52,420
You can't tell my dad that I came here!

612
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,000
Oh, Yool! Just one second!

613
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,070
Here!

614
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,650
Here!

615
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,100
  Hello, welcome!

616
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,300
 You came too, Yool!

617
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,060
 Ah, yes!

618
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,240
 This is Yool's!

619
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,840

620
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,440
 Do you like it?

621
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,700
 You must be happy!

622
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,040
 Yes!

623
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,700
 You must be so happy!

624
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,140
Yool, you can take it! It's okay.

625
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,610
Yool, you like this!

626
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,480
I don't like this.

627
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,670
You'd always buy this when you came in with your mom.

628
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,750
This is the only thing that my mom could buy me without my dad's permission

629
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,400
so I decided to like it.

630
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,710
Back then...

631
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,000
Yool!

632
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,180
Oh, no! I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

633
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,070
Let me look. Roll up your sleeve.

634
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,760
Let me have a look.

635
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,090
It's okay, it's okay. Let me see.

636
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,040
Why, why, why?

637
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,520
Let me take a look.

638
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,930
It's okay. Let's take a look.

639
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,810
Let me just see a little bit.

640
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,780
Mom, help me with her clothes.

641
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,510
If I stain this, I'll get in trouble.

642
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,470
I'll clean it for you!

643
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,010
Oh, yes! If you go and change into this,

644
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,590
I'll clean it very well for you!

645
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:40,470
Let's go this way!

646
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,120
Let's go!

647
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,120
This way!

648
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,070
  You're so good!

649
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,200
Yool, your arms! Up in the air!

650
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,350
I'm cold.

651
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,430
Oh? Oh!

652
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,330
Okay.

653
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,070
Okay.

654
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,660
Yool.

655
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,510
I have a favor to ask you.

656
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,080
What is it?

657
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,060
So,

658
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,980
before we change your clothes,

659
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,480
could I take pictures of

660
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,110
where you got hurt?

661
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,050
Why?

662
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,720
It's not a picture where your face will come out but here and here

663
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,640
the places where you got hurt,

664
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,380
I'll take a picture

665
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,050
and show it to you!

666
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,140
If you don't want to, I'll never show it to anyone!

667
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,180
But...

668
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,280
You might have to go to the hospital

669
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,760
and get treatment and...

670
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,890
to prevent this from happening again—

671
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,870
You don't have to help me.

672
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,430
What?

673
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,380
I don't want to get separated from my dad and have to go to an orphanage.

674
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,330
Then, I can't see my mom.

675
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,150
Yool.

676
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:41,060
Do you want to hang out with me while I wash your clothes?

677
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:47,320
Yool, did you eat?

678
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,120
Besides all the physical wounds,

679
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,850
we should go to the hospital to see if she has any internal injuries.

680
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,580
How bad is it?

681
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,120
Bruises and burns.

682
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,750
And blood-stained wounds.

683
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,160
They're not all new. Some are pretty old.

684
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,590
And some that look like they just happened.

685
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,710
Can't you punish them even without the child's consent?

686
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:39,020
The wife got hit so badly that her bones broke.

687
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:44,010
They said that Yool's mom was being hospitalized at Woonhaeng Hospital but we checked and she wasn't there.

688
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,250
Why did you check?

689
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,550
I wanted to make a neighborly visit,

690
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,060
but everyone was keeping it on the down-low so I checked for myself.

691
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,460
I know one of the caregivers.

692
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,980
Can you arrest Yool's dad?

693
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,060
He could've purposely stopped by and said he was going to the hospital and ran away.

694
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,880
There isn't anyone else to look after the kid.

695
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,920
Well...

696
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,880
I'm in the middle of investigating it and I'm not in charge of it either.

697
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,020
You should file a report with the police.

698
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,550
And include evidence.

699
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,940
The child doesn't want to. We can't forcefully take the pictures!

700
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,450
By what means?

701
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,310
How are we supposed to get evidence?

702
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,290
I'll report it.

703
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,240
We'll find the evidence and find the father.

704
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,660
Hey, Dae Seong!

705
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,680
Let's go together.

706
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,580
Where?

707
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,830
You're investigating and you said that I'm a suspect.

708
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,490
Then, aren't you curious as to where I'm going?

709
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,950

710
00:49:53,830 --> 00:50:02,620

711
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:06,550
Ahn Dae Seong, I don't have time to play the hero with you!

712
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,320
I told you to report child abuse—

713
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,120
One second.

714
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,860

715
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,970
What are you doing?!

716
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,220
  If I find it, I'll contact you right away

717
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,240
  Okay

718
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,050
There's one piece of evidence that Yool was abused.

719
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,090
What, the child's shoe?

720
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,120
No, a glue gun.

721
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,420
There was a blister on Yool's body. That happens when you get burned by a glue gun.

722
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,950
There's also a toy.

723
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,220
It could've been like that while building the toy.

724
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,220
There was the day that Yool disappeared.

725
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,060
When I found her, it seemed like she was running away from something. She was barefoot and not even properly wearing her clothes.

726
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,720
  Yool, are you okay?

727
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,980
  What about your shoes? Are you hurt anywhere?

728
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,600
Her shoes are here, and there's evidence that a glue gun was used.

729
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,440
And the scar on the father's chin.

730
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,290
  Thank you for finding Yool with me.

731
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,900
  What is this?

732
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,560
  In the morning, you crazy bastard!

733
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,920
I've seen that type of scar happen from a glue gun before.

734
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,260
Aren't you just forcing the puzzle pieces to fit?

735
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,990
There are a hundred other reasons why you can get a scar on the chin.

736
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,740
No, don't touch that and leave now.

737
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,240
You can't break into a house just because you brought me.

738
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,650
That day, how did you know the child disappeared and why did you look for her?

739
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:26,560
On the day after Kwon Bo Yeon's incident, Yool brought in one of Kwon Bo Yeon's slippers.

740
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,180
  But do you know whose this is?

741
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,510
  Why did you bring this here?

742
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:34,330
  It'd be kind of weird if I brought a lost slipper to the police.

743
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:39,330
She said she picked it up in front of the Catholic Church, and when I went there, I found a stocking.

744
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,020
It was on the same day that I saw the slipper at the mart's lost and found section

745
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,970
and told Yool's dad that she could be the witness to the crime.

746
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,960
And after I found Yool, I asked him where her shoes were.

747
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,660
  That.. I asked her and she said she went to the next neighborhood

748
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,950
  and it seems like the big kids bullied her.

749
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,730
  They must've taken her shoes for fun.

750
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,930
  Anyway, I'm sorry to have worried you.

751
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,850
  Get some rest.

752
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,190
What about the child? Did she say what she saw?

753
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,750
No, just that I'm not the criminal.

754
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,100
As if she knew who the real criminal was.

755
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,490
She said that to me earlier, too.

756
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,400
But that's because she's close to you.

757
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,340
What if she saw her own father commit the crime?

758
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,350
What if the father knew the child was the witness and abused her?

759
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,360
Then, it makes sense that she can't tell us.

760
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,610
What?

761
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,840
Thinking about it, it seems right.

762
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,480
The person who found Lee Kyeong Ah's body was Yool's father.

763
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,090
He already knew the passcode to the door of that unit, and when he bumped into my mom, they went in together.

764
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,470
Since he does real estate, he can go in and out of apartments without suspicion.

765
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,710
Since he takes care of the apartments for the owners often, he knows a lot of passcodes.

766
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,850
Or he could have a master key.

767
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,260
Whether a woman lives alone or with her family, he can figure that out.

768
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,050
Wait a minute.

769
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,660
What are you trying to do?

770
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,890
Earlier you said Yool's father was a child abuser, and now you're accusing him of being a murderer?

771
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,660
Oh, I see. So you can get out of it?!

772
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,360
Please, just once!

773
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,080
Just once, listen to me seriously.

774
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,240
Don't conclude that I'm the criminal,

775
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,140
and seriously just listen to me this once.

776
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:28,590
Okay, then keep talking. What else is there?

777
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,630
The shopping list.

778
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,840
What?

779
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,340
Choco-Pie,

780
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,270
the bubble candy, stockings, peach can, can opener.

781
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,850
We sell all of these items at our mart.

782
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,150
On the day of the crime, the scent that came from the President of the Women's Association

783
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,040
was of a drain opener called Quick Unclogger that we sell at our mart, which Gong San confirmed.

784
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,180
The glue gun and the glue gun stick are also sold at our mart.

785
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,760
We suspected all of the people that bought those items.

786
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,360
But we missed one person.

787
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,970
Are you saying Yool's father happened to buy all of those items?

788
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,360
Can you prove it?

789
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,410
No.

790
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,520
There are items that Yool's father bought, but...

791
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,910
  - Oh, you must be buying them to take to the hospital. 
 - Oh, yes.

792
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,140
  Here, a present!

793
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,510
  Thank you.

794
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,020
  This is also dangerous for kids. I can't sell it to you.

795
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,370

796
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,370
  It's heavy.

797
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:35,420
For the most part, Yool bought them or they were given to her.

798
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,340
They're things that she wanted to buy but couldn't.

799
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,220
The last words that the President of the Women's Association said before she got on the ambulance, you remember them. Right?

800
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,380
  What?

801
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,740
  G-G-G..

802
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,260
G. She kept saying G several times.

803
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,900
You thought due to the President of the Women's Association's face

804
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:25,800
and with the glue gun on the ground, that she was trying to say glue gun.

805
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,380
- That's right! 
 - What if...

806
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,190
What if it was you, Detective? If someone tried to kill you,

807
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:45,180
and you couldn't speak properly, would you be trying to mention the murder weapon?

808
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:50,880
If it were me, I would have done whatever I could to name the criminal.

809
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:57,370
What the President of the Women's Association was trying to say was not glue gun,

810
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,170
- but Geumseong. 
 - Geumseong.

811
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,340

812
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,150
Stay right there!

813
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,050
For the murders of Kwon Bo Yeon and Lee Kyeong Ah and for the attempted murder of Jo Yang Soon, I'm arresting you.

814
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,580
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

815
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,820
Who do you think you are?

816
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,050
What are you?!

817
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,450

818
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,690
Here, Yool, eat this.

819
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:52,150
That detective, did he take Dae Seong to the police station again?

820
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:59,000
Seriously, if he did, I'll just—

821
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,460
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

822
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,650
Where is the canned mackerel?

823
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:05,340
It's behind the snack section.

824
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,400
Come this way.

825
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:09,790
 Let me find them for you.

826
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,660

827
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,630

828
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,230
Detective Choi!

829
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:27,020
Detective Choi!

830
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,380
You're alive, right?

831
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,400
Can you hear me?

832
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:42,450
 Detective Choi!

833
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:46,670
  You're alive, right?

834
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:54,240

835
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,900
  Yool, Mom is very sick.

836
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,350
  Mom says she wants to see you quickly.

837
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,650
  Come quickly to the address I sent you.

838
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:06,510
  Don't tell anyone and come by yourself, okay?

839
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:11,370
  If you don't listen to me this time, you'll never be able to see Mom.

840
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:24,230

841
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:28,410

842
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:33,380

843
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:38,830
♫  I think of you like a fool  ♫

844
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:44,490
♫   Why didn't I know, keeping you close  ♫

845
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,870
♫   Your cruelty, baby  ♫

846
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,030
  It's really not me.

847
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,450
  During that time, you're going to be a suspect.

848
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,920
  But you're still going to do this?

849
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,670
 From the back!

850
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:58,650
  The place where I just did a delivery, they just placed another order.

851
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,860
 He didn't run away from the beginning...

852
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:05,330
 If what you're saying is true, then a serial killer is holding a child hostage!

853
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:09,650
 If things don't work out the way I want them to, I get angry.

854
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:13,040
 Dae Seong is in danger. They're at the store.

855
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,970
 Help!

856
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,590
 Just because she's your daughter doesn't mean you can do whatever you want to her.

857
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,330
 How can you control another human being?

858
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:20,570
 I can't even control myself.

859
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,350
♫  How much did you plan  ♫

860
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,770
♫  The dark moon, the lie you told me  ♫

861
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:27,010
♫  After pouring it all out  ♫
