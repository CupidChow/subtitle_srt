1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,530

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,810

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,680

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,930

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,700

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,990

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,340

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,260
 A customer who snoops around a local market on a weekday, in broad daylight, dressed out of place,

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,450
 is bound to give off a sense of something not so pleasant.

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,040

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,020

13
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,630

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,940
Welcome!

15
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,860
 - A program that reports all the cases that police have been investigating.  
 - Oh my!

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,960

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,110
That's possible?

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,340
It's on the house.

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,940
Oh my! It's new money!

20
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,880
Ahn Dae Seong!

21
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,030

22
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,220
Mom, 77102.

23
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,730
What? I told you not to mumble and always speak up, with confidence!

24
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,260
77102.

25
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,760
Cleanly, clearly, and with confidence!

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,210
77102!

27
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,050
What is that?

28
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,820
Are you not going to give me my change?

29
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,260
Ah, yes! Just one moment.

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,880
Ahn Dae Seong!

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,810
Mom, look. Da-ma 277102.

32
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,090
Ra-ma 677102.

33
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,810
Sa-ma 877102.

34
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,070
Ma-ma 277102

35
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,200
Oh my goodness! I just got goosebumps!

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,570
Seriously!

37
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,130
You saw that, right? He's a genius, don't you think?

38
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,820
I couldn't brag much before, since I didn't want to seem like a dimwit, but...

39
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,730
Thank you!

40
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,580
Customer.

41
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,330
This... is a fake.

42
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,350
- Don't use this and go report it to the police. 
 - Sorry?

43
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,080
If you turn the corner and go right, you'll see the police substation.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,260
You seem to have a lot of 5,000 won bills. And they all seem to be new.

45
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,940
Oh, damn!

46
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,220
These are... Ah, damn...

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,830
How did this happen? Ah, geez!

48
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,460
I went to the bank and exchanged all my bills for new ones before going to visit my family.

49
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,370
To give my nieces and nephews some spending money.

50
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,850
To give your nieces and nephews some spending money?

51
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,670
You're such a good uncle.

52
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,760
Does the bank not check for counterfeit bills?

53
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,160
I know! When he goes to the police substation,

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,790
then they should check that first. Right?

55
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,800
That's right.

56
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,830
You're smart. How old are you?

57
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,320
I'm ten years old.

58
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,390
You're so good, helping out your mom and the store. I'm giving you this since you're so good.

59
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,930
Mister, just give it to your nieces and nephews instead.

60
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,350
You seem to have a lot of them!

61
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,780
Mister, now that I think about it, it's weird.

62
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,470
You had a 1,000 won bill, but you chose to pay with a 5,000 won bill.

63
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,200
To buy a single Choco Pie?

64
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,750
When you exchanged for new bills to give to your nieces and nephews!

65
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,690
Missus, your son's very daring.

66
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,580
I bet he's very good in school.

67
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,490
Nawoo Grade School is the one right in front, isn't it?

68
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,710
3rd Grade, Class 3?

69
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,050
His name is Dae Seong, so this store's name is Dae Seong Mart.

70
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,110
Nawoo Grade School 3rd Grade, Class 3, Dae Seong!

71
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,160
Mister.

72
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,110
Elementary School.

73
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,790
Nawoo Elementary, not Grade School.

74
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,090
They switched it to Elementary School last year. I guess you don't watch the news often.

75
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,090
I do watch the news!

76
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,330
Exactly! Nawoo Elementary! Nawoo Elementary School, 3rd Grade! Right?

77
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,930
Class 3.

78
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,540
3rd Grade, Class 3.

79
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,230
Exactly.

80
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,440
If he's in 3rd grade, he may look smart, but he's still a child.

81
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,200
You should teach him to watch how he speaks.

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,540
It's a dangerous world these days.

83
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,280

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,210
Oh my.

85
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,510
Are the shutters broken?

86
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,070
You'll get hurt, be careful.

87
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,700
Mister! At our store...

88
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,590
Dae Seong, what's wrong? Is there a robber?

89
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,200
I caught him! He's a counterfeit money offender.

90
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,420
What do you mean?

91
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,310
I locked him up in our mart.

92
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,970
- What about your mom? 
 - She's with him!

93
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,850
My mom will hold onto him so that he can't escape.

94
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,230
She's with him? Your mom and the criminal?

95
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,740
 Unit 1! To Dae Seong Mart, please!

96
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,350
 Unit 1, en route!

97
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,940
Stay still!

98
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,580
Stay still, won't you?

99
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,680
Dae Seong's mom! Are you in there?

100
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,380
I just need one bunch of scallions!

101
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,330
Closing the mart in broad daylight.

102
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,480
 Did something happen?

103
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,630
- Shh! 
  - Dae Seong's mom!

104
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,750
 Are you not in there?

105
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,060
- Stay still! 
  - Dae Seong's mom!

106
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,360

107
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,130
Ms. Han, are you in there?

108
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,390

109
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,110
I'm fine!

110
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,700
I was going to wear this tomorrow, too!

111
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,720
You have the right to remain silent.

112
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,730
You may request a lawyer.

113
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,600
Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.

114
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,100

115
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,140

116
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,210
 I'll see you again!

117
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,370
- Is this him? 
 - Yes. 
 - Take him to the station.

118
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,270
No, I... I will...

119
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,240
I'll get you!

120
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,070
What happened?

121
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,360
He came to the substation on his own.

122
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,240
When we got here, his mom had already caught him by herself.

123
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,770
Did anyone get hurt?

124
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,210
Ma'am, are you all right?

125
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,190
 A counterfeiter, who was targeting small businesses on the outer edge of the city for the past 8 months,

126
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,210
 was caught using counterfeit bills

127
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,560
 while purchasing a single Choco Pie.

128
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,240
 Surprisingly, the owner of the supermarket who caught the culprit was a mother of a young child.

129
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,200
 The store owner bravely faced off with the culprit, unyielding to his threats.

130
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,790
 After receiving an award from the police, the store has become crowded from her popularity.

131
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,260
 Well, I'm not a hero or anything.

132
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,810
 Saying something might happen to my son,

133
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,580
 he threatened us, that son of a bitch!

134
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,880
 I mean, that person? That punk? That bastard?

135
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,180
 I used to be an athlete back in the day.

136
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,050
 I played handball, so I thought I could do a rub...

137
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,550
 I felt like I could do something.

138
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,650
 For your contribution to catching the criminal, I present this award.

139
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,920
 - Mom! 
 - My baby!

140
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,060

141
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,570

142
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,360
 This young boy memorized the serial number and recognized the counterfeit bill.

143
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,570
 Thanks to him, the culprit was caught.

144
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,380
 You're amazing. Were you scared at all?

145
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,770
 It's okay. The culprit is in jail now.

146
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,890
 He won't be out for a while.

147
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,940
 Five years is not that long.

148
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,330
 What kind of person would you like to become?

149
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,460
 - Well... 
 - A hero?

150
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,710
 A boss.

151
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,040
 I will protect our mart!

152
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,950
1,700 won, please.

153
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,990
Wow, you're so smart.

154
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,780
Work hard!

155
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,990

156
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,340

157
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,660

158
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,050

159
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,630

160
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,790

161
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,040
One, two, three!

162
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,790
One more, please.

163
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,350
Welcome. Hello.

164
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,360
How many would you like?

165
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,590
Welcome! Hello!

166
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,670
 I'll give you an extra one with the 10.

167
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,060
Two.

168
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,880
Hello.

169
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,930
It's two for one today.

170
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,650
You picked a good one!

171
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,790
 You're so generous!

172
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,590
 You're so nice!

173
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,510

174
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,920

175
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,420

(T/N: wrong spelling)

176
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,020

177
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,420

178
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,010

179
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,040
 I will protect our mart!

180
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,450
I will protect our mart!

181
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,140

182
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,050

183
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:15,750
 Have I told you? A customer who snoops around a local market on a weekday, in broad daylight, dressed out of place, ,

184
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,880
 is bound to give off a sense of something not so pleasant.

185
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,570

186
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,380
Okay. I need it back today. I need to help a customer. Bye.

187
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,790
Hello!

188
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,970
Choco Pie for the nunchuck grandpa.

189
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,290
 We got in really good Jerusalem artichokes today.

190
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,250

191
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,460
 - Hello.  
 - Hello!

192
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,570
Hello, kids! Make sure you listen to your teacher well today, too!

193
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,400
Hey! Do you have a job interview? Where?

194
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,350
Somewhere. The most important one.

195
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,230
What about the civil servant exam? Have you given up?

196
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,330

197
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,270

198
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,830
Your girlfriend, Do Rah Ee, (sounds like lunatic) is okay with that?

199
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,220
Come on!  Her name isn't Do Rah Ee, it's Ah Hee, Do Ah Hee.

200
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,120
You think I call her Do Rah Ee because I don't know?

201
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,000
No difference between Do Rah Ee or Do Ah Hee, breaking up or getting kicked to the curb!

202
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,630
What? What is this?

203
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,480
A necklace for passing. You should try out for Show Me the Money.  
  (T/N: rap competition)

204
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,540
Why are you working here when you can rhyme like that?

205
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,170
What's the prize? A house?

206
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,120
I can do anything if they'll give me a house.

207
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,700
Here.

208
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,760
I'm heading out.

209
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,990
Men need to take care of themselves these days, too.

210
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,920
Look at you. You've been studying inside and getting no sun.

211
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,440
Here. Look at this.

212
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,310
You face looks awful!

213
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,410
- See you later. 
 - Just a little more.

214
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,520
- I'm late. 
 - Hold on, your forehead!

215
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,920
Hey! Dae Seong, what are you doing with that pineapple?

216
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,750
Hello.

217
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,100
How did you know I love pineapples the most?

218
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,620
It's been a while since I've had some sweet and tart taste.

219
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,420
How sensible. It couldn't have been easy to choose something like this to bring when coming to say hello.

220
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,560
Very nice. Pineapple... pine... pine.

221
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,460
Fine...(pronounced same as pine) This is an un-fine-apple.

222
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,270
Un-fine-apple.

223
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,420
Why are you guys sitting like that?

224
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,770
Sit on the couch comfortably. It's more cordial.

225
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,700

226
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,410
What have you been up to lately?

227
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,070
Nothing, Sir.

228
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,090
Plans for the future?

229
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,090
None.

230
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,180
Ah Hee, calm down. Relax.

231
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,880
What does your father do?

232
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,010
He generally does nothing and lays around the house.

233
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,830
What does your mother do?

234
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,810
She runs a little hole-in-the-wall store.

235
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,230
Why did you say that?! It's Dae Seong Mart!

236
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,510
What did you say?

237
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,740
He lays around?

238
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,190
- Has no job? 
 - Ow! Ow!

239
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,160
"I thought you would leave if I did this." 
  (T/N: saying a famous line from a Kdrama)

240
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,630
What are you doing?

241
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,470
- I failed again. 
 - Hey!

242
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,730
Oppa, why don't you know your potential?

243
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,740
Do you think I've been dating you all this time because you were going to become a government worker?

244
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,170
I know you didn't.

245
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,270
The only person that has liked me for who I am, has always been and will always be you—

246
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,480
Mart! Your family's mart!

247
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,310
If redevelopment permits are granted, do you know how much that mart building will be worth?

248
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,210
  Hurry up and send that jerk away!

249
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,710

250
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,530
♫   Orange dream, do you remember?   ♫

251
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,170
♫   Those youthful days   ♫

252
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,780
♫   The times when everything seemed possible   ♫

253
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,840
♫   We were so passionate   ♫

254
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,120
♫   Our pounding hearts   ♫

255
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,810
♫   Orange dream, are you still here?   ♫

256
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:42,550
♫  Our blazing dreams  ♫

257
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:48,090
♫   The time that we thought would last forever   ♫

258
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,800
♫   That we sang   ♫

259
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,720
♫   Will it be the same?   ♫

260
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,960
♫   Looking back, it seems we've come so far   ♫

261
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,250
♫   In that place, my dreams remain in an orange light   ♫

262
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,910
♫   To keep these as just memories   ♫

263
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,840
♫   Still, my heart is still pounding and on fire   ♫

264
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,110
♫   Sometimes, I miss the times I've forgotten about   ♫

265
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:30,490
♫   And other times when I dislike my reflection in the mirror   ♫

266
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,420
Hyung, you're coming back tomorrow. Right?

267
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,940
You've always gone back and forth saying you needed to sleep at home.

268
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,890
So, cheer up, and from tomorrow—

269
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,980
I've done all I can.

270
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,140
Make sure you pass.

271
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,210
Hyung!

272
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,960
Hyung, wait just a second.

273
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,320
Hyung, here.

274
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,160
Thanks. I'll be sure to return it.

275
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,270
No, it's okay. Accept it as a parting gift.

276
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,610
Oh, if you use it on this side, it should be okay.

277
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,340
My house is close. I'll just run.

278
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,570
♫   And other times when I dislike my reflection in the mirror   ♫

279
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,210
♫   The times when we shined the brightest   ♫

280
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:05,370
♫   Let's remember the bright smiles we had   ♫

281
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,350

282
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,970
Mom! Were we struggling financially for a while?

283
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,030
Yes, it's been a little hard.

284
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,290
Not us, but me.

285
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,590
Why didn't you say something?

286
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,030
You should have told me to give up on studying and go do manual labor or something!

287
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,180
Honestly, for the past two years, I've been preparing for the 9th level,

288
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,550
not even 5th or 7th.

289
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,670
Yeah, I know.

290
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,790
You, why are you helping out with this right now?

291
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:09,570
My mom is basically your mom. How can you just be looking at this like a stranger?

292
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,320
Why is your mom, my mom?

293
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,140

294
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,370
She's my boss!

295
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,030
Oh, your boss?

296
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,720
So never mind being friends, it's a business relationship. Huh?

297
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
Hey, just hold this.

298
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,930
So, even if the boss changes, you're just going to work here?

299
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,150
- I'll take that. 
 - Okay, you two got everything here?

300
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,450
Yes, go ahead.

301
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,060
- Work hard. 
 - Yes.

302
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,680
- Why do I have to do this? 
 - Hurry up!

303
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,570
Ma'am, this came.

304
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,530
Oh, okay. Good work.

305
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,450
Give me that.

306
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,180
- Be careful going up there. 
 - Yes!

307
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,500
Ah Hee... I'm not even the son of a building owner anymore.

308
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,710

309
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,350
- Looks good. 
 - Yes.

310
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,680
- Jeong Yook, come over here. 
 - Yes?

311
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,210
Take this, at least.

312
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,620
Thank you so much for today.

313
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,990
You did such great work. What would've happened if you weren't here?

314
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,700
Don't mention it.

315
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,820
Thank you. Good job!

316
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,470
- Yes, I'll be leaving now. 
 - Okay.

317
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,620
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Yes.

318
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,170
Our Jeong Yook is the best!

319
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,140
Thank you.

320
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,800
Bye.

321
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,500
Hey, what are you doing?

322
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,790
This is now our only memory.

323
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,480
Oh my! "Our only memory," my foot.

324
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,900
Look at this.

325
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,660
It's a mart run by Myeong Sook.

326
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:22,320
so MS Mart, using the first letters of the name. Isn't that a good idea?

327
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,710
Mom, did you get ripped off by a friend?

328
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,110
Make sure to pass these out to all the apartment complexes.

329
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,040
The first steps of business is the most important.

330
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,420
Who in the world is Myeong Sook that you're doing all of this for?

331
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,890
Do you know my name?

332
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,800
My mom's name is Han Myeong—

333
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,660
Han Myeong Sook!

334
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,810
We didn't lose the store?

335
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,660
Renewal. Remodeling, you know?

336
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,930
It made sense when I thought about it.

337
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,540
What have you done for the store to be named after you?

338
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,500
- Then what's all this? 
 - Your stuff.

339
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,260
Mine? Why?

340
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,370
It made sense when I thought about it.

341
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,810
What are you doing that you deserve to live off of us?

342
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,600
Move out.

343
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,550
I don't have a place to go right now!

344
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,690
I only have 12 cents on my transit card!

345
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,900
You can pay back the deposit fee in a year.

346
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,910
Just pay 350,000 won ($350) a month, for rent.

347
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,150
I'll let you make

348
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,190
deferred payments.

349
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,720
How can a person live here?

350
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,480
So become a person and leave!

351
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,770
- Ah, Mom! 
 - If you don't like it, you can leave now.

352
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,660
Then let me work!

353
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,490
Me? Hey! Why would I?

354
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,210
Boss.

355
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,280
30 years of fashion experience. Dae Seong Mar... A living witness to the history of MS Mart!

356
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,330
Human CCTV, customized service for regular customers, even delivery and advertising.

357
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,580
Please leave it to me.

358
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,780
That's what you usually do for free.

359
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,970
But you provided room and board.

360
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,390
Since you don't, give me my month's pay.

361
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,170
Please give it to me.

362
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,510
Deal! But you're on probation for the first month.

363
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,460
- But I'm an experienced worker. 
 - It's nepotism!

364
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,570
The other workers will complain.

365
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,380
If you don't like it, don't do it!

366
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,490
That's fair.

367
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,670
Oh! Hand out the flyers first.

368
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,300
- This late? 
 - Yeah.

369
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,890
Do it secretly!

370
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,780
If you do it during the day, then you have to pay!

371
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,210
Do it to the best of your ability!

372
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,160

373
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,680

374
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,240

375
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,250
Why do you always do this to me?

376
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,350
It's definitely not dementia.

377
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,470
He's doing that on purpose.

378
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,370
 Leave!

379
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,970
- Hello? 
  - Good evening. I'm by the playground. You know the nunchuck grandpa, right?

380
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,290
  He's screaming and making noise again. I can't sleep.

381
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,110
I called you instead of reporting it to the police.

382
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,570
Ah, sure, sure! I will go check it out immediately!

383
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,590

384
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,160
You're from Dae Seong Mart, right?

385
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,190
Yes, why?

386
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,620
It was delivered wrong. I never ordered this.

387
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,750
This is the second time this week.

388
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,960
- That's not possible. 
 - How would you know without checking?

389
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,680
Three individual Choco Pies and a box of 20 regular tampons. Altogether, that's 10,400 won.

390
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
Are you telling me to pay for that?

391
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
I didn't order those!

392
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,850
We don't deliver orders under 30,000 won.

393
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,870
Anyway, I will never be ordering from you,

394
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,310
so don't leave anything at my house under any circumstances.

395
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,840
It's Unit 402.

396
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,170
We didn't do it, so talking to me about it

397
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,730
- is useless.
  - Kyeong Ah!

398
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,580
Oh, you're late!

399
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,690
 What happened?

400
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,000
  Nothing. Let's go.

401
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,420
I'm telling you it's useless, you customer.

402
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,750

403
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,240

404
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,880
Dae Seong, did you spend the night out?

405
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,620
Are things going well with Ah Hee?

406
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,550
You're using protection, right?

407
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,720
- You don't know yet? 
 -  Honey!

408
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,390
Honey! Honey!

409
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,730
Honey!

410
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,730

411
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,130
Honey, honey!

412
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,820
Honey, from now on,

413
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,000
you don't have to make deliveries anymore!

414
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,210
So, you don't have to ride the motorcycle anymore!

415
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,250
Honey, I'm not tired at all! Seriously!

416
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,790
But Mom is tired.

417
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,340
Dad, did you make any wrong deliveries lately?

418
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,760
You can't just hang anything on someone's door and leave!

419
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,270
Ah, I told her it's not us, but she keeps complaining!

420
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,380
- It's Jin Song Apartment, right? 
 - No, it was Na Deul.

421
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,030
Honey, you gave me Rebecca as a gift!

422
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,150
You aren't someone that gives and takes something back!

423
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,110
That's right, I'm not that kind of person!

424
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,630
So don't ride Rebecca and ride a much bigger one!

425
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,930
- A bigger one? 
 - Yeah!

426
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,460
As a surprise? It's not even my birthday!

427
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,860
Is it to commemorate the renewal?

428
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,050

429
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,010
The best thing that I have done in life

430
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,750
was meeting you, loving you,

431
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,950
and messing up (getting pregnant) with you,

432
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,770
and becoming responsible for you.

433
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,520
I'm the one who took responsibility.

434
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,720
That's true.

435
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,220
That is true.

436
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,990
So, where is it?

437
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,420
Right there.

438
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,550

You are now the branch manager. You won't be paid a salary

439
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,400
but paid based on how much work you do.

440
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,330
Fighting!

441
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,190
Fighting!

442
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,050

443
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,340

444
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,180

445
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,910

446
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:15,260
♫  It's so fun being with you, our, our MS  ♫

447
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,570
♫  Happy, happy MS is always on our side  ♫

448
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,480
♫  MS is so reliable. Our family, MS  ♫

449
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,590
♫  MS Mart that brings a flowery smile  ♫

450
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,720

451
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,230
♫  MS Mart is always happy, happy  ♫

452
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:44,230
♫  MS is friendly. MS is so surprising  ♫

453
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:50,540
♫  Everyday my heart pounds, let's do it together, MS Mart  ♫

454
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,920

455
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,420
Are they eggplants or Chinese yams?

456
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,400

457
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,180
Don't you know this will cause huge issues for us today?!

458
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,190
It's clearly eggplants!

459
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,650
The women will think the yam prices are on the eggplants

460
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,530
and all come at me!

461
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,950

462
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,620
Well, this is good enough.

463
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,840
This is okay?

464
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,200
You put eggplant in bold.

465
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,680
You are still doing this?

466
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,210
I didn't want to do it either at first,

467
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,920
but it's effective. It even cured my disc problem.

468
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,590
Hurry up and come over.

469
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,920
He failed again, didn't he?

470
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,000
It looks like he broke up with "Lunatic," seeing how the bar codes are messed up.

471
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,820
How consistent.

472
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,950
From today, Dae Seong will be the cashier.

473
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,140
He said he's not going to take the exam anymore.

474
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,750
Our Dae Seong was born with a gold spoon in his mouth. A gold spoon.

475
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,400
Hey, who cares about the exam?

476
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,690
It's a good thing. You might as well inherit the family business.

477
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,140
Inherit? I am on probation for one month.

478
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,960
What probation? Why would you ever get fired?

479
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,390
He could get fired, if the mart goes under.

480
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,230
- Unni. 
 - What? He should know, too.

481
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,910
His mom's been struggling alone so much to survive and doing renewals or whatnot.

482
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,250
I'm nervous that we might not even get paid for this month.

483
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,870
True.

484
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,100
We've been in the red for a while.

485
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,010
If we can't get the sales back up in the next month,

486
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,120
- he will get fired. 
 - You didn't mention that.

487
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,240
You didn't, but I will work hard.

488
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,370
What is the reason for the decrease in sales, Boss?

489
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,270
Speedy delivery, early morning delivery.

490
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,430
Missile delivery, spaceship delivery.

491
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,380
Bae Mart.

492
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,240
How can we beat that?

493
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
If you can't, then quit right now.

494
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,460
We will beat them, no matter what.

495
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,350
Okay, beat them somehow.

496
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,400
You are not a gold spoon. You are gold-plated.

497
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,860
Anyway, are you still not able to contact "Fish"?

498
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,170
Did you try calling him?

499
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,290
Why are you asking me?

500
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,470
Boss, just hire someone else!

501
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,840
We will have to hire a delivery person anyway.

502
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,620
How can you be so cold-hearted and hire someone else, just because he disappeared for a few days?

503
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,040
He got scouted.

504
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,410
What? Where?

505
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,020
Where else?

506
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,230
Fresh Sashimi.

507
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,300
Ah, those jerks, seriously!

508
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,430
They use our mart to sell all their stuff and take our worker?

509
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,680
That's what I am saying. How do you think he went there?

510
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,050
Oh my, my.

511
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:34,410
But how do you always know everything?

512
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,300
The owner's wife uses our cosmetics.

513
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,870
She's too busy to come here, so she always asks me to come to their store!

514
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,840
And you let him go work there?

515
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,570
I'm not even the owner, what would I say?

516
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,350
He's going to go work for whoever pays more!

517
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,150
Oh, I don't know. That octopus fish face of a bastard!

518
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,330
I won't let him get away with this.

519
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:57,320
- Mom, did you do your breathing exercise? 
 - Let go, get away.

520
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,830
Oh, Ms. Han. What's going on?

521
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,030
Sir, the person you mentioned last time.

522
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,940
Yes, yes, him. Why don't you bring him sometime?

523
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,280
Huh, really?

524
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,250

Our Owner Han, thank you.

525
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,380
But if I bring him, you're for sure hiring him. Right?

526
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,710
  Well, I would even borrow a cat's hand. (Need all the help possible)

527
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,130
Okay, I'll come to the mart immediately.

528
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,080

529
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,340

530
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,270

531
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,490
I worked really hard on lobbying the Women's Association.

532
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,320
So, don't ruin this and do well!

533
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,560
One, two, three.

534
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,900
The Women's Association is announcing that

535
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,780
starting today, three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,

536
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,410
MS Mart's stand will be here selling

537
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:18,100
agricultural and marine products at low prices.

538
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,120
We invite everyone to come by often!

539
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,400

540
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,590
You've had three previous convictions?

541
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,530
He did delivery at a Chinese restaurant for a long time.

542
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,270
He's experienced.

543
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,400
Just a moment.

544
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,420
Why, why, why?

545
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,210

546
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,790
Is this some sort of rehabilitation center for ex-convicts?

547
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:03,010
Why are you always trying to bring ex-convicts here?

548
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,550
How can I leave deliveries to someone with three previous convictions?

549
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,270
No, it's okay.

550
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:14,690
His previous convictions are just petty thefts. He didn't hurt anyone.

551
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,280
This whole place is full of money and live creatures

552
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,170
and you want me to leave a fish to a cat?

553
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,090
You said you would even borrow a cat's hand.

554
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,000
What did he steal?

555
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,980
Well...

556
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,830
The motorcycle from the Chinese food restaurant he used to deliver for.

557
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,740
We have a Harley! Do you know how much that costs?

558
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,610
He's a good kid.

559
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,500
Ah, instead of a relatively good kid, couldn't you bring someone who's legitimately good?

560
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,800
He also had his reasons.

561
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,230
Even though I can't tell you.

562
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,340
You know, too, that when Dae Seong was young—

563
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,000
Oh, why would you bring that up right now?!

564
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,600
And what is that? That wilted, old thing.

565
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,520
It's still alive. Someone threw it away, and I found it on the way here.

566
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,250
Boss.

567
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:14,240
I don't want to be suspected while working either.

568
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,860
You can hold onto my first paycheck and give it to me when I leave.

569
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,890
And if anything happens, you can use that to cover the expenses.

570
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,290

571
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,330
I thought you said you were letting me go because you loved me?

572
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,460

573
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,470

574
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,570
My dad told me he'll commit murder if he sees you again.

575
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,780
How could your father say such harsh words to his only daughter?

576
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,700
No, you. He said he will murder you.

577
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Whether I get murdered by your father or die because I am not able to see you...

578
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,630
So why did you cause such a ruckus when you would be like this the very next day?

579
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,420
I know, right? I must have been crazy yesterday.

580
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,930
I must have been crazy for the last 20 years.

581
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,030
I know, right?  We were crazy about each other.

582
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,550
We were crazy in a good way, and it was nice. Right?

583
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,820
I joined DUO (matchmaking service).

584
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,360
I am going to try meeting other guys.

585
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,310
No, no.

586
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,550
That's not right. That's not right.

587
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,060
It's unfair!

588
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,520
That you were the only man in my life.

589
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,040
I'm going to meet a man who I can proudly say to my dad that he is a good person!

590
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,930
 Why are they being so loud in front of my store?

591
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,390
Maybe they get bored if they don't act like that once in a while.

592
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,690
They could really break up this time.

593
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,330
See that? Officer Do seemed serious this time.

594
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,410
- I'll be leaving now. 
 - Ah, okay.

595
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,560
You can start work tomorrow if you're okay working in the seafood section.

596
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,510
What? Not delivery?

597
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,310
We need someone at the seafood section more.

598
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,850
I'm okay with that.

599
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,280
Thank you, Ms. Han! Work hard!

600
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,780
Seafood needs a good turnover rate, so they have to sell well.

601
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,630
I can do it.

602
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,980
Okay, then I will see you tomorrow.

603
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,990
What are you doing? Get to work.

604
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,130

605
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,180
Hello.

606
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,120
Will you be doing the delivery from now on?

607
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,880
I'll be in the seafood section.

608
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,210
Oh, seafood...

609
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,230
I see.

610
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,570
Can you please ring this up?

611
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,630
Just take them to commemorate becoming a part of the family.

612
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,470
I can't sell alcohol to minors.

613
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,940
Don't you know my dad? He does real estate.

614
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,800
I know who your dad is and your mom and even you.

615
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,060
But I still can't sell soju to minors. It's $6.69.

616
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,880
If I can't buy soju, why would I buy whelk?

617
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,530
Is that your phone?

618
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,690
It's my mom's.

619
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,650
Then, what about your mom?

620
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,990
Hey, dress properly.

621
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,940
I'm not cold.

622
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,500
Even if you take Taekwondo, you can still get a cold.

623
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,420
But do you know who this belongs to?

624
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,470
Why did you bring this here?

625
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,470
It'd be kind of weird if I brought a lost slipper to the police station.

626
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:35,420
Can I put it in the lost and found here?

627
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,740
For now, put it in here.

628
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,310
Will someone come looking for it?

629
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,500
I'll let you know when the owner comes in to buy something later.

630
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,850
Do you know whose slipper it is?

631
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,150
Yeah, I know everything.

632
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,470
I doubt it.

633
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,330
I'm serious.

634
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:57,060
It seems you haven't heard, but people used to call me a genius since I was—

635
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,620
Then, why did you make the police lady mad?

636
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:04,630
You said you know everything. Then, don't you know how to not make her mad?

637
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,320
That's... not what I mean.

638
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,900
Yool, you came?

639
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,730
Yool, the thing is...

640
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:17,120
Even the smartest person can't know all of everyone's thoughts.

641
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,610
Sometimes we don't even know how we feel.

642
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,430
Yool, aren't you cold?

643
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:27,950
Yool, look. It's a present!

644
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:30,670
Thank you.

645
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:33,740
Here, get going now.

646
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,890
Bye!

647
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:48,050
But it's been a while since I've seen Yool's mom.

648
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,610
I wonder if something happened.

649
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:53,940
The last time I saw her was in the summer. Does she go to another mart?

650
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,990
She's at the hospital.

651
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:59,450
Where did you go? You left your station during work.

652
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:02,450
I had a bit of an emergency.

653
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,330
But it seems Yool's mom is in a bad state.

654
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,830
Have you seen Geumseong's face recently?

655
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,220
He's lost so much weight!

656
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,760
That's true! I saw him on my way out yesterday.

657
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,050
He was drinking alone at the real estate office.

658
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,690
You know how he only has eyes for his wife.

659
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,640
He does all of the shopping because she doesn't speak Korean well.

660
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,180
He also buys all kinds of cosmetics from me!

661
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,780
He even bought concealer.

662
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,760
Why does someone who dotes on his wife so much let his kid go around like that without proper clothes?

663
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,450
You know how men are!

664
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,010
Quiet!

665
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:40,350
Stop your chattering and go work!

666
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,930

667
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:51,840
Hi, Mr. Cho.

668
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:59,950
We still have a lot left, so I don't think we need to restock yet.

669
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:05,690
I know. It's not selling as well as we thought.

670
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:10,460
Our mart sales are down a bit these days.

671
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:15,670
Please send it next week instead of this week.

672
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:19,550
Yes, yes. Thank you.

673
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,590
Mom, the person who lives at Jin Seong Building 3, Unit 403 doesn't come by these days. Right?

674
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,630
Who is that?

675
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,970
That teacher at the daycare center.

676
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:30,410
Which one?

677
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,970
The youngest one. She used to come every Friday and order deliveries.

678
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,950
She hasn't come in weeks.

679
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:39,990
That's true. It's been a while since I saw her.

680
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,320
I wonder why?

681
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,190
It's obvious.

682
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:47,390
Speedy delivery, early morning delivery, missile delivery, spaceship delivery!

683
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,500
Bae Mart.

684
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,010
I'll deliver today.

685
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,770
Why would you?

686
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,570
Even one regular customer is precious if we're to get our sales back up.

687
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,170
I'll get it back up.

688
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,810
How?

689
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,470
Differentiation.

690
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,390
Our store's differentiation strategy will be...

691
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,670

692
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,760
...family.

693
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,810
- But you hate that. 
 - Yeah.

694
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,150
It's too sweet.

695
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,790
Still, people have a habit of missing Choco Pies.

696
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:27,850
That's all because of marketing. We need to take advantage of that.

697
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,880
In an analog and metropolitan way.

698
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,610
A store where you can feel the love and care of a family.

699
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:39,250
It's completely different from an impersonal delivery service.

700
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:44,940
What kind of nonsense about family are you spewing? I'm sick and tired of the family I have.

701
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,360
If you don't like the family angle, we can go with the care aspect instead.

702
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,190
Do whatever you think will work.

703
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,810

704
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:13,970

705
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:18,220

706
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,820
  I told her it's not us, but she keeps complaining!

707
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,100
 It's Jin Song Apartment, right?

708
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,500
Is anyone home?

709
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,230
What was that?

710
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,180
Are you okay?

711
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,120
Grandfather!

712
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:58,690
Grand... fa—

713
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,200
Over...

714
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,490
Over there...

715
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,670
What did you say?

716
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:13,090
T-T-There!

717
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,430
No! No!

718
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,340
 It's Choco Pie again.

719
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:47,890

720
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,760

721
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,090

722
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,670
 Take this, at least.

723
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,190
 Thank you so much for today.

724
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,300
 - Thank you! 
 - Good job.

725
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,100

726
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,250
 Why do you always do this to me? Why!

727
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,680

728
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:22,060

729
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,190

730
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,400
No!

731
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,870
 I hate Choco Pie the most in the world.

732
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,720

733
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,520

734
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:02,380
♫  I picked up the courage to take a look  ♫

735
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,610
 Why are you so obsessed with this case?

736
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,130
 I thought we had forgotten everything and were living well.

737
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,100
 But where did you pick this up?

738
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,350
 In the courtyard of the church.

739
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,250
 It could be one of our mart customers.

740
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,980
 Kwon Bo Yeon was strangled to death, right? Murder Tool.

741
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:22,150
 Hey! You could be suspected, too, for only seeing it as a murder tool.

742
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,210

743
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:25,970
 What happened to you?

744
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,010
 It feels really weird.

745
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,160
 The door is...

746
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,780
 Right?

747
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:34,770
 5,000 won.

748
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:37,840
♫  I'll find you anyway  ♫

749
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,590
♫  Secrets don't exist, so don't play dumb  ♫
