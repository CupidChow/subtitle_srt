00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,390

00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,710
 One, two, three, four,

7
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,900

five, six, seven, eight.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,950
 One, two, three, four, five, six,

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,100
 seven, eight. One, two,

 three, four, five, six,

13
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,490

 three, four, five, six,

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,710

 three, four, five, six, seven,

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,600
 eight. One, two—

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,590
Where's Vegetables?

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,740
- Anyone heard from her? 
 - It's odd.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,520
She's never been late.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,780
- Should I try calling her? 
 - Yeah, call her.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,880
No, don't. Let's wait 'til we open.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,550
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,600
- Sorry, I'm late. 
 - She's here.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,550
-  Oh... 
 - What? Noona, are you unwell?

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,510
I didn't get a wink of sleep. He followed me all the way home.

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,650
- What? 
 - Geez! I'm telling you this location has bad energy!

28
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,440
So, are you okay now?

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,460
Yes. He ran away when I screamed.

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,320
Did you see his face?

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,330
Just his shadow. I didn't see his face.

32
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,010
But are you sure he was following you? Where did he start following you from?

33
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,530
You know the convenience store next to the main road? From there.

34
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,400

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,750
Noona, I'll take you home from now on.

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,790
Oh, no. It's fine. I'm good.

37
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,610
What do you mean?

38
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,660
Yeah, take her home for the time being.

39
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,200
Call the police right away if you see anyone suspicious.

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,960
Okay.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,180
You must have been shocked.

42
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,570
Noona, you... dropped this.

43
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,350
Oh, I thought I lost another one. Thanks.

44
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,620
Who in the world would do that?

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,160
Gosh. Do you have anyone in mind?

46
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,100
- No. 
 - I can't believe it.

47
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,250
What?

48
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,290
What is it? It's cold!

49
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,220
Be careful of Fish when you take Vegetables home.

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,340
Fish? Why?

51
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,910
Hey, she doesn't like fish either?!

52
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,520
Geez, I was going to have some sashimi with her on the way home!

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,450
The fish guy at our store. Watch yourself with him.

55
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,930
Um... why?

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,580
If Fish is the one following Noona home, call me right away instead of beating him up or catching him.

57
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,070
Why?! Does he like Noona, too?

58
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,120
Too? Does someone like Noona?

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Well... there are lots of guys who like her.

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,630
There are lots of customers who became regulars because of her, too.

61
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,950
And now there's someone following her home, too.

62
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,300
- It's not you, is it? 
 - What? What do you mean?

63
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,490
Noona's married. You don't like her, do you?

64
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,070
No way! Why? Is it strange?

65
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,060
Is it strange that I'm taking her home?

66
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,760
Do you want to come with us? But don't you have to close up?

67
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,780
I do need to close up.

68
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,970
Seriously... he can't be, could he?

69
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,500
But I'm getting a strange feeling.

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,390
- It's true. He likes her. 
 - What?

71
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,510
Butchery likes Vegetables.

72
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,990
Everyone knows, except you. Even Vegetables knows.

73
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,380
What?

74
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,090
You remember all kinds of things, but you can't see something that obvious?

75
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,770
Well, it's not an option since she's married.

76
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,190
♪ Loving someone whom I can't love ♪

77
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,790
♪ The crime of loving... Come on ♪

78
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,890
Still, she's married.

79
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,350
Liking a married woman is illega—

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,980
Is it not?

81
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,700
Welcome!

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,570
Noona! Noona!

83
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,040
You bastard!

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,520
What do you think you're doing?!

85
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,460
This is MS Mart. The escaped convict broke our window with a rock.

86
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,570
No. I'm not an escaped convict!

87
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,010
I got released because I'm innocent!

88
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,170
This is all because of you! Now, I'm completely ruined!

89
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,430
Because of you, the money I was barely able to save,

90
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,400
I had to spend all of it

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,820
on fines! And somehow the loan sharks found out,

92
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,820
and they came looking for me again! This is all your fault!

93
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,290
How is that my fault? You're the one who did something wrong!

94
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,120
Of course, it's your fault. From the beginning, if you had

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,750
ignored everything and let things slide,

96
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,650
I would have been able to keep living my life quietly!

97
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,800
Do you think you're some kind of national bank?

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,910
Are you the Mint Corporation?

99
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,230
If you had kept your mouth shut, everything would have been fine!

100
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,220
Because of you, my life is now completely ruined!

101
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,040
You're the one who hurt my mom!

102
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,610
Officer Do, relax. Relax.

103
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,560
How could you let him go so easily?

104
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,860
Look how he went straight to the mart and caused a problem!

105
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,070
The detective said the culprit is someone else, though.

106
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,890
This won't do. I need to get to the mart.

107
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,130
Hey, wait. We need to first go where the report came in from. It's working hours.

108
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,580
Unit 11, Unit 11.

109
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,690
Is there anyone who can go catch the dog near Jin Song Apartment?

110
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,620
Everyone is out. We're the only ones left.

111
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,520
Let's take care of it quickly and then go to Dae Seong. Okay?

112
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
Geez, damn bastard...

113
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,560
 Officer Do, I know you're a lunatic, but watch your mouth on the walkie-talkie.

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,020
No, I'm talking about the dog.

115
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,370
The one that's gotten enormous and is terrorizing the neighborhood.

116
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,630
I will go catch it at the speed of light.

117
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,530
So, why this place of all places?

118
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,820
If you had gone somewhere else from the start, all this wouldn't have happened.

119
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,240
If you had stayed out of my sight, I could have lived a normal life, too.

120
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,230
Why did you come to our place?!

121
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,460
Why did you come and do that to me?! Why?!

122
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,360
Because you, I also...

123
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,460
Look at him. This is his true personality!

124
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,520
Take a look right here!

125
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
This bastard did this to kill me!

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,260
He pretends to be all nice, but if not for you,

127
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,550
I could have gone about my way quietly, you bastard!

128
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,350
Mister, please leave.

129
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,890
Leave while we let you go.

130
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,500
You just wait and see if I let you be! I'll...

131
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,950
destroy this place! I'll set fire to it or something and die!

132
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,130
You wait till I get my hands on you!

133
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,630
This crazy bastard!

134
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,090
Don't lay a finger on anyone.

135
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,590
Like you said, you nearly died.

136
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,850
Or did you forget?

137
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,400
So that guy wasn't lying!

138
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,100
- Take him. 
 - Yes, sir.

139
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,150
- Please stay calm. 
 - I'll be back for sure!

140
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,000
- Let's go. 
 - I'll kill you. I will!

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,060
So it's true that you nearly killed him 20 years ago.

142
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,020
And you insisted that the man you nearly killed was the real culprit and caught him. That's also true, right?

143
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,350
That was... self-defense.

144
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,430
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. First, I need to ask you something.

145
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:59,400
During the presumed time of Kwon Bo Yeon and Lee Kyeong Ah's deaths, where were you and what were you doing?

146
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,030
You're so enormous and scary!

147
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,510
You're back.

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,830
I called the owner. She should be here soon.

149
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,790
Why does that stalker bastard keep bothering poor Munji?!

150
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,750
Come on, Ah Hee.

151
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,650
- Did you sort out 5,000 Won? 
 - 5,000 Won?

152
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,600
I heard 5,000 Won showed up at the mart and was causing a scene.

153
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
Hello?

154
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,330
Detective Choi did?!

155
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,230
Did you know about this?

156
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,090
Did you know that the new suspect was Dae Seong?

157
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,790
Well... that's... I didn't think they would really believe it.

158
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,380
This stalker and 5,000 Won and Detective Choi. I'm going to kill them all!

159
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,750
Hey, Ah Hee. Ah Hee!

160
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,090
 Ah Hee!

161
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,800
Oh, that lunatic. Geez.

162
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,080
Oh, it's so good. Honey.

163
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,710
Oh, hello.

164
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,500
Did you forget where you started?

165
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,110
The produce isn't very fresh.

166
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,300
Oh, I can't renew the marketplace contract at this rate.

167
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,580
Honey, I heard the next election for the president of the Women's Association is... next month!

168
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,440
I hear we might get a new president.

169
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,970
Miss Han! You were here!

170
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,550
Yes, since Dae Seong is managing the mart well.

171
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,270
That's what I mean! Something's going on there because of Dae Seong.

172
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,960
What?

173
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,980
You know every detail about the victims, and the stalking happened using the items from this mart.

174
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,150
We also found the electric kickboard that you ride frequently at the crime scene.

175
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,290
- That could belong to anyone. 
 - Decisively,

176
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,590
we found your fingerprint.

177
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,830
On the plastic bag that was hung on Kwon Bo Yeong's door.

178
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,430
That's because I went to return the slipper to her and—

179
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,300
Slipper?

180
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,140
Allegiance!

181
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,900
What brings you here?

182
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,450
That's what I want to ask you.

183
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,260
I came because I received a report that a police officer was bullying an innocent citizen.

184
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,310
Do you have a particular reason for coming?

185
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,870
As you can see, I'm investigating the murder suspect. Do you have a problem with that?

186
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,690
Then you came to the wrong place.

187
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,860
- What? 
 - Ahn Dae Seong isn't the culprit.

188
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,580
Officer Do!

189
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,960
Your behavior could cause a big problem. It's an obstruction of justice!

190
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
It's because I know Ahn Dae Seong well.

191
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,080
Even if you're investigating, without concrete evidence, it's—

192
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,350
What would you like me to do?

193
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,230
Could I have a look at your room right now?

194
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,410
I think you need to bring a search warrant first!

195
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,190
I'll show it to you.

196
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,190
Ah Hee.

197
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,790
I'll be back.

198
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,800

199
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,690
What is all this?

200
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,840
Whether high elasticity stockings could strangle someone without ripping—

201
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,650
What?

202
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,760
I checked to see if the stocking was the weapon used to kill Kwon Bo Yeon.

203
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,830
Why would you check that?

204
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,700
- To find the culprit. 
 - Exactly. Why? Who are you to do that?

205
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,700
Oh, how long do I have to tell this story?

206
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,130
- What did you just say? 
 - Is finding the culprit a crime?

207
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,800
Why is everyone treating me like this?!

208
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,610
Get out.

209
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,010
- "Get out"? 
 - Stop bothering an innocent person and get out!

210
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,510
You sure have a lot of busy bees around you.

211
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,270
Are they covering up for you?

212
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,180
Or are they sheltering you because they don't know?

213
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,480
What did you just say?!

214
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,650
I have to conclude that you're a flight risk. Ahn Dae Seong,

215
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,930
I'm arresting you without a warrant for the murder of Kwon Bo Yeon and Lee Kyeong Ah.

216
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,530
Huh? Dae Seong... Why are you doing this?! Why?! Dae Seong...

217
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,190
- Dae Seong... 
 - Oppa!

218
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,000
Name: Ahn Dae Seong. Address: Seoul, Woonhaeng District, Nawoo Road 43.

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,250
 You live on the second floor of the mart, correct?

220
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,770
 No.

221
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,120
 I live in the attic room. The second floor is somewhere else.

222
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,940
 I see. Well...

223
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,860
You must have your own space then. You don't live with your family.

224
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,280
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Since when?

225
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,100
Is that important?

226
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,840
That's a better setup for hiding something.

227
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,150
Since November 2nd.

228
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,160

229
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,540
The day before Kwon Bo Yeon's body was found.

230
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,920
You told us before that you were passing out flyers that night.

231
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,390
Yes.

232
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,250
I was with my mom and a friend up until then, and before that, I was with my girlfriend and her father.

233
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,280
I'll check your alibis pertaining to the stalker and murder cases in time.

234
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,020
What? Shouldn't you confirm my alibis first?

235
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,610
I'm busy, too!

236
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,980
Go write it all down over there later.

237
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,740

238
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,770
But you don't have a job?

239
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,170
I work at the mart.

240
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,210
For the past 10 years, you've been helping out your parents' business while preparing for the civic exams and failing.

241
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,580
Living off of your parents in the attic room of their building in your mid-30s

242
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,160
must be tough. It must feel unfair, too.

243
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,620
I don't live off of them. I'm on work probation for a month, and I paid my rent in advance.

244
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,930
You failed the exams, and your family stopped supporting you.

245
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,620
You must have a lot of stress.

246
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,260
It happens a lot when you look at murders without cause and serial murders.

247
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,430
 Life feels tough, and it feels like people are looking down on them. When that happens,

248
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,270
they want to show off their strength to women who are the easiest targets.

249
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,480
I'm not that kind of a person.

250
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,360
How long have you been dating Officer Do Ah Hee?

251
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,640
I have to tell you that, too?

252
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,550
Among the killers who like to show off their strengths, there are also those types.

253
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,950
Those who approach police officers to get inside information and enjoy themselves, too.

254
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,070
We've been together for 20 years! 20 years!

255
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,820
She was an elementary school student then!

256
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,370
Oh, right. Among pedophiles—

257
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,730
We've been close for 20 years, but we knew each other before that.

258
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,810
Even after dating as adults, it's been over 10 years!

259
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:43,330
Do you think that she was a police officer at that age and that I've been hitting on her since I was in junior high?! Also,

260
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,570
she followed me around first.

261
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:53,340
Why are you getting so heated? I'm just saying there are those types of murderers.

262
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,010
Why are you doing this to me?

263
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,600
I had a bad feeling from the beginning.

264
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,960
- What? 
 - Information on all the neighbors.

265
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,880
It's personal information. If you know every detail, don't you think it would upset them?

266
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,600
I wasn't trying to do anything with all the information. I only wanted to help the investigation—

267
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,100
You know the customers' addresses,

268
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,930
their birthdays and phone numbers, their likes and dislikes.

269
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,630
The son of the mart owner who knows all their personal information!

270
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,530
Items used for stalking and the murder weapons are easily found at the mart!

271
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,590
Everything falls into place so well that

272
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,230
it almost seems unlikely.

273
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,450
How?

274
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,400
That I don't have a job?

275
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,600
That I'm too nice to the customers?

276
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
Instead of catching the criminal, why are you holding the wrong person...

277
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,290
and hurting me?

278
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,140
Did the murdered women ever hurt your feelings?

279
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,030
Or rude to you?

280
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,260
A third of the Korean citizens would be dead if you killed people for being rude.

281
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,760
Seeing how you are, you would have died a couple of times already, too, Detective.

282
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,130
Wow, maybe because you're experienced, you talk about death so easily.

283
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,230
Why are you here now, Miss Han?

284
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,020
What do you think you can do?!

285
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,640
 - Get him out! 
 - Get him out!

286
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,940
If you get him out, will Detective Choi not suspect him anymore? How ridiculous!

287
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,160
What do I do then?

288
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,370
What can I do? What do I do?!

289
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,190
First... go back and wait at the mart.

290
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,250
I'll make sure to bring him back.

291
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,730
Place it close.

292
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,060
Unnie.

293
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,650
 What's happened?

294
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,260
Really?!

295
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,720
- I heard he's the murderer! 
 - What? Oh god!

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,460
Fish, can you do something? We're going to lose all our customers.

297
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,510
How about an event or something?

298
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,140
Hurry!

299
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,000
We're doing a surprise sale. Half off for only the next thirty minutes.

300
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,750
We'll sell all the fish at half price!

301
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,990
Oh, right!  As I'm telling you,

302
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,910
our competitive worker at the butcher corner is saying he will sell meat at half price for forty minutes.

303
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,760
An unparalleled surprise sale battle in the history of MS Mart.

304
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,140
There is nothing wrong with the items, and it's not even time for a clearance sale.

305
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,940
It is merely our way of showing trust to our loyal customers who have shopped at our mart for a long time.

306
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,730
We thank you for that trust and will try to take this saggy mood

307
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,600
and raise it up!

308
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,000
Aren't you doing this because you feel guilty?

309
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,520
True. Since this mart's son became the suspect,

310
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,880
they're probably doing this to make sure they still get sales.

311
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,970
Is that right? How will people buy things from here? It's so scary.

312
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:31,120
I heard that he deliberately picked out a mart customer and killed them.

313
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,680
- I'm getting chills! 
 - Hurry! I can't buy anything here.

314
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,520
- Excuse me. 
 - Goodbye.

315
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,330
Wait...

316
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,760

317
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,560
There's a high possibility that he is the criminal.

318
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,300
There are no other suspects, given the situation.

319
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,170
Yes, okay. I'll call you back after I find solid evidence.

320
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,720
- Insufficient evidence. 
 - You scared me.

321
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,530
You weren't able to get a warrant, right?

322
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:18,090
Ahn Dae Seong's arrest without a warrant has passed forty-seven hours and forty-one minutes.

323
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,880
Forty-two minutes and one second, two seconds, three seconds,

324
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,960
four seconds, five seconds, six seconds, seven seconds...

325
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,350
From now on, think of it like I'm always watching you.

326
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,290
Don't get into any trouble and don't leave the neighborhood either.

327
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,690
If at any time you want to honestly tell me anything,

328
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,300
call me at this number.

329
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,980
If this is really a serial murder case, then isn't it possible that someone else will get killed?

330
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,440
That's why we need to stop it from happening.

331
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,040
What if you lose the real criminal while spending time watching me instead?

332
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,970
What you just said, that nunchuck grandpa said the same thing.

333
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,360
I guess there are similarities between you two.

334
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,890
If it's revealed that I'm not the real criminal—

335
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,420
Okay, so if that's the case?

336
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,350
- Are you going to apologize to me? 
 - What?

337
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,360
Ahn Dae Seong, I'm not trying to harass you. I'm just trying to do my job.

338
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,730
I also hope that you aren't the criminal.

339
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,580
Bull crap.

340
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,890

341
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,850
Thanks, Ah Hee.

342
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,910
Say hello to your mom from me and get some rest. I'll be back when I get off work.

343
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,470
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm good at riding the kickboard.

344
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,070
What do you mean good? You said you got hurt last time while riding your kickboard.

345
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,680
You should ask your dad to buy you a helmet so you can ride with it on. If you don't, you might hurt your head.

346
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,660
I'm more worried about your mart than my head.

347
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,740
There are rumors going around that you're the criminal.

348
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,750
That this is the store of a serial killer.

349
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,180
People were saying that this mart needs to be closed.

350
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,910
He's not the criminal, though...

351
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,170
You're here. It must have been tough for you.

352
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,370
What about Mom?

353
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,070
Oh, I know! I haven't seen her today.

354
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,380
Earlier, I saw her go up to the rooftop.

355
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,300
You should go up, too. You staying here won't help us any.

356
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,720
Unnie, why are you saying it like that?

357
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,850
Why? It's true.

358
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,720
Do you want all of our customers to leave?

359
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,110
Oh, here.

360
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,640
It's done.

361
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,070
- Dae Seong! 
 - Oh, you're here!

362
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,390
Here. We just cooked this with the perilla oil we squeezed this morning.

363
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,900
-Try it. 
 - Here.

364
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,410
Is it good?

365
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:41,750
Dae Seong, even if you told me you chopped someone with an ax, I would trust you.

366
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,500
Is our son someone who would kill a person with an ax?!

367
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,120
Just go and cook some tofu.

368
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,900
Mom, but aren't you supposed to eat raw tofu when you get out of jail?

369
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,540
So you don't commit crimes and live a white, innocent life?

370
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,530
This is all yellow.

371
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,870
That's for people who've actually committed crimes.

372
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,370
You didn't even commit a crime and only went through that hardship.

373
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,020
So, you should just eat things you like.

374
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,000
It's good.

375
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,280
Here, dip it in soy sauce.

376
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,440
The pepper is nice and spicy, so I sliced some in.

377
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,860
- How is it? 
 - Is it good?

378
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,250
It's good, right?

379
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,670
Yeah, eat a lot.

380
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,220
Eat and gain strength, so we can go catch the criminal.

381
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,180
Catch the criminal?

382
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,270
Mom, why are you suddenly acting so scary?

383
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,020
I mean, is there another solution to remove suspicion from you?

384
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,260
Just you wait. I will make sure to

385
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,310
catch the real criminal and prove your innocence.

386
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,860
What about Ah Hee? I told her to come.

387
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,940
She said she'll come after she gets off work.

388
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,540
Really. That bastard should be fried over this flame.

389
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,440
Whoever this bastard is... Just you wait until I catch the bastard who bothered my son!

390
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,960
I'll just destroy him!

391
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,240
Just you wait. Just you wait!

392
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,380

393
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,340
We just slept here.

394
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,240
We just slept.

395
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,620
Oh, I slept at my house in my own room.

396
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,100
Come on!

397
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,140
You two are young! What have you been doing instead of spending the night together?!

398
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,800
I wasn't like that at your guys' age.

399
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,750
- Mom. 
 - I also wanted to, but oppa— 
- Hey!

400
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,650
Anyway, since we don't know what will happen in the future, make sure to... you know?

401
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,370
I meant just get along well.

402
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,190
If not, at least for the alibi.

403
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,210
- Yes. 
 - Stop talking about that now.

404
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,680
I've been thinking about it, and I think Detective Choi is on to something.

405
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,730
- What? 
 - The criminal might be inside the mart.

406
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,210
You're talking nonsense again.

407
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,110
They all live in this neighborhood.

408
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,330
They could have bumped into the victims going back and forth, or even at the mart.

409
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,460
And the murder weapons can all be bought at our mart.

410
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,510
What? Do you have a person in mind that you're suspecting?

411
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,230
Fish. A couple of days ago, I secretly snuck into his house.

412
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,110
- Ow! 
 - I knew something was weird.

413
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,110
I told you not to act out!

414
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,950
Sneaking into someone's house because you're suspicious of them, what if something happened!

415
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,150
I found evidence. Evidence.

416
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,250
This sweater. The same ones were at Fish's house.

417
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,700
Well, it's not like that's the only one that exists.

418
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,490
But also, why did you even sneak into his house in the first place?

419
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,240
I didn't tell you, but Kwon Bo Yeon's murder weapon is high elasticity stockings, an apricot-colored one at that.

420
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,370
But Fish bought that.

421
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,550
I've also bought the apricot-colored ones, too!

422
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,730
But Fish is a man. And he doesn't even live with a woman.

423
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,530
He might've given them to someone.

424
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,270
Mom, don't be shocked.

425
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:21,080
I saw with Ah Hee, but Fish goes around dressing like a woman.

426
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,590
So what? Wearing women's clothes is a personal preference.

427
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,760
It's not something that people should judge.

428
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,190
Why is my mom so chill?

429
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:34,620
But even if they were the same clothes, they can't be evidence since it was found through a break-in.

430
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,330
- Didn't Fish come into the mart after the stalking incident? 
 - Yes.

431
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,560
The time span doesn't match.

432
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,590
That's our Ah Hee. You're so smart.

433
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,390
First...

434
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,180
This is the list of people who have bought the items that were in the bag left by Lee Kyeong Ah's stalker.

435
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,340
After that, a bag with MS Mart's sticker, not Dae Seong Mart's, was found at the scene of the crime.

436
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,070
Then, after we began using new bags,

437
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,150
if we look into the people who bought the items found at the crime scene,

438
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,140

439
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,490

440
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,660

441
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,360

442
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,160

443
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,460

444
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,450

445
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,920

446
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,840

447
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,540

448
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,940
To start, like he said, let's look into those who work at the mart.

449
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,810
Why? Why do you think we should do that?

450
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:33,400
Catching the culprit is important, but we have to save the mart.

451
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,670
So we have to prove that the mart has no relation to the incident.

452
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,740
We have to hurry and mark off the people who didn't do it.

453
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
Right, you're right.

454
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,830
Butchery and Gong San?

455
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,420
It's definitely not Gong San, I've known her for so long.

456
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,860
That's impossible. She's not that kind of person.

457
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,220
Is Butchery that kind of person?

458
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,900
Butchery?

459
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,500
Of course not...

460
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,200
You can't trust anyone!

461
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,090
Even when a felon is caught, the people around them are always like, "Oh, he was so quiet!"

462
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,510
"I never saw it coming!"

463
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,440
"There were rumors going around about how nice he was!"

464
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,890
"He was a filial son!" like that.

465
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,090
No matter how well you know someone, we should still check.

466
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,270
What about me? You don't need to check me?

467
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,280
All right!  Going with what she said,

468
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,380
let's look into Butchery and Gong San first.

469
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,300
- What about Fish? 
 - I'll watch him carefully with Team Leader.

470
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,520

471
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:54,320
These days, Gong San leaves health and beauty products in front of Geumseong Real Estate every morning.

472
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,280
What's wrong with that?

473
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
She's prepping.

474
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,180
What kind of prepping?

475
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,550
It's a wish of Gong San to buy a place in this neighborhood in her son's name.

476
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,790
Saying if her son's to get married, he has to have an apartment no matter what.

477
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,460
Well, it's not like he's getting married immediately, so I don't know why she's making such a fuss.

478
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,900
So what?

479
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,220
Look. The murders have occurred at two apartments.

480
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,060
Those units will both be up for sale.

481
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,120
Wouldn't this be a great opportunity for her?

482
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,840
It's persuasive. Enough to be a criminal motive.

483
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,910
There's no way someone would...

484
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,870
My goodness, why aren't you getting it?

485
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,190
She didn't kill someone to drop the property value,

486
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,800
she's just taking advantage of the dropped value.

487
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,990
Gong San is not the kind of person

488
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,350
- to go around killing people— 
 - Mother, I told you you never know!

489
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,780
She's been peddling beauty products in this old neighborhood for a whole 15 years!

490
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,300
When it comes to this neighborhood, from the facts to the rumors,

491
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,390
what goes on in which apartment, who lives alone and doesn't get visitors,

492
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,440
she knows it all.

493
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,010
Since she's involved with health products too,

494
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,960
she'll have a hold on the guard booth and maintenance office of each building,

495
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,290
so she knows about the security holes and has info on each apartment as well.

496
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,740
That apartment is still getting sorted out.

497
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,080
But the people above are saying they're moving out because they're scared.

498
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,620
You can't tell this to anyone else, yet.

499
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,020
Of course! No one asks about it anyway.

500
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,190
Except for you.

501
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,430
Hello!

502
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,670
Hello, yes.

503
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,620
Did Yool's mom like the beauty products?

504
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,810
Why do you keep bringing these things? I feel bad.

505
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,100
This is nothing in a relationship like ours!

506
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,180
Our relationship?

507
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,330
Next-door neighbors!

508
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,600
Share these when there's a good opportunity,

509
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,850
and if you have good info, share them again!

510
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,790
Is there a place you're interested in?

511
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,090
Jin Song, Building Three, Floor Four.

512
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,690
The first murder case.

513
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,470
I'll make sure to give you plenty of commission, so let's come up with a good plan.

514
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,080
Okay.

515
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,570
It definitely has a creepy feeling.

516
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,390
But it was an apartment built in the 1980's.

517
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,430
There must've been all kinds of incidents since then.

518
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,100
If you think that way,

519
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,320
the whole world is on top of gravestones.

520
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,950
I said it, but I'm giving myself goosebumps.

521
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,290
 Then please help me out!

522
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,990
Why are you coming out from there?

523
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,890
For a walk. Just to exercise.

524
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,310
You're taking a walk with Geumseong Real Estate?

525
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,030
Are you two dating?

526
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,060
No, President, why would you say that?

527
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,920
You two continue talking. I'll leave first.

528
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,890
This won't do.  You should play fair.

529
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,040
President, at your advanced age, aren't you even tired?

530
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,840
Don't spend your energy needlessly.

531
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,700
It's already been decided.  You should invest in the future.

532
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,240
What's already been decided?

533
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,020
Wait and see. I will protect our neighborhood somehow.

534
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,110
Sure, sure, sure. You do that, please.

535
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,270

536
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,400
Are you bored?

537
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,710
Being tired is better than being bored.  This is just...

538
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,170
When you used to buy stockings and tampons all the time, did you say they were for your second eldest sister?

539
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,190
No. They were for the third eldest sister.

540
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,840
The second eldest sister uses sanitary napkins, the ones with wings.

541
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,370
Not that I wanted to know.

542
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,170
I see. I got to know.

543
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,070
What about the canned peaches?  You said you don't really like them as drinking snacks, so you don't order them.

544
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:40,550
You know that my dad's teeth are all implants. He likes them because they are soft.

545
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,300
What is it with you?

546
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,350
Are you suspecting me? That list from that time?

547
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,030
No! What are you talking about?

548
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,280
I was rechecking the inventory since I was worried about sales, so I was just curious because you've been buying them regularly.

549
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Yeah? But come to think of it, I am offended.

550
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,570
It means that you know everything that I buy, right?

551
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,690
Is there something I shouldn't know, between us?

552
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,890
Is there anyone who doesn't have a secret?

553
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,660
Everyone has a secret.

554
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,300
Is that why you hid the fact that you like noona?

555
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,040
Hey, but still, she's off-limits.

556
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,190
It may not be illegal, but morally, it's not right.

557
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,130
Hey, stop it right there.

558
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,950
We may be friends, but don't cross the line.

559
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:32,210
♪  Qué será, Será  ♪ 
 (♪  Whatever will be, will be  ♪)

560

♪ Waiving hand, goodbye ♪

561
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,510
Goodbye.

562
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,690
♪  Qué será, Será  ♪ 
 (♪  Whatever will be, will be   ♪)

563
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:48,990
♪ To the beginning, not an ending, goodbye ♪

564
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,150
 Goodbye!

565
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,380
So cool!  Father, you are the best!

566
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,340
Mother, he's really is cool, isn't he?

567
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,400
That's not all. He's cool and sexy. That's why I married him.

568
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,980
But how come you're helping me? What about the mart?

569
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,510
The sales here are better than at the mart these days.

570
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,590
Maybe we should keep Dae Seong from working there.

571
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,390
He did nothing wrong!

572
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,320
But he's getting his feelings hurt.

573
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,190
That's what I am saying. Because of strange rumors going around.

574
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,360
Father, have you heard any rumors here?

575
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,720
Not really.

576
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,370
Ah, Honey! I think this time there will really be a new president for the Women's Association.

577
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,210
What?

578
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,970
What about the president of the Women's Association?

579
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,410
Miss Yang Soon is not on good terms with the redevelopment project union.

580
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,440
That's why she's against the redevelopment.

581
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,270
Miss, Miss, Miss.  Miss Yang Soon?

582
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,650
So, so what about it?

583
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,240
People are saying that Yang Soon—

584
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,550
No, the president of the Women's Association

585
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,750
has been buying time, and secretly formed CSEC.

586
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,990
CSEC?

587
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:08,290
Yes, Committee to Select Exclusive Contractor.

588
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,170
Ah, seriously.

589
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,470
The union wants a consortium of many companies.

590
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,740
But apparently, the president of the Women's Association wants to fire the union leader and wants to do things her way.

591
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,220
Of course, since a lot of money is at stake there.

592
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,270
She really is something else.

593
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,760
Ah, Honey, isn't Gong San very busy nowadays?

594
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,850
Huh? Why?

595
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,300
Gong San is the core of the union.

596
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,640
Right now, Gong San's faction and the President of the Women's Association's faction are totally locked in a battle.

597
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,280
- Gong San is? 
 - Yes.

598
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,730
The President of the Women's Association is grinding her teeth right now.

599
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,620
That Gong San's been going around spreading rumors about the murders to devalue the houses while looking for a place to buy.

600
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,450
Rumor has it that Gong San has a pile of cash at home.

601
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,330
That she wants to buy all those units and expand her share.

602
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,920
It's crazy.

603
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,240
 It's a far more certain motive than I thought.

604
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,730
 Gong San is very ambitious.

605
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,840
But still, would she kill someone in order to buy an apartment at a cheap price?

606
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,010
Even if she buys one that way, she won't be able to make much profit if the value drops because of rumors.

607
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,880
Oppa, do you remember each and every neighborhood that had murder cases?

608
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,250
Are you not going to live in a neighborhood near your workplace if a murder occurs there?

609
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:23,030
There are rumors that Gong San tipped off the broadcasting stations about the murders.

610
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,610
The stalking murder cases aren't all that uncommon, so they didn't make any headlines.

611
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:31,270
But still, it probably is because of redevelopment and not the murders.

612
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,860
I still think... What about Fish? Any new updates?

613
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,680
No, not really.

614
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,380
Kwon Bo Yeon's case happened before he worked at our mart.

615
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,690
When exactly did Fish move to our neighborhood?

616
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,080
It's been two months since he moved here.

617
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,100
She said it's been two months. The timeline adds up.

618
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,120
I'll call you again.

619
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,780
I saw him when he was signing his lease at my dad's real estate office.

620
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,610
Yes, thanks.

621
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,350
But what about Brother Fish?

622
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,770
Why am I an uncle, when Fish is a brother?

623
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,620
It's your choice, of course.

624
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,280
But, considering that you're a child, you seem to really like vegetables.

625
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,820
I don't buy vegetables to just eat them.

626
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,190
Is it for homework? Are you making something?

627
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,880
I just have somewhere to use them for.

628
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,990
It's 10,000 won.

629
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,830

630
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,980
- It's heavy. 
 - Goodbye.

631
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,890

632
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,820
 - Who is it?  
 - It's me, the President of the Women's Association.

633
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,580
You need to sign.

634
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,000
Here, have you been doing well?

635
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,880
I've been doing well.

636
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,010
You won't be able to find a neighborhood like this anywhere else in Seoul.

637
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,960
Thank you.

638
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,250

639
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,830

640
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,170

641
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,810
Thank you, see you next time.

642
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,350
I got Unit 411's signature last time.

643
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,970
Unit 419, both work, so I have to come back at night. Unit 409.

644
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,490

645
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,380
Unit 408 is empty.

646
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,420

647
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,220

648
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,640
That's weird.

649
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,860

650
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,410
Yes, Real Estate. Isn't Unit 408 supposed to be empty?

651
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:09,200
Yes, but I'm passing by and the electricity seems to be running.

652
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,800
Is there a leak somewhere?

653
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,010
Yes. Please check.

654
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,730

655
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,650
Hey, what is that?

656
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,280
Isn't that Kwon Bo Yeon's?

657
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
There was only one slipper at the crime scene.

658
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,540
Yes, that's right.

659
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,980
Why is that here?

660
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,650
You know, Yool, right? She brought it here.

661
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,430
From where?

662
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,800
- I don't know. 
 - Hey!

663
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,190
Why didn't you tell me something this important?

664
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,990
The place that the slipper fell could be the real crime scene

665
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,120
and Yool could be the eyewitness to the incident.

666
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,490
Eyewitness?

667
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,210
Give me that.

668
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,500
  In the Catholic churchyard. You know where the sculpture of St. Mary is, in front of that.

669
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,850
  Did you see anything else?

670
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,490
  I'm sad.

671
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,590

672
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,460
Yeah, Officer Do?

673
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,210
Okay, I'll be back soon.

674
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,900

675
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,230
It's 25,950 won.

676
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,350
Oh, I bought only one, but you rang it as two.

677
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,380
Oh, so sorry about that. I'll redo it.

678
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,070
- Sorry about that. 
 - Take care.

679
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,370
Aren't you going to work properly?!

680
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,970
I will work properly.

681
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,650
Wait, but where did Fish go?

682
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,530
- Where did he go? 
 - I'm not sure.

683
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,050
I kept praising him for his good work, and he seems to think the owner's words mean nothing.

684
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,070
You should've stopped him from leaving.

685
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,590
Hey, isn't that abuse of power?

686
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:21,820
I mean, he might've had an emergency and had to leave, what's wrong with that? You do that all the time.

687
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,780
What are you getting all angry for?

688
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,080
You're so anxious like a dog that needs to poop. Why are you being like that?

689
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,390
- Yool might've seen something. 
 - Seen what?

690
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,940
Mom, you gave Yool the bubble-blowing gun.

691
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,040
Yeah, I gave it to her. I probably gave her a couple.

692
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,960
There are also vitamins, so it's good for kids.

693
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,720
Exactly, so that candy. I don't think the criminal dropped it.

694
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,420
What does that mean?

695
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,910
Yool is the eyewitness.

696
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,520
What?

697
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,910

698
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,860
- What are you doing? Get off! 
 - Why?

699
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,630
Split up and look for her!

700
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,390
- I'll look around! 
 - I'll head to Yool's place.

701
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,500
Why isn't it working?

702
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,510
You guys think you're the nation's police or something?

703
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,190
Let go! Aren't you going to let go?!

704
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:46,480
I told you I would pay you back so many times!

705
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,180
Are you kidding me right now?

706
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,870

707
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,110
Seo Yool!

708
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,650

709
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,560
Hey!

710
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,160
Seo Yool!

711
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,650
Seo Yool!

712
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,180

713
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,450

714
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,170
Yool!

715
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,630
Yool!

716
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,420
Yool!

717
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,350
  Yool!

718
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,330
Yool!

719
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:23,140
What is that? He doesn't even dress or feed the child.

720
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,050
Why is he acting all clean?

721
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,920
Oh my! What am I going to do? Geez.

722
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,150
Yeah, Part-Time?

723
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:37,420
- Are you going to pass on the mart to me? 
 - What?

724
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,300
Why is everyone leaving their stations at the mart? Do I have three bodies?

725
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,000
I mean, should I just let the customers shop one at a time?

726
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,950
 Thankfully, some customers returned, and I thought things were looking up.

727
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,130
 Does no one else but me care?

728
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,630
  Just because customers have lessened, I won't lessen your pay.

729
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,980
Why are you so upset?

730
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,340
Exactly! I really don’t understand why I work so hard.

731
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,850
Another gone. We lost a seafood customer.

732
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,620
What? Fish hasn’t returned yet?

733
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,210
 I couldn’t reach him.

734
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,900

735
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,600
Is Yool here?!

736
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,480
No, she should be at home. What's wrong?

737
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,350
She wasn't at home.

738
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,150
Do you happen to know where she would go?

739
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,360
I don’t. Did Yool do something?

740
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,430
Not at all… she might be in danger.

741
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:26,160
What? Why would Yool be in danger?

742
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,750
I think she might have witnessed the murder.

743
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,720
- If the culprit finds out— 
 - Did she tell you that?!

744
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,730
No. She didn’t, but...

745
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,980
looking at the circumstances...

746
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,870
I will look for her.

747
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,650
Thank you.

748
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,890
You can go now. I will find her.

749
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,880
By the way, do you know where she goes when scared?

750
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,410
When I was young, I hid in our store, too.

751
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:02,410
No. As you can see, my office is small compared to the mart.

752
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,580
I will give you a call when I find her.

753
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,070
Okay.

754
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,850

755
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:19,030

756
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,430
Oppa!

757
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,140
Mom, I’m at Fish’s house.

758
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,950
Why are you home right now?

759
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,970
Isn’t it more strange that you’re here right now?

760
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,460
- Is that so? 
 - What are you doing?

761
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,860
I just need to check something.

762
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,810
In my apartment?

763
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,740
Is someone with you?

764
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,210
Do you like me?

765
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,520
Are you home alone?

766
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,950
So what if I’m alone? You know everything, don't you?

767
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,060
- What? 
 - You came here yesterday and stole my key card.

768
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,020
You saw, right?

769
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,660
That’s right, I saw it all.

770
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,370
Yool!

771
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,460
What are doing right now?

772
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,750
Leave. Get out!

773
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,280
What are you doing in my apartment?

774
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,420
- Yool! 
 - Why would you look for her here, you bastard?

775
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,740
Are you okay? Are you okay?

776
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,830
Fish, wake up!

777
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,760
He’s not dead, right? What do we do?

778
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,770
Since it ended up this way,

779
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,850
please get a chair.

780
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,160
Oh, my goodness!

781
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,690
Get a chair!

782
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,390
Wait a second.

783
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,850
Fish.

784
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,670
Fish. Fish.

785
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,010
Oh no!  What do we do?

786
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,260
Wake up!

787
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,610
Oh, no!

788
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,890
Are you all right?

789
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,810
Why are you doing this to me?

790
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:32,430
Where is Yool?

791
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,060
Why do you keep asking me about her?

792
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,000
This is Lee Kyeong Ah’s, right? Why do you have it?

793
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:46,590
Be honest. Did you kill her?

794
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,370
Did you kill her?

795
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,390
She gave it to me.

796
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,380
 Kyeong Ah.

797
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,400
 Why did you come out? Don't you have to work still?

798
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,530
 Whatever. If I get fired, I get fired.

799
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,190
  Look at you bluffing.

800
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,940
  You worked so hard trying to get this job.

801
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,020
 Are you okay?

802
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,060
 What a dumb thing to ask.

803
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,070
 There’s no way you’re all right. You must be really scared.

804
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,660
 I know, right?

805
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,000
 Living as a woman is really difficult.

806
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,390
 You and I both. Right, Unnie?

807
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,760
 Still, you look really pretty today.

808
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,170
 Yeah, right.

809
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:47,060
  Now that I'm taking a closer look, I think it's this sweater that's pretty.

810
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,790
  Where did you buy it? I think I'd look prettier in it.

811
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,930
 I’m not telling you.

812
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,050
 Go back inside, before you get in trouble.

813
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,150
 It's okay. Go on now.

814
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,680
 See you.

815
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,780
 Go.

816
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,820
  Hurry inside.

817
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,690
I was just making a conversation so she would feel better.

818
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:22,300
But she gave it to me that night before leaving to stay at a friend's house for a while.

819
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,860
And I bought the tampons before because Kyeong Ah asked me to get them for her.

820
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,250
She said she was too scared to shop.

821
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,570
She was my only friend in this neighborhood.

822
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:46,100
She knew who I was, but she didn’t mind.

823
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,250
Open the drawer under the bed.

824
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:15,130

825
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,770

826
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,620

827
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:25,890

828
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,350
I'll just keep working at the store until you hire someone else.

829
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:40,610
I'm really sorry for causing you to pass out.

830
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,440
I was just out of my mind and in a hurry.

831
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,890
No, it's not because of that.

832
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,140
Then, because we tied you up?

833
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:56,140
Oh, I'm also really, very sorry for that.

834
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:03,130
Then, is it okay if I keep working?

835
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:05,180
O-Of course!

836
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:09,120
The fish department has had the best sales lately.

837
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,570
It'll be bad if you quit.

838
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,890
Sorry.

839
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:25,720
I've never said that I was a man.

840
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,510
- True. 
 - Just because I wore women's clothes,

841
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:34,020
making me out to be a psychopathic killer is unfair.

842
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,660
You're right.

843
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,120
- You're right. 
 - Sorry.

844
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,500
But why are you looking for the kid?

845
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,150
I saw her earlier in front of the real estate office.

846
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,090
Right, Yool!

847
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:06,960

848
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,870
I'm sorry.

849
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,830
I'm sorry. Please...

850
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:32,220

851
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:42,380
♫   Remembering you   ♫

852
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:47,970
♫  Why didn't I ever know, with you by my side  ♫

853
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,900
♫  That cruel betrayal   ♫

854
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,660
 Yool was barefoot.

855
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,760
  As if she was running away from somewhere in a hurry.

856
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,270
 Is Butchery among the people you're suspicious of?

857
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,300
 Wait, isn't this "Vegetables"?

858
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,070
 Last night, Butchery didn't attend the dinner with co-workers.

859
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:08,290
 The fact that the crime occurred at that particular time does bother me.

860
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:12,590
 Don't cause any more trouble and live quietly.

861
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,950
 Now, the only male at the mart is Butchery.

862
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:18,440
 Why are you doing this, scaring me? Let go.

863
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,620
 I think "Vegetables" might be in danger.

864
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,940
♫  The night is dark. The darkness has come  ♫

865
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,930
 It was you!

866
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:29,440
♫  The moon is dark. After pouring out  ♫

867
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,170
♫  All the lies you told  ♫
