1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,200

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,330

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,570

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,330

5
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,100

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,900

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,250
Hello!

8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,960
I won't tell anyone what I saw!

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,380
Spare me! Please spare me! Spare me!

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,070
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome. Thank you.

11
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,090
  I want some jjondeuki (chewy corn snack).

12
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,090
- Jjondeuki? 
  - Aren't you full? 
 - Chewy jjondeuki!

13
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,370
- I'll get some on my way back. 
  - Yay, you're the best, Fatty!

14
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,120
Oh, Dae Seong!

15
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,880
Gosh!

16
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,050
Oh, what is this smell?

17
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,950
Excuse me.

18
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,550
Oh, my god! What's this?!

19
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
Ah Hee, the jjondeuki!

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,940
Oh, jjondeuki!

21
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,300
It's cold. You should go inside and eat.

22
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,580
- What flavor? 
 - Squash and sweet potato.

23
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,590
384 calories.

24
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,570
Oh, it looks so good!

25
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,040
Ready? Go!

26
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,180
No surprise there!

27
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,420
Our champion, MS Mart's Part-Time defends the title again!

28
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,810
But what do you eat that you're soâ€”

29
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,390
Why would you challenge her? Haven't you seen how she works?

30
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,330
Then I'll get going.

31
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,190
The loser will do the dishes.

32
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,770
- What? 
 - See you tomorrow!

33
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,240
- Bye! 
 - Hold on, hold on! Am I really cleaning everything alone? 
 - Good night!

34
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,640
Eat this while you clean.

35
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,770
- I should clean up then. 
 - Hey!

36
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,710
Don't you get the picture? It's not the time for you to be doing that.

37
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,090
Go. Go home. I... I can clean up.

38
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,070
In return, let's go shopping together next time.

39
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,740
Okay. Let's do that.

40
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,560
Be careful going home!

41
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,230
You should go home, too. I'll take you.

42
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,390
Huh? I'm sleeping over. Your mom told me to!

43
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,260

44
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,030
- What are you doing? I'm not going! 
 - What do you mean?

45
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,580
- I'm not going home! 
 - Go home.

46
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,920
No! I want to sleep over.

47
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,250
No!

48
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,990
Oppa.

49
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,990
Carry me.

50
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,250
Right now?

51
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,850
Yeah.

52
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,010
What's going on?

53
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,000
Did something happen again?

54
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,910
It's an ambulance, not a police car.

55
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,920
Let go. I need to go. I'm a police officer!

56
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,750
You're off duty! And you're too drunk!

57
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,740
I'm not!

58
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,320
Following the siren means you're plastered!

59
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,270
How could someone do that?!

60
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,060
I can't believe it!

61
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,880
It scared me so much!

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,840
It's unbelievable.

63
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,030
Detective Kim.

64
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,020
- You discovered the body first. 
 - Yes.

65
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,870
Oh, wait!

66
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,190
Can you try saying that again?

67
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,630
What?

68
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,250
The President of the Women's Association...

69
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,780
You can take her now.

70
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,200
- How did you know to come? 
 - Because of the siren.

71
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,190
Have you been drinking?

72
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,890
This was dropped on the fourth floor.

73
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,660
I'm thinking this was used to do that to her eyes and mouth.

74
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,720
Was she trying to say "glue gun"?

75
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,490
We've started the on-site inspection on the fourth floor. Let's go.

76
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,500
Oh my!

77
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,910
- I've... I've never seen something so... 
 - Try to calm down.

78
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,880
- Hold on, Ma'am. 
 - ...horrible in all my life!

79
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,020
Has she ever expressed any

80
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,430
resentment or difficulties?

81
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,490
Well... who doesn't have at least one or two?

82
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,160
I wouldn't know about that!

83
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,550
Oh, it's so noisy!

84
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,940
No one lives there! Stop ringing the bell.

85
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,150
You live here, of all places!

86
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,860
What's wrong with me living here?

87
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,400
Are you saying I did it?

88
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,940
Did what?

89
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,360
Never mind.

90
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,550
Come on. We'll find out sooner or later through the investigation.

91
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,730
I can prove it wasn't me.

92
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,690
So... it was you!

93
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,230
You tried to push me off the rooftop!

94
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,450
Are you crazy?!

95
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,990
I was going to...

96
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,480
Hey! Hey! What's wrong with you?!

97
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,610
Was it a bad dream? I came to see if you were suffering from a sleep paralysis since you were screaming so much.

98
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,690
Seriously... What's this?

99
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,710
Geez! How could you do this to me, first thing in the morning?!

100
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,650
I'm the crazy one. I wake up at the crack of dawn to come help fix your door!

101
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,510
Geez.

102
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,290
Why did you...

103
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,430
Why come this early without telling me?

104
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,610
Say one or the other. Thank you or sorry.

105
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,690
If I didn't know about it, that's one thing. I knew you wouldn't fix it.

106
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,580
It's getting colder by the day, so how could I ignore it?

107
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,950
- Did you clean up everything? 
 - Of course.

108
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,850
Did you think a cleaning fairy did it?

109
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,370
Why didn't you come last night? And you wouldn't answer my calls.

110
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,610
I just... wasn't in the mood. I wasn't feeling well either.

111
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,710
Hey, did that punk Fish just leave after eating without cleaning up?

112
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,290
Did you offer to clean up again and tell him to go home?

113
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,790
Then... were you home last night?

114
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,840
We-Well... Yeah, home.

115
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,560
- I drank alone by my place. 
 - Where?

116
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,020
What are you asking in detail for?

117
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,710
Are you worried I ate something good by myself without telling you?

118
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,650
Never mind. What was good was the meat you sent over.

119
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,190
Hey, why would I give you low-quality meat for your get-together?

120
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,520
Pay for it later.

121
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,010
- Weren't you buying? 
 - You said you were!

122
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,840
Why would you send over the rib eye just because I asked?

123
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,820
I was just saying that! Some pork belly...

124
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,770
Why is everyone so inconsiderate?

125
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,460
Go wash up already. It's almost time to open.

126
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,080

127
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,980
 Noona, just spare me a moment. Please.

128
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,390
How many times is he going to do that?

129
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,820
- I don't know. 
 - Is something wrong?

130
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,640
Maybe it's because Vegetable quit.

131
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,880
He didn't even come to the get-together last night.

132
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,160
Did you try calling Vegetable?

133
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,920
No. Why?

134
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,230
She even took a break from work since she was scared. Aren't you concerned for her?

135
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,090
Me calling her isn't going to stop her from feeling scared.

136
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,240
Who are you worried about? It's dangerous for all of us.

137
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,850
The neighborhood is in chaos.

138
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,480
Why? Did something happen again?

139
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,240
Last night, the President of the Women's Association fell off a building.

140
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,050
What?!

141
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,670
- Suicide? 
 - Come on!

142
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,550
I don't think so.

143
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,900
How would you know that?

144
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,910
I saw. Those eyes!

145
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,610
What?

146
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,750
I couldn't bear to look.

147
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,000
Like someone... burned her eyes and mouth with something...

148
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,100
Then... did someone push her off?

149
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,790
- To kill her? 
 - Hey! Come on!

150
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,670
We don't know.

151
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,820
I couldn't sleep a wink from having nightmares. My appetite's gone, too.

152
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,760
Hey! Hey!

153
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,520
It's sweet.

154
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,590

155
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,060

156
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,250
Who is it?

157
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,180
Who is it?

158
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,100
 It's me.

159
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,090
Boss?

160
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Hello.

161
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,030
Is everything okay?

162
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,650
Yes.

163
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,550
Here. I thought you might not feel comfortable going out,

164
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,430
so I brought some basic things.

165
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,460
Thank you.

166
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,370
You said you were going away. Why did you stay here like this?

167
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,370
Under the circumstances...

168
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,370
If you need anything, call me, even if it's late.

169
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll go get whatever we don't sell at the mart and bring it over. And I have Dae Seong and Part-Time to help, too.

170
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,420
It's okay. I feel bad. Everyone must be working harder without me there.

171
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:26,360
That's nonsense. And watch who you open the door for, even if it's someone you know. Okay?

172
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,420
Make sure to lock up well from the inside. And especially this thing. This.

173
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,060
Don't forget to use this, too!

174
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,490
Why? Has something else happened?

175
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,900
Is it someone we know?

176
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,600

177
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,790
Well... just in case. We all have to be careful.

178
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,020
Right.

179
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,490
If anything, make sure to call me.

180
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,160
And your husband? When is he coming back from the Philippines?

181
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,050
I think... he has to stay a little longer.

182
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,160
Too bad. While all this is going on...

183
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,360
Thank you, Boss.

184
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,560
I should offer you some tea, but it's a mess inside.

185
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,090
It's fine. I need to get going.

186
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,720
Then, take care.

187
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,470
Good-bye. Thank you.

188
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,330
No. Not here. Let's meet outside.

189
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,840
Where it's crowded.

190
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,730
I got it! I got it! It's coming up!

191
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,940
You like koalas, right? I'll get it for you.

192
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,920
Here we go.

193
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Come on!

194
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,900
It's caught!

195
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,950
Do you want to try it? Come here. Stand here.

196
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,260
That's it, right? The trouble my dad caused?

197
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,100
My mom said she was going to go there yesterday to get a refund on it.

198
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,570
She had a huge fight yesterday over it.

199
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,710
But you know how that stationery shop owner is. Boss lost.

200
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,820
- Where is she? 
 - She's probably at the marketplace.

201
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,970
I hear people are boycotting because of your father.

202
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,520
Ahn Dae Seong, I need you to come with me.

203
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,330
Why?

204
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,770
You were at the scene of Jo Yang Soon's incident, right?

205
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,860
That's because Officer Do was drunk... She always runs toward the sound of sirens.

206
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,050
No, before that. You were there around the estimated time of the incident, too.

207
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,670
Yes. I was making a delivery.

208
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,830
Building 1, Unit 211.

209
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,990
Take a look. You can call and check, too.

210
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,960
It shows the time I made the delivery,

211
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,500
and before that, I was having a get-together on the rooftop. You can ask them.

212
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,930
You could have seen an opportunity when you ran into Jo Yang Soon by chance while making a delivery.

213
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,820
- Since you had a solid alibi. 
 - What opportunity?

214
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,420
To kill Jo Yang Soon.

215
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,750
Come on! Stop saying such nonsense!

216
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,890
Why would I have used a glue gun on her eyes and mouth if I did it?

217
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,970
It would have been better to make it look like she fell by accident!

218
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,690
That's right!

219
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,030
Actually, I don't think pushing her off the building was part of the original plan.

220
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,710
Since Jo Yang Soon survived even though she was in a coma.

221
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,050
If the intention was to make it look like death from a fall, the glue gun probably wouldn't have been used, like you said.

222
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,600
And whether for laughs or intimidation, doing that to her face...

223
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,390
it would have been much more natural to abandon the body after the murder.

224
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:59,340
Let's say you ran into Jo Yang Soon by chance while making a delivery when she was at that building for whatever reason.

225
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,450
You've had a huge argument with her in the past, right?

226
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,410
- Still, why would Iâ€” 
 - Another argument ensued,

227
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,720
and after threatening her, you dragged her away to kill her.

228
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,020
What if she fell while running away because she couldn't see clearly?

229
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,500
Huh?

230
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,740
So, while intentionally carrying around a glue gun,

231
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,130
I argued with someone I met by chance and burned that person with the gun out in the hallway of the apartment building,

232
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,290
and she fell into a coma after falling while running away?

233
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,250
I mean, why are you going this far to make me the criminal? Why?!

234
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,270
That's right. Why are you doing this?

235
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,960
It's not that I'm trying to make him the criminal... Ouch, what are you...

236
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,850
Please move aside. You can't block the checkout aisle like that.

237
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,590
- Geez! 
 - Fish is really fresh today. Would you like to buy some?

238
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,000
- No, I'm good. 
 - It's really fresh, though. Too bad.

239
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,860
What about the fish?

240
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,860
I think my son has already explained it very clearly.

241
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,810
Doing this won't solve anything!

242
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,870
We have a witness.

243
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,240
What do you mean a witness when he didn't do it?!

244
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,040
That person must be the culprit! Who is that person, huh?

245
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,840
I can't tell you that.

246
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,380
Since we received a report, you need to come with us to the substation first.

247
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,910
I need you to write a statement, and I need to confirm a few things with the witness' statement, too.

248
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,820
- What are you doing? 
 - Please watch the cashier.

249
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,530
- I'll be back. 
 -  Dae Seong. Dae Seong!

250
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,510
Hey, Dae Seong! Oh!

251
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,240
Are you okay?

252
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,850
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,060

254
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,600
You're not going to him today?

255
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,150
He's fine. He'll be out since he didn't do it. Plus, he has a solid alibi.

256
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,070
Look at you. What got into you?! Oh, geez!

257
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,450
While Detective Choi is wasting his time, I will find the culprit first.

258
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,550
So he'll stop harassing Dae Seong!

259
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,580
Do you have a suspect?

260
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,760
No.

261
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,730
Why are there so many stalkers in this neighborhood lately?!

262
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,620
There's always been many.

263
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,460
They just don't go around advertising that they're stalkers.

264
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,950
It went from stalking to murder,

265
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,010
so I will destroy those people first.

266
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,400
What do you mean destroy?

267
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,130
There's that punk who kidnapped Munji,

268
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,150
and the bastard who broke into Vegetable's place, too!

269
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,200
They're both prime suspects. This is a war against stalkers from now on.

270
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,960
All right then.

271
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,200
But finish off your tasks first. Ask me if you need help.

272
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,950
The whole neighborhood is going to become safe thanks to you!

273
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,360
Are you going to just sit there and watch?

274
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,970
I have only one to go after.

275
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,350
I don't know what he's thinking or what he saw, though.

276
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,660
5,000 Won? Okay, nice one.

277
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,710
I'll dig everything up and lock him up, no matter what!

278
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,350

279
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,550
Seriously, it's suspicious enough that it happened when Butchery wasn't at the get-together.

280
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,460
Why does he keep going after my oppa when there are this many suspicious people?!

281
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,320
I'll get that Detective Choi fired.

282
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,630
I will end him for good!

283
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,790
This one here...

284
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,910

285
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,630
Ta-da! It's a gift for you.

286
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,180
Take it.

287
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,210
Where are you going?

288
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,370
I need to take care of something.

289
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,130
I only need a minute.

290
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,840
But...

291
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,400
Sorry, it's 6,000 won.

292
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,620
Something on your mind?

293
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,220
Do you want me to give you some advice?

294
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,370
My dad told me to be careful with adult men who are friendly.

295
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,180
But we played together with that machine earlier.

296
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,380
Do you want to play with me or give some advice?

297
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,880
Wow, how are you so similar to Dae Seong when he was little?

298
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,990
Such a smart girl.

299
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,340
Let's see. Oh?

300
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,490
Oh, Yool. Hold on!

301
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,770
Oh, sorry. I didn't grab that hard, though.

302
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,670
Does it hurt a lot?

303
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,200
Here. Let me see.

304
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,100
Huh? What happened to your arm?

305
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,090
- Did you put on ointment? 
 - I'm fine.

306
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,220
What do you mean fine? Wait a minute.

307
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,760
What?

308
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,100
Why are you running?

309
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,390
Where have you been?

310
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,610
To buy a snack.

311
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,200
Where's the snack? Did you eat it already?

312
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,670
Oh...

313
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,580
You went to MS Mart again, didn't you?

314
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,540
Did Dae Seong say something to you again?

315
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,410
No.

316
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,410
Oh, the police took him away.

317
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,540
Why?

318
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,600
Because of the President of the Women's Association falling yesterday.

319
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,000
That he might be the culprit.

320
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
What?

321
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,060
There is a witness.

322
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,270

323
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,450
Stop standing and please sit.

324
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,250
- I'm sitting. 
 - What do you... So you are.

325
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,910
What were you wearing yesterday?

326
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,780
Oh, hello!

327
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,470
Health food.

328
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,350
I asked what you were wearing yesterday.

329
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,840
A checkered shirt, khaki jacket, and a pair of grey sweatpants.

330
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,420
That matches the witness' statement.

331
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,140
They could have seen me over there since I was making a delivery.

332
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,610
Did that person see me push her off?

333
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,830
The witness is coming in again later.

334
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,820
He should be here soon. He said it was okay to see you face-to-face,

335
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,840
so just answer a few more questions.

336
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,600
He's here.

337
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,070
Ma'am, please leave already!

338
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,660
Oh, sure!

339
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,220

340
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,110
Oh!

341
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,720
Honey, these are cold.

342
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,580
Oh, thank you!

343
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,810
What about the marketplace?

344
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,630
I left it with someone for a sec.

345
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,430
Go and close up.

346
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,540
People aren't buying anyway, so let's call it a day.

347
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,610
I'm sorry, Honey.

348
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,340
Never mind!

349
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,160
Honey, ta-da!

350
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,730
What's that?

351
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,130
All the women in this neighborhood with good skin use this.

352
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,940
Here. Ta-da!

353
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,890
What? Oh, this thing! Yes!

354
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:29,070
I felt like my skin was sagging in this hot weather.

355
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,040
If you I use it,

356
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,870
maybe it'll breathe new life into my skin!

357
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,720
- Do you like it? 
 - So much!

358
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,450
But why are you working the register? Where's Dae Seong?

359
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,100
The poâ€” Oh, he went out for a minute.

360
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,670
What about Gong San?

361
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,390
She's out, too.

362
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,380
Really?

363
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,720
Nice going.

364
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,910
I need to close early since I have to be somewhere today.

365
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,820
Okay. Why not close up for good with that attitude?

366
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,650
Honey, I'll go close up the marketplace.

367
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,120
See you later.

368
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,360
I'm sorry. I am in hurry, soâ€”

369
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,960
Come talk with me before you leave.

370
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,190
What?

371
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,830
Hold on.

372
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,570

373
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,390
Yeah, hi!

374
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,860
Mother, is Butcher at the mart?

375
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,320
 What? Yeah.

376
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,780
It's just that... seeing how someone broke into Vegetable's place...

377
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,300
and he didn't join us for the get-together yesterday.

378
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,080
 It bothers me that the incident happened during that time.

379
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,740
I think we need to watch him carefully.

380
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,850
Oo-oops, what's wrong with me? I forgot!

381
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,790
I'll call you later, so don't worry. Bye.

382
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,890
Stay 30 more minutes.

383
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,490
But I need to...

384
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,890
But why do you need to speak with me for 30 minutes?

385
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,530
No, that's not it...

386
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,640
The call was from the daycare center.

387
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,040
What?

388
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,020
Thirty servings of bite-sized Tonkatsu.

389
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,970
It has to be tenderized well.

390
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,350
They want it done by hand with a mallet.

391
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,940
They ordered it.

392
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,800
By when?

393
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,640
Oh, goodness.

394
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,860
It has to be delivered within an hour

395
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,290
because they're throwing a party at the daycare center!

396
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,280
Business is slow these days, and the daycare center is our VIP.

397
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,900
We can't break that trust. Right?

398
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,230
Right.

399
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,150
All we have right now is 20 servings worth.

400
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,860
Really? Then you should have just enough time!

401
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,350
We don't have time, so go and start tenderizing.

402
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,200
Oh, right.

403
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,210
(Let's talk over there.)

404
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,360
(Come on!)

405
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,260
 Don't push me! Don't push me!

406
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,810
 You're it!

407
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,080
 I got you!

408
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,420
 No, you didn't!

409
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,410
 You didn't!

410
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,760
 I did!

411
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,580
 Come on!

412
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,320
 You're it!

413
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,050
 The person you are calling is not available.

414
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,890
 Please call again in a moment.

415
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,350
 I'll catch you!

416
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,620
Later, when Butchery leaves, follow him.

417
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,450
Excuse me?

418
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,740
Watch carefully what he does and let me know by text.

419
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,870
Why?

420
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,610
Oh...

421
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,060
You can do it without getting caught, right?

422
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,530
Yes.

423
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,240
All right.

424
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,710

425
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,150
 That's a lie!

426
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,010
No, I told you.

427
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,850
On my way back from somewhere, I hid

428
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,180
and saw him.

429
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,460
I... um,

430
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,600
yesterday, I realized something else.

431
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,030
Glue gun.

432
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,250
Go investigate that.

433
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,260
That bastard was wearing gloves,

434
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,290
so I'm not sure if his fingerprints will be there,

435
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:23,690
but my fingerprints are definitely there!

436
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,970
What do you mean?

437
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,810
So, yesterday...

438
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,600
 After all the detectives left,

439
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,170
 in front of my front door,

440
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,190
 I saw a toolbox.

441
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,230
 The glue gun had disappeared!

442
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,640
I think this bastard took it and did that to her.

443
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,010
He went insane thinking, "What should I kill her with?"

444
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,510
While he was looking for something, he grabbed that!

445
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,920
I think that's what happened!

446
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,430
Did you see a toolbox when you went to question people yesterday?

447
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,090
No, I didn't.

448
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,170
I didn't see it.

449
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,590
Well, it's possible not to see it, sure...

450
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,230
Even if it was there, it's possible to miss it.

451
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,200
First, Ahn Dae Seong, the investigation is over, so you're free to go.

452
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,810
I... I can really go?

453
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,200
Yes. Don't go anywhere far, and make sure that we can always contact you.

454
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,820
Since it's not over yet.

455
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,600
Can I...

456
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,300
As for you, tell me what happened again from the beginning.

457
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,380
Slowly, starting from when you made the initial report.

458
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,190
But why?!

459
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,520
No, Iâ€”

460
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,720
Don't touch me!

461
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,860
- Come on now! 
 - I'll kill you!

462
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,840
Hurry up and leave, please.

463
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,920
He just hit me!

464
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,980
No, why do I... Why can he leave and not me?

465
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,440
Why let him go but not me?

466
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,070

467
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,740
Gong San...

468
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,610

469
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,750

470
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,750

471
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,620
Gong San!

472
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,420
You're going out... like this?

473
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,400
If I'm going to do it, I should do it right. He won't recognize me.

474
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,330
But you're still... What if the others find out?

475
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,160
Do I have to quit my job if the others find out?

476
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Of course not!

477
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,120
It's just that, I don't want you to have a hard time.

478
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,660
I don't know how long I'll be working there, but I'm getting surgery soon.

479
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,460
If I keep working after that, everyone will find out anyway.

480
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,400
Thank you so much.

481
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,000
You're going this far because of me.

482
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,090
Pardon?

483
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,790
Is that not it?

484
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,880
It's because of Gyeong Ah.

485
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,230
I felt like I had to do something, too.

486
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,940
I see.

487
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,260
I'm counting on you.

488
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,390

489
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,020

490
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,220
Boss, I put in plenty to serve 30 people.

491
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,630
I can go now, right?

492
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,540
Sure, go on.

493
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,820
- Go on then! 
 - Okay!

494
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,690
 Hurry! Follow him!

495
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,730
Do I have to watch this big store by myself?

496
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,160
With the same wage?

497
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
You can do it!

498
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,700
Hey!

499
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,740
Asshole.

500
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,510
You asshole!

501
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,010
Hey! Hey! Are you all rigâ€”

502
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,670
Who are you now?!

503
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,140
Wait...

504
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,950

505
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,480
 I've made it to Hanbom Apartments.

506
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,370
 Butchery left work early and angry.

507
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,940
 Fish is following him. Vegetable home.

508
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,170
Where are you going?

509
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,160
I'm going to patrol in Wonjin.

510
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,190
To see if there are any stalkers.

511
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,030
I'll come with you.

512
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,390

513
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,740

514
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,770

515
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,540

516
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,740
Ah, really.

517
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,280
Boss, I lost Butchery. Vegetables is on her way home now.

518
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,590
I told her not to go out anywhere!

519
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,570
Watch him carefully. Ah Hee will be there soon.

520
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,690

521
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,420
- Um... you know me, right? 
 - Hello.

522
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,190
This.

523
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,970
You're working so hard.

524
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,210
What are you doing here?

525
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,420
A visit. I'll be quick.

526
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:57,260
Visits aren't allowed. She's still unconscious, so she can't talk or recognize anybody anyway.

527
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,300
It's because I feel so bad for her.

528
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,730
I fought with her for nothing, when she's a lonely person.

529
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,850
You haven't been able to contact any of her family, right?

530
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,790
Yes. I hear she has a daughter, but there's no way to contact her.

531
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,050
She doesn't have her daughter's contact info.

532
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,680
- When her daughter turned twenty, she cut ties. I hear she left for America. 
 - Oh no.

533
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,500
I'll come right out after quietly taking a peek. Okay?

534
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,580
She'll feel so lonely when she gains consciousness.

535
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,780
If I can't, then you guys can just go in with me.

536
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,970
- We really shouldn't. 
 - Please tell her no.

537
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,480
In American dramas, the criminal always shows up at the hospital to finish the victim off.

538
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,010
What if she put something in the drink? No!

539
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,790
I'll go in just for a second, huh? Just a second.

540
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:55,090
We normally don't allow it, but go leave the bag and come right out.

541
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,850
Thank you.

542
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,990
No! Letting her go inside like that? You can't!

543
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,020
It'll put you, police officers, in an awkward situation, so no!

544
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,350
Quiet down.

545
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,650

546
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,530
Is the president doing okay?

547
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,850
Well, she is still unconscious.

548
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,650
Gong San is so warm-hearted... but I'll go and get her quickly.

549
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,030
I heard the day before the incident, they had a big fight.

550
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,450
- Really? 
 - Yes.

551
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,790
They never had a good relationship. It was really bad.

552
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,590
This. You know what this is, right?

553
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:34,180
The scent of this was on you yesterday.

554
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,810
Out of all the bleaches, only this one is pine tree scented.

555
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:43,660
I know because I've used this. If you recognize the smell, nod your head.

556
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,720
Let's go.

557
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,330

558
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,730
Gong San.

559
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,380
 Help me.

560
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,230
Seriously!

561
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,960
You little.

562
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,080
You bastard!

563
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,770
Stop it!

564
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,910
Stop it now! Leave the medicine to pharmacists, and civilian protection to the police.

565
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,520
Oppa, calm down. If you keep doing this, you'll also be in trouble.

566
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,690
I knew it!

567
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,050
Were you working with this bastard?!

568
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,230
This punk works at the mart, doesn't he?!

569
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,320
What are you?!

570
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,370
A little girl acting like she's a police officer...

571
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,160
You sure know how to run your mouth. It's sad that you're an actual human being.

572
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,680
Unnie, do you know this person?

573
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,950
He's Noona's ex-husband.

574
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,230
What? How did you know?

575
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,970
I was worried, so I kept an eye on you.

576
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:47,810
I know you were physically abused, and you recently got divorced.

577
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,840
How did you...

578
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,950
I'm sorry. Without asking you for permission...

579
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,790
I was going to tell you I knew. The reason I

580
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,300
kept asking to speak to you was because...

581
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,170
Well... that it's okay.

582
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,910
I was going to tell you I'll help you.

583
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,100
But that day, I got a little ahead of myself, so...

584
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,980
I'm sorry.

585
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,460
Are you filming a movie?

586
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,660
Did you two sleep together? You did, right?

587
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,310
Ah, really. Your name?

588
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,020
Oh Myeong Soo.

589
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,910
- Oh Myeong Soo, I'm arresting you for home invasion. 
 - What?

590
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:34,820
You have the right to a lawyer and an opportunity to explain yourself.

591
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,320
Unnie, you got hit.

592
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,550
I'm adding domestic violence charge!

593
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,850
Did he do that to your clothes, too?

594
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,460
- Sexual assault as well as attempted murder, and you were caught red-handed. 
 - No!

595
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,260
There are plenty of charges already, but you've even broken the statute regarding stalking as well.

596
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,440
What do you mean, stalking?

597
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,660
You kept following her around.

598
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,810
You committed a home invasion last time, too.

599
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,860
- Were you the one that did that to Kyeong Ah? 
 - Kyeong Ah?

600
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,650
The woman that was murdered not long ago in this neighborhood with a can of peaches.

601
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:18,550
Wow. What are you saying?

602
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,060
Check. It's in there, so check!

603
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,630
I went to the Philippines for business and came back just a few days ago.

604
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,780
Hey! Hey! I'll walk on my own!

605
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,460
Damn it! I'll get in!

606
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,390
- Get in the car quietly. 
 - What is he looking at?

607
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,130
If you have something to say, we can talk at the station.

608
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,700

609
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,080
What are you doing here?

610
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,550
I came to visit a friend and then saw you.

611
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,020
Gong San, I know you're upset, but you can't come in here.

612
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,400
Let's hurry up and leave.

613
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,750
Why are you being like this?

614
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,180

615
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,530

616
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,270
Why are you being like this? My goodness.

617
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,850
Let go!

618
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,200
Why was your friend admitted to the hospital?

619
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,120
Appendicitis.

620
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,240
It could have been dangerous since it was discovered late.

621
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,480
Your friend who?

622
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,360
Do you know all my friends?

623
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,750
If I say their name, would you know?

624
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,000
Do I need to know?

625
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,630
It's a friend you don't know.

626
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,000
Okay.

627
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,250
Why are you so mad since earlier?

628
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,610
You're acting weird.

629
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,970
Why am I weird?

630
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,380
It's weirder that you're here!

631
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,090
Where's your friend's room? Is it near here?

632
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,510
I heard it's on this floor, but I need to ask.

633
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:10,890
He kept telling me not to come.

634
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,710
I kept asking him to tell me his room number, but he wouldn't.

635
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,790
Go ask.

636
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:18,700
Okay.

637
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,300
Leave first. I'll visit my friend before I go.

638
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,940
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

639
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:43,830
The patient who received an emergency appendectomy yesterday... Kim Cheol... which room is he in?

640
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,800
Who?

641
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,240
- Kim Cheol's room. 
 - What?

642
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,500
Kim... Kim Hyeon Sik...

643
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,750
You said appendectomy, right?

644
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,930
That's not on this floor. You need to go down one floor

645
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,250
- and walk to the oppositeâ€” 
 -  Excuse me.

646
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,950
Since I'm here, let me ask you something, too.

647
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,100
Yes, what is it?

648
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,610
Her name is Nguyen Thi Zhonglin.

649
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,930
Is she among the long-term care patients here?

650
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,120
She's Vietnamese.

651
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,480
Nguyen Thi...

652
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,330
Zhonglin

653
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,200
- Zhonglin? 
 - Yes.

654
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,160
She's a mother.

655
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,110
And she's about thirty-five years old. She would've come to this hospital often.

656
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,730
I don't know exactly where she's hurting.

657
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:24,080
If she was admitted, it would have been at this hospital.

658
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,500
But even though I ask, they won't let me know the room number.

659
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,560
I'm sorry. You're going to have to ask her guardian.

660
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,630
We can't give out personal information.

661
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,570
You can't let me know?

662
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,580
I came all this way.

663
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,100
Who is this?

664
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,100
Oh, oh!

665
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,220
Are you hurt?

666
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,740
No, I came to visit someone.

667
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:47,330
If they were admitted, it would've been here, but the family doesn't want to feel indebted

668
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,070
and won't let me know the room number.

669
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,850
And the nurse says she's not allowed to either.

670
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,580
I wish she would.

671
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,700
Why, huh?

672
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,420
Who is it? I know pretty much everyone admitted here by their descriptions.

673
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,150
Oh, you might!

674
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,840
It's a Vietnamese woman, and she married this neighborhood's real estate owner.

675
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,510
They have one daughter, and her name is Yool. Seo Yool.

676
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,690
- Yool's mom? 
 - Hey, be quiet.

677
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,500
I know her. Of course, I do.

678
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,620
You do? Which room is she in?

679
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,160
She wasn't admitted here.

680
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,490
She wasn't?

681
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:27,940
Sometimes she would come to our neighborhood's foreigner get-togethers,

682
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,650
but it's been a long time since she's come.

683
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,170
And if she was here, there's no way I wouldn't know!

684
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,820
Is it a different hospital?

685
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,250
Why? Is she sick?

686
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,330
Well...

687
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,390
From all that physical abuse, of course she would end up sick.

688
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,660
Abused? By whom?

689
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,090
Who do you think?

690
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,690
Be quiet.

691
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,710
It's common for people in international marriages to be victims of domestic violence.

692
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,010
It's just that they keep quiet.

693
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,390
Caregiver!

694
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,620
- I'm leaving. 
 - Thank you!

695
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,200
Gong San, how did you know that?

696
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,490
How could I not? I visited them often when Yool was younger.

697
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,440
And even though I stopped going for about a year, I can tell.

698
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:16,320
Geum Seong was ordering makeup for his wife, and he bought a concealer.

699
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,230
She doesn't even wear makeup, but he bought so much.

700
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,460
Concealer?

701
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,800
To cover any scars or bruises!

702
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,510
But you never actually witnessed him hitting her?

703
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,150
Did you see any bruises or scars?

704
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,830
Do I need to see to know? Do I?

705
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,970
You can just tell.

706
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:36,970
But... back then you pretended not to know, so why are you looking for her now?

707
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,940
It's been a while since I haven't seen her, so I'm concerned.

708
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:44,770
I figured I would just quickly see her since I'm already here.

709
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,700
Did she run away to Vietnam?

710
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,210

711
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,400
Gong San!

712
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,440

713
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,590
What are you doing?

714
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,170
Thinking.

715
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,110
About what?

716
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:23,130
Earlier, Yool came in to buy something

717
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,810
and just left without her stuff after paying.

718
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:29,020
Do I deliver them to her or just wait?

719
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,970
Do I refund her or give her the items?

720
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:33,270
Yool? Why?

721
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:37,080
Earlier, when I pushed up her sleeve, she had a blister.

722
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,020
It definitely looked like a burn scar.

723
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,450
So, I was going to put some ointment on it for her, but she ran out.

724
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:47,140
Why is her father just leaving it like that?

725
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,600
Give it to me. The things Yool bought.

726
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,220
These.

727
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,370
- Here. 
 - Part-Time!

728
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:07,480

729
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:19,260

730
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,400

731
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,390
What are you doing here?

732
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,660
Where's your dad?

733
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,420
I don't know.

734
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,670
Yool, do you know the door code for the office?

735
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,980
Why?

736
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,530
I'm just worried you might have to wait long for your dad.

737
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,500
Dad will be back soon.

738
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,520
He told me we'd go home together.

739
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,970
Here.

740
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,220
Your change.

741
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,950
What did the detective say?

742
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,870
You didn't go to jail?

743
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:59,730
- What? 
 - That detective thought you were the criminal.

744
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,740
Oh, no. It was a misunderstanding.

745
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,350
I know.

746
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,160
Oh, thank...

747
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,180
- What? 
 - I know you're not the criminal.

748
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,010
How? How do you know?

749
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,700
- That day, did you really see something? 
 - Ow!

750
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,820
Yool, it's okay. Nothing will happen.

751
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,830
So, tell me everything.

752
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,930
About what?

753
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:47,590
Your scars... did your dad do this?

754
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,960
What are you doing with my kid?

755
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:10,290

756
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:14,090

757
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:19,560
â™«  While I remember you, I feel like a fool  â™«

758
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:25,170
â™«   Why didn't I know, even when I kept you close   â™«

759
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:30,690
â™«   Your cruelty, baby   â™«

760
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,150
â™«   I must've looked so stupid   â™«

761
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:36,080
  Auntie killed someone?

762
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,790
â™«  Just how low   â™«

763
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,710
  Hey! I really don't think it's Gong San.

764
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,120
  Were you following me?

765
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,810
  We need to start from the beginning. Wake up.

766
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,090
  What was the reason we started suspecting the mart's employees?

767
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:52,120
 The items found at the crime scene are the same items purchased by the murderer.

768
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,170
  That's right.

769
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:59,290
 If he's the culprit, staying home knowing there's nothing more he can do,

770
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,380
 wouldn't that be best?

771
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,260
â™«  How much did you plan out  â™«

772
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:07,000
 Just call me anytime you're hurt or scared.

773
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,630
â™«  After I poured everything out  â™«

774
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,030
  Let's catch him.

775
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,320
 We'll catch him.

776
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,090
â™«  You can tell me no- no- no-  â™«

777
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,740
â™«  You can tell me nothing  â™«
