1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,360

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,570

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,260

5
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,790

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,670
Who are you?

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,370
Ah Hee!

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,790
Oppa!

9
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,450

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,770
  Why would we try to find something that not even the police are searching for?

11
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,670
  What if we go out of business from rumors that we doubt our customers?! What then?

12
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,480
  Miss, take those and throw them away or whatever you want with them.

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,290
  Please leave, okay?

14
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,220
  Leave, I said!

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,360
She-She said she was scared,

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,240
but I told her to leave. I kicked her out.

17
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,910
Is this the police? Yes.

18
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,710
This is Naedeuri Apartment, Building 103, Unit 402.

19
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,020
Yes.

20
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,250
Oppa, don't do it!

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,320
You don't have to do it!

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,700
That's right, don't do it.

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,440
And you call him your boyfriend?

24
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,530
Seriously. You really can't read the room.

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,020

26
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,570
Ow, my arm! My arm!

27
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,370
- I tapped out! 
  - Your arm isn't broken.

28
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,830
Don't be a crybaby!

29
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,180
Why are you guys doing this to me? What did I do?

30
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,930
You were the one who held me hostage and threatened my life first.

31
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,870
I only did that because that bastard was chasing me, and I was trying to run away.

32
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,910
Usually, people don't run away when someone follows them.

33
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,750
You ran away because you did something wrong, didn't you?

34
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,230
What did I do wrong?

35
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,530
When, where, who, what, at what hour, minute, and second?

36
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,300
I'm going to report you all! You guys are in big trouble now. You and that bastard... I'm going to report you all!

37
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,220
How did you get hurt here?

38
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,730
When?

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,610
Why? Why do you want to know, fatty bastard?

40
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,600
The only person who can call him "Fatty" is me.

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,670
Ah Hee, at what age did you call me "Fatty?"

42
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,770
Before I went into elementary school.

43
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,840
Right? When I turned eleven.

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,170
Only until then... I was fat.

45
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,420
  Our mart, I will protect it!

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,400

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,390
  This person moved to our neighborhood ten years ago.

48
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,600
Nephew.

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,010
Damn it!

50
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,590
Repeat after me. "To give allowance to my nieces and nephews."

51
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,310
What? What?

52
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,380
- What is that? 
 - There's something like that.

53
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,330
- Repeat it. "To give allowance to my nieces and nephews." 
 - Okay, okay I'll do it.

54
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,820
To give allowance to my nieces and nephews.

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,630
  To give allowance to my nieces and nephews.

56
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,210
It's you, 5,000 Won.

57
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,840
What?

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,290
5,000 Won. The punk who used a fake bill at our mart and got caught.

59
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,740
What? He's that legendary 5,000 Won?

60
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,870
Yes, that 5,000 Won.

61
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,540
But that person...

62
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,000
you killed.

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,150
How did you... know that?

64
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,640
That's because...

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,330
I saw it!

66
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,790
  You need to prepare for the unexpected.

67
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,990
  How to protect yourself with self-defense.

68
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,870

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,650

70
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,970
 The cable tie doesn't break and just tightens more around the wrist.

71
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,960
 What is the way to escape out of these cable ties?

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,140
 Just remember these three things.

73
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,580
 1. Have your body straightened out.

74
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,580
 2. Raise your hands high above your head.

75
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,890
 3. Tighten your core and with force move your elbows as far back as you can.

76
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,570
  The cable tie broke on the first try

77
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,420
  Wow, is that possible?

78
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,060
  The way to escape cable ties, remember this!

79
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,820
 You... You put me in a tiny little cell.

80
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,190
 Wow, and thanks to me,

81
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,580
 you grew your mart into a success. It's not fair!

82
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,850
 Damn it! Come here, come here!

83
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,110
 D-Do you know what makes me go mad? Huh?

84
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,500
 In prison, the fact that I went down at the hands of an old lady and little kid.

85
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,630
 That rumor went around the prison and all the young bastards there, looked down on me!

86
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,680
 Do you know that?!

87
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,140
 Come here!

88
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,330
 Come here! Hold still!

89
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,690
 I said stay still!

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,030
 Save me! Save me!

91
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,320
 Fatty. Where's Fatty!?

92
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
 Fatty!

93
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,050
 You, if you don't come out at the count of three, then your mom will die because of you!

94
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,720
 I'm here, you bastard!

95
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,920
 Geez.

96
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,210

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,730
  3. Tighten your core and with force move your elbows as far back as you can.

98
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,160

- Fatty!

99
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,340
 You bastard! Over here!

100
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,360
 I'm near the canned goods! Mom, you go to the condiment section!

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,050
 I'll kill you!

102
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,260
 Here! Dae Seong, run!

103
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,980
 - Fatty!! 
 - Run!

104
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,930
 Fatty!

105
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,500
 Why are you doing this to us?!

106
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,580
That was you?

107
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,050
Because of that witness, my mom was so anxious.

108
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,600
I was going to tell you, but I was scared.

109
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,800
And even though I waited, you guys never said anything about what happened at the mart.

110
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,580
Then, even though you saw someone get killed at the mart, you didn't report it?

111
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,840
That was your fault!

112
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,420
That's called self-defense.

113
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,120
But still, you're a police officer!

114
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,520
Back then, I was an elementary student!

115
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,900
Because of that, I became a police officer, so I could take down the bad guys!

116
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,040
Why did you do it? To get revenge on me?

117
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,410
You tried to kill me! Would you have done nothing?!

118
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,470
Still, how could you kill someone?

119
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,450
Especially someone who has nothing to do with me?

120
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,410
What are you talking about?

121
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,490
Who killed whom?

122
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,510
I might commit fraud but not murder!

123
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,250
You killed Kwon Bo Yeon!

124
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,220
The Choco Pie and vitamin candy are unmistakably your M.O.

125
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,370
You pretended to be a witness after killing her just so you wouldn't be suspected, right when I was passing by on purpose!

126
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,140
You'd better start telling me what you were doing last Tuesday night from 10:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m,

127
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,360
and where you were in detail.

128
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,580
What's with this mood?

129
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,400
I didn't do it. I didn't kill her!

130
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,220
A murderer should use honorifics!

131
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,810
Wow, this is crazy! It wasn't me!

132
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,570
You have the right to remain silent.

133
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,550
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

134
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,010
You have the right to an attorney.

135
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,040
- Mom, I'll call you right— 
 - Team Leader, Sir.

136
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,620
I'm telling you it wasn't me! You can't just do this!

137
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,540
You don't even have evidence!

138
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,590
You can't come in. Please move away!

139
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,970
I'm the guardian. Her son. Ahn Dae Seong.

140
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,920
I'm her son, Ahn Dae Seong.

141
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,960
- Mom. 
 - Oh, Dae Seong.

142
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,700
I... felt bad about what I said to her, so I just...

143
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,320
While I was making deliveries in the area, I just...

144
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,790
I was just going to see her for a second, but...

145
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,050

146
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,810
Real Estate...

147
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,780
Real Estate asked me for a favor, so I went in with him.

148
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,120
The can was laying there, and it scared me so much!

149
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,030
I felt so bad toward that lady. What do I do, Dae Seong?

150
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,400
Mom, you don't need to be scared. I caught 5,000 Won.

151
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,640
5,000 Won? What are you talking about all of a sudden?

152
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,970
- 5,000 Won was the culprit. 
 - What?

153
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,190
Kwon Bo Yeon, and now Lee Kyeong Ah...

154
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,890
She was killed with the canned peaches, right? Was she struck in the head?

155
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,390
Ahn Dae Seong, you don't need to worry about this anymore, so—

156
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,250
5,000 Won bought canned peaches and a can opener at our store.

157
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,520
The Catholic church volunteer bought them for him and took them to him at the hospital, and today—

158
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,490
5,000 Won was at our store?!

159
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,500
Geez, why are you bringing me up here?

160
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,390
That's the nunchuck grandpa!

161
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,540
So... the nunchuck grandpa is 5,000 Won.

162
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,440
He was hiding out in our neighborhood for 10 years, but we didn't know.

163
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Stand up straight!

164
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,710
I'm hurting...

165
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,490
Oh, Miss Han, what are you—

166
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,350
Ouch! Why are you—

167
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,500
Oh! 5,000 Won!

168
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,630
Since he was pretending to be an old man who's 30 years older,

169
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,850
we didn't even think to take a good look at him.

170
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,950
Officer Do, are you sure it's him? Did you check to make sure?

171
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,980
We'll need to check to make sure since he was pretending to be someone else,

172
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,340
but he confessed to being 5,000 Won.

173
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,000
See?! I told you! I told you it wasn't true,

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,520
but you suspected my son of murder!

175
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,850
At that time, I really thought he had died.

176
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,310
 Oh!

177
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,530
 Sir...

178
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,650
 I...

179
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,890
 Please save me.

180
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,330
 Please...

181
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,970

182
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,580
But you left me out there to die!

183
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,340
I didn't pretend to be dying! I was—

184
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,110
Be quiet, you bastard!

185
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,920
You son of a gun! You deserve to die! You bastard.

186
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,930
Why do I deserve to die?!

187
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,250
It's all your fault, you bastard!

188
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,050
How dare you call him names?

189
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,460
Do you know what you did to him?!

190
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,840
Because you disappeared back then instead of dying,

191
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,160
he got so worried that you'd be back that

192
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,750
he was never able to take his exams properly,

193
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,830
and instead, he spent all his years at the mart!

194
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,510
 - Good luck! 
 - Take your time!

195
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,910
 - Good luck! 
 - You can do it!

196
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,490
 Good luck! Good luck, everyone!

197
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,360

198
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,980
 To give allowance to my nieces and nephews.

199
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,210
 I went to the bank and changed them into brand new bills.

200
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,250
 To give allowance to my nieces and nephews.

201
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,900

202
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,920

203
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,980

204
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,530

205
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,480
I... I thought I was a fool to open a mart

206
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,710
and ruin my kid's life, so... That bastard...

207
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,860
Ahn Dae Seong?

208
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,560
You're at the crime scene before us again. Is it a coincidence?

209
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,140
Right, exactly! It's too strange to call it a coincidence!

210
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,790
That bastard was hanging around the area where

211
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,220
- the dead body was found, too! 
 - Bastard!

212
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,200
How dare you try and accuse my son! This bastard is a counterfeit bill offender.

213
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,280
He is faking his identity!

214
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,990
I'm sure this bastard killed both women!

215
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,690
I killed them?! No, I didn't!

216
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,560
- How dare you?! 
 - Please stop.

217
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,950
- Stop! 
 - Go ahead and hit me! Kill me!

218
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,880
Are you having a neighborhood meeting at the crime scene? How will we catch the culprit this way?

219
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,760
But still, I don't think this is unrelated to this case.

220
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,620
It always seemed strange that he fainted after finding the body.

221
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,670
He went overboard. He was spinning nunchucks every morning and night at the vicinity of where the body was found.

222
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,320
How could he not know what happened there?

223
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,630
Wow! Geez!

224
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,690
It wasn't me. It really wasn't!

225
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,500
If someone was going to hide the body, they would do it when I wasn't around.

226
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,630
Not when I'm hanging out around there!

227
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,700
We're not saying you're the witness!

228
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,310
- We're saying you're the murderer! 
 - Punk!

229
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,980
- Geez. 
 - Officer Do, take these three home.

230
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,040
We won't get anywhere like this.

231
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,430
- What about him? 
 - Leave him here and come back. Detective Choi will carry out the investigation.

232
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,600
Detective Cho, take him.

233
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,480
I'll take the suspect.

234
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,890
Sorry, Miss Han. I got you involved for no reason.

235
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,150
It's all right. You must have been very shocked, too.

236
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,880
Oh right. Yool must be home alone.

237
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,780
Go on home.

238
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,340
Then I'll get going.

239
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,830
Mother, please get in.

240
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,220
It's okay. I feel stifled.

241
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,530
I'm going to walk instead.

242
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,200
- Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

243
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,700
Pardon? Huh?

244
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,270
For not being able to save you from danger at the hospital lobby.

245
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,520
Did it look like I was in danger?

246
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,030
I took my time because I was trying to calm you down, not that bastard.

247
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,950
Geez.

248
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:14,370
Hey, I heard... you knew everything.

249
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,640
Yes.

250
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,490
I wasn't pretending not to know, but... I'm sorry.

251
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,300
Geez. You were so young and you couldn't say anything.

252
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,720
You must have been so troubled.

253
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,510
Do you still not know Ah Hee? Did you not see her back there?

254
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,840
What?

255
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,800
I... wanted to save Oppa.

256
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,910
That's why I became a police officer.

257
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,750
I tried to keep that bad guy from setting foot in this neighborhood again.

258
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,530
Oh, I know.

259
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:01,610
That's why that punk couldn't do anything around here for ten years!

260
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,280
It's all thanks to you.

261
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,110
- I'm proud of you. 
 - Mother.

262
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,400
Let's go.

263
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,880
Ah Hee, do you know...

264
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,270
how I lived with an immature person like Dae Seong's dad?

265
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,990
I told myself to look at the good in him twice and the not-so-good once.

266
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,280
That's how I've lived.

267
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,840
Removing bad things from your sight and heart.

268
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,480
That's the way to protect our family.

269
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,940
That's how I thought.

270
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,780
But, maybe I was wrong to be that way since—

271
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,710
You didn't do anything wrong.

272
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,420
What did we do wrong?

273
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,920
Do you know what really makes me mad?

274
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,870
Because of that pathetic person, I feel like my life has become pathetic as well.

275
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,030
I was on TV and people called me smart, so I actually thought I was.

276
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,000
In reality,

277
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,850
I was just a pathetic person who had nothing.

278
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,620
Ahn Dae Sung! Why are you pathetic?

279
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,830
If you fail some tests a couple of times, does that make you a pathetic person?

280
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,340
Also, you weren't the only one who was scared.

281
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,800
- You were scared too? 
 - Then what, am I not human?

282
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,240
How could I go to sleep peacefully having gone through something like that?

283
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,010
Even now, I wake up in the middle of the night and go down to the mart with a kitchen knife to see if anything's wrong.

284
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,380
I'm glad that bastard was caught.

285
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,050
Now, there won't be any reason for us to lose sleep from feeling anxious.

286
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,150
- So, stop coming to the mart from now on. 
 - What?

287
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:10,240
We caught the bastard, so now we have nothing to be afraid of or anxious of.

288
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,530
- It's enough now. 
 - Then, what do I do now?

289
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,350
- Why are you asking me? 
 - I can really do whatever I want?

290
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,360
- Of course. 
 - Well, let me complete the month.

291
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,130
I'll finish the month. We also need to raise our sales.

292
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,370
I promised you.

293
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,060
  - It was a young lady. 
 - She must've been so scared!

294
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,560
  It's so scary!

295
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,370
One second.

296
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,960
Wow.

297
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,710
Ah Hee.

298
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,210
♫  Orange dream, do you remember?  ♫

299
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,520
- It's chilly. 
 - Thank you.

300
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,450
What is this?

301
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,950
Wait a bit, I'll give you something really delicious.

302

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,740
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

320
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,400
Oppa.

321
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,330
Are you really going to keep working at the mart?

322
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,800
I won't be able to do it forever.

323
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,040
I'll quit after I confirm that 5,000 Won is really the criminal.

324
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,840
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

325
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,300
Because you were the first one to discover the body?

326
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,890
Don't tell me something I want to hear.

327
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,010
I keep thinking of this.

328
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,720
This laundry machine toy?

329
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,300
Kwon Bo Yeon bought this the last time she came to the mart.

330
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:20,260
Usually, she doesn't, but she strangely talked to me first that day.

331
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,360
 - Welcome. 
 - Hello.

332
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,230

333
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,520
 You should put a lot more in stock.

334
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,820
 Why? Is it part of the supplies for the daycare center?

335
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,960
 No, it’s supplies for adults.

336
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,460
 - One glass of soju and half a cup of beer and mix it. 
 - What?

337
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,030
 That laundry machine is good for making somaek. 
  (T/N: somaek is soju and beer mixed together)

338
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,080
 What?

339
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,180
 One of our daycare children's parents taught us.

340
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,680
 Then, even if you drink alone you won't be bored.

341
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,650
 - 14,340 won, please. 
 - Here you go.

342
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,290
 - Okay, do you need a receipt? 
 - Yes.

343
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,190
 Thank you.

344
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,130

345
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,980
 Oh, did I finally pass 30,000 points?

346
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,900
 Wow, then I can use the points next time. Right?

347
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,360
 Yes. Don't forget to use them.

348
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,290
 Yes, thank you.

349
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,830
That memory of her...

350
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,250
keeps playing in my head.

351
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,280
At first, I only thought about seeing her dead body.

352
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,230
But all of a sudden,

353
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,370
it's her on that day

354
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,210
that I kept thinking about it.

355
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:57,790
Kwon Bo Yeon and Lee Kyeong Ah, were both fine and alive.

356
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,760
It's so weird.

357
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,680
This is really good.

358
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:25,480
Do you think it tastes the same as what Kwon Bo Yeon drank?

359
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,500

360
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,700
Wait a second. Rewind it again.

361
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,560
Just a bit more.

362
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,180
A bit more.

363
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,020
Look. The person walking right there. That's her, right?

364
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,530
Yes, that's right.

365
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,120
Okay.

366
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,070
Team Leader, we found it.

367
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,660
So you hung the plastic bags on the doors.

368
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,870
But someone swapped out the things inside? How does that make sense?

369
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,830
I'm telling you, it's the truth!

370
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,820
The one who placed the plastic bag on the door, that was me, but—

371
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,290
Then, why did you do that?

372
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,070
To get revenge.

373
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,000
If a strange rumor spread about the mart, then women wouldn't go to that mart anymore.

374
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,010
That would ruin both that bastard and the mart.

375
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,010
I deserved to see that happen!

376
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,040
Okay, then what?

377
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,970
I really didn't kill anybody though!

378
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,150
 T-That, Choco-Pie.

379
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,610
 I only put that in the bag!

380
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,520
 Then, what about the tampon?

381
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,510
What's that?

382
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,970
How do you use this thing?

383
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,470
It's a menstrual pad.

384
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:12,690
Oh, for when women.... with wings—

385
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,830
So how do you expect us to believe what you say?!

386
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:22,480
For ten years, you planned this and hid out while pretending to be an old man, and you want us to believe you?

387
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,880
If it were you, would you be able to believe it?

388
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,420
This is all because of that bastard!

389
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Because of that bastard, I even went to prison!

390
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,530
I-I even worked really hard with my business so that

391
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,500
I can live my life, but that went to ruins, too!

392
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,900
Do you know how much I suffered because of that?

393
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,310
Then one day, I got all withered and wrinkled.

394
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:50,220
All my hair fell out and that's when my voice got all weird.

395
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,490
That's when people started calling me, "Grandpa."

396
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,020
So, sir, you're saying you only put the Choco-Pie in the bag

397
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,560
and spread false rumors, so the mart would go out of business,

398
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,000
and put the bags where young women lived alone?

399
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,430
- Only to raise fear. 
 - Exactly.

400
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,130
That's all I did.

401
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,510
Okay, well. Firstly, you confessed to stalking.

402
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,710
What confession? When did I confess?!

403
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,940
I-I only put the Choco-Pies there!

404
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,420
You did it to raise fear, sir, so it falls under crime.

405
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:31,270
 And, sir, your update is a bit slow, so you didn't know stalking was a crime.

406
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,890
From now on, we have a lot of time. A lot of time to even reveal a murder.

407
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,940
No! I didn't kill! What do you mean murder?!

408
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,880
Write this again!

409
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,790
I didn't kill anyone!

410
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,550
- Oh, no! 
 - This is why I'm against redevelopment.

411
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,560
If our neighborhood goes through redevelopment and wanderers come pouring in, then how will we deal with it?

412
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,240
Will you ladies be able to do that? Isn't that right?

413
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,080
That's why you ladies should also sign against redevelopment.

414
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,410
- Hurry. 
 - But, ladies, did you hear anything else?

415
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,540
I heard similar things have happened many times in the past.

416
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,090
Like plastic bags from Dae Seong Mart being hung on the doors of women living alone.

417
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,270
Wait, so that old man's been doing that all these years?

418
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:19,350
No, from what I've heard, it's the son of the mart's owners.

419
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,550
No way! The father that runs the mart is so handsome—

420
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,260
I-I mean good.

421
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,840
But actually, there's an even scarier story than that.

422
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,650
In the past, he killed someone and hid the body inside the mart.

423
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,930
Hey, hey! Let's leave.

424
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,790
But isn't it weird?

425
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:47,940
Ahn Dae Seong, back when he was young, he used to be able to differentiate fake bills with one look.

426
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,760
But he wasn't able to recognize me for ten years? Does that make any sense?

427
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,150
So that means he knew the truth all along.

428
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,280
And he just pretended not to know.

429
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,850
And he used me to fulfill his needs.

430
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,750
And he placed all the blame on me!

431
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:12,570
- He totally planned all of this— 
 - Sir, it seems like that was your plan.

432
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,910
That punk has killed someone before.

433
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:24,030
Me! I almost died, really.

434
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,370
That jerk thought I was dead and just shamelessly went on living his life.

435
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:35,350
Killing someone? The first time is hard but not the second or third time!

436
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:41,530
Wow, sir, you are smart. Coaching a detective on investigation techniques.

437
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,370
But that's not enough for you to weasel out of this.

438
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:48,390
Sir, we have evidence against you, but with Ahn Dae Seong there's only suspicion and no hard evidence.

439
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,490
Then, what if it turns out that it's not me? Then, what will you do?

440
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,000
What?

441
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,060
Okay, then I will be in prison

442
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,700
and if another young woman dies in the same way, then my alibi will be certain.

443
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,290
Then, you'll believe me!

444
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,910
  He's not the criminal?

445
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,550
I knew you wouldn't believe me, so I even brought the CCTV tapes.

446
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,040
  Hello, you should try these.

447
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,380
  Thank you.

448
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,350
His alibi holds up during the suspected time of the murder.

449
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,640
Since his alibi is airtight, we can't insist he's the criminal.

450
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,860
You said he confessed to stalking!

451
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,890
He probably has an accomplice!

452
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,280
Detective Choi will take care of it. He said that he can hold him at least for a couple of days so--

453
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,560
Do Rah Ee, don't be mad.

454
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,210
If you get frown lines, you'll look old. Hand.

455
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,710
Hand.

456
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,520
Keep up the hard work.

457
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,020
Oh, here.

458
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,850
Keep up the hard work!

459
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,500
You're not eating lunch? Aren't you hungry?

460
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,100
Noona, do you think that if we held a singing competition, our sales would go up?

461
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,550
I wonder... I think we could attract more customers though.

462
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,190
You're working hard.

463
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,100
- Then, I'll eat first. 
 - Okay.

464
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,740
- Did you eat? 
 - Hope you have a good lunch.

465
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:54,060

466
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,980
Hey.

467
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,600
Do you have a hair tie?

468
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,400
I don't have one.

469
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,880
Noona, here.

470
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,810
What is this?

471
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,700
Why are you giving me this?

472
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,770
My older sister asked me to buy it for her, but since you need it, you can use it for now.

473
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,860
Hey, your sister has the same taste as me.

474
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,450
Thank you. I'll use it well.

475
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,940
I'll give you money, so you can order a new one.

476
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,790
No, it's okay. Eat a lot.

477
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Unnie, where have you been? We were waiting for so long.

478
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,120
And now we're going to eat.

479
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,400
Let's do an exorcism.

480
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,160
Naosan Bodhisattva is close to a shaman who's especially good.

481
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,130
She got her spiritual possession only a couple of days ago.

482
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,010
Why is a cook at a temple close to a shaman?

483
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,600
Is that important now?

484
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,540
This location having bad energy is what's important. Our workplace!

485
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,360
It's had bad mojo since the counterfeit bill offender appeared way back when.

486
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,590
You said that, thanks to that, the mart got expanded.

487
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,130
You can't say the location has bad energy.

488
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,610
Maybe...

489
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,310
Still, two of the mart's customers died.

490
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,500
Also, Dae Seong was the first one to find the body!

491
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,470
Sit down. Sit.

492
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,470
Second Boss.

493
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,420
Dae Seong, the fact that you never passed the civic exam could be because of this location's bad energy.

494
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,870
Why are you talking about that right now?

495
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,710
True. I thought the vegetable section felt unusually cold.

496
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,000
I wear long johns from September.

497
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,650
I get this blast of chill right where my top comes down to.

498
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,790
That's from the fridge.

499
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,030
Oh, geez. What do we do if the mart goes out of business?!

500
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,690
Everyone knows that I work here. I'll be lucky if they don't call me bad luck!

501
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,430
Everyone's worried about the real estate value going down as it is!

502
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,030
But I heard they caught the culprit.

503
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,530
Then, isn't everything okay now?

504
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,620
That nunchuck?

505
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,550
Hey, hey, hey!  They said he's just a stalker.

506
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,740
I heard the murderer is someone else.

507
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,570
- Who told you that? 
 - I was just at the police substation.

508
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,710
Team Leader Kim was telling Do Rah Ee.

509
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,590
What's wrong with him?

510
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,190
There's nothing we can do legally.

511
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,790
So be careful from now on.

512
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,450
It's a stun gun. Ask your mother to carry it while going out for deliveries.

513
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,130
5,000 Won.

514
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,800
Can 5,000 Won get released then?

515
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,420
Even if he is prosecuted under the Stalking Prevention Law, the punishment will be light.

516
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,340
And it's not as if there is any victim who can file a civil lawsuit against him.

517
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,310
But the canned peaches are the murder weapon!

518
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,040
Choco Pie and canned peaches, are all connected to me.

519
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,620
Right. They are connected to you, too.

520
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,190
If we just consider it as a murder weapon, you could be under suspicion as well.

521
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,380
What?

522
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:18,250
I know how you feel, but don't talk about this case to anyone other than me.

523
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,130
Understand?

524
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,670
Isn't there any CCTV near the Kwon Bo Yeon crime scene?

525
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,680
No. There is one on the playground, but not over there since it is so secluded.

526
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,960
Because it's secluded, there should be a CCTV!

527
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,870
Why are you saying that to me?

528
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,530
Gosh!!!

529
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,610
But if that grandpa gets out...

530
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,670
They said he's not a grandpa.

531
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,170
Right. If that counterfeit bill offender gets out,

532
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,000
he'll stay in this neighborhood?

533
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,120
Since his home is here. At least for now.

534
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,850
Right?

535
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:55,810
On the days I have to close, I get scared to walk home.

536
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,910
- Well, I can— 
 - Ask your husband to come and pick you up.

537
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,580
What?

538
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,780
He works late every day lately.

539
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,590
He's busy.

540
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,630
You should start doing your job properly.

541
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,300
Sure.

542
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,360
 Two squids for 10,000 won. Two for 10,000 won. If you're nice, three for 10,000!

543
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,600
Handsome young man, sing us a song. A trot!

544
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,090
I can't sing, Ma'am!

545
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,550
Maybe some rap then?

546
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,870
Ah, let's see, let's see.

547
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,210
Let's take a look.

548
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,170
Let's take a look at today's fish.

549
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,250
Mackerel is very blue,

550
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,390
and the squid is very fresh.

551
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,060
Hairtail is dazzling!

552
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,530
Which one would you like?

553
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,400
Squid.

554
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,870
Squid. Two squids coming up!

555
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,580
Two squids, okay.

556
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,700
He's a keeper.

557
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,880
  Let me get some!

558
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,920
Thank you.

559
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,360
What's his true identity?

560
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,610

561
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,450
 Goodbye!

562
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,440
 Two squids coming up!

563
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,990
 Two squids, two squids coming up!

564
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,070
- Hey! 
  - Two squids.

565
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,060
- What is it? 
  - We're having a quick sale!

566
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,050
What's with the beef jerky?

567
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,010
My dad got another factory to expand his business.

568
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,820
Why is it so good?

569
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,060
What is it about?

570
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,230
You asked me to come out!

571
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,870
- Oh right. 
 - "Oh right?"

572
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,120
Do you know where Fish lives?

573
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,980
- Fish? 
 - Do you know anyone who does know? It's not Nadeuri Apartments, is it?

574
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,410
I heard he moved before he started working here...

575
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:59,610
I don't know where though. You can look at his resume.

576
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,330
We have his resume?

577
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:04,410
I guess someone hired through nepotism wouldn't know things like that.

578
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,060
Why? You think Fish is the culprit?

579
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,370
No. Why do you think he's the culprit?

580
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:12,970
Not me! I'm asking if that's what you think!

581
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,010
Punk, did you burn your brain along with your exam workbooks?!

582
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,700
- You live alone, right? 
 - Pardon?

583
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,330
I get really lonely usually, but I was glad to be living alone yesterday.

584
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:34,520
How could I split something this delicious with someone?

585
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,810
- Come back. 
 - I will!

586
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,950
Hello, welcome!

587
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:57,040

588
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,610
So he does live at Nadeuri Apartments.

589
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,200
Young Choon.

590
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,340
It's so sweet!

591
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,820
It's the mart lady.

592
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,910
Yool!

593
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:28,130
Yool, you were here?

594
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,110
Did you eat?

595
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,740
Do you want some tangerines?

596
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,760
How is it? Sweet?

597
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,750
Do you want some more?

598
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,790
No, I'm good.

599
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,680
Come on. Your eyes look sunken in.

600
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,660
You're really hungry, aren't you?

601
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,740
I'm on my way home. Why don't you come with me?

602
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,090
I'll make you something to eat.

603
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,130
My dad will get angry if I go home with just anyone.

604
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,840
He won't get angry since he knows me!

605
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,960
Right? It's okay, right?

606
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,040
Of course.

607
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,750
We can call your dad, so ask her to make you something tasty.

608
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,370
Yool, what do you like? I'll make everything for you.

609
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,180
Bulgogi?

610
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,480
Bulgogi?

611
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,690
Well, we have pork at home, so fried rice.

612
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,890
I'll make you kimchi fried rice. Doesn't that sound good?

613
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:25,060
What do you mean kimchi fried rice when she wants to eat Bulgogi?

614
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,200
I guess you don't have meat left at home.

615
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,350
I'll put in an order for you!

616
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,580
You should have said so!

617
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,650
Hey, Butchery.

618
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,020
The President of the Women's Association is on her way.

619
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,380
Pack up some Korean Beef A-Class and put it aside.

620
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,990
What?

621
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,500
How could you possibly suggest...?

622
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,160
One plus grade beef to her?

623
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,650
Two plus, okay?

624
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,800
It does seem suspicious to show interest in a woman who lives alone, but...

625
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,720
That's not all. Why would he loiter around Lee Kyeong Ah's house?

626
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,240
- What would you like? 
 -  It's suspicious.

627
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,100
We need something more concrete.

628
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,290
Still, shouldn't we check?

629
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,210
- How? 
 - I'll figure something out.

630
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,160
I'll call you.

631
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:22,120
Part-time, I'm going to the restroom.

632
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,390

633
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,860

634
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,160
There are supplies in the breakroom.

635
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,430
Go get a new pair.

636
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,290
- What are you doing? 
 - Huh?

637
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,960
Butchery wanted me to get him something.

638
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,400
What happened to your foot?

639
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,360
I got a cramp.

640
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,410
Yesterday,

641
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,210
I bought the celery by mistake instead of cilantro.

642
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,880
I think it was here somewhere.

643
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,880
I think so.

644
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,150
I nearly made celery salad.

645
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,630
Do you know the 4th floor lady died?

646
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,150
Are you scared?

647
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,770
I'm sad.

648
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:03,320
She was nice to me.

649
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,110
She gave me treats, too.

650
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,690
She must have really liked you.

651
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,750
Really?

652
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,440
Hurry home. You shouldn't be out alone these days.

653
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,220
Are you going home?

654
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,110
Yes.

655
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,140
Are you allowed to do that?

656
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,460
Aren't you working hourly, Oppa?

657
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,290
I'm not your oppa.

658
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,370
Then, what do I call you?

659
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:34,910
You can call me Fish or "you," whatever you want.

660
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,190
Don't they pay you hourly?

661
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,150
You need to fill your hours.

662
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,960
I sold everything.

663
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,500
- Team Leader. 
 - Yeah?

664
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,750
We have the fingerprint analysis results from the plastic bag hung on Kwon Bo Yeon's door.

665
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,430
Oh, okay.

666
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,500
Where's Dae Seong?

667
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,430
I thought he went to the restroom but he hasn't been back in over an hour.

668
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,150
Does he have constipation?

669
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,390
What about Fish?

670
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,610
He left early because he sold everything.

671
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,450
Really?

672
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,400
Then, starting tomorrow I should order more!

673
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,590
He wanted me to tell you that he already ordered more.

674
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,320
You've seen "Silence of the Lambs," right?

675
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,910
No, not Hannibal. That character named Buffalo something.

676
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,400
The pervert who makes clothes out of female victims' skin.

677
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,050
 That doesn't count as evidence.

678
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,290
Not unless there's something belonging to the victim.

679
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,780
  Are you okay?

680
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,010
I think I've found evidence.

681
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:03,190
 For now, just leave everything and don't touch anything.

682
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,030
  Why? What's wrong?

683
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,330
  Did you get caught?

684
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,830

685
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:32,310

686
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,830
Sorry.

687
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,590
He's better at makeup than me.

688
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,140
He's coming out.

689
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,720
We have the evidence. Why do we have to follow him?

690
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,260
What if he does something while he's out?

691
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,030
You said he even confirmed earlier that a customer lived alone.

692
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:18,340

693
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,540
Oppa!

694
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,760

695
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,600
Is there someone there?

696
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,380

697
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:41,020

698

♫   Getting the courage   ♫

699

♫   To look over   ♫

700
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,210
  You can't trust anybody. I think it's a good idea to rule out the mart's employees.

701
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,060
 What?

702
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,860
♫   You've already gone so far   ♫

703
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,790
  Is there something I shouldn't know about?

704
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:03,830
 It's a far more certain motive than I had thought.  Gong San is very ambitious.

705
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,610
  Sir, there are rumors that you're the criminal.

706
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,250
 That it's a murderer's store.

707
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,880
  Why are you asking the wrong person instead of catching the criminal?

708
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:17,670
 The spot where the shoe fell could be the actual crime scene and Yool could be the eyewitness.

  Yool!

714
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,300
  Do you know of any places she could have gone?
