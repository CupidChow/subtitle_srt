00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,848
[BRING THE SOUL DOCU SERIES:
EP6. ENERGY]

2
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,327
What is Germany famous for?

3
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,697
Beer, of course.
Shall we?

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,601
Their signature dish is

5
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,669
- Schweinshaxe
- Ham hock is famous

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,804
It's popular

7
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,207
Which beer's the most popular?

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,077
Do they sell draft beer by the liter?

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,744
They do

10
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,213
- Okay, let's go for it
- Sure, which one?

11
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,348
Aren't you going to have one?

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:50,917
Why not?

13
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,620
- I'll have the same
- Okay, one liter

14
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,955
- One liter?
- One liter

15
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,191
- You should get a liter too
- Okay

16
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,260
- You too
- Me too?

17
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,294
We're getting a liter each

18
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,732
Cheers

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,700
Right here

20
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,977
Alpaca!

21
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,749
I have to go there

22
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,186
Where I can feed the sheep

23
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,054
What if it bites me?

24
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,598
What's this?

25
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,066
There's no fence

26
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,007
Am I allowed in?

27
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,845
- It's glaring at me
- It saw you

28
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,048
I'm scared I don't want to get closer

29
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,017
This zoo is very natural

30
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,721
Isn't that a Korean ox?
Like those fighting bulls?

31
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,256
One of those yellow Korean bulls?

32
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,390
That works in the fields

33
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,859
Like in that story
about oxen in the field

34
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,994
Hello, Sir

35
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,363
Which ox is a better worker?

36
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,634
The left one

37
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,503
Why did you come
all the way here

38
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,672
when you can
say it from there?

39
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,477
Why, if I did that

40
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,714
the ox on the right
might get upset

41
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,252
They're arguing over
who's stronger

42
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,388
Let's go and see

43
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,501
The weather is wonderful

44
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,337
The weather is so nice

45
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,141
It'd be nice if it
was like this in Korea

46
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,378
Perfect autum weather
when we get back

47
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,314
I wanted to be in Korea during autumn

48
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,682
but couldn't

49
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,585
There was no autumn in Korea

50
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,189
The weather's great

51
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,625
- For the final leg of the tour
- Cheers

52
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,493
Cheers

53
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,611
I think I would've been bored
if I stayed in

54
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,014
Thank you for keeping me company

55
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,463
The salt is the best part

56
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,435
Jeon Jung Kook as a person,

57
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:03,610
as a professional singer,
I wonder,

58
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,947
is my time being expended
in the best way for my career?

59
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,452
How are other artists
spending their time?

60
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,487
What kind of sacrifices are they making

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,823
for their career?

62
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,762
What's that?

63
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,766
What animal is making me so curious?

64
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,935
Its neck..

65
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,943
I thought it was an animal

66
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,381
That's a rock,
not a cow, right?

67
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,248
Yes

68
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,851
The animals are free to roam so…

69
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,821
Look up there

70
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,757
Don't get mad

71
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,098
Come here, buddy

72
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,567
Come on

73
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,913
No, don't go

74
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,015
That was a pleasant experience

75
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,550
I need to get some souvenirs

76
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,118
I didn't bring my wallet

77
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,153
It's in my bag

78
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,493
Korea's the best
when it comes to ordering

79
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,329
Just need to ring the bell

80
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,065
I want schweinshaxe

81
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:32,665
Schweinshaxe

82
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,367
I think that was a great choice

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,669
I get this high
when I order something good

84
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,138
I think it'll be good

85
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,208
I can't believe I did this 18 times

86
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,079
If I try, I can remember things

87
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,882
But time just flew me by

88
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,354
This one is 'Hopfen'

89
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,221
Hopfen

90
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,058
I'll go with Hopfen, definitely

91
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,327
Right here

92
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,295
That's my pick

93
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,601
Honestly, when I first came,

94
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,637
I couldn't even imagine
this tour being over

95
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,006
We stayed overseas
for a long time

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,209
For myself, and for BTS,

97
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:20,413
it was a huge challenge

98
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,315
Both mentally

99
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,283
and physically,

100
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,120
we had to be strong and prepared

101
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,655
No performance is easy

102
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,791
We were in a certain mindset

103
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,328
had a sort of attitude

104
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,663
Being on tour is like
running a marathon

105
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,733
You have to bear
all sorts of things

106
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,201
The same goes for
this time around

107
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,837
There is issue after issue,

108
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,239
unexpected circumstances,

109
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,209
and seven unique personalities

110
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,012
And despite all that,

111
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,914
putting on 25 3-hour long
performances.

112
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,485
Not to toot my own horn, but

113
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,854
I'd say it was a success

114
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,128
I feel awesome

115
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,163
Where's the plaza?

116
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,434
Thank you

117
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,370
She was Korean
I should at least shake her hand

118
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,576
I would have run
if only my foot was okay

119
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,848
Sightseeing's not too bad

120
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,018
Honestly, when I was in my room,

121
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,453
I thought

122
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,522
What's the point of
looking at buildings?

123
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,727
Europe, until now

124
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,297
being on tours

125
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,533
we weren't able to come

126
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,037
I was very excited,
getting ready for this tour

127
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,071
But…

128
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,841
I really wanted to show

129
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,042
who we are as a group,

130
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,478
how we perform, what we sing

131
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,447
I wanted to show everyone

132
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,886
That day,

133
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,789
my parents were there too

134
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,029
Regardless

135
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,398
the fans

136
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,170
won't want to see me be upset

137
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,639
I'm sure everyone was sad

138
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:34,413
They couldn't see all seven
performing together

139
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,782
because we were separated,

140
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,618
on stage

141
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,420
Many things crossed my mind

142
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,258
I know, of course,

143
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,495
but honestly,

144
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,663
it's really hard to let things go

145
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,899
I know I should,

146
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,101
but I still feel discontent
and regretful

147
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,770
I can't seem to hide it

148
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,910
But regret is part of
being human

149
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:07,813
No matter what,

150
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,550
I can't help but feel regret

151
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,753
That's why,

152
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,955
I really wanted a drink

153
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,023
Here

154
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,027
I am only human after all

155
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,030
I need to let off a little steam too

156
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,178
I try to do my best on stage

157
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,780
but if it doesn't go as planned

158
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,115
I can't help but get upset

159
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,718
I always want to show my best

160
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,654
I remember the ones
that I make mistakes on

161
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,059
I always push myself to be good,
not make mistakes

162
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,896
But I think I should
cut myself some slack

163
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,932
I'm completely pumped on stage

164
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,102
but when I'm done, I'm down

165
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,404
This cycle is on repeat everyday

166
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,274
I get sensitive about
the littlest things

167
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,844
I only want to show
the finished result

168
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,981
not the work in progress

169
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,051
There are lots of
difficult moments in between

170
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,323
But on the other hand

171
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,725
though it might be hard

172
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,893
I think our fans will feel

173
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,929
a different kind of love for us

174
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,998
It's not all pain all the time

175
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,767
And throughout the tour,

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,871
I get to learn more about myself

177
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,439
It's painful,

178
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,475
and this side of me

179
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,543
might seem less attractive
to others

180
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,747
I thought, being okay
with everything

181
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,283
looked cool and mature

182
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,952
I though that was expected
of an artist

183
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,620
That's what I thought

184
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,390
But what can I do?
That's just not me

185
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,392
The end of this pain means

186
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,861
the end of this euphoria

187
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,096
All this can go away

188
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,132
But I don't want to be
the one to take it away

189
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,701
Because

190
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,070
because

191
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,773
I have this faith

192
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,841
I know that I need to do this

193
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,837
I'll give you a detailed
look at Jung Kook

194
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,539
Jung Kook has a mole on his ear

195
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,774
- That's right
- Left ear

196
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,143
You've become a bit round
during the tour

197
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,079
Me? No

198
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,815
It's because I drank a lot yesterday

199
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,982
How much?

200
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,552
Two liters Two

201
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,020
Two liters of alcohol?

202
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,089
How do you drink two liters?
I don't even drink two liters of water

203
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,056
Two liters of alcohol?

204
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,024
- Beer?
- Yes

205
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,326
I had no idea dark beer was so good

206
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,329
- It's good
- You need to drink draft beer

207
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,697
I did In the hotel

208
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,500
It's not the same

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,668
But it's not easy

210
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,936
I mean the security and managers

211
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,739
That's why I had a drink
and chatted with them

212
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,908
I said it's kind of
double-sided, a paradox

213
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,543
We want to become closer,

214
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,780
but it takes a drink
to bring it up

215
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,748
Impressive

216
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,883
I'm not close with the security team
or my manger…

217
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,185
Yeah

218
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,121
I mean, you can't
bond at an art museum

219
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,690
I wanted to get closer

220
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,492
so I had a drink together

221
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,727
You talk more
with a drink in you, right?

222
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,930
But then I was like, Do I need to
make a chat room with him?

223
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,199
Because he was on his phone
the whole time, messaging

224
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,202
Maybe he was just putting up
with your drunken blabbering

225
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,838
Part of his job He was messaging,
Work sucks right now

226
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,075
Come on!

227
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,578
I think it'll be better to
eat quickly and get some rest

228
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:05,184
Germany, please make some noise
for this beautiful day

229
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,318
Make some noise!

230
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,092
Thank you, 1, 2, 3

231
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,127
Thank you

232
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,132
Thank you

233
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,141
Good work, guys

234
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,043
Do the feet clap

235
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,311
Jimin!

236
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,046
Tell us about your hat

237
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,748
Tell us about your bag

238
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,782
- My bag?
- Yes

239
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,985
First of all,
there's a shoehorn on the bag

240
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,887
A shoehorn? Wow!

241
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,088
Putting on your shoes
can be painful, so…

242
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,290
Hang on Let me focus

243
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,691
Get a final shot of me

244
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,127
BTS is like an oasis in the desert

245
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,029
- It was very..
- Okay, one, two, three!

246
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,577
It's our final concert

247
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,444
At last

248
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,715
Now that this long journey
is coming to an end,

249
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:11,917
it feels,

250
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,486
kind of odd

251
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,356
We'll do our best
for our final show

252
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,837
Ready
Please look at the camera

253
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,307
Here we go
Taking it now

254
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,143
One, two, three!

255
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,613
Moments of brilliance

256
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,215
This moment we're
doing this interview

257
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,351
is a brilliant moment

258
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,287
All of these moments are brilliant

259
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,557
and important to me

260
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,793
My mom bought me a PG48

261
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,496
It's a microphone,
cost about $45

262
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,099
She said she won't buy it
but she surprised me

263
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,333
bought it for me secretly

264
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,336
She said, All right, do what
you really want to do

265
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,206
I remember that

266
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,075
I think that moment

267
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,044
was the start of my happiness

268
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,313
I think getting into music

269
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,783
was the happiest moment

270
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,286
The moment I started this

271
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,788
First, a team

272
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,823
We're a team

273
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,992
But also, a family

274
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,761
And a driving force, too

275
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,195
All of these

276
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,532
mesh together,

277
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,003
Wait, what was I going to say?

278
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,838
I was about to
say something amazing

279
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,142
We start to want more

280
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,645
Not self-centered things like,

281
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,348
I want to stand out
more on the stage

282
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,484
But a strong desire
for what may come

283
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,752
his future in music

284
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,121
They guided me

285
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,425
I couldn't take a step on my own

286
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,827
but they enabled me to

287
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,362
take a hundred steps forward

288
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,364
Without them,

289
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,298
I don't exist

290
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,402
Our 22nd concert, let's do our cheer!

291
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,136
Okay, fighting!

292
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,671
- Bangtan, Bangtan!
- Bang Bangtan!

293
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,174
What more needs to be said?

294
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,444
I've learned by watching them

295
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,912
and I grew

296
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,714
I learned a lot

297
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,250
I can't perform

298
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,054
I can't perform I can't perform

299
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,226
Whew…

300
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,997
let's get through today

301
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,232
With them,

302
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,134
I'm not j-hope

303
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,370
I'm just

304
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,871
Jeong Hoseok

305
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,017
The end is a new beginning, isn't it?

306
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,953
Yes, it's true
An end is a new beginning

307
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,268
We're always together

308
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,404
We've come to know
everything about each other

309
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,940
The good, the bad

310
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,976
These are people

311
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,811
who have shaped me

312
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,213
Made me who I am today

313
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,414
I've going to see if your
live is any good or not

314
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,683
The pitch is too high,
I can't sing it

315
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,736
We never even dreamed about

316
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,239
the Olympic Stadium, to be honest

317
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,076
We shouldn't get excited
just because it's a bigger venue

318
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,214
We need to bring
enough energy to fill it

319
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,714
Let's make some noise
Make some noise!

320
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,749
Make some noise!

321
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,419
- BTS!
- BTS!

322
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,654
Thank you

323
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,192
- Thank you
- Love you

324
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,461
Love you, BTS!

325
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,062
Right?
Am I doing it right?

326
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,431
You're doing great, keep going
You rock!

327
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,167
See you later I love you

328
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,501
BTS, forever

329
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,069
I cherish you guys

330
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,351
I want to be good

331
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,521
That was always on my mind

332
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,190
Put on a great show

333
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
Sing great

334
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,728
Dance great
That's all I cared about

335
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,931
But I think I had
lost sight of something

336
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,499
Why I love being on stage

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,470
Why I want to do great

338
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,941
The fundamental reason
I perform

339
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,154
ARMY, are you ready?

340
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:31,890
Okay!

341
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:36,028
One, two, three!

342
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,636
- Paris, Paris
- Paris!

343
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,004
Today,

344
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,044
our European tour

345
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,879
has come to the happiest end

346
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,021
I'm really happy today

347
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,465
I was tired and sore,

348
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,368
but now that I'm with you,
I feel much better

349
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,909
You make me happy

350
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,079
Thank you, Paris!

351
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,882
Party people!

352
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,758
It's like I heard the crashing of waves
for the whole concert

353
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,298
We have the song, SEA, too, right?

354
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:52,337
This place, together with our ARMY

355
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,873
feels like the sea

356
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,078
Thank you for letting us
hear the waves

357
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,350
Thank you, Paris!

358
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,181
WINGS was very chaotic,
in many ways

359
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,949
Sort of like,
What do I need to do?

360
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,952
Being anxious and looking for answers

361
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,154
In contrast,

362
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,356
The LOVE YOURSELF
North America and Europe tour

363
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:48,293
was a process of searching for answers

364
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,928
within yourself

365
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,140
Guys getting hurt,
not being able to perform

366
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,278
but still trying to do
as best as everyone could

367
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,079
I was moved by
all the members

368
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,416
how they overcame
all of those hardships

369
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,785
doing what we wanted to do
and showing as much as we could

370
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,254
to people who we
wanted to show our best to

371
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,909
Everyone knows that
once it's been spilled

372
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,879
you can't pick it back up

373
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,681
You know it, but

374
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,182
you can't stop thinking about it

375
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,851
That's what LOVE MYSELF is about

376
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,118
I'm trying to be

377
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,387
more tolerant of myself

378
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,891
more forgiving of myself

379
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,304
I've come to examine closely

380
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,973
how we have such
significant impact

381
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,543
Why do I have this impact
on these people?

382
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,514
It does make me reflect on it

383
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,193
More and more
ARMY come together

384
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,963
and cheer on the seven of us

385
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,665
always trusting us, following us

386
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,167
and talking with us

387
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,737
That gives power
to what we have to say

388
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,541
They have allowed us
to become better people

389
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,287
When we won the Billboard Awards

390
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,023
we were in tears,
we were happy

391
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,225
But the happiness we feel

392
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,961
when we are surrounded
by tends of thousands

393
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,896
is a little different

394
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,165
There is no happier moment

395
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,500
than that moment

396
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,411
Since we debuted,
more and more people

397
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,645
have come to love us

398
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,181
They are our influence

399
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,050
There are lots of things

400
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,919
There's music, there's dance

401
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,654
The one thing I want the most

402
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,824
is to become
their energy

403
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,105
Wouldn't at least some of it
have found its way into people?

404
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,341
Wouldn't the doors into the hearts of

405
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,209
people who love us be more open?

406
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,612
Wouldn't more light have
reached into their hearts?

407
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,781
Sometimes it was hard,
couldn't even dance sometimes,

408
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,450
cried a lot

409
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,853
But I think a concert

410
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,156
is this outpouring of light

411
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,359
So in that sense,

412
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,161
I'm confident a lot of it
reached them

413
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,604
I love you guys!

414
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,774
Thank you

415
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,317
I got too excited and talked too much

416
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:40,258
In the interview at the hotel
in Dallas last month, you said

417
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:45,030
you hoped this documentary contained
the sweat and struggles of your youth

418
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,431
Does it?

419
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,565
The sweat and struggles of my youth

420
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,569
Yup

421
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,468
Hello

422
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:24,969
Hello

423
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,006
It's a dome

424
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,308
Please put your bags on the desk,
not the couch

425
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,209
No!

426
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,412
Artist

427
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,880
- This is reserved for the artists
- Right

428
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,482
There are seats for the artists?

429
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,418
Namjoon, you sit here
and you're not an artist any more

430
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,052
Really?

431
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,454
Artist seating is over there

432
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,056
This is too much for the first day

433
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,725
I've decided to leave
such stereotypes behind

434
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,159
Is there something there?

435
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,561
Okay, I'll go over there

436
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,898
You don't know about inserts?

437
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:54,999
Hey Taehyung, insert

438
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,802
- We have to film the insert
- Insert

439
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,709
People say,

440
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,611
it's possible to make it
to an arena show

441
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,179
You can get there with skill and effort

442
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,181
But you need divine luck
to make it to a dome

443
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,149
That's what people say

444
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,184
Not to mention
a dome tour

445
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,787
I think we need a brand-new

446
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,655
approach to our performance

447
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,591
It's a whole new beginning

448
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,877
- Bangtan, Bangtan!
- Bang Bangtan!
