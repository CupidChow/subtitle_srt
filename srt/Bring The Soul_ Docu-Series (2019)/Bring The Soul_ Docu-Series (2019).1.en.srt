[BRING THE SOUL: DOCU-SERIES
EP.1 CHALLENGE]

2
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:17,274
Am I pressured?

3
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:19,941
Pressure

4
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:24,601
Pressure?

5
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:25,861
Pressure

6
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:40,796
Two, three, Bangtan!

7
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:43,102
Hello, we're BTS

8
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:58,302
I feel like I have a different mindset

9
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:03,024
I think for "Wings",
we had fire in our blood

10
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:06,167
And we dreamed big

11
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,990
We need to do this and that

12
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,042
We were all ambitious to make it happen

13
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:14,979
But now, we're more at ease

14
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,057
and just enjoying the moment

15
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,502
I'm not used to the new solo yet
so it's a bit tough

16
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,112
For tours, doing something new

17
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:33,699
and doing what you're used to
are two totally different things

18
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,448
I think our "Wings" tour was the beginning

19
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:39,492
We had "THE RED BULLET" and others

20
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,557
But back then, we were just starting out
so we weren't as experienced

21
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:46,004
Now, everybody's going about it steadily

22
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,774
We're able to handle things without trouble

23
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,658
I still get very nervous

24
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,410
I might not look like it

25
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:58,830
but first of all, I'm scared of the
physical aspect right before the concert

26
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:04,263
My condition for the day relies heavily on
how the first three numbers go

27
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:06,294
That makes me nervous

28
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:07,766
The biggest problem is jet lag

29
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,937
I get the worst jet lag

30
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:14,143
and even if I try to get over it,
I still have trouble sleeping

31
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,373
It's just scary before the concerts start

32
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:20,744
My mind is filled with, "Can I do well?"

33
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:24,185
A lot of people think when we
go on tours and travel a lot

34
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,933
we get to eat good food, perform

35
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:31,596
but there's
another layer of struggle beneath

36
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:33,864
"Seesaw" to sweep the M*lon Charts!

37
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:37,868
Let's go for number one!

38
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:42,119
"Seesaw" is a great song

39
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,449
Look forward to it, "Seesaw"!

40
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:51,338
It would be nice to chart 1st on M*lon

41
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,523
♪ It was fun in the beginning ♪

42
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:06,431
♪ Going up and down itself ♪

43
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:10,730
But I still feel alive on stage

44
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,786
And the seven of us

45
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:19,469
Thousands of people
love seeing the seven of us on stage

46
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:24,880
I can still remember all the concerts
I've been to when I was young

47
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,683
Especially the ones I went to in my teens

48
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:32,152
Being able to give everyone a good memory

49
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:36,353
It's an amazing feat

50
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:39,622
Although we can't do a rehearsal

51
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,688
Due to Typhoon Soulik

52
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,622
There's no excuses for professionals

53
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:44,232
Fighting!

54
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,566
The Olympic Stadium

55
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,910
Please be a stage that day

56
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,223
I hope the stage is up that day

57
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,715
Let's have fun at the main stadium

58
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:52,182
Bangtan Bangtan Bang Bangtan!

59
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:51,376
Hello

60
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,391
Hello hello

61
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,102
Do we take the elevator to the stage?

62
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,770
During rehearsals

63
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:07,295
you need to check the venue in advance

64
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:09,196
A true artist always checks in advance

65
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:09,929
All of the sudden?

66
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,800
Yeah

67
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,499
No?

68
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,646
I just wanted to check it out

69
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,536
Really?

70
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,946
Wow, it's amazing!

71
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,349
It's so big!

72
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,008
It's too big

73
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:28,536
I don't think they'll be able to see us

74
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:32,333
I guess this is how it feels

75
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,399
to perform at an open roof stadium

76
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:37,358
Everything's starting to feel real now

77
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,465
It honestly didn't feel real earlier

78
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:42,213
This stadium is
gonna be filled with our fans

79
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:44,431
I'm starting to feel it now

80
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:49,556
Right, being able to
perform at the Olympic Stadium

81
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:52,231
it's something to be proud of

82
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:57,813
We know that
this isn't a chance everyone gets

83
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,344
It means more people
are now interested in us

84
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:04,721
and more people now know us

85
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,928
I still haven't gotten this right

86
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,188
I'm gonna get it today

87
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:16,825
The choreography is too tough

88
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:17,655
I can't breathe

89
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:24,895
The fact that we can rehearse now

90
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:26,829
I think that's a relief

91
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,166
Otherwise, we would've had
to go up the stage without it

92
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:39,993
The typhoon

93
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:43,157
It honestly didn't feel real

94
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:49,101
I had no idea what to do
once we got to the Olympic Stadium

95
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:52,792
My biggest concern was
keeping my energy up

96
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:54,501
and I shouldn't mess up

97
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:59,470
I need to give it my all on stage
to make up for the lack of rehearsal

98
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:18,861
Let me stop by the waiting room

99
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:20,208
I'm just gonna get changed

100
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,499
What's this?

101
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:24,875
It's so hot

102
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,782
This is our first time

103
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:29,279
Our first time with it being just us

104
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,809
We've been to SEOTAIJI's concert

105
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,506
We've gone to events

106
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:37,857
and we've performed 5 or 6 songs

107
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:41,498
But it's our first time performing 26 songs

108
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:45,913
The fact that we're performing at a
huge venue mean's things have gotten big

109
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:51,281
That's why I think it's tough

110
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:56,973
I'm worried about the live

111
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:04,535
We're at a place where
we have a lot of eyes on us

112
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:07,985
be it our fans and other people

113
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:11,628
and we need to

114
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:17,689
Act or perform a certain way

115
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,093
to show that we're worthy of that spot

116
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,337
We need to

117
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,057
act accordingly to show them that

118
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,873
I think my voice is too low

119
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,302
There's some reverb

120
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,911
I don't know if
we need to make the MR louder

121
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,040
-That'll probably be better
-Then could you make the MR louder?

122
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:45,304
What time is it?

123
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,025
Doing this live is so hard

124
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:00,717
What do I do?

125
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:02,823
I'm craving something sweet!

126
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,857
Sweets are best when stressed

127
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:07,259
Isn't that just your excuse?

128
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,359
We rehearsed once and it wasn't good

129
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,638
It wasn't good

130
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,437
but we can't do another one

131
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,041
and had to come back in

132
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,002
It wasn't the best

133
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:18,274
Let's gather up, guys!

134
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,277
Pay attention, these are the formations

135
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,680
After "MIC Drop", just an exit
to the closest lift to you

136
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,432
There is a bit of pressure

137
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,960
It's kinda scary for me too

138
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,244
It's scary to head up

139
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:33,182
because who knows what people will say
once we go up and fall down

140
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:36,493
But that's not in our control

141
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,388
We're just doing what we can

142
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,669
I just wanted a taste of first place

143
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:48,818
I didn't want to live my life expecting it

144
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:49,854
Focus up

145
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:50,704
We have 12 minutes left

146
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,955
Focus up! Let's do our best today!

147
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,063
Wow, I'm nervous

148
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,003
We can do this, we can!

149
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,387
I'm ready!

150
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:06,421
Are you ready?

151
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,169
We have one minute left on the music video

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,868
The first stadium

153
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:14,867
Let's party!

154
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,636
Bangtan Bangtan Bang Bangtan!

155
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:19,364
Fighting!

156
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,810
Nothing much has
changed from 2, 3 years ago

157
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:52,306
We attend award shows, hold concerts,
release new albums, that's about it

158
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,566
We're not doing anything unique

159
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:58,635
It's just that the degree of expressions
that follow us has changed

160
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:02,704
We're still living our lives
and acting the same way as before

161
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:23,660
Instead of being scared of these things

162
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,951
I need to stay true to myself
and just work hard on my music

163
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:29,714
What more can we do other than that?

164
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:34,240
When asked what
we do about feeling the pressure

165
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:36,146
There's nothing we can say to that

166
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:40,308
We have to accept those concerns,
dilemmas, and worries

167
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:43,602
and keep on creating something new

168
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:45,567
That's how we make a living

169
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:46,757
We're heading up!

170
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:51,828
I don't think

171
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,946
We've performed that much

172
00:14:57,587 --> 00:15:00,942
When the sun is still up like today

173
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,604
We were worried as well

174
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,496
It's our first time
performing at a venue this big

175
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:11,685
We were worried and concerned

176
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:14,419
so we thought a lot amongst ourselves

177
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,855
on how we could
present ourselves to you all

178
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,439
I think we talked a lot about it

179
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,312
I hope you have fun today as well

180
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,938
You know that this album

181
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,311
and this concert

182
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:30,810
are a festival for us to have fun, right?

183
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:33,809
Yes!

184
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,259
You might've heard this already
but should we do this all together?

185
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,357
Are you ready?

186
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,317
Let's go to the next stage

187
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:43,829
Let's go!

188
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,482
Let's go

189
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:54,125
The lift is down! Let's get on

190
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,404
-Can I have some water?
-Yes

191
00:15:57,443 --> 00:16:00,234
If you'll get on that, it'll lift you up

192
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:01,585
Slightly to the right

193
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,868
Quickly please!

194
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,418
I just got a glimpse of my ancestors

195
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:07,845
It's so...

196
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,727
So tiring!

197
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:12,132
But I think this is so cool and fun

198
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:15,597
You can't help it

199
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:21,458
This tiredness and the catharsis
people feel always balance out

200
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,077
Our tiredness give people joy

201
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,980
What more can we do?
We need to give it our all

202
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,045
He's always amazing

203
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:57,752
We ride the lift right before
we head up for every stage this tour

204
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:02,291
Whenever they say "We're heading up",
I close my eyes

205
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,395
and open them once I'm on stage

206
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,768
That puts me in a great mood

207
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:09,230
I couldn't do this before

208
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:13,327
but now I worry, what if ARMY aren't here?

209
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,089
What if the seats are empty?

210
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,409
Let's see for myself

211
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,268
That's when I get goosebumps

212
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:29,235
It's unbelievable

213
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:32,904
The thrill is amazing

214
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:34,771
That's when

215
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:36,808
I really feel

216
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:40,067
Like I'm alive, right then and there

217
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:42,268
How should I describe it?

218
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,861
It boils from the inside?

219
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:47,995
I think it's kinda like that

220
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:50,542
If I were to make a comparison

221
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:52,342
it's like when a computer reboots

222
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:54,202
Like a reset

223
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,297
Everybody stand up!

224
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:01,512
Stand up!

225
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,320
Let's all stand up!

226
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:05,377
Everybody stand up!

227
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:06,885
Let's all jump

228
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:08,284
Okay!

229
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:48,387
Are you ready to jump?

230
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:17,198
Before heading up on stage,
there's just a list of songs

231
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,161
and a lot of things to consider,
everything's just really hectic

232
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:23,251
But the moment I take the lift up

233
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,762
something in the air just shifts

234
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:29,916
Something in my body just shifts

235
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,775
They say that
if you do the things you love for work

236
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,083
you end up getting stressed

237
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:42,729
I think going on tour like this

238
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,724
is more precious than work

239
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,524
Just getting to meet ARMY

240
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:51,566
Where do we go?

241
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,133
I fell way too hard

242
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,670
I totally forgot

243
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:05,276
How did you fall?

244
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:06,617
I got hit by the water

245
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:07,795
Pardon? Oh, the water?

246
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:09,994
I got hit by the water and just crashed

247
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:12,929
Of course there's fatigue

248
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,306
And that builds up

249
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,682
We perform and of course
that physical fatigue builds up

250
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:24,861
But that's when the cheers are the loudest

251
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:28,083
I'll be lying if I said
I didn't feel the pressure

252
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:33,052
Keeping that up until the end

253
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,509
That's our responsibility

254
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:06,557
Boom

255
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,142
That's kinda how I feel

256
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:13,772
When we debuted,
there were a lot of naysaying

257
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:15,649
but people still cut us a break

258
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,014
But now, nobody does that

259
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:24,117
The eyes and ears
of the public have changed

260
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:27,228
and because time just flies

261
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,668
We can't ease up the tension

262
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,372
Although we've made it so far

263
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,683
we can't get complacent

264
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:38,411
Because this bit back then was this big

265
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:44,715
Huh?

266
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:46,005
What's wrong?

267
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:48,877
It's fine

268
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:52,834
I can't focus because of that

269
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:04,371
Things we do

270
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:06,972
like winning an award
at the Billboard Awards

271
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,279
ranking high on the Billboard charts

272
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,048
Going on tour, holding concerts

273
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:15,018
Whatever we do, we're recognized

274
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,612
and peoples' eyes are on us

275
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:22,247
They cheer us on and encourage us

276
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:24,561
I think that's how much impact we have

277
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,064
That's why, not just with our songs

278
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,082
but with our actions,
we need to watch and be careful

279
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:37,751
and we have that obligation
to perform well on stage

280
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,027
Are you having fun?

281
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,590
Yes!

282
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:44,795
I can't hear you guys

283
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,369
Are you having fun?

284
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,392
Yes!

285
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:52,679
We'll reveal our hidden message

286
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,974
to you right now

287
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,409
One!

288
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,245
Two!

289
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,040
Three!

290
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,933
BTS ♥ ARMY

291
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:06,568
It's so beautiful!

292
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,073
Can you see it?

293
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,147
I do feel the pressure

294
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:16,426
I feel like we've gradually climbed up
with the sizes of venues every time

295
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,574
starting with the YES 24 Live Hall
to the Olympic Stadium

296
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:20,966
But it sure isn't easy

297
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:23,120
since these aren't common experiences

298
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:30,344
If you put someone that's not
in the concert or in this field of work

299
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,023
and put them in front of 35,000 people

300
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:35,436
Most people would be shaking

301
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:06,353
To be honest, the entire world
is keeping an eye on BTS

302
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:08,708
That's why, even if I say

303
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,183
that I'm enjoying this moment

304
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,299
I'm pretty sure that the
personal struggles will come

305
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:19,024
I want to keep an objective view of myself

306
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:21,358
I need to be satisfied

307
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,558
and somewhat happy with myself

308
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,171
But despite all that

309
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,644
I'm still impatient

310
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:49,400
All of our members have this thirst

311
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:52,163
that helps our team keep on growing

312
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:55,822
Of course we want to sing better

313
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,641
and perform better

314
00:26:57,642 --> 00:27:01,565
To everyone who comes to our concert
and to those that listen to our music

315
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,282
We want to give them a better experience

316
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:27,527
I'm happy being on stage

317
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:30,201
If I sing this song during a concert

318
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,917
will people like it?

319
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,477
I hope they do

320
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,384
How should I sing it so they'll like it?

321
00:27:57,957 --> 00:28:02,544
I know that a lot of ARMY love me

322
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:06,574
and that makes me try harder

323
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:08,698
That's why I strive for more

324
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:29,614
I've felt this as time passes

325
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:31,573
Before our debut

326
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:35,562
The reason I wanted to become a singer

327
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:39,508
was just because
I liked dancing and singing

328
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,979
But looking back now

329
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,080
The fact that I'm on stage

330
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,443
is all thanks to ARMY

331
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:53,868
I hope that we can have these moments

332
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,284
together and feel this way every year

333
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:02,398
There are some things
I can change and can't change

334
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,675
Definitely

335
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,528
I can change what I can

336
00:29:07,202 --> 00:29:09,326
and if I don't, I don't need to

337
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,531
If I can't change it, it is what it is

338
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:13,959
That's fine

339
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:16,188
I'm doing fine

340
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,627
Just the way I am right now

341
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:21,723
Don't sway, just go
