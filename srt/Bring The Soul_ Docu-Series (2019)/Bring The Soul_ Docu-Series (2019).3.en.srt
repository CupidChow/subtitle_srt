[BRING THE SOUL: DOCU-SERIES
EP.3 RELATIONSHIP]

2
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,018
Happiness?

3
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,352
Wow, yeah that's the thing

4
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,689
It would be kinda embarrassing

5
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,627
to say that I'm happy

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,196
But to say I'm not happy

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,332
I don't think that's right either

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,034
But

9
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,037
Simply put

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,873
I'm doing what I want to do

11
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,674
Anyway, I'm

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,310
I'm smiling

13
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,846
Just with that alone

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,784
it makes me think,
"I'm very happy right now"

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,786
This is intense!

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,827
But I'm not 100% sure about this

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,529
Am I actually happy?

18
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,597
I'm not sure about that yet

19
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,332
It feels like

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,269
I haven't found a resolute answer

21
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,205
Seokjin, let's go

22
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,486
Just me?

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,887
Nobody else is going?

24
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,189
Surprise

25
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,424
You sure Jimin or Jung Kook aren't coming?

26
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,659
I'll be waiting

27
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,303
It apparently takes 25 minutes
to get to the amusement park

28
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,039
In 25 minutes, you'll be able to see

29
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,042
me having the time of my life

30
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,825
There's...

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,362
not a single person...

32
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,037
That was fun

33
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,340
I'm so excited

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,209
I should've just slept in

35
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,278
The guys are going to
laugh at me so much

36
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,881
"Why can't you just stay in?"

37
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,057
I honestly never thought about that

38
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,962
Things like, "I've made it this far,
I've improved this much"

39
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,565
When all these people come to our concerts

40
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,301
Rather than those thoughts

41
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,335
I'm more like, "This is so exciting"

42
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:54,040
"I'm so happy to have fun
with everybody here"

43
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:59,112
I just enjoy the moment like a kid

44
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,714
I think not thinking too hard

45
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,784
and not getting too deep into things

46
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:09,622
helps me more with this life

47
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,725
Because the moment I think that way

48
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,261
I could feel pressure

49
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,902
BTS! BTS!

50
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:01,975
Throughout this "LOVE YOURSELF" series

51
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,344
I thought about that a lot

52
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,312
The first half of this year
was really tough

53
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:12,418
But the moment I started to
get skeptical thinking

54
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,354
"What am I living like this for?"

55
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:19,525
I felt like I was denying everything
I've done so far and it was hard

56
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,795
My thoughts after I went through that was

57
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:29,769
It's important to find what makes me happy

58
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,471
but it all depends on your mindset

59
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,575
The moment you think,
"What am I doing?" then it's game over

60
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,679
The moment you think,
"This is fun," then everything seems fun

61
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,346
That's what I think

62
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,116
So to be honest

63
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,087
although we know all of this,
it's hard to put it into practice

64
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,559
Can you show us again?

65
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,531
1, 2, 3, go!

66
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:08,441
So pretty! So beautiful!

67
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:21,187
Did they say I can get the
previous in-ear I had?

68
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,790
The company contacted them

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,794
Is it possible?

70
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,297
-They need to send it to their headquarters
first before sending it here to the States
-Is their headquarters in Korea?

71
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,366
We're in the talks with them

72
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,469
I think I need to make another one

73
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,603
I don't have a spare

74
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,674
All of us suddenly got emotional

75
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,642
for "FAKE LOVE"

76
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,545
We can't hear until
we're almost done with the performance

77
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,547
I couldn't hear a thing
because I was so into the performance

78
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,248
It felt like singing with my ears covered

79
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,586
It probably has 5 units

80
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,187
Yes

81
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,722
All of them went out except for one

82
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,960
-I'll ask and see if we can get them here
-All right

83
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:01,794
Okay

84
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,722
See you next time!

85
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,229
Have a good night!

86
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,501
I think it's the issue with
quantity and quality

87
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,803
I like to put it like this

88
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,839
The festival is short

89
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,508
but the garbage stays

90
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,443
The festival itself is short

91
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,047
But the process of preparing it
and cleaning up afterwards

92
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,916
All of that takes a long time

93
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,885
But despite all that,
people still hold festivals each year

94
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,786
They wait for it

95
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,521
Even with people

96
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,323
It's painful a lot of the times

97
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,424
in comparison

98
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:22,328
But that doesn't mean
that happy moments don't exist

99
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,362
in contrast to the pain

100
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,398
Those moments hit you hard,
that dopamine

101
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,100
That's why people don't forget

102
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,468
It's just so precious

103
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,444
I had a blast today

104
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,213
As expected of a country
that knows how to party

105
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,715
The city knows how to party

106
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,382
That's America

107
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,184
Did you have fun?

108
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,118
US tours are definitely

109
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:46,986
It was fun

110
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,754
It makes your blood boil

111
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,190
I have no more blood left
since it's all boiled away

112
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,491
It's all evaporated

113
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:57,129
I think these moments
are the happiest moments in my life

114
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:01,067
Just giving it my all on stage

115
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,269
performing with the people I cherish

116
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,172
and then enjoying a drink with them after

117
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,075
I didn't know how to relieve my stress

118
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,012
and didn't know what made me happy

119
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,114
But after my debut

120
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,119
These moments are what I live for

121
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,322
I lie in bed

122
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,158
and reflect back on myself for the day

123
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,093
The reactions

124
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,363
I lie in bed for about 15 minutes
and then take a shower

125
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,297
Then I'm out for the day

126
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,300
j-hope, j-hope

127
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,135
I'm gonna go with j-hope

128
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
Should we dig in?

129
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,545
Don't cut it like that

130
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,381
Cut it in half like this

131
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,049
And this is my share!

132
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,656
They definitely know what they're doing

133
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,291
But it doesn't really suit soju

134
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,662
You put it in ice?

135
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:04,997
Let me pour you a glass

136
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,939
I'm too hungry to skip eating today

137
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,307
LA

138
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,843
I almost died back then

139
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,978
LA is so

140
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,583
I don't know how I survived skipping meals

141
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,720
I lost a lot of weight here

142
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,221
You did

143
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,290
You didn't hear what I said then, did you?

144
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:31,924
Yeah

145
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,694
Apparently, I had some drinks

146
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,696
got back to the hotel

147
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,932
and asked for more soju

148
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,269
Apparently, I said I was so lonely

149
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,841
I kept going on and on about
how I shouldn't have a room to myself

150
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,342
I had a good night sleep that day

151
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,647
But with Jimin

152
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,283
Jimin really likes company

153
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,618
Jimin once said

154
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,857
"I'm glad that I'm your roommate
even back at home"

155
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,492
If not, he would've been lonely

156
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,227
After I heard that

157
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,498
I thought I should stay with Jimin

158
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,901
But in that aspect, staying at hotels

159
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,171
gives me a sense of liberation of some sort

160
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,607
But it is lonely sometimes

161
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,708
since I'm alone

162
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,712
I cried when I talked about the members

163
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,914
Why? Why did you cry?

164
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,349
Because you love us so much?

165
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,120
"I love my members so much!"

166
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,589
Not because of that

167
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,160
But all of us were going through
a lot back then, including myself

168
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,797
They kept telling me
not to worry too much about it

169
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,867
But from my point of view,
we're all on the same team

170
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,869
and we'll continue to be together

171
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,808
How could I not worry?

172
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,445
That's not what a team does

173
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,547
You get what I mean, right?

174
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,348
Of course

175
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,417
You know I can't do that

176
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,051
Yeah

177
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,022
But they said because they cared

178
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:14,727
They told me so that
I wouldn't struggle by myself

179
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,327
Yeah

180
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,164
But although I knew all that

181
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:23,435
I realized there's a limit
on how much you could understand

182
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,571
That's when I started to cry

183
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,576
I kept rambling on about that
at 2 am while we were drinking

184
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,546
But I don't remember that at all

185
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:39,618
Apparently, I played them
a song I made with just the melody

186
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,109
It's normal to feel lonely

187
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:41,480
Spending all this time away from home

188
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,950
overseas is not easy

189
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,956
But who would fully understand
where that comes from?

190
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,958
That's

191
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,663
Something that comes with my job

192
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,998
I need to find a way around it

193
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,736
That's why I always
video call my family at night

194
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,305
It feels like we're together

195
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,541
It's really tiring

196
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,142
Today's just not the day

197
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,310
It's not because of the mood

198
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,645
It feels like punching in the water

199
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,080
This actually

200
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,781
It does feel like that

201
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,385
Even if I give it the same strength

202
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,187
I can't seem to go as hard

203
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,588
I feel like I'm stuck in a dream

204
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,629
Going on tour is a long-term project

205
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,664
It's like a marathon

206
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,799
If we run like a 100 meter race

207
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,268
We'll never cross the finish line

208
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,170
That's the thing with tours

209
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,706
We need to go about it
like a 100 meter race

210
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,844
but we can't actually sprint it like that

211
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,345
We need to consider our stamina

212
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,783
Our concerts are very physically demanding

213
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,086
But what makes it more difficult is

214
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,723
I know there's some things
I want to express through that song

215
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,327
but when I can't
pull it off the way I want

216
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,515
One, two, three!

217
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,653
This is way better
after a two day break

218
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,121
Right? We're in a better condition

219
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:09,888
Our conditions

220
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,356
-Are definitely better
-I'm in a better condition

221
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,558
but it takes me too long to warm up

222
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,127
-I think we're definitely feeling better
-You need to get mentally ready before

223
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,929
We were in a good condition

224
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,931
and the response was good

225
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,202
I think I can call that a good performance

226
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,305
Aren't we going?

227
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,807
-Apparently it takes an hour
-Namjoon is talking to them right now

228
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,109
What I'm talking about

229
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,610
What are they talking about?

230
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,611
I don't know

231
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,246
I don't know I don't know

232
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,815
Guys, they have something to say

233
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,749
-What?
-Hear them out

234
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,486
I knew this was coming

235
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,086
What's up?

236
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,521
What's going on?

237
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,157
We've been on the road for quite a bit now

238
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,892
But it wasn't just me that felt this way

239
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,161
so I wanted to make sure to mention this

240
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,929
I discussed this with RM first

241
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,065
but right now, it's a little bit

242
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,667
We're not sure what the members think

243
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,303
but it feels like
the performance and singing

244
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,938
seem a bit too loose?

245
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,973
-Really?
-Yes

246
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,876
-In what way?
-For example, some dances are not in sync

247
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,010
Especially with "FAKE LOVE"

248
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,412
With "FAKE LOVE" and "DNA"

249
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:11,216
I felt the same way
since I'm in the back

250
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,452
You know like the angles?

251
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,421
We always get a bit loose
at around this time on tours

252
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,089
Let's fix it then

253
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:17,956
Yeah

254
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,360
That's why I asked
which specific songs we were loose

255
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,995
Honestly, for the other songs

256
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,099
There's a lot where I think
it's okay to ease up a bit

257
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,902
since our choreography is difficult

258
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,071
I think it's hard to keep
the performance that long

259
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,974
but today... I think I felt it more

260
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,077
With "IDOL" we kept it up but today

261
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,212
it felt a bit...

262
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,813
Over the line?

263
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,581
Yes

264
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,318
I'm sure you know we don't mean,
"Go all out for every song"

265
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,820
Whether or not you guys heed this message

266
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,889
that's up to you guys to recognize

267
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,793
-That's something else entirely
-With singing, regardless of our condition

268
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,263
if my voice is off
then I just get scared

269
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,131
of singing

270
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:03,302
Even if we were fine yesterday,
things could turn sour the day of

271
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,636
We understand those aspects

272
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,738
That's why we wanted to ask you about it

273
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,473
In case something happened or

274
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,910
But regardless,
today's our first concert in Canada

275
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,546
and the audience's response was great

276
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,015
The fans were really hyped
and everything was great

277
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,319
but the performance and singing
in comparison felt a bit lacking

278
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,688
That's why I talked with Namjoon first

279
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,057
But I think

280
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,797
We have no excuse for this

281
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,602
Usually, if the fans are like

282
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,671
If they don't get excited

283
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,273
that really puts us in a downer

284
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,643
However, it's the fans
that are so passionate

285
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,179
but it feels like we couldn't
meet up to that passion

286
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:51,250
For example, after "FIRE" and into
"Silver Spoon" I feel like I'm about to faint

287
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,186
I feel like I can't sing anymore

288
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,689
but that's when I feel like
I'm meeting up to fans' energy

289
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,826
It feels like I did this together

290
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,997
To be honest,
I couldn't do that today either

291
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,866
We don't wanna say that
this concert wasn't good

292
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,002
We just wanted to let you guys know

293
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:10,869
It's about time

294
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,039
The audience was so into the concert

295
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:18,310
and we just wanted to let the members know
what we thought could use to improve

296
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,879
We've always
been like this around this time

297
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,182
If Sung Deuk was here,
he would've told us but he's not

298
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,985
I think this is good

299
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,187
Let's hype it up and do better

300
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,756
Good work today and
let's see how we did today

301
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,864
There's definitely a difference in
what I feel and what others see

302
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,700
There's no I in team

303
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,502
Just because one person does well

304
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,938
doesn't mean it completes teamwork

305
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,811
I think it's always been like this

306
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,013
I want us to get used to everything

307
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,916
but there's a dark side to that too

308
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:58,884
It's just

309
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,386
I feel like we get too loose

310
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,021
Let's see how we did yesterday first

311
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:03,822
Let's watch yesterday's

312
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,826
I think we can just look at the center,
not necessarily the camera

313
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:13,231
Don't just focus on the screen
but rather focus on everything as a whole

314
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:19,237
Also, Taehyung, your balance is always up

315
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,907
I know you think you're going down

316
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,108
I think I'm going down

317
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,477
But your balance is always up

318
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,445
This is from Seoul

319
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,179
Do you wanna watch the Seoul one?

320
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,880
Let's watch the Seoul one

321
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,918
I wanted to tell Namjoon this
but you're always dancing too fast

322
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:33,585
Yeah

323
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:39,458
I feel like when you're hyped,
you end up going faster

324
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,395
Who's that on the left? Yoongi?

325
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,398
Yoongi needs to move forward
during the second verse

326
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,868
With the tour and how long it is

327
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,738
I feel like there's a part of us
trying to conserve our energy

328
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,173
But that's what makes us loose

329
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,075
But we do need to

330
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,945
We need to get it together

331
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,952
Performing twenty-something
songs at a concert

332
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,390
I think we need to perform
more than the base standard

333
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,792
but our stamina can't keep up

334
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,162
It's not that I hate the stage

335
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,500
but I don't think we can keep it up
by only thinking of the good things

336
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,236
We need to keep the basics on stage

337
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,540
I don't think being
happy with just going on stage

338
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,710
is enough to call it a day

339
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,913
We have energy during "IDOL"

340
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,215
I think as we need to monitor ourselves

341
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,817
more towards the end of the show

342
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,384
Right

343
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:46,091
We need to have some kind of action
when we're passing on the mics

344
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,059
The audience is following along

345
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,899
The vocal line should also check
how they're sounding

346
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,637
The mic gets confusing to me
when we do the floor move

347
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,477
Jin doesn't have that many moves

348
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,047
The moment you turn

349
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,851
I kind of give it a cut in the middle
but you don't and that difference is

350
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,854
I think it shows more
because I'm next to you

351
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,855
but I'm definitely going too fast

352
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:21,693
When we get in a line at the end,
let's not play around

353
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,361
Like pushing and stuff

354
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,997
I think we can ease up the playing around

355
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,932
Just a little bit

356
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:31,837
I'm not critiquing us having fun but
it feels like we're playing around too much

357
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,071
I think we should ease up on that

358
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,707
I understand by what you meant by
it feels disarrayed

359
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,811
It's great if we all look excited

360
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,847
but we shouldn't look disorganized

361
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,649
They are guys who are flawless

362
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,185
when it comes to
physical movements

363
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,021
It's right that they lead

364
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:54,693
and we listen and speak up
when we need to

365
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,628
We each have our roles

366
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,396
If, and I really think this way

367
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,866
But if I was good in everything,
it would've been difficult for me

368
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,968
In those situations,
the right thing to do is let go

369
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,769
and heed to what they say

370
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:09,074
If there's something where
I can step up, musically or otherwise

371
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,010
They heed to my words then

372
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,079
That's how we have mutual respect

373
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,250
I like Taehyung's presence

374
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:22,521
You can go easy on the presence
you can just dance and that's fine

375
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,557
That's what I'm talking about

376
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,660
Watch RM when he says "Turn up"

377
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,244
RM gives it his all

378
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,850
I think we should work on these 4
when we're at the venue

379
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,485
We can do that tomorrow

380
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,054
Whoever wants to watch can do that

381
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,657
Monitoring sure makes a difference

382
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,525
We all know our flaws

383
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,920
When I'm asked

384
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:36,261
how BTS made it this far,
I get a bit frustrated

385
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,764
We have so much to improve on

386
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,200
but it feels like
they're only seeing the good

387
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,570
However, I think

388
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,207
we're slowly improving ourselves

389
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,844
It's not easy to do this
with seven people

390
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,245
We'll get started

391
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,213
Okay

392
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,847
They come to see us in-person
after only watching us in the screen

393
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:33,351
but if we're different,
the reason for holding a concert

394
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,087
is to show off what we've been working on

395
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,758
After I realized that they come
to see us only once a year

396
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:44,429
and if they see that we don't
give our 100% or 120%

397
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,364
It felt like I've been slapped in the face

398
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,478
You are so much to me
and everybody else

399
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,982
You're more than a musical group
who can sing and dance

400
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,784
You're like, really important to all of us

401
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,887
and help a lot of us
through difficult and tough times

402
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,722
and you tend to touch on topics that

403
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,359
We all really appreciate that and
we love you so much, thank you so much

404
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,227
for even existing

405
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,844
I don't have a favorite song
because I like them all too much

406
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:37,115
but the ones that they write for fans
always touch me personally

407
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:41,086
because they write it with us in mind
and that we go through

408
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,688
personal stuff,
that they're always there for us

409
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:48,493
Thank you so much for being there,
not only for me but for the rest of us here

410
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,527
Thank you

411
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,641
BTS needs to be different

412
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,845
That sense of responsibility
does make it tough on us

413
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,379
but it's also a huge help to us

414
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,015
If I put a little more into this one

415
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,818
I believe the other 6 will do the same
