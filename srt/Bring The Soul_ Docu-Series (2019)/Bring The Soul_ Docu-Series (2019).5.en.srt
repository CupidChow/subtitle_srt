1
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,651
This place has good drumsticks

2
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,653
Is there any radish? White radish

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,655
This leg is so chewy
I think it was a gamecock

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,658
It's all in Yoongi's hands now

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,660
Does anyone have
their wallet on them?

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,662
Why are they all
telling me to sign up?

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,664
Korea, Korea!
Let Korea be there, please

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,666
Korea!

9
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,669
- Hang in there!
- Please

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,673
Either team can win

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,677
No! Please!

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,680
- Please!
- SUGA!

13
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,652
No, no! Right there!
Go in, go in, go…

14
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:55,922
- Ah!
- What's happening?

15
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:56,656
- Hey!
- What's happening right now?

16
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,458
Come on, work!

17
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,661
I don't that that really
counts as watching the game

18
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,631
Really? I didn't pack at all

19
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,834
- Thanks, Jimin
- Seriously, you did all the work

20
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:08,835
Yeah

21
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,315
They split as soon as the game ended

22
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,316
Are you sad?

23
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,320
Our concert ended today...

24
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,327
After packing

25
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,332
we board the plane
and head to Europe

26
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,336
We really wanted to go
visit Europe

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,341
but circumstances just wouldn't let us

28
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,343
But now that we can

29
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:54,481
I think our fans will be thrilled, too

30
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,321
Only deep sleep makes me
feel like I slept well

31
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,691
I have to use English

32
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,328
learn how to write music

33
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,329
learn to dance

34
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,332
learn to sing, learn the piano...

35
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,335
but I'm going to do it

36
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,337
I refuse to lose

37
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,339
Thank you

38
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,341
Worried?

39
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,410
I worry a lot

40
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,114
When I'm in my room,
I get all kinds of thoughts

41
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,318
"Why do people like us?"

42
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,321
Probably because we work hard, but...

43
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,158
who doesn't work hard?

44
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,327
Others make good music
and do their best too

45
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,463
So why us?

46
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:51,337
In our interviews we always
talk about how close we are

47
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,311
how we try to communicate
a lot with our fans

48
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,314
but that's not just us,
everyone else does that

49
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,320
I don't think it's easy

50
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,323
believing in someone
and cheering them on

51
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,324
That's why we have to do well

52
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,161
That's why we have to do even better

53
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,343
"Let's see how far we can go"

54
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,545
That was sort of our mindset

55
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,314
Especially

56
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,316
for this US. tour

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,320
I'd turn on the news
before we leave for the show

58
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,754
and it's nothing but news about us

59
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,324
No matter where we went

60
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,326
That just defies belief

61
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,329
Being on the morning news

62
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,333
People living in the US
and Canada were saying

63
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,836
that they're grateful there are
Asian artists out there

64
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,338
that they can be proud of

65
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,040
It's a strange feeling

66
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:05,311
It's a good feeling, changing someone's perception

67
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,314
That's not an easy thing to do

68
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,321
If I take a picture, man…

69
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,326
I think I can hold an exhibition
just with the pictures from London

70
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:21,861
Someday...

71
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,334
I want to hold a small exhibition

72
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,606
Maybe when I'm in my 40s?

73
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,342
In the far future

74
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,879
I think if I do,

75
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,915
I think it'll be a very...

76
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,484
touching moment

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,338
What's this?

78
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,342
Oh, man!

79
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,411
What is this?

80
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,313
He's got a good grip

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,049
- What an effort
- Strong grip

82
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,050
It keeps changing

83
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,321
He's rushing to
change hands in there

84
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,323
He's changing hands
down there

85
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,324
It's really hot in here even for us

86
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,326
He's got on a pink glove now

87
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,332
Bingo

88
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:37,337
It's only natural that we're sincere

89
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,338
with our message,

90
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,339
We are BTS!

91
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,375
that we create and present
a great performance

92
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,311
but again, honestly
that's only natural

93
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,413
Fundamentally, we are singers

94
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,317
It also occurs to me

95
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,119
that this is a great time to be doing this

96
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,321
We release an album,
and within seconds

97
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,324
it spreads across the world,
and the news

98
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,794
spreads and the
lyrics are translated right away

99
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,331
The higher we go

100
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,334
our fans might start
to feel distant

101
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,203
What's lucky, though

102
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:14,941
is that there are so many
different ways to connect

103
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,877
So many people say
they are comforted

104
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,545
Some say, "Things were so, so hard,"

105
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:24,817
"but I picked myself back up," they tell us

106
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,920
Now, of course, you have
already conquered the world

107
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,324
two US. number one albums

108
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,658
What is next?

109
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,711
So for me,

110
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,313
in a way, my knowledge in music

111
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:58,317
is shallow compared to RM

112
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,319
or SUGA

113
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,322
I started music after joining the team

114
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,325
so my spectrum isn't that broad

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,761
To start from that

116
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,331
and now being able to provide
comfort and healing

117
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,300
through music to many people

118
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,334
Become another lifestyle

119
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,336
to some people

120
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,338
I still find all this

121
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,441
still amazing, but

122
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,643
there's also a sense of
responsibility

123
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,612
There's a great sense of
responsibility

124
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,848
because we give hope and healing

125
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,119
to great many people

126
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,756
And that's why
I don't take music lightly anymore

127
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,558
Not when it comes to music

128
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,560
- Hope right here!
- I like ARMY...

129
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,029
I like ARMY so much
It's like London,

130
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,133
- London!
- full of hope, like j-hope

131
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,337
If you watch Bon Voyage,
when you were on the boat

132
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,338
you said to the people on
the other side

133
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,339
"Do you know BTS?" again

134
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,340
I didn't

135
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,642
Actually there wasn't anyone around

136
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,345
What? What's your idea of "no one around"?

137
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,349
He must think that means
anything under thirty

138
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,090
- Coming down with a cold?
- Seems like it

139
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,359
Please edit out the previous part

140
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,360
Are you okay?

141
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,797
- Medicine?
- You get me some

142
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,998
Should I make you some porridge?

143
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:19,999
Yes

144
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,336
Where's the chef?

145
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,338
If you're going to act, do it right

146
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,340
Where's the executive chef?

147
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,341
j-hope

148
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,646
- Hot, I'm hot now
- No, no

149
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,348
You have to

150
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,950
Jung Kook, that restroom's open

151
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,285
- Is it?
- Shower room

152
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,686
Okay

153
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,855
I'm going to choose shower
over conditioning

154
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,363
I got cut

155
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,064
Are you hurt?

156
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,333
Something cut into me

157
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,334
Sit down, let me see

158
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,770
- First...
- Hey, you're bleeding

159
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,338
I'll call him

160
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,107
Is he bleeding?

161
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,845
I wish no one gets hurt

162
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,347
Finishing a concert
without anyone getting hurt

163
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,349
is always optimal for us

164
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,353
He was warming up
for a better performance,

165
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,356
and it's a real pity
he was injured

166
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,360
He has so much passion for the stage

167
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,362
so I knew he was going to be
very upset

168
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,363
It's the same with
every situation

169
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,332
You get hurt or sick
because you're unlucky

170
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,334
It's not like I jumped off the second floor

171
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,336
because I wanted to get hurt

172
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,340
There's always the possiblity
of an injury

173
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,343
You just hope you'll heal quickly

174
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,113
It's my first time in Europe...

175
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,855
You were just unlucky

176
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:50,856
No, this is my fault

177
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,859
- It isn't!
- Can you open this?

178
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,461
I wasn't cautious of my surroundings

179
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,863
No, no!
You were just unlucky

180
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,665
What's going on?

181
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,771
What happened?
What do we do?

182
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,773
- Three centimeters. Three
- That's really bad

183
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,743
Does he need stitches?

184
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,778
Is the doctor here?

185
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,779
- He's on his way
- He's coming

186
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,781
This is bad

187
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,816
I'm 100% positive he needs stitches

188
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,785
This is beyond belief
Why am I lying down now?

189
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:20,786
I'm glad you can laugh about it

190
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,788
I ran here worried you'd be crying

191
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,657
I almost did

192
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,792
Afraid I can't go on stage

193
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,794
I'm sure it's super hard
for Jung Kook right now

194
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,796
I actually think it's incredible

195
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,766
that's he's smiling right now

196
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,769
I can't even imagine

197
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,772
how much he's beating
himself up over this

198
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,775
I went through this
myself once too

199
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,111
What's happened has happened

200
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,281
It'll be okay as long as
Jung Kook can hold himself steady

201
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,318
- The rest, we'll...
- I just need to go up on stage

202
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,787
But I can't perform

203
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,822
I've done that before
In the back

204
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,325
Twice I've done it twice,

205
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,795
and it won't be easy, mentally

206
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,697
Keep it together, now

207
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,771
Getting hurt like this,

208
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,072
I got really mad

209
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,775
It was bewildering

210
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,910
I blamed myself a lot

211
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:24,784
If it happened last year,
I might have fallen into a slump

212
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,788
But if I do that

213
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,790
it doesn't helping anything

214
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,361
I'd make everyone else
uncomfortable

215
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,765
I don't think
that's helpful at all

216
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,767
I can't believe this

217
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,770
- He should go to the waiting room
- Which room will be better?

218
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,772
To the waiting room

219
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,773
I need stitches?

220
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,041
It won't hurt

221
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,777
I'm scared

222
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,746
It's just like earlier

223
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,780
SO WHAT, ANPANMAN,
it starts at A

224
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,782
- On stage, instead of the thrust stage,
- From the beginning, let's try

225
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,918
- IDOL
- IDOL, do it the same

226
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,787
We do our dance just the same
without Jung Kook

227
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,790
And the comments
Namjoon will have some more

228
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,792
- Don't focus too much on that
- Okay

229
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,794
When we actually get on stage,

230
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,796
it's going to affect us mentally

231
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,131
But we can't show

232
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,768
the audience that it's getting to us

233
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,769
Jung Kook,
are you raising your hand?

234
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,770
- Let's do our cheer chant
- Can you hear me, Jung Kook?

235
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,773
Can you hear me?

236
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,775
Let's do our cheer chant together

237
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,143
Jung Kook, hang in there

238
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,778
- Bangtan, Bangtan!
- Bangtan!

239
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,779
Let's keep it tight, fighting!

240
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,780
Bangtan!

241
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,766
Make some noise!

242
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,772
Make some noise!

243
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,791
When a member is missing,

244
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,795
that spot seems very empty
so if we try harder

245
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,797
and dance more powerfully

246
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,767
hoping it won't seem so vacant

247
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,835
Not only me but other members too

248
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,770
it seemed like

249
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,773
they were putting in not just a 100%

250
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,777
but more than 100% of their effort
into this performance

251
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,779
And that's why I think

252
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,250
the performance looked even
bigger, with just the six of us

253
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,772
I saw somewhere,

254
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,775
someone said, "Seeing BTS was like

255
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,779
seeing a unicorn"

256
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,780
When you think about that

257
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,516
no matter what's happening
behind the stage

258
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,586
yes, maybe the performance is
not as good as the last one

259
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,088
but 70% and 0% is totally different

260
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,791
Just showing our faces, to some people,

261
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,794
is a spectacular and singular experience

262
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,797
Thankfully, we've become capable
of giving something,

263
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,432
so we have to be here

264
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,767
We have to go up on that stage

265
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:50,783
Hello

266
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,786
- The hotel looks like a school
- Does it?

267
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,355
The Netherlands is really pretty

268
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,856
Yeah, that river

269
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,793
- Are you going out, V?
- Yes

270
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,027
I think I'll step out for a bit too

271
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,764
Come out I don't have
any of you on my film camera

272
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,766
Then I want to go too

273
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,707
Nice Take a look around my room

274
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,774
Welcome, Amsterdam

275
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,776
Welcome to my room

276
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,778
There are grapes and kiwis

277
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,780
Something's in it
Can I eat it?

278
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,787
Let me guess, on my face?

279
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,362
I don't think this is food

280
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,764
Water pressure is strong here

281
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,766
There's a menu for a spa
Room service menu

282
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,867
This hotel is nice

283
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,771
If you look, there's a robe
prepared for you

284
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,773
And underneath, there are slippers

285
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,775
It seems there's an extra pillow
as well

286
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,777
I bought these pj's in London

287
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:56,782
The pride of Korea, instant rice
Seaweed soup rice

288
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,785
This is a face mask

289
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,453
Because my skin's worth it

290
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,789
I need to hang up my clothes

291
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,791
but I couldn't find the clothes hangers

292
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:07,793
In here, I bet

293
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,197
There's a safe

294
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,632
and a teacup

295
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,000
That's it

296
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,435
This is the way out

297
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,538
Goodbye

298
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,778
- Want to go to the bridge?
- Yes

299
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,783
Looking good, V

300
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,419
V is the man of the season right now

301
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,787
I'll take a picture for you

302
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,725
I think this place will
really pop in the daytime

303
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,797
Right now, I'm truly...

304
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,832
I'm really grateful
for my life right now

305
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,934
To be able to do what I can

306
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,769
and being loved for it

307
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,771
that's not something
that comes easily

308
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,774
I want to live happily

309
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,810
for a long, long time

310
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,778
with our BTS members

311
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,382
Frankly, we could go higher

312
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,783
we had the chances

313
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,787
but instead of dreaming
again for something bigger

314
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,789
I want to laugh and be happy

315
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,125
Even if it’s a little lower, a little slower

316
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,627
I want to make music
with our BTS for a long, long time

317
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,795
- Okay
- Nice

318
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,796
Do I look like a local?

319
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,897
Walk down here

320
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,771
Do I look like I'm in Europe?

321
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,773
Yes

322
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,776
To be honest, there's a lot

323
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,779
If we're just talking about
setting records

324
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,547
I want to perform at the Grammy's

325
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,583
Do a world tour in those

326
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,787
"places without roofs"

327
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,790
There's no limit to
human desire

328
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,794
But if I think rationally

329
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,063
just as it is now, this moment

330
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,765
where we're all happy

331
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,766
working together

332
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,769
That's our one goal

333
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,770
It's not easy though

334
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,773
We all have our battles

335
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,442
There are things we want to do
on our own

336
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,777
How can seven guys with
own thoughts become one?

337
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,780
It's all different but
understanding the differences

338
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,150
and being considerate

339
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,987
Through them,
my self-esteem is boosted too

340
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,322
We understand one another very well

341
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,993
and know the importance of our team

342
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,029
which allows us to be happy on stage

343
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,798
if we can be happy
and still set records

344
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,770
that would be the
best of both worlds

345
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,258
My top priority

346
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,128
wherever I go

347
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:58,931
My heels?

348
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,966
I want to go up on the stage
right this moment

349
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,070
but I need to be level-headed about this

350
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,808
I'm so regretful

351
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,044
More than regretful,
I'm really sad

352
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,880
Wait for me, London

353
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,249
Should I check out the catering?

354
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:34,233
Graham Norton Show wasn't too bad

355
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,334
- What?
- Graham Norton

356
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,237
- Better than what we thought
- Not bad

357
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,240
We just need to do our best

358
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,241
That's right

359
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,944
I let my guard down

360
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,247
My muscles are cramped again

361
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,249
I...

362
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:56,488
ended up not being able to go on air

363
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,258
Are you okay?

364
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,359
Yes

365
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,262
- Can you do it?
- I'm feeling a lot better

366
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,264
But still need to be careful

367
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,231
As long as I don't overdo myself

368
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,233
Just go lightly

369
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,234
- Yes
- They'll understand

370
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,236
Everyone knows how you are

371
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,239
I felt so bad

372
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,243
Because I know Jimin

373
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,249
I'm sure he was extremely stressed

374
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,253
When it comes to his body,
he does overstrain himself

375
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,256
But when you do,
it does look nice

376
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,261
I can totally relate to
what Jimin is feeling

377
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,262
I can understand

378
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,232
- I need to get it loose first
- Okay

379
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,500
- My back...
- Help Jimin first

380
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,235
- My back feels so tight
- Okay

381
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,238
I think

382
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,574
it'll be worse if I don't loosen it up

383
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,243
What about where weIworked on before?

384
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,244
- Huh?
- Where we worked on yesterday

385
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,248
- I think I should go up after this
- Right?

386
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,784
Right We can show our 100%

387
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,119
when all seven of us are on stage

388
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,255
It's unfortunate that we can't,

389
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:08,260
but I wouldn't go so far
to say that the quality

390
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,262
of our performance has dropped

391
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,664
It's unfortunate, but

392
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,233
I think we should be grateful

393
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,236
that we can be on stage at all

394
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,706
This case too,

395
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,241
he was going as hard as he can

396
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,243
It's not his fault he got hurt

397
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,246
but to make up for that energy

398
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,250
you go harder and
someone else gets hurt

399
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,251
If this keeps going

400
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,755
its going to affect everyone

401
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,257
Then we end up where we're hurting

402
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,261
the performance and
the fan experience

403
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,232
So we need to be level-headed

404
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:53,238
and for the rest of the tour
set your physical limits,

405
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:57,242
and make sure everyone
stays within those limits

406
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,243
Yes

407
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,245
Even now, we don't know
what's going to happen to whom

408
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,549
Everyone has been sick once,
have missed a stage and so on

409
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,252
The performance suffers more by

410
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,254
you not being there
and being shaken up

411
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:14,259
than by you going
full-on making it great

412
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,262
At the very least,
making sure you're there

413
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:21,233
and keeping your place
in the whole group

414
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,234
is something you need to understand,

415
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,469
realize how important
that is for everyone

416
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,973
and keep it as a promise
among yourselves

417
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,243
There were a few days
when I had a sore throat

418
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,778
When we're on a tour,

419
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,347
we're sick with the cold
about half the time

420
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:40,252
Such that there will be 4 or 5
critical moments during a show

421
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,322
We only had Jung Koon and Jimin
come down with injuries,

422
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,260
but everyone has their
aches and pains

423
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,930
So everyone's trying to figure out

424
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,232
how we can stay on top of that

425
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,243
What I realized during this tour is that
the most important thing

426
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,280
is the health and physical state
of our body

427
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,249
It's very important not to get hurt

428
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,984
- Okay, everyone
- Okay, everyone

429
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,253
We have five more shows left

430
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,255
and there are couple people
that are not feeling well

431
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,659
Like we talked about earlier,
let's look after ourselves well and

432
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,260
- Stay focused
- Right

433
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,030
We need to focus
in a different way

434
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,364
Staying focused to go hard
is one kind of focus

435
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,233
- but we should...
- Focus on not getting hurt

436
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,204
Right. Focus on pacing yourself

437
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,072
I know you guys are concerned

438
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,240
but don't worry too much
I won't go overboard

439
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,242
Jimin, you know better
so I'm not worried

440
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,610
- Don't worry and
- You do what you need to do

441
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,244
do what you need to do

442
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,246
Jung Kook, you'll be on the chair

443
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,250
but in my opinion, you just being there,
it completes the picture

444
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,252
rather than watching us

445
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,255
It's nice seeing you enjoying our show

446
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,257
but when it's your time, do your best

447
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,294
like during the medley or a slow song,
even the cute ones

448
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,264
- Okay
- Okay I think we're good

449
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,233
Okay Let's cheer up

450
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,201
We don't know when we'll be back
in the Netherlands again

451
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,236
- Let's get this!
- All right!

452
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,238
- Let's do well today!
- Okay, fighting

453
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,572
- Fighting
- Fighting

454
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,246
I think many people do know

455
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,250
I think people like us
not because we are perfect

456
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,253
but because we are not
We have a lot of shortcomings

457
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,388
I think that's why

458
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,258
But honestly, I personally don't

459
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,261
want to be just an ordinary Park Ji-min

460
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,331
I'm not saying I want to
be unapproachable or something

461
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,234
I want to be a celebrity
for them

462
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,241
I want them to be happy

463
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,243
I want them to be happy
seeing us

464
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,279
listening to our songs,
watching us dance

465
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,248
That's enough for me

466
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,251
They are the driving force

467
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,254
helping us to strive forward

468
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,258
so I hope that our fans are
as happy as we are

469
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,260
or better yet, happier than us

470
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,031
I think I'm performing with
that thought in my mind

471
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,366
Everyone here, at this moment

472
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,235
I wish for all of them to be happy

473
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,237
That's all I think about right now

474
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,408
Thank you

475
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:45,263
My favorite quote these days is

476
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,232
Done is better than perfect

477
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,234
I think it means that,

478
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,237
doing something is better than
trying just to be perfect

479
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,238
That's how I see it

480
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,239
I liked it

481
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,242
I liked it
"Done is better than perfect"

482
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,244
Nothing is really ever perfect

483
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,247
So these days, I've taken that

484
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,251
quote to heart

485
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,253
I think too much

486
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,257
Are you having fun?

487
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,461
One more,
are you having fun?

488
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,931
All right, thank you guys,
we're BTS

489
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:24,235
and Netherland ARMY is
just all right

490
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:30,241
And there's one more thing
to celebrate tonight

491
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,246
Are you ready?

492
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:44,255
Happy birthday to you!

493
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,426
Happy birthday to you!

494
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:55,233
Happy birthday, dear Jimin

495
00:28:55,266 --> 00:29:02,240
Happy birthday to you!

496
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,443
I love you all!

497
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,248
- Happy Birthday, Jimin!
- Happy Birthday, Jimin!

498
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,251
Thank you!

499
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,357
Hey, me too!

500
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,233
Thank you for giving me...

501
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,235
Thank you

502
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,775
I had no idea you guys would
surprise me like this

503
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,244
I'm so happy
Thank you, everyone

504
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,247
I love you guys!

505
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,263
I'll say, a place where you can
feel the love?

506
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,231
I know, when I'm on stage

507
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,233
"This is how much I'm being loved"

508
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,537
And that's also the reason
I must try hard

509
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,238
This is not just an ordinary place

510
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:11,242
It's a place where I feel
everything should be perfect

511
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,245
But we are so very ordinary

512
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,247
I think we're just
a group of people

513
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,249
trying very hard for perfection

514
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,251
To look perfect

515
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,788
Each member is different

516
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,258
but our sincerity for the stage is identical

517
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,261
It's very

518
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,830
simple, but

519
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,732
we are performers
