[BRING THE SOUL DOCU SERIES:
EP2. PASSION]

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,152
The elements of a stage
What a question

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,054
The stage?

4
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,590
Right
That's a tough question

5
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,859
The elements of a BTS performance

6
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:28,728
Lighting?

7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,265
Why do I think "In-ear monitors?"

8
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,555
We worked hard
When we debuted,

9
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,723
We woke up at 10 am

10
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,591
and got off work
at 10 pm

11
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,593
Now I think "How was
that even possible?"

12
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,595
That's how much
we really practiced

13
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,596
That thirst

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,599
I think

15
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,601
each and every member

16
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,836
has this powerful thirst
for the stage

17
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,938
You can tell
how strong it is

18
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,574
Preciousness?
The stage is precious

19
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,577
Being able to
do this music

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,578
has become so precious

21
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:23,583
I think there are seven identical
things that need to go in

22
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,353
It's the passion for the stage
that each member has

23
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,596
These elements all together

24
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,997
constitute the energy
Energy

25
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,599
Energy that makes
someone new to us

26
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
think "I want to join in"

27
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,604
That kind of energy

28
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,573
Isn't that at the heart
of a BTS performance?

29
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,574
That and the in-ears

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,521
ARMY!

31
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,226
Are you having fun?

32
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,601
The fact that this concert
is just as big as our Korean concerts,

33
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,804
that we ask "Our concert
is that big here too?"

34
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,574
The fact we ask that tells me

35
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,645
"Wow we've really grown"

36
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,591
The first AX concert that we did

37
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,093
we had about 2000 people show up

38
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:19,599
That means now we have
22 to 23 times more people

39
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:25,572
Those numbers...
It’s like a miracle

40
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,575
We started small
and worked our way up

41
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:32,579
This is the story
we wanted to write

42
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,584
BTS is growing steadily

43
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,588
and I think showing who we are
to more people

44
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,591
is the right thing to be
doing right now

45
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,961
That's why we continue
to grow and expand

46
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,599
Wow... This is...

47
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,604
This stage is small so
we shouldn't walk around

48
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,575
We shouldn't lose focus

49
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,577
Just look straight ahead
and do our best

50
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,580
If I'm standing without
doing anything for like 2 seconds

51
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,581
I get really awkward
so I need to do something

52
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,418
And today there are some things
we did wrong too

53
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,587
Everyone's a little too loose

54
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,592
There should be
more mass choreography

55
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,364
I think we should change
the setlist

56
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,599
We should put in a mass choreo
in the middle

57
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,602
It's just we're too close to
the audience

58
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,572
We’re really exposed

59
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:38,578
It just feels like we have to
be dancing to get the energy up

60
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,582
If we're still
we're like blocks of ice

61
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,585
- Let's go hard till the end
- OK

62
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,587
I mean really...

63
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,589
We came a long way

64
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,592
We started with the AX concert
and slowly climbed up

65
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,594
That was really the case

66
00:04:54,627 --> 00:05:00,099
I think because we climbed
those steps one by one,

67
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,604
the things we have now
are so precious to us

68
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,571
That's how we think

69
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,574
I think focusing on the present itself

70
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,711
has been the biggest
driving force for us

71
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,578
That process

72
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,582
Let's just do it

73
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,589
For our first concerts
we didn't have that many songs

74
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,591
We barely filled the setlist

75
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,595
We had to do 26 songs but
we didn't have much choreography

76
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,432
And we weren't even sure
if people will like it

77
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,599
We only had a few songs

78
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,603
We even said "Should we do
a cover or something?"

79
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,573
We had just our songs
on the setlist no covers

80
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,075
We didn't even
have a hit song yet

81
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,576
This was before I NEED U

82
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,578
So trying to have a concert

83
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,814
with that was hard And the choreo

84
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,584
We put together a ton of
choreography for that concert

85
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,586
I think about that the most

86
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,421
So we talked about how…

87
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,589
"I hope we'll have a hit song soon,

88
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,591
so we can finally choose"

89
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,593
Have some choices

90
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,596
Back then we felt
poor in our hearts

91
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,603
I NEED U and "RUN" are
the biggest problems

92
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,573
If "I NEED U" catches on fire
then we keep it up till RUN

93
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,575
I don't know what
we can do with "I NEED U"

94
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,577
When it comes on all of us...

95
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,412
should do a "put your hands up"

96
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,581
Do this with your hands to

97
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,582
get them to do a "hands up"

98
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,585
We need to lock in
what gestures we're doing

99
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:30,590
If someone is trying to
get the energy up during the medley

100
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,592
I think everyone needs to
bring up their energy and match it

101
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:37,597
I think some of us
walk around too much

102
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,600
I mean that doesn't matter
But just bring up the energy

103
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,269
Crank up the energy
even when you're walking

104
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,574
You know we're all not
feeling well today

105
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,210
It's the first day
that's what I'm thinking

106
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,578
We're still not in the groove

107
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,582
Seeing it and doing it
are totally different

108
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,585
For the medley,

109
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,587
songs where we don't have
choreography,

110
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,589
it feels like it's not as fun

111
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,259
"I need to do more"
that's what I start thinking

112
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,595
I don't know

113
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,130
I get nervous

114
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,599
So I go even harder

115
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,602
When it's over I've been breathing so hard that

116
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,603
my clavicle actually hurts

117
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,574
I got better quickly though

118
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,578
Just need to do something
about this neck crick

119
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,587
I think every situation
is different

120
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,889
When we're not touring
I wish I was performing

121
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,593
When I'm performing I just
want to sit and write songs

122
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,963
There's nothing to do
even if I go out

123
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,600
I went out today but
I just ate and came back in

124
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,602
Nothing to do I don't
really do shopping

125
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,571
I don't play games
The other guys are wild about it

126
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,573
Games... I don't play games

127
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,576
I downloaded some games
but I don't play them

128
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,579
I don't really find it very fun

129
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,588
They'll say
I'm a composer

130
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,591
and they'll mention Beethoven or Mozart

131
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,758
pictures of conductors
and that kind of stuff

132
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,594
And then there's me ,

133
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,597
there's a picture
of me lying down or something

134
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,600
The actual
amount of time I work

135
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:25,171
the 12 hours I'm in the studio
I'm lying down 8 hours

136
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,573
Sleeping and eating you know...

137
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:32,578
Getting ready is
what takes the longest

138
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,580
I ask myself
"Why won't anything come up?"

139
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,048
Used to
stress me out a lot

140
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,585
But now I think
"It'll come out"

141
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,587
I believe it

142
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,590
This is for my solo

143
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,595
I've already written the songs

144
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,598
I just have to write the lyrics
and I really don't feel like it

145
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,599
Now that I'm touring

146
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,803
I wanted to put out 10 songs

147
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,573
but I might get 6 out of these

148
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,580
I have to write the lyrics
but I haven't done any of them

149
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,583
I actually wrote the lyrics

150
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,586
I just have to put it to the music
but I don't feel like doing it

151
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,590
I should've done it when
I was working on the album,

152
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,059
right when I was in that groove

153
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,270
- It's always like that
- This? This area?

154
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,573
Yes it hurts
when I bend my leg

155
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,075
Come over here for a second
Come sit here

156
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,145
- Does that hurt?
- Yes

157
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,583
I feel it more because
I don't have my fitness up

158
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,785
The damage just keeps piling on

159
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,588
When you dance...

160
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:52,758
It's not just any kind of dance
It's tough choreography

161
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,595
I think it's kind of inevitable

162
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,597
To be honest I bet I'm not
the only one like this right now

163
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,601
The other members
probably have all kinds of injuries

164
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:07,573
I'm sure there are aches and pains

165
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,575
and I'm sure they keep it to themselves

166
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,578
There are tens of thousands
of people right there

167
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,582
Maybe I don't want to let go
of that...

168
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,618
I think there are
plenty of reasons

169
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,589
What should I call it? Fate?

170
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,590
This pain...

171
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,592
Right? You have to live with it

172
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,594
A chronic condition

173
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,596
As long as you're
in this line of work

174
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,602
I always feel bad

175
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,572
You know I'm not doing it
on purpose right?

176
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,581
I woke up this morning and
my voice was just gone

177
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,586
So I took some medicine

178
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,591
I've got to do better today

179
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,594
I'll do fine today

180
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,797
If I just start warming up now
and take my medicine...

181
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,571
In a way

182
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,575
we were never really
that good our dancing

183
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,011
Myself too
there were a lot of shortcomings

184
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,580
The vocal side of it too

185
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,581
to be really candid,

186
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,782
there was a lot of criticism

187
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,584
To be honest for me...

188
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,587
I thought there will be nothing after
'Blood Sweat & Tears'

189
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,224
I figured that would be our peak

190
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,595
We're doing so many things
not just our concerts

191
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,597
We reached no 1 on the Billboard chart

192
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,101
We perform at awards shows
We receive awards...

193
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,603
Of course we don't perform or do music

194
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,573
to try to meet
all those expectations

195
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,642
But we can't turn away
from those expectations either

196
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,583
BTS has become big like this

197
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,586
If I can't live up to it can't fill it up,

198
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,156
that's a lot of pressure
and it's frightening

199
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,576
But all the passion and love
when we're on stage

200
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,578
make it shine through

201
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,579
When we're on stage

202
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,582
it's all that passion
The hard work and passion

203
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,585
People can recognize sincerity

204
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,966
Music performance the stage
those kinds of things

205
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,603
made me who I am
and changed me

206
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,573
At this present moment
it's my everything

207
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,582
I honestly don't remember
how we ever did that AX concert

208
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,586
Everything was seriously
just so hectic then

209
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,589
It just felt like we were trying
to do the best we could

210
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:48,460
I think we were more fierce
in a different way back then

211
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,595
Instead of using our brains,

212
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,598
we were just following our body

213
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,599
Doing what we wanted

214
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,936
Each moment was so
special back then

215
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,572
All the time every moment...

216
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,007
Like "I'm so thankful
to be able to perform at AX Hall"

217
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,576
I'm so thankful for our fans

218
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,577
And that moment was followed by

219
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,580
our performance at Gocheok Dome
with 25000 people

220
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,582
We've come this far

221
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,051
All those moments
were meaningful

222
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:17,590
I'm thankful because
it's that journey

223
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,591
that made me who I am today

224
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,594
That's one of the main reasons
why we've come so far

225
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,647
- We were better today
- You're right

226
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,584
Today I mean compared
to yesterday...

227
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,588
I feel like we all knew what
we were lacking going in

228
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,589
Everyone did a good job

229
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,591
Today felt really good

230
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,593
I was very satisfied

231
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,594
Great job

232
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,596
We're going out for soju and BBQ

233
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,574
I just want it to be done

234
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,578
Wow that's crazy!

235
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,580
One two three!

236
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,584
You've got to eat after a concert

237
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,120
That's why we never lose weight
even if we do a concert

238
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,588
We actually get fatter

239
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,590
My goal is to not gain weight
on this tour

240
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,492
I'm going to work out

241
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,594
I'm not trying to lose weight

242
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,596
- I just want to maintain
- I know it

243
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,598
We have 18 concerts left everyone

244
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,601
Fighting!

245
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,602
We can do it!

246
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,573
One two three Cheers!

247
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,710
Cheers to the next 18 concerts

248
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,586
This is a very special shoot

249
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,589
Photo shoot for Time Magazine

250
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,826
Not the cover right?
Is it for Time's cover?

251
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,628
- We're on the cover
- Today's a cover shoot?

252
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,932
- Spread and the cover
- Oh really? Oh my

253
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,601
It's the cover shoot

254
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,602
This is ridiculous

255
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,574
How BTS lives...

256
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,577
You lifted your arm
but all I saw was your watch

257
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,884
Let's go let's go

258
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,329
I'm not really thinking
about anything right now

259
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,664
We can't say
we want to go back to Korea

260
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,301
My lifestyle here
and in Korea is about the same

261
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,302
It is?
It's totally different for me

262
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,037
This is all the same

263
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,039
I wanted to go outside and...

264
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,307
Go see an exhibition
or something

265
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,242
I don't normally like
going outside

266
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,310
Go see an exhibition

267
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,946
If I'm overseas for 45 days,

268
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,314
staying abroad,

269
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,316
lots of people think I'm
doing just fine

270
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,320
But after just a week
I feel like I'm going to die

271
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,323
Because I know we're not here
on vacation,

272
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,326
going to a museum
going shopping...

273
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,329
I really do try my best
to do all those things

274
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,331
It's really hard for me to stay
in my hotel room

275
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,304
We're here at
America's Got Talent

276
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,972
AGT bro!

277
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,307
We have a full schedule today

278
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,643
- We have to go to Line
- We have to go to the Line store

279
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,314
I think I'll feel better
after the Grammy Museum

280
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,316
That's what I think too

281
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,351
Isn't our concert tomorrow RM?

282
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,854
Yes in Oakland

283
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,323
- Tomorrow's going to be hard
- Yes it'll be tough

284
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,891
We should take care
of our throat tomorrow

285
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,494
As soon as we get there
we perform then move again

286
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,330
We're on the road again
right after the show

287
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,332
Yeah right away
But we still get two days off

288
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,301
- I'm scared
- Huh? Of what?

289
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,305
- Losing all your energy?
- Yes

290
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,310
It's fun and all but I wish
it was a little less hard

291
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,312
But if it's not hard
it's not a concert

292
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,315
That way you don't think about it
afterwards in your room

293
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,316
You just pass out

294
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,318
Since I'm completely dead
after a show

295
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,887
Even while I'm eating...

296
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,322
I took a bite
and leaned for just a second

297
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,324
Next thing I knew
I was out for 2 hours

298
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,327
I'm the type that always
thinks about tomorrow

299
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,328
I think too much

300
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,331
I think that's why I can't drink

301
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,300
Like "Will tomorrow be tougher?"

302
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,302
You know I go overboard...

303
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,307
Once you start touring
like that...

304
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,310
We live for the performance

305
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,312
I'll say "I have a show tomorrow

306
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,314
so I can't eat after
such and such time"

307
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,317
I was never like that before
I didn't know or care

308
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,319
I didn't really take care
of myself but...

309
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,322
if I don't pay attention
to the smallest things

310
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,324
it affects my performance
the next day

311
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,325
I'm basically living
for the performance

312
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,028
I thought about this yesterday...

313
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,330
Like if you were to tour alone,

314
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,332
I bet it'd be so hard

315
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,300
Completely

316
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,304
It might be
fun to tour on your own

317
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,305
but it's going to be lonely for sure

318
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,307
You're alone all the time

319
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,409
You're alone in your
room all the time

320
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,311
Alone when it's over

321
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,314
I think I'll get
so tired of it quickly

322
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,316
But if it starts to get repetitive

323
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,319
the show at some point...

324
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,454
It begins to
start feeling like work

325
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:27,459
Then you get these different voices
colliding within you

326
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,331
Waiting rooms should be
at least this good

327
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,301
It's got to be this good
You know what I'm talking about?

328
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,304
Seeing the waiting room
just woke me up

329
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,978
- Happy birthday Namjoon
- Thanks so much

330
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:25,150
Happy birthday my bro!

331
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:32,157
Happy birthday to you!

332
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,131
This is probably different
for everyone but...

333
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,135
I don't really think birthdays
are all that special

334
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:47,139
So I'm fine

335
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,141
Actually spending it overseas...

336
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,014
It's kind of better for me

337
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,150
My mom does get sad about it

338
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,153
I guess even for my birthday...

339
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,157
If my life is how should I say
kind of dry like this

340
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:13,131
People might say "What do you live for?"

341
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,135
The happiest I was after
I debuted was...

342
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,138
when I didn't have to worry
about asking myself,

343
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,142
"What if no one listens?"

344
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,811
I don't know exactly when
that was

345
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,646
It was probably around the time
"RUN" came out

346
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,149
Whether no one listens or not,

347
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,151
I don't have to
worry about that

348
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,221
At that time for me...

349
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:39,925
Wouldn't that be
my happiest moment?

350
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,428
When my biggest concern
was solved

351
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,197
Working and having that work

352
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,032
exert a positive impact on society

353
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,002
and then add to that
your own passion

354
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,572
and such then that's
more you can ever hope for

355
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,442
I was lucky I met guys who could

356
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,444
make up for my own shortcomings

357
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,446
That's why I'm able to do this

358
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,782
I'm always saying it but...

359
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,386
I live my life
so that I can love myself

360
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,390
I'm still 25 and it's not easy
because I'm still young

361
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,126
I want to love myself

362
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,262
Should we find a way together?

363
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,598
Yes

364
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,367
- We're going down
- Okay

365
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,503
I have to go

366
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,107
- I'm always forgetting things
- Take your glasses

367
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,081
Good morning

368
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,784
We're finally leaving LA

369
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,752
It really was a long stay

370
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,364
Wow
I didn't even get a full roll

371
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,668
New York Dallas
Chicago Hamilton

372
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,404
Make a quick trip to Toronto
to take some pictures

373
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,674
I really want to take pictures
of London

374
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,410
Oh and Paris too

375
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,280
I heard Paris was so pretty

376
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,284
All photographers say
the same thing

377
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,020
Grow your sense of feeling first

378
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,657
Sure pictures are feelings

379
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,559
When you take pictures
with your feelings,

380
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:25,564
the moment you wanted to capture
can be seen in your picture

381
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,669
They say you should never settle
for just enough in photos

382
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,673
Feeling a sense...

383
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,415
We're finally going to Oakland!
Let's go!

384
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,656
Don't they pop a bottle
of champagne in movies?

385
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,391
Movies aren't real

386
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,659
I'm so hungry!

387
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,661
There are some chips back here

388
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,660
We're going to swing our arms
for "So What" again

389
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,428
So what!

390
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,430
- We're getting off
- Let's go

391
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,669
There's supposed to be a cold front
in Korea when we land

392
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,673
It's so nice we can feel

393
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,676
a little bit of fall weather here

394
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,848
I wish the weather was like this
year-round

395
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,668
What... Are we starting?

396
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,670
Should we make it different
today and go up?

397
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,671
Okay

398
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:51,543
We only have this one day
so let's make it unforgettable

399
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,677
- Bangtan Bangtan
- Bang Bangtan

400
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,182
We can't come here often

401
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,350
So we think this is a special event

402
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,051
that we can do for ARMY

403
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:45,156
We wanted to give them a
great performance and music

404
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,358
It's the support from the fans

405
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,360
that makes all of this possible

406
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,362
We need to give back

407
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,364
I just think we should give back
as much energy as they feed us

408
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,367
I do think that
we've gotten better

409
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,370
Still I think
"If I can do just a little better"

410
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,372
It does occur to me that

411
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,374
it might never be perfect

412
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,745
But I want to make it feel perfect
at least on that stage

413
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,080
That is j-hope

414
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,515
That is BTS
