00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:15,015
[BRING THE SOUL DOCU SERIES:
EP4. INFLUENCE]

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,821
I know
Everyone's panicking except me

3
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,060
I can't believe what I just saw

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,802
The leader of the group, BTS

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,652
I believe there are

6
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,655
many fans and people
who've been comforted

7
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,691
after listening to our music

8
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,061
We need to
understand them,

9
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,097
and say the things
we need to say for these times,

10
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,100
messages that can
help the world

11
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,102
We haven't directly
helped anyone

12
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,104
We're not sponsoring
or donating to all the causes

13
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,106
That's what 'influence' is

14
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:17,143
Giving them an opportunity
to take a step forward through us

15
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,697
My name is Kim Namjoon,
also known as RM

16
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,099
the leader of the group BTS

17
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,103
It’s an incredible honor
to be invited to an occasion

18
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,005
with such significance
for today’s young generation

19
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,110
And I would like to begin
by talking about myself

20
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:55,315
I was born in Ilsan,
a city near Seoul, South Korea

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:01,087
I spent a very happy childhood there,
and I was just an ordinary boy

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,091
I used to look up at
the night sky in wonder

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,094
and I used to dream
the dreams of a boy

24
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:13,099
I used to imagine that I was a superhero,
who could save the world

25
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,814
I don't know when we'll be leaving
I've been waiting for 30 minutes

26
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,183
I need to get some sleep

27
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,520
Everyone's going to go eat steak
at eight today

28
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,522
I think I'll stay in

29
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,491
I'm so tired

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,530
I'm going to go and finish up
on that recording ASAP

31
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,533
That's been bugging me

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,502
- RM, they're here
- Okay

33
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,504
- Are we leaving now?
- Yes

34
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,550
- Jimin
- I'm so sorry

35
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,518
When did you get up? Be honest

36
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,052
What?

37
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,220
Be honest
What time did you get up?

38
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,521
Two

39
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:12,425
I'm sorry for not even washing up
and getting up at two

40
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,526
When'd you go to sleep?

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,528
- I think I passed out right away
- Really?

42
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,532
Yes I was about to go to sleep
then I remembered

43
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,969
you telling me,
"Take out your contacts before bed"

44
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:23,736
Okay

45
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,507
I will

46
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,512
That Kill!

47
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,515
That...

48
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,255
Soraka...

49
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,529
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!

50
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,466
All clean

51
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,837
Such a hassle to dry my hair

52
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,522
Where am I going...

53
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,528
It was fine just staying
in the hotel

54
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,533
but now it's gotten a bit boring

55
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,503
I don't know what to do in the hotel

56
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,502
I didn't even take that many photos
but I'm out of film

57
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,372
- Hello!
- Hey!

58
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,374
- A pleasure to meet you
- Likewise!

59
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,709
How are you, ambassador?

60
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,678
It feels great

61
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,746
I've got to bit want to talk...

62
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,381
Just like us

63
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,383
Yeah, I mean, I love creating at night

64
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:21,387
- Yeah, it calms down
- It feels natural

65
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,389
- It does, like the earth gets quiet
- Yes, right

66
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,391
You're... you know,
the phone's not ringing,

67
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,060
your e-mail's not going

68
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,362
- You can really just focus on music and
- Yeah

69
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,363
get in the zone

70
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,365
- I love working at night
- Inside of myself

71
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,366
Yeah

72
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,368
But raise up a little volume
for this doubling?

73
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,346
This is...
Jimin, what do you think?

74
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,214
RM

75
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,549
All RM

76
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,457
It's not 'Happy Birthday'
so my present

77
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,759
is just 'Happy'

78
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,461
- Happy
- Please, happy

79
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:41,267
I think I actually have more fun
buying presents for the other guys

80
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,801
I know

81
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,270
The UN speech was really good

82
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,273
We didn't do anything
It was all our leader

83
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,242
- Yes
- He was so cool

84
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,244
- If we didn't have RM...
- My heart was pounding

85
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,745
- the thought of it kills me
- just standing behind him

86
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,247
How would have he felt?

87
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,249
Imagine, what if RM
couldn't speak English at all?

88
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,252
- Seriously!
- What would we do on TV?

89
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,255
Probably just be like, "Yeah!"

90
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,993
We are BTS!
That's all we'd ever say

91
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,962
Just the thought terrifies me

92
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,967
We should be thankful
for his existence

93
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,970
That's RM's lyrics
"Thank you for existing"

94
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,974
Do you think we'll be

95
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,978
touring individually in the future?

96
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,281
Like, someday...

97
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:30,983
Pressure...

98
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,985
The pressure and physically exhausting

99
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,990
Imagine doing all 23 songs by yourself

100
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,992
- That will be tough
- It'll be rough

101
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:40,993
The pressure and...

102
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,963
It'll be much more than just working

103
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,199
Concerts, definitely,

104
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,968
but the time besides that,
will be taxing

105
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,971
- When alone
- It's boring

106
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,974
I know How lonely will it be?

107
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:07,553
It's perfect

108
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:15,962
Thank you, bye!

109
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,564
See you next year!

110
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,901
He engineers for
bands for artists like Kanye,

111
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,470
Beyonce, and other legendary singers

112
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,474
Not only that,
but he also produces for them

113
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,481
He says that our song is deep
and touching,

114
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,484
expressing things people are
afraid to admit

115
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,487
and explaining the emotions very well

116
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,091
I like that song the most because,

117
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,462
I don't know
It's just me

118
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,467
It's me, how I want to express myself

119
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,468
I don't know,
I'm not sure...

120
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,471
if I'll get to write a song
true to myself in the future again

121
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,474
So far, it's the only song
that expresses

122
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,845
what I want to do the most
and who I am most accurately

123
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,482
I'm so sleepy

124
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,487
You know what's hilarious?

125
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,490
This is the second person
that sent me this picture today

126
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,492
Really? Who?

127
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,494
"HOPE"

128
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,463
It sounded so odd at first
The name

129
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,466
I know

130
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,235
- Honestly, me too I
- j-hope?

131
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,470
- didn't want to use my real name
- Really?

132
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,472
It doesn't have that "oomph"

133
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,608
No, it's the most,

134
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,481
it's so you

135
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,482
- Yes, I like it now
- Jimin

136
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,485
- People like it a lot, so...
- Jung Kook, Jimin, Jung Kook

137
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,487
I didn't like it since I was a kid

138
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,489
You two are the only ones
using your real name

139
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,494
- I, I...
- j-hope, no?

140
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,596
No, I...

141
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,565
Me, RM, and Bang Si Hyuk PD was there

142
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,467
When we were making names,

143
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,470
I said I want 'Ho' in my name so

144
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,106
at first, it was 'j-ho'

145
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,475
We kept thinking and
"j-ho, j-ho, j-hope?"

146
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,344
That's how we came up with my name

147
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,479
The meanings came after that

148
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,015
Pandora's box was mentioned,

149
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,484
and the last thing left
in the box was hope

150
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,486
We were all like, "Hope"

151
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,089
Looking back, I think
the name was the right choice

152
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,857
And I think the name
made me,

153
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,759
who I am

154
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:22,481
Before, I thought the image
of myself on the stage

155
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,483
and off the stage,

156
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,488
meaning Jung Kook, the singer
and Jung Kook, as a person,

157
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,859
was very different

158
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,463
It felt like that to me

159
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:42,468
I'm working on the differences,
trying to be same on or off stage

160
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:47,473
There are things
I constantly think about

161
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,476
You know, the minor things

162
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,479
I can express my thoughts comfortably,

163
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,481
but even that,

164
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,483
I tend to jot it down and erase it

165
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,485
Things like that

166
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,487
Just in case

167
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,749
Everyone probably thinks about it
at least once

168
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,751
About oneself

169
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,754
Reflect on oneself,

170
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,123
hate,

171
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,758
love...

172
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,761
I, Jeon Jung Kook, as a person,

173
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,765
when the Jung Kook behind the mask

174
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,635
is revealed,

175
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,338
it's a lot of pressure and also scary

176
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,236
You know how they say,

177
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,606
One needs to love oneself first
before loving others

178
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,609
I really love ARMY but

179
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,613
I don't think I loved myself

180
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,583
that much until now

181
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,587
I'm trying to love myself right now

182
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,590
Fully understand what I have

183
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,860
and think, "I'm happy with what I have
and I love it"

184
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,263
I'm trying to feel like that

185
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,599
And I'm working on it on my won

186
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,596
Why? Dad, dad?

187
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,601
It's raining in Busan?

188
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,604
Can you hear me?

189
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,948
I'm eating very well here

190
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,653
I'll check and take
some dried seaweed with me

191
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,755
We got a lot here
That's okay

192
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,827
Yes

193
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,828
- Yes, me too
- Okay

194
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,832
- Yes
- Fighting!

195
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,833
Fighting

196
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,576
My dad says he'll bring us seaweed

197
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,811
We have so much already

198
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,484
There are times when it's difficult

199
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,821
It's very...

200
00:15:55,854 --> 00:16:00,826
Extremely flashy and the cheer from

201
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:05,831
so many people and afterward

202
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,534
when it's all over

203
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,704
and I come down from the stage

204
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,505
it was really difficult before

205
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,809
It's polar opposites

206
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,580
It was very difficult to endure that

207
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,183
Now, I'm not sure

208
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,822
Those moments just linger now

209
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,833
Hangry

210
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,938
That's how I feel right now

211
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,810
No!

212
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,820
Finished

213
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,827
Ta-da! Smile Done

214
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,104
Yes
We’d normally never come out this far

215
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,073
16!

216
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,511
Whoever sits in seat 16 will be
sitting in the same seat as me

217
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,081
It's not easy,

218
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:33,085
even for the hottest stars in the US right now

219
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,088
Tickets selling out in a day

220
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,089
Selling out in an hour

221
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:41,126
I was told there's no other artists
that can do that

222
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,099
Coming to concerts
is a big thing in a way

223
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,869
I see the faces of our fans
from the stage

224
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,074
It seems like
most of them are satisfied

225
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,077
What surprised me during this tour

226
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,079
was that there were people of all ages

227
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,083
The whole family at the concert,
singing along...

228
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,786
I believe there was a definite
positive influence in that

229
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,091
It's possible for parents to learn
from these younger people

230
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,093
That there's definitely some influence

231
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,095
Now they buy tickets on their own

232
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,097
and come together with their kids

233
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:19,665
Are we confirmed?

234
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,600
Confirmed
but it hasn't been announced yet

235
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,435
I'm receiving a medal in this lifetime?

236
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,104
Way to go, BTS!

237
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,074
I should display it in those cabinets
at home

238
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,976
- What is it?
- What award?

239
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,077
It's the Order of Cultural Merit, right?

240
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,312
- Yes, that
- Seriously?

241
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,148
If it's that,
then it's an actual official medal

242
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:40,085
It's acknowledging that we did something
worthy of national merit

243
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,086
It's very precious

244
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,088
I'm experiencing and accomplishing
all kinds of things

245
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,090
- Right?
- I can't believe it

246
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,092
This is what you call an honor
to the family, right?

247
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,895
Not an honor to the family but

248
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,097
should it be an honor to all Parks?

249
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,868
- Honor to all Kims?
- You know what I mean?

250
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,103
After a couple decades

251
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,105
when kids ask "Who's from
the 'Kwangsan Kim clan?'"

252
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,075
There's Kim Tae Hyung
and Kim Seok Jin from Kwangsan

253
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,910
Really?

254
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,912
We are, BTS!

255
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,282
And this is "Ask Me Anything"

256
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,984
And... start!

257
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,188
Can you please tell us more about
IDOL and the story behind the song?

258
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,657
IDOL is,
"No matter what anybody says,"

259
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,659
we are who we are

260
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,629
and we will continue
to make our music our way

261
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,998
Great

262
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:26,999
Can you repeat that in English?

263
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,002
My way

264
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,005
Jung Kook, that was perfect

265
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,009
What is the greatest thing
about being a BTS member?

266
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,012
Encountering once in a lifetime
experiences

267
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,013
Agreed!

268
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,716
There are lots of things you might want to do

269
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,018
but can't

270
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,020
I think I get to do everything

271
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,923
- Mission impossible
- Traveling to many countries

272
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,024
- True, true
- That's right

273
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,027
It's not boring at all
when we're together

274
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,963
- True
- I think that's the best part

275
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,302
Why, why, why, why, why?

276
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,004
This is a reaction when Jin
doesn't know how to respond

277
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,007
Make a reaction
like Jimmy Fallon for me

278
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,013
I received a call from a friend
a couple days ago

279
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,015
and he was more anxious than me

280
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,017
He said, "I'm glad that
you're doing so well,"

281
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,021
but I'm worried
something bad might happen

282
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,023
or you can get
more lonely than before

283
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,026
He said,
"I'm very worried about you"

284
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,795
I do feel a huge responsibility

285
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,997
because now,
whenever we're overseas,

286
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:43,001
everyone knows our achievements

287
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,004
and I feel like we need to accomplish
even more

288
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,340
and sustain our record

289
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,009
I know it's something I need to endure

290
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,679
but I feel like
I have to lead a moral life

291
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,148
and just my life in general

292
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,885
and I as a person has to be flawless?

293
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,027
They're not out yet

294
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:17,996
j-hope

295
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,565
j-hope

296
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,000
j-hope is under the weather

297
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,002
so the frog doesn't look well either

298
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,004
My throat is no joke

299
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,007
It's gotten worse

300
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,011
It's painful watching j-hope like this

301
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,013
When a cheerful guy is down like this,

302
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,015
- it makes me sad
- Yes

303
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:43,054
It's now exactly a month since
we left Korea

304
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,090
I'm realizing once again on this tour

305
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,026
that the 5:5 balance between work
and hobby is important

306
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,895
I'm realizing that again

307
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,429
For sure

308
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,998
I tried playing games

309
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:57,002
and go shopping and stuff...

310
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,471
But since these psychological needs
are not met,

311
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:04,009
I feel like "I was living
a pretty balanced life in Korea"

312
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,013
I know it can't be helped
due to the circumstances but

313
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,017
it's not easy

314
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,026
He can't put it on RM

315
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,029
I want to stretch out my legs

316
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,752
- Welcome
- Thank you

317
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,022
SUGA's room is right next door

318
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,760
Nice room

319
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:02,000
A room in wainscoting...

320
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,003
I'm into interiors designs

321
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,005
I get wild about lighting fixtures

322
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,010
Every time I find lighting I like
when overseas,

323
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:16,081
it's all done by a designer
so I can't buy it

324
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,587
Can you see?

325
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,022
Nope

326
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,392
It must be a prop

327
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,604
I know there are things

328
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,007
I can give advise on

329
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,010
being in the position that I'm in now

330
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,013
but I've accomplished these things
at a young age

331
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,149
and I think I started work before
my peers

332
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,019
but I still am curious

333
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,921
about people my age

334
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,024
How they are living,
what they are thinking

335
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,026
what are their goals and dreams?

336
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,029
What I can do at the moment

337
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,665
and be of help to them is music

338
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,235
A song that can encourage
and comfort them during hard times

339
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,003
That kind of voice

340
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,005
You are my hope

341
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:22,013
- I'm j...
- hope!

342
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,016
Citi Field, wow!

343
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:32,424
Also honored to have first-ever
stadium show in the US.

344
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,025
Thank you, ARMY!

345
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,028
All right, now let's move out
to the next song

346
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:37,996
Let's go!

347
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,000
Let's go!

348
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,003
It's hard to define it but

349
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,071
for me, when it comes to my dark side,

350
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,007
I think I tried to look into it
in more depth

351
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,708
Delving into it constantly

352
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,010
But I didn't like going on stage

353
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,012
with that kind of mindset

354
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,013
and I didn't

355
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,547
It's so nice performing on stage
but afterwards,

356
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,083
the same thing runs through my mind
for the rest 21 hours

357
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,887
So I thought, "What do I do?"

358
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,022
I'm not quite sure yet
Not yet

359
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,025
But I think I do know something

360
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,027
You know, that feeling you get

361
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,996
That you know...

362
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,999
and that somehow
I will find the answer

363
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,003
And now!

364
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,006
Now,

365
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,009
it's 4:57 right now

366
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,279
Three more minutes
Give me five

367
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,014
We've prepared for three years

368
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,383
but it just takes three minutes
Three minutes to upload

369
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:10,021
Even concerts The reason why
the first one is the most memorable

370
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,123
is when we did IDOL for the first time

371
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,026
I can't forget it
The people...

372
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,529
I do it for this

373
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,997
This

374
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,998
It's five

375
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,001
Okay

376
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,004
It's up

377
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,942
It's done

378
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,016
Finished!

379
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,018
This is a really private moment

380
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,588
I do it for that

381
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,490
Waiting for this moment

382
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:49,027
What would they think of this music?
How will they respond?

383
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,029
That's what keeps me going

384
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,000
BTS has become artists performing
in those huge stadiums

385
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,836
and selling millions of albums
right now

386
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,007
But I am still an ordinary,
twenty-four-year-old guy

387
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,778
If there’s anything that I’ve achieved,

388
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,112
it was only possible

389
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,150
that I had my other BTS members
right by my side,

390
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,020
and because of the love and support

391
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,023
that our ARMY fans
all over the world made for us

392
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,928
And maybe I made a mistake yesterday,

393
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,131
but yesterday’s me is still me

394
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,634
Today,

395
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:07,138
I am who I am, with all of my faults
and my mistakes

396
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,014
What is your name?

397
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,550
Speak yourself
