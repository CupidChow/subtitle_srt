4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,820
Are you sure you're going to deliver the settlement letter alone?

5
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,690
Don't type. Do sign language.

6
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,050
Slow down.

7
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,650
I didn't catch it.

8
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,039
This is...

9
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,980
My family...

10
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,680
Family matter.

11
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,330
Please do the last part again.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,920
I don't want to

13
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,220
bother...

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,979
I see.

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,020
You said, "This is my family matter. I don't want to trouble you."

16
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,789
Right?

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,940
Okay, go ahead.

18
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,250
Nian, you're here.

19
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,620
Have a seat.

20
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,900
Do you want something to drink?

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,690
Why is she still at home?

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,810
We just got divorced.

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
She has nowhere to go.

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,780
She'll stay at home for the time being.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,370
Here are the divorce certificate and the personal will that you want.

[Divorce Certificate]

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,620
Give me the settlement letter.

29
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,500
I want Jiang Wanli to leave the Xu family.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,690
A divorce certificate won't solve the problem.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,700
Nian, I've been in this family for ten years.

32
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,650
I know I did something wrong.

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,720
I don't want to be the hostess of this family.

34
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
Just treat me as a maid.

35
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,050
I just need a shelter.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,920
Besides,

37
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,750
your dad needs someone to take care of him, right?

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,510
Are you trying to gain sympathy by pretending to be pitiful again?

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,050
Xu Nian, don't go too far.

40
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,910
Give way to others when you have the chance to do so.

41
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,140
Nian. Nian.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,330
Please spare your sister.

43
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,970
You can beat me or scold me.

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,170
You're a daughter too.

45
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,630
If your mother were still alive,

46
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,980
wouldn't she be sad

47
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,940
to see you be so cruel?

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
Jiang Wanli, how dare you mention my mom?

49
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,820
Why not?

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,480
Does my mother's death have nothing to do with you?

51
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,010
Your mother committed suicide

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
because she felt guilty.

53
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,990
She jumped off the building herself. It had nothing to do with others.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,160
Give us the settlement letter if you want.

55
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,230
If you don't want to,

56
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,020
don't insult us.

57
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,170
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,460
I came in without permission because I saw the door was open.

59
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,790
Ms. Xu. Mr. Gu couldn't leave.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,860
He asked me to bring someone for you.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Ji Lan?

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,530
Mr. Xu.

63
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,780
Lan, don't be afraid.

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,230
Since you are willing to come,

65
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,070
it means you've made up your mind.

66
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,070
Why did my mom commit suicide back then?

67
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,440
I came here to serve Mrs. Xu back then.

68
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,480
She had severe depression.

69
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,090
She needed to take medicine on time every day.

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,530
I took good care of her at first.

71
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,070
She trusted me very much.

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,440
Later on...

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,400
What happened later on?

74
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,240
Someone

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,840
gave me a lot of money

76
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,210
and asked me to change the medicine secretly.

77
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,320
At that time, my husband

78
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,010
owed a big debt.

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,659
I was too greedy.

80
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,850
So I agreed to it.

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,370
But I didn't hurt anyone.

82
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,480
I changed the medicine into vitamins.

83
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,110
Mrs. Xu got worse

84
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,190
because she didn't take the medicine for depression.

85
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,730
Who gave you the money?

86
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,450
Jiang Wanli.

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,960
Don't talk nonsense here.

88
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,930
Honey, she's with Xu Nian.

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Don't trust her.

90
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,820
Lan,

91
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,940
are you telling the truth?

92
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,150
Yes.

93
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,110
I have

94
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,110
an IOU from Jiang Wanli to me.

95
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,870
She promised to pay me

96
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,330
before we stopped changing the medicine.

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,960
I guess

98
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
she thought Mrs. Xu couldn't hold on for long,

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,560
so she gave me this IOU because she had no money.

100
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,260
What can this stupid IOU tell?

101
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,140
Lan,

102
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,430
I indeed have known you for a long time,

103
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,920
and I have also given you money.

104
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,720
But, Honey,

105
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,880
I just wanted to know more about the Xu family.

106
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,040
I was doing this because I loved you.

107
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,590
Honey.

108
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,460
I really didn't do such a vicious thing as changing the medicine.

109
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,860
Honey, you have to trust me.

110
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,540
Since you had stopped changing the medicine,

111
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,100
it had nothing to do

112
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,890
with my late wife's death.

113
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,409
I don't know then.

114
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,310
Oh, I remember

115
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,690
a woman

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
often called Mrs. Xu at night.

117
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,940
She yelled at Mrs. Xu.

118
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,720
She must be provoking Mrs. Xu.

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,310
Because every time Mrs. Xu answered the phone,

120
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,280
she was in great pain

121
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,180
and very sad.

122
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,910
Get lost! Stop forcing me!

123
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,690
I know you want me to die.

124
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,800
Fine.

125
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,240
I'll grant your wish.

126
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,820
Oh.

127
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,100
I remember her phone number had lucky numbers as the last digits.

128
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,640
Six, seven, eight, nine, zero.

129
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,640
Six, seven, eight, nine, zero?

130
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,409
I just called her a few times.

131
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,790
I didn't expect

132
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,200
she would take things too hard.

133
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,020
Honey, I really can't take it.

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,520
I really can't.

135
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,350
Intentionally provoking a depressed patient,

136
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,210
resulting in the patient's death, may involve charges of intentional homicide or intentional harm,

137
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,510
leading to legal consequences.

138
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,390
Honey! Honey!

139
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,190
Honey, help me!

140
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,760
Honey, help me!

141
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,610
We're divorced.

142
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,690
Ms. Xu,

143
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,870
based on the current evidence,

144
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,110
it’s not enough to convict Jiang Wanli.

145
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,070
Stop the car.

146
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,540
What's wrong?

147
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,590
Stop the car.

148
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,240
Okay.

149
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,090
Ms. Xu. What's wrong?

150
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,980
Where is Xu Nian?

151
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,370
She's outside.

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
Open the door!

153
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,290
I can't open it. It's locked.

154
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,830
Get out of the way!

155
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,710
Get out of the way!

156
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,990
Xu Nian, what are you doing?

157
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,950
Xu Nian, don't do anything stupid.

158
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,440
If there's any problem, leave it to me, Xu Nian.

159
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,860
Xu Nian.

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,110
Xu Nian.

161
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,830
Xu Nian, it's me.

162
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,130
Xu Nian.

163
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,520
Mom!

164
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,660
Nian.

165
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,890
Let's get down, okay?

166
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,100
Come down.

167
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,050
Nian, don't cry.
