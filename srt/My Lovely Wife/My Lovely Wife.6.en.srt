[My Lovely Wife]

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,250
[Episode 6]

4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,670
With all due respect,

5
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,210
as the influence of the previous prostitute scandal has been lifted,

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,760
you might as well claim

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,460
that you were deceived by Xu Nian

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,400
and you yourself are a victim.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,360
It will draw public sympathy.

10
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,460
It'll be good for you in terms of public opinion.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,620
What about Xu Nian?

12
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,370
Whether Ms Xu's scandal is true or not,

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,690
it's the best time to dissociate yourself from her.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,930
Besides, you need to explain to your father, too.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,180
Where are you going?

16
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm going to explain to the reporters.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,220
I'll take care of my own business.

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,890
Don't go.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,070
Don't worry. I'll help you.

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,510
Inform the Technology Department to work on it immediately.

21
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,140
Yes.

22
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,210
Mrs. Xu, do you mean

23
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,620
the rumors online are all true?

24
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,610
Xu Nian is my stepdaughter.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,690
I know her best.

26
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,860
Actually, we were surprised

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,229
when learned about her engagement 
with Gu Mingyuan.

28
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,930
We didn't even have time to object.

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,840
As Xu Nian's parent,

30
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,640
I really don't want to see this happen.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,930
I apologize to the Gu family on behalf of Xu Nian.

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,720
Mrs. Xu, I'm afraid

33
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,010
as a stepmother, you're not qualified

34
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,130
to be the spokesperson of my fiancée.

35
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,040
Everyone,

36
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,090
the intimate photos of Xu Nian and others spreading online

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,420
all have trails showing that they were tempered.

38
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,420
These are a part of the original photos restored by our IT Department.

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,180
We've reported it to the police.

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,960
Later,

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,290
a more authoritative organization will issue relevant evidence.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,800
If anyone can prove

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,090
my fiancée's misconduct,

44
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,610
I'm willing to offer him 10 million.

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,880
But if I find out who slandered her,

46
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,240
Shanyu's Legal Department 
will follow it up and through.

47
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:07,640
[Songlin]

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,080
Looks like Mr. Gu is going to support his fiancée.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,640
You don't understand.

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
This is called crisis management.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,880
There's no smoke without fire.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,550
Even if the photos are fake,

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,850
that thing might be true.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
Everyone has left.

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,160
Let's go too.

56
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,550
I thought that if I do Xu Nian dirty,

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,880
Gu Mingyan'd dump her.

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,550
I underestimated her artifice.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,840
I told you

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,600
this wouldn't work.

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
We should have used the honey trap.

62
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,770
Honey trap?

63
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,950
All you know is honey trap. Use your brain.

64
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,820
Jiang Wanli.

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,380
Don't go.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,770
Yao, go get the car.

67
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,579
Mom.

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,410
Who is she?

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,079
Go get the car!

70
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,600
Okay.

71
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,700
Lan, long time no see.

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,340
It's settled.

73
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,500
Don't think too much.

74
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,290
I helped you solve the problem

75
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,200
because I don't want to be seen as an illicit amour.

76
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,400
One problem is solved.

77
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,120
But there's another problem emerging.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
You caused me so much trouble.

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,710
I should deduct

80
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,110
at least 50 points from you.

81
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,420
50?

82
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,530
Back to zero again.

83
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,390
When can I get the school back?

84
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,900
I'll go find my phone.

85
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,420
Mr. Gu, your father called just now.

86
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,650
He was very angry.

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,010
A puppet is gradually getting out of control.

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,900
Of course he'll be angry.

89
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,330
Are you referring to the thing

90
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,370
where Chairman wants you to marry into Shenlyu Group for business?

91
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,820
Now you are married to Mr. Xu.

92
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,650
Then you should fulfill what you've promised me.

93
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,150
I've given you everything I should.

94
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,310
Don't be too greedy.

95
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,830
I'm greedy?

96
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,300
You should know clearly if it weren't for me,

97
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,370
you couldn't have become Mrs. Xu.

98
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,340
Are you threatening me?

99
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,480
So what if I'm threatening you?

100
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,350
Why don't we talk to Mr Xu?

101
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,770
Miss.

102
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,250
Miss.

103
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,330
Don't you leave!

104
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,750
-Let go!
-Don't go!

105
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,570
Miss, what's wrong?

106
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,290
Look, I found your purse.

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,160
Thank you.

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,950
Check if anything is missing.

109
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,430
Miss, is there a problem?

110
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,430
Can you take me to the person in charge here?

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,270
Okay.

112
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,860
Who is she?

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,470
She's a temporary worker here. 
Her name's Ji Lan.

114
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,850
Mrs. Xu, time to have medicine.

115
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,710
Here.

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,659
Nian, stop playing. Go wash up.

117
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,350
Go upstairs and sleep.

118
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,830
Go and rest.

119
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,380
Do you have her number?

120
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,060
I'll find it for you.

121
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,660
Ms. Xu, she didn't answer.

122
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,760
Lan was my mom's caretaker.

123
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,060
After Mom passed away, Dad fired her.

124
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,260
But Jiang Wanli came in later.

125
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,480
Why are they connected?

126
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,360
I've given you everything I should.

127
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,720
Don't be too greedy.

128
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm greedy?

129
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,570
You should know clearly

130
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,870
if it weren't for me,

131
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,690
you couldn't have become Mrs. Xu.

132
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,840
Are you threatening me?

133
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,140
So what if I'm threatening you?

134
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,940
Why don't we talk to Mr Xu?

135
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Let's tell him about us.

136
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,539
Could it be

137
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,430
Mom's death is related to Jiang Wanli?

138
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,370
But now Lan is nowhere to be found.

139
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,700
I can't just wait.

140
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,800
I must go home and find out the truth.

141
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,260
Please ask Gu Mingyan for me for a few days off.

142
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,360
I need to go home.

143
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,730
Okay.

144
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,330
Where is she going?

145
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,690
Ms. Xu wants to take a few days off and go home.

146
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,940
She tried so hard to escape from Xu family.

147
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,180
Why is she going back now?

148
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,160
Ms. Xu seems to be investigating something.

149
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,950
She asked me to look for a staff member here.

150
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,390
Mr. Gu, do you want me to go and ask her?

151
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,870
No, let's go back to the office first.

152
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,860
Xu Nian, why are you here?
