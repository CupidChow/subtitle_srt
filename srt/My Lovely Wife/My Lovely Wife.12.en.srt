[Episode 12]

4
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,270
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

5
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,520
Mr. Gu will wake up soon.

6
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,300
Has Gu Mingyan always been so easy to faint?

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,260
Mr. Gu has always been mentally ill.

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,710
Being afraid of blood 
is just one of the symptoms.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,140
Other symptoms include

10
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,280
being afraid of fire, sharp objects,

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,210
unfamiliar environment,

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,520
and some…

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,850
acts too intimate.

14
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,550
First of all, I don't like people being too close to me.

15
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,520
But in this special situation,

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
if there's an outsider around,

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,480
I want you to move outside a circle

18
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,850
with me as the center and a radius of 20 cm.

19
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,070
So that's why

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,820
he was acting so weirdly before.

21
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,460
Liu Bo, pay the money!

22
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,710
Come out and solve the problem.

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,979
Pay us! Pay us!

24
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,150
Pay us!

25
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,770
Pay the money!

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,200
You've been in debt for so long. Pay us back!

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Pay off your debts! Hurry!

28
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,730
Someone jumped off the building.

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,550
Don't hide in the room.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,860
No!

33
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,900
Mr. Gu, Mr. Xu...

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,130
Sorry to bother you.

35
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,710
Come back.

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,210
What is it? Go ahead.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,320
Mr. Xu is downstairs. He wants Ms. Xu to go downstairs.

38
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,980
Can I talk to my dad alone?

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Go ahead.

40
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,430
Yao

41
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,050
was taken away by the police.

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,050
They said it was intentional assault.

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,860
You...

44
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,920
Can you ask Mingyan to sign a settlement letter

45
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,320
and to not sue Yao?

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,100
I thought

47
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,070
he came to repent for betraying Mom 
and having an affair with Jiang Wanli.

48
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,750
I didn't expect him to be so nice to Jiang Wanli and her daughter.

49
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,159
I know you're still mad at us,

50
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,570
but it's Aunt Jiang and Daddy's fault.

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
Yao is innocent.

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,730
She just wanted to protect her mother.

53
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,400
I've never begged you.

54
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,650
I'm begging you today.

55
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,180
Ask Mingyan to sign this.

[Criminal Settlement Letter]

57
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,380
Why didn't you care about Mom

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
when something happened to her?

59
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,300
Why didn't you care about me

60
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,550
when Jiang Wanli abused me?

61
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,300
I...

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,570
I just want to solve this scandal today.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,170
Let's talk about the past later, okay?

64
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,830
Why should we put the matter of me and my mom behind?

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,820
Why should

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,880
Jiang Wanli and her daughter's troubles be solved now?

67
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,850

You...

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,490
I asked your mother to find Gu Hongze

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,620
to help Xinliang Group get through the crisis.

71
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,920
Your mom and Gu Hongze ended up together, do you know?

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,260
Someone took a photo of them, do you know?

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,040
Have you considered my feelings?

74
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,790
I'm a man.

75
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,130
I was her man. I was her husband, do you know?

76
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,130
Why do you have to touch my sore spot?

77
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,750
I'll prove my mom's innocence to you.

78
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,820
You want a settlement? No problem.

79
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,260
But I have two requests.

80
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:51,960
Go ahead.

81
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,990
First,

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
I want you to divorce Jiang Wanli now.

83
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,330
No matter how wrong she was,

84
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,940
she has been with me for 20 years after all.

85
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,740
Let Xu Yao go to jail then.

86
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,610
You...

87
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,990
Xu Nian, how could you become like this?

88
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,010
She's your sister!

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,480
No, she's just your daughter.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,630
It's up to you.

91
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,790
The second request.

92
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,510
Second, I want you to change your will.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,080
I'll be the first heir to your property.

94
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,320
The proportion of Xu Yao's inheritance cannot exceed 5%.

95
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,330
What Jiang Wanli has taken away from the group these years

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,080
is enough for the rest of their lives.

97
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,020
Or do I need to add another condition?

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,420
To have them recover the assets they have embezzled?

99
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,690
Then there will be more than one person going to prison if that's the case.

100
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,100
Okay.

101
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,730
I promise you.

102
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,540
When the will and the divorce agreement are done,

103
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,130
I'll send you the settlement letter.

104
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,440
You win.

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,290
Xu Nian.

106
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,660
Thank you.

107
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,000
Why don't we get a divorce?

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
Why, honey?

109
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,630
Why do you want a divorce?

110
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,840
Honey, don't abandon me.

111
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,470
Honey, I only like you. I only love you.

112
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,750
As long as you agree,

113
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,230
Xu Nian will send the settlement letter here.

114
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,630
Then Yao will come back.

115
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,710
Xu Nian forced you, right?

116
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,980
This bitch forced you, right?

117
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,370
No, I don't want a divorce! Never!

118
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,310
Then our daughter will go to jail

119
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,450
and have her life ruined.

120
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,020
Xu Nian.

121
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
You're so cruel.

122
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,100
Honey,

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,450
I've been with you for 20 years.

124
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,120
We raised Yao together.

125
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,000
Are you really going to abandon us now?

126
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,409
Honey.

127
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,530
No!

128
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,150
I don't want to, honey.

129
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,039
I won't really abandon you.

130
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,790
Anyway,

131
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,200
let's get the settlement letter first.

132
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,670
Let's get a divorce first.

133
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,420
When Yao comes out, everything will be fine.

134
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,020
By then,

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
we can do whatever we want.

136
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,510
Alright, stop crying.

137
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,740
Xu Nian.

138
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,090
I won't let you off easily!

139
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,920
Thank you.

140
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,930
If you owe me, it means you have to pay me back.

141
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,350
Of course, what do you want me to do?

142
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,830
As long as I can.

143
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,900
Anything?

144
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,540
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

145
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,940
Stop typing.

146
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,260
Let's use sign language.

147
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,290
I've been learning sign language lately.
