[Episode 10]

4
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,660
Hello, this way please.

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,620
Listen to me.

6
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,060
These girls are nothing.

7
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,650
I'll knock them all down.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,300
- Drink with me.
- Take care. Please come again.

9
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,890
Ms. Xu.

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,320
Where are you going?

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,430
You've run away twice.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,150
Do you know what it means when they say 'things come in threes'?

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,170
God is watching.

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,640
I tried so hard to look for you,

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,460
only to find you so easily.

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,390
Come with me. Come!

17
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,130
Get in!

18
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,970
Do you still want to run away? Can you run away?

19
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,900
Aren't you pretty good at running?

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,820
You're still trying this?

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,990
It doesn't work.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,860
Can you run away?

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,140
Come on.

24
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:42,830
Come on.

25
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,150
I asked you to come.

26
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,009
Who is this?

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,770
Gu Mingyan.

28
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,150
I'll beat you

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,420
every time I see you.

30
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,460
Are you okay?

31
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,579
Don't be afraid.

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,840
What's wrong?

33
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,230
Did you hurt your waist?

34
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,440
Let me take a look.

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,550
Why? Are you shy?

36
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
I'll just check

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
if your waist is badly injured.

38
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,270
And if you need to go to the hospital.

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't think too much. Come on.

40
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,840
Your waist is heavily bruised.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,140
Let me get you some medicine.

42
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,700
It's too hard for you.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,880
Let me help you.

44
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,730
What are you doing at a place like that so late at night?

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,440
If I tell you about my mom,

46
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,260
it will also involve Gu Mingyan's father.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
I shouldn't tell him.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
Men who go to those places

49
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,510
are no good.

50
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,980
What were you thinking?

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
How dare you go there alone?

52
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,720
If I hadn't been there today or I got there late,

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,780
the consequences would be unimaginable, you know?

54
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,060
Why were you there?

55
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,340
I don't know what you're signing.

56
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,330
What's going on?

57
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,020
Is it because he used too much energy

58
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,590
to beat Zhou Guodong today?

59
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,580
He's too weak.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,340
I'll make you a big meal tomorrow.

61
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,320
♫In the early days, we were thick as thieves♫

62
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,670
♫What're you doing? Can we hang?♫

63
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,890
♫People come and go, lessons on the road♫

64
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,030
♫We were meant to stay♫

65
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,750
♫I need closure♫

66
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,650
♫I need to know that we will be okay♫

67
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,110
We can eat soon.

68
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,470
♫On our separate ways♫

69
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,880
♫I feel closer♫

70
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,560
♫These shadows that I need♫

71
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,920
♫Of these sheets♫

72
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,420
♫Over me♫

73
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,700
♫Closer♫

74
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,350
I put a lot of Chinese medicine in the soup.

75
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,730
You are weak.

76
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,980
You need some nourishment.

77
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,580
It's drinkable.

78
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,710
Hello?

79
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,710
Wait.

80
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,050
Speak.

81
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,030
Mr. Gu, I found that man.

82
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,260
Who is he? What's his relationship with Xu Nian?

83
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,710
He's a private detective.

84
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,990
Ms. Xu asked him to investigate Jiang Wanli.

85
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,300
Because Ms. Xu couldn't afford the investigation fee,

86
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,390
the detective didn't take the case.

87
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,120
Ask hin to continue the investigation.

88
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,300
I'll pay.

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,400
Ms. Xu, when we were investigating other cases,

90
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,280
we found the person you were looking for

91
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,450
so we checked it for you.

92
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,260
Okay, thank you.
