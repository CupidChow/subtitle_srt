[Episode 2]

4
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
Good morning, everyone.

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,970
This is Finance and Economics Channel.

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,520
Breaking news!

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,640
Shanyu Group has just announced its new CEO.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,870
Surprisingly,

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,440
the group will not be inherited by Gu Hongyu, the second-generation heir

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
but Gu Mingyan, the eldest grandchild of the Gu family

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,040
and the third-generation heir. This decision is so sudden.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,490
It is said that Gu Mingyan is the only son of Gu Hongze, the former CEO.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,800
Gu Mingyan was brought up abroad.

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,100
He's mysterious and low-key.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,880
Mr. Gu, how do you feel

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,700
about becoming the new CEO?

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
Mr. Gu, how did you beat Gu Hongyu?

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,050
Did Gu Hongyu give up his right to become the CEO?

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,280
Please, get out of the way!

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,960
-Mr. Gu won't take any questions.
-Mr. Gu, please tell us.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,800
Mr. Gu, please tell us.

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,720
Move.

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,900
Mr. Gu,

24
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,660
Even if the Chairman wants to retire,

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,410
he should let Gu Hongyu be the CEO.

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,140
How can he let Gu Mingyan be the new CEO?

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,770
He has just come back to China.

28
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,990
It is not important who the new CEO is.

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,860
We should prioritize our company's development.

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,420
Mingyan just took office,

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,530
but made such an ambitious acquisition proposal.

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,200
His proposal is unrealistic and will do no good to the group.

33
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,060
Hongyu. Don't worry.

34
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,850
We've been working for the group for long. We all support you.

35
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,259
Today's vote...

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,030
Please read these documents.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,479
Mingyan, what do you mean?

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,950
I can forgive you

39
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,479
for what you did in the past.

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,410
But from now on,

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,130
I hope you can make the right choice.

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,220
We'll acquire the Xinliang Group.

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,470
You can vote now.

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,880
Any objection?

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,120
Okay.

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,840
No objection.

47
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,310
The acquisition proposal is approved. Meeting ended.

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,740
How could he do that?

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,450
He's difficult to deal with.

50
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,490
He is so despicable.

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,840
Looks like it won't be easy to deal with him in the future.

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,300
He's too young to beat me.

53
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,710
Jin.

54
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:46,750
Mr. Gu.

55
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,100
How is the thing about Gu Mingyan? Did you do the job well?

56
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,990
Yes.

57
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,650
It's time to teach him a lesson.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,270
Xu Nian, are you crazy? What are you doing?

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
This vicious woman kidnapped me

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
and sent me to a man's bed.

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,520
Don't slander me.

62
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,230
When did I do that?

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,760
Honey, I just took her to meet Zhou Guodong.

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,240
As to what happened next...

65
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,800
What are you doing?

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,840
This is my house.

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,540
She is your stepmother.

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
Dad, if you don't believe me,

69
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,260
we can check the footage of the surveillance camera in the hotel together.

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,600
What surveillance camera?

71
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
What surveillance camera?

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,640
Will your stepmom hurt you?

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,800
Will she frame you?

74
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,050
I am so busy

75
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,680
with work at the company.

76
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,610
When I get home, I have deal with this mess.

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you want?

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,910
Fine.

79
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,410
Let's not talk about this.

80
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,610
Dad.

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
Are you going to sell the school?

82
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,360
Yes.

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
You can't sell the school. The school belongs to my mom.

84
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,680
It's not yours.

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,880
This is my house.

86
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,070
Don't mention that shameless woman in my house.

87
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,680
My mom was not shameless.

88
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,180
This woman is shameless.

89
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,690
You...

90
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,870
Get lost!

91
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,190
Get lost!

92
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,720
Honey.

93
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,570
Did you see that look in her eyes?

94
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,500
It's like she was going to eat me.

95
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,220
Shut up!

96
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,260
Mr. Gu, it's been investigated.

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,790
Gu Hongyu bribed the waiter into drugging you

98
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,210
and sent this woman to your room.

99
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,780
It wasn't her.

100
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,650
Not her?

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,510
No, not this woman.

102
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,900
But the information I got said it's her.

103
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,120
I said it's not her.

104
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
It's not her.

105
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
Okay.

106
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,080
Keep investigating.

107
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,140
Okay, I'll do it now.

108
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,730
Let me ask you.

109
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,810
Is what Nian said true?

110
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,260
Impossible.

111
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
How could I do that?

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,550
Yes

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,290
or no?

114
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,220
Honey, sit down. Don't be angry.

115
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,440
Being angry is bad for your health. Yao and I depend on you.

116
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,900
Listen to me.

117
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,200
Zhou Guodong has always liked Xu Nian.

118
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,580
And he said

119
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,200
if he can get Xu Nian,

120
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,100
he'll invest in Xinliang Group.

121
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,060
You...

122
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,380
You want to sell my daughter?

123
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,290
Xu Nian is not a little girl anymore.

124
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,960
Shouldn't she get married?

125
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,840
But she is a mute.

126
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,870
No decent man will marry a mute.

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,580
Xu Nian should feel lucky that Zhou Guodong likes her.

128
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,650
Besides, if the Zhou family and the Xu family can be relatives by her marriage,

129
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,970
not only can we prevent Xinliang Group from being acquired,

130
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,120
but our group can thrive again, honey.

131
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,890
Dad, Mom.

132
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,510
Look, is this Xu Nian?

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,720
[Gu Mingyan, CEO of Shanyu Group, was found to stay with a mysterious woman in the hotel. Rumor said the woman is a prostitute]

134
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,880
Mingyan, I'm not lecturing you.

135
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,830
You are young. I can understand.

136
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,190
But you've just become the CEO

137
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,450
and there are rumors of you meeting a prostitute.

138
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,980
It'll damage the reputation of the group.

139
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,760
The board of directors are very angry about it.

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,640
You'd better

141
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,720
voluntarily resign as CEO now

142
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,430
instead of letting them force you to step down.

143
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,200
I will explain to your grandfather.

144
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,440
You really put in a lot of effort.

145
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,190
After all, we are family.

146
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,230
Back then, your dad

147
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,160
also slept with some shameless woman.

148
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,730
In the end...

149
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,860
I don't want that tragedy to happen to you.

150
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,540
I found the girl's information.

151
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,100
Who said she's a shameless woman?

152
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,540
She is my fiancée.

153
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:36,790
Really?

154
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,300
I will hold a press meeting to clarify the issue

155
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,280
and introduce her.

156
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,130
You don't have to do anything.

157
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,960
Alright.

158
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,510
In that case,

159
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,470
I have nothing to say.

160
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,860
Bye.

161
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,510
[Xu Nian]

162
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,660
The daughter of Xu Tao from the Xinliang Group?

163
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,920
She's also Song Yuzhi's daughter.

164
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,500
A teaching assistant at a special education school?

165
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,860
She's a mute.

166
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,340
A mute?

167
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,830
Let's go find her.

168
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,620
Everyone knows Xu Nian now.

169
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,100
The scandal is on the hot search.

170
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,720
Mom, Gu Mingyan

171
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,960
is handsome and rich.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,580
How did Xu Nian seduce him?

173
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,360
I also want to know Gu Mingyan.

174
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,400
If he likes me too...

175
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,110
Shut up! Are you out of your mind?

176
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,530
Stop it. Your dad is angry.

177
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,570
Go back to your room.

178
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,160
Honey, don't be angry.

179
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,540
The media made up the story. How can she be a prostitute?

180
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,550
Nian is not that kind of girl.

181
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,330
There must be something going on between them two.

182
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,570
But it's impossible that they're a couple.

183
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,020
Gu Mingyan is Gu Hongze's son.

184
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,050
Xu Nian knows the relationship

185
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,000
between Gu Hongze and his mother.

186
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,000
Can you shut up?

187
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,360
I can shut up but others will keep talking about this.

188
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,480
Then don't say these things to make me angry.

189
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,800
Xu Nian is the one who annoys you.

190
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
You have to talk to her about what is going on.

191
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,730
You go. Go, go, go.

192
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,340
Okay.

193
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,850
Give me the key.

194
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,200
What's wrong?

195
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,320
You don't have to go.

196
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,640
I can go alone.

197
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,630
Okay.

198
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,590
Besides,

199
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,220
it's not safe to stay in the hotel owned by our group.

200
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,110
Go find a safer place to live.

201
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,210
Yes.

202
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,900
You're as shameless as your mother.

203
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,060
You're really fooling around with Gu Mingyan.

204
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,860
What are you talking about?

205
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,370
You've disgraced the Xu family. Take her.

206
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,580
Go with us.

207
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,780
Go.

208
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:36,890
Go.

209
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,010
Thank you.

210
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,820
Don't run.

211
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,810
Come here.

212
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,930
Girl, don't try to resist.

213
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,440
You managed to escape last time.

214
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,790
Today, you'll know

215
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,990
you can never escape from me.

216
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,290
How about we drink some?

217
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,000
Good idea.

218
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,260
Cheers.

219
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,100
Stop!

220
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
Hurry! She ran away! Chase her!

221
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,450
Stop! Stop!

222
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,240
Stop!

223
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,200
Stop!

224
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,500
Stop! Stop!

225
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,910
Stop! Stop!
