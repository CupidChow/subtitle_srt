[My Lovely Wife]

3
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,160
[Episode 18]

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,320
Are you okay?

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,410
How about you?

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm fine.

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,730
Mingyan, there's blood.

8
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,490
Xu Nian,

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,660
do you know what I fear the most?

10
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,390
I'm afraid of wasting time the most.

11
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,250
I've already wasted a lot of time

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,450
on deciding whether to like you.

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,590
I don't want to waste more time.

14
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:30,680
Xu Nian.

15
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,080
I'll use my whole life to prove

16
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,539
you are my only one.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,060
Who would bring a ring when saving people?

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,150
Xu Nian,

19
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,540
marry me.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,840
What a pity.

21
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,230
We were so close to getting rid of Gu Mingyan.

22
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,710
I never expected a crazy woman

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,040
could kill Gu Mingyan.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,640
But one thing is for sure.

25
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,980
[Gu Mingyan, president of Shanyu Group, announced his marriage to his fiancée Xu Nian; their wedding of the century is highly anticipated]

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Xu Nian is his weakness.

27
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,130
We've planned for so long.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,140
It's time to close the net.

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,560
♫Nobody knows♫

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,400
♫This feeling I behold♫

31
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,040
♫I feel younger, but I'm wrong♫

32
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,820
♫I've seen highs, I've seen lows♫

33

♫These days come and go♫

34
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,280
♫So beautiful, so cold♫

35
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,100
♫I've been walking on my own♫

36

♫It's like I can't move on♫

40

Do I look good?

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,570
There is a serious problem.

42
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,130
You look too good in this wedding dress.

43
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,010
I just want to enjoy it alone.

44
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,370
Cheesy.

45
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,270
Someone's here.

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,110
The veil is crooked.

47
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,730
Let me help you.

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,340
Blood.

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,260
-Gu Mingyan.
-Blood. Blood…

50
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,940
Gu Mingyan!

51
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,560
You are so annoying.

52
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,850
Are you trying to scare me again?

53
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,180
What's wrong with you?

54
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,060
I hope we can have our wedding now.

55
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,850
Coming!

56
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,680
What are you doing here?

57
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,570
It's different to have a woman at home.

58
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,410
What brings you here?

59
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,040
Why? Will you be just like Mingyan

60
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,920
and not call me Uncle?

61
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,970
I'll call you whatever Mingyan calls you.

62
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,370
You're indeed siblings.

63
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,620
You have the same temper.

64
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,600
Why on earth are you here?

65
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,650
Sit.

66
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,890
Take a look at this report.

67
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,190
Let me explain.

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,320
This is the paternity test report

69
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,659
made for you and my father.

70
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,900
It says

71
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,440
the probability of you being direct relatives is 99%.

72
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,440
In other words,

73
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,620
you are a child of our Gu Family.

74
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,380
You're my brother Gu Hongze's daughter.

75
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,610
You just talk nonsense here with a piece of paper.

76
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,770
Why should I believe you?

77
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,470
I know you won't believe me

78
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,010
at this special time.

79
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,920
But

80
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,230
this is not the only proof I have.

81
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,590
You should be able to recognize this woman

82
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,890
was your mother, right?

83
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,020
The other

84
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,650
is Gu Hongze.

85
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,550
They loved each other deeply.

86
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,600
Unfortunately, they were forced to break up by my father.

87
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,960
But soon, your mother married Xu Tao

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,790
and gave birth to you.

89
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,620
They once lost contact after she got married,

90
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,560
until the reunion ten years ago.

91
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,970
I did ask someone to follow my brother

92
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,230
and took photos of him having an affair with Song Yuzhi.

93
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,450
So I'm the only one who knows

94
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,460
what happened back then.

95
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,160
Song Yuzhi did it voluntarily.

96
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,400
She was totally an easy woman.

97
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,990
Mom was not innocent.

98
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Am I really Gu Hongze's daughter?

99
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,350
This is bad karma caused by Song Yuzhi.

100
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,210
But I pity you.

101
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,710
You fell in love with your half-brother.

102
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,559
But luckily,

103
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,110
it's figured out before the wedding.

104
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,500
Otherwise, if you and Mingyan do get married,

105
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,710
it'll be an incestuous tragedy.

106
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,670
Xu Nian.

107
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,910
Mingyan.

108
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,060
I need to talk to you.

109
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,150
You'll know when you come.

110
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,030
I'll wait for you at home.

111
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,010
Why are you here?

112
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,820
Dad, tell me,

113
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,600
am I your daughter or not?

114
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,560
What happened?

115
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Why do you ask suddenly?

116
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,760
This is very important to me.

117
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,150
I beg you.

118
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,310
Tell me everything you know.

119
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,320
Okay?

120
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,320
Okay.

121
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,250
I can tell you.

122
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,870
But later on,

123
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,080
you have to take care of many things yourself.
