[Episode 16]

4
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,230
He treated me

5
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,690
and asked me to leave.

6
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,290
What does it mean?

7
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,280
No.

8
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,200
Where is Dr. Zhao?

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,450
He went back first.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,720
He hasn't treated me yet.

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,490
Why did he leave?

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,930
I don't know.

13
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,240
Oh no.

14
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,380
I must have an incurable disease.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,910
I'm going to die.

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,460
I'm going to die.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,000
No, I promise.

18
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,990
I will find a solution for you.

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,620
I'm not married yet.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,270
I don't have children.

21
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,130
You can get married

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,200
and have children.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,479
Stop this!

24
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,860
I'm just kidding.

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,340
Don't be angry.

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,699
Don't move.

27
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,090
Can you accept this?

28
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,590
What do you mean?

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,190
Dr. Zhao spoke to me.

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,260
He asked me to have more physical contact with you.

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,870
It'll help immunize you.

32
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,210
Oh.

33
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,570
I see.

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,140
I thought you wanted...

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,310
You wanted...

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,410
What did you think?

37
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:14,760
Nothing.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,700
You haven't answered me.

39
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,230
Was that distance okay?

40
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,400
I guess so.

41
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
What do you mean?

42
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,510
Yes means yes, no means no.

43
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,730
It's getting late.

44
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm leaving.

45
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
You haven't answered me yet.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,690
Was that okay or not?

47
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,210
How is it?

48
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,200
We were talking about this all night, was that okay or not?

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,440
I'm talking to you! Stop eating.

50
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:58,940
Okay.

51
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,850
I accept your treatment.

52
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,370
Okay.

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
From now on,

54
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,660
I'll go to work with you.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,870
There are so many people in the office.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,110
It's not good for you to go with me.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,230
I'm your fiancée. What's wrong with that?

58
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,260
Eat up.

59
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,690
I'll go upstairs and prepare.

60
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,540
Hello, Mr. Gu.

61
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,180
Hello.

62
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,290
What?

63
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,840
Why are you hiding?

64
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:52,900
Yes?

65
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,560
Oh.

66
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,790
Since the company restructured its revenue structure,

67
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,370
the sustained development strategy has achieved significant results.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,920
Revenues in the third quarter increased significantly year-on-year,

69
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,610
with the proportion of revenues coming from the real economy increasing.

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,370
Go on.

71
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,250
Okay.

72
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,340
In line with your previous strategy,

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,000
we will continue to increase our investment in self-development

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,220
and continue to specialize in the financial and industrial sectors.

75
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,909
I need to go to the bathroom.

76
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,920
Dr. Zhao, are you really not coming today?

77
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
If I'm there, Mr. Gu will be more reserved.

78
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,690
Just get along with him normally.

79
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Have more physical contact with him.

80
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,700
It's best if it's something more intimate

81
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,950
than holding hands and touching each other.

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,700
Create a romantic environment.

83
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,700
Okay.

84
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,290
Why isn't Dr. Zhao here yet?

85
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,640
He said he's busy today. He can't come.

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,520
Shall we watch a movie?

87
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,330
What movie?

88
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,130
Something relaxing.

89
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,720
With a good atmosphere.

90
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,370
Is this

91
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,790
a funny movie with a good atmosphere?

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,260
Is it not?

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,370
This is the first

94
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,440
and the last time.

95
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,920
All right, it's gone.

96
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,210
It's over.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,590
I used to

98
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,909
have post-traumatic stress disorder

99
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,330
and that's why I couldn't speak.

100
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,630
Dr. Zhao said

101
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,590
you have the same problem.

102
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,010
At that time, something or someone

103
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,430
had too much influence on you

104
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,820
so you neglected your condition.

105
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,470
Just like me.

106
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:56,770
My mom...

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,270
Just watch the movie.

108
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,650
Why do you have to lecture me?

109
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
Can you show some respect

110
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,690
to this horror film?

111
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,550
All right.

112
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,160
This is all fake.

113
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,510
Thank you.

114
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,670
Did the

115
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,870
circuit trip?

116
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,390
Look at you. We wanted to watch a movie.

117
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,130
Why did you choose this kind of movie?

118
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,250
Look, it even tripped the meter.

119
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,740
Is this the time to blame others?

120
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:56,890
Alright.

121
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,460
I'll get someone to fix it.

122
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,460
Can't you fix the meter?

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
Why should I know how to fix a meter?

124
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,100
Then you don't know how to fix electrical appliances, do you?

125
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,980
Then your wife and children

126
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,330
have to use faulty electronics with you.

127
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,100
I can just change them and get new ones.

128
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,500
Why should I know how to fix them?

129
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,520
Right.

130
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,420
Okay.

131
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,040
Actually, it's not that hard.

132
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
It's easy to fix.

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,420
Really?

134
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,310
Yes.

135
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,950
Are you sure about this? Maybe we shouldn't go.

136
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,720
It's okay.

137
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,220
I can do it.

138
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,590
Gu Mingyan.

139
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,100
I saw something.

140
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,570
What is it?

141
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,200
I saw something.
