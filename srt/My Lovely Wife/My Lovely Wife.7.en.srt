[My Lovely Wife]

00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,220
[Episode 7]

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,750
Xu Nian? Why are you here?

5
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,190
What do you want?

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,620
Dad, I'm home.

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,680
It turns out the future mistress of Shanyu Group

8
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,590
has come home in a domineering manner.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,270
I don't deserve you

10
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,069
calling me Dad.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,970
Dad just said

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,520
he didn't want to see you.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,200
He also told me

14
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,980
I'm his only daughter now.

15
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,340
You're just a stepdaughter.

16
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,170
But I'm his biological daughter.

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,510
How dare you say that?

18
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,539
I'm still better than you.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,720
You're not welcome here. Leave now.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,750
I can't act on impulse like before.

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,070
If I want to stay here to investigate matters about Mom,

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,430
I need to get along with Dad first.

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,630
When I was young, I always went fishing with you.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,570
You always thought I was too noisy

25
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,420
and scared the fish away.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,210
But you would still take me with you every time you go fishing.

27
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,100
I didn't expect that this little fishing rod is still here.

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
We made it together.

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,130
Dad.

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,470
Actually, I miss you

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,329
at school.

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,990
But you haven't visited me for so long.

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,130
Dad.

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,730
Since you don't want to see me,

35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,410
I'm leaving.

36
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,270
Wait.

37
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,070
Have dinner before you go.

38
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:18,900
Mom.

39
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,550
Come here.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,190
When did she come?

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,410
Just a while ago.

42
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,520
Why is she here?

43
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,590
I don't know.

44
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,440
Look at how she's being attentive to my dad.

45
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,460
Here, have a piece of pizza.

46
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,140
Feifei specially brought this for you.

47
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,950
Dad, I want it too.

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,790
OK. Here.

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,950
Yao, have one.

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,490
Thank you, Dad.

51
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,140
Dad, I was young and didn't know any better before.

52
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,730
I didn't understand you well enough at that time.

53
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,490
It's all in the past. Don't mention it.

54
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,050
I know Mom betrayed you,

55
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,510
but she was my family.

56
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,260
I remember she kept writing her diary when she was sick.

57
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,810
I wanted to take that diary.

58
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,330
The old stuff is all in the warehouse.

59
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,590
You can go get it after dinner. Let's eat.

60
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,840
How many shareholders

61
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
of Xinliang Group

62
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,020
haven't signed the letter of intent for the purchase of shares with us?

63
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,610
Four.

64
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,180
The other three are easy to handle.

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,310
I'm afraid Xu Tao won't agree.

66
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,670
Xu Nian is my partner after all.

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,770
I should find someone reliable to talk to him.

68
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,360
Xu Nian has been back for so long.

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,270
Haven't you heard from her yet?

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,330
Has it been a long time? Hasn't Ms. Xu been back for only half a day?

71
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,280
If you're worried about Ms. Xu,

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,940
I can send someone to ask around at the Xu family.

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,730
What's there to ask about? No need.

74
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,680
But Mr. Shen has been rushing us recently.

75
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,790
The acquisition must be solved as soon as possible.

76
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,670
How about this?

77
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,380
I'll talk to Xu Tao myself.

78
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,900
With the current situation in the Xu family, as long as we delay it for a while,

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,610
even if Xu Tao doesn't want to sell his shares, he will have to sell them eventually.

80
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,360
I don't think you need to...

81
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,140
I'll get the car.

82
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,490
Dad, there's an emergency at school.

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,870
I need to go back.

84
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,910
I'll go to the warehouse to find my mom's diary after things are done.

85
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,960
Okay, go ahead.

86
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,390
Honey, I'm done. I'll get going too.

87
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,230
Was it you?

88
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,020
Didn't you go to school?

89
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,040
You killed my mom, didn't you?

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,550
I really admire your imagination.

91
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,310
You think I killed your mother

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,190
because I came to look for your mom's diary?

93
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,680
I just wanted to see

94
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,290
what happened between her and your dad.

95
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,760
Nothing else.

96
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,240
What about Lan, the caregiver?

97
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,280
Why did you have contact with the caregiver

98
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,190
who took care of my mother?

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,620
Xu Nian.

100
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,880
I contacted Lan

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,280
just to find out what happened

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,220
before I entered the Xu family.

103
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,750
I only knew your mother's illness

104
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,420
because of her.

105
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,220
To be honest, I pity you.

106
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,820
What your mother did back then

107
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,170
was enough to make you ashamed.

108
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,540
How could she abandon you when you were so young

109
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,610
and committed suicide?

110
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,409
I don't understand.

111
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,659
How could she be so cruel?

112
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
How could she just die

113
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,159
and don't care about you at all?

114
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,280
Now,

115
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,960
you've finally had a few good days.

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
I advise you to stop making trouble

117
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,280
or you'll expose matters

118
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,360
between your mom and Gu Mingyan's dad.

119
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,670
By that time, everyone will be embarrassed.

120
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,720
Also,

121
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,370
do you think you can bring me down with this recording pen?

122
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,730
This is the trick I played over ten years ago.

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,440
You're too weak.

124
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,620
Your dad is happy today.

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,550
I don't want to disappoint him.

126
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,470
As long as you behave,

127
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,120
we'll be at peace.

128
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,720
Otherwise, I'll never let you enter this house again.

129
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,799
Jiang Wanli.

130
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,490
The death of my mom

131
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,370
indeed has something to do with you.

132
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,880
I never thought of bringing you down here with a recording.

133
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,700
But

134
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,140
your good days are coming to an end.

135
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,550
Are you enjoying the moon?

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,640
Why are you here?

137
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm here for business

138
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,300
and pick you up.

139
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,070
Consider it as an employee benefit.

140
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,770
But I'm not going home tonight.

141
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Hey, pick me up tomorrow.

142
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm not going home tonight.

143
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,670
What's going on?

144
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Does he want to live in my house?

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,430
But if my dad sees Gu Mingyan...

146
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,570
Okay, I got it.

147
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,190
What are you waiting for? Let's go.
