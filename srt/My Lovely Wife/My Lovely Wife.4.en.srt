[My Lovely Wife]

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,270
[Episode 4]

4
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,670
If you buy the land use rights to the school,

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,760
you can sabotage Xinliang's self-rescue plan

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,930
and help me save the school from a crisis.

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,650
You can kill two birds with one stone.

8
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,320
You have no reason not to agree.

9
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,740
I just don't want to agree.

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,300
No matter what,

11
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,220
I have to get this contract.

12
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,430
I'll be shameless today.

13
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,010
What are you doing?

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,020
Stop.

15
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,300
I agree.

16
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,270
Just talk.

17
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,710
Why did you have to get physical?

18
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,530
As long as you cooperate with me,

19
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,840
when the contract expires,

20
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,340
I'll return the school's management rights to you.

21
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,770
I've tweaked the contract a little bit.

22
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,700
Take a look.

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,630
Sign if there's no problem.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,900
Based on your company's PR intern salary.

25
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,260
Didn't you say it would be based on PR specialists' pay yesterday?

26
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,440
The hours are not right either.

27
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,780
How did it become six days a week

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,000
with variable days off

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,510
and 24 hours a day?

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,660
You don't want to sign it?

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,220
It doesn't matter.

32
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,570
I can use AI and change people's faces. I'll still get my name cleared.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,210
I'm the original.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,579
Why trouble yourself?

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,140
Why go for a high-quality imitation?

36
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,800
I've never been one to impose.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,010
Alright, from now on, you are my fiancée.

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,050
I hope we can work well together.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,040
But there are some things

40
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,990
I have to tell you in advance.

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,880
First of all, I don't like people being too close to me.

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,750
But in this special situation,

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,920
when there are outsiders around,

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,630
I'd like you to stay

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,010
within a radius of 20cm from me.

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,720
What about when there are no outsiders?

47
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,350
Can I get off work?

48
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
When there are no outsiders,

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,130
the further you get away from me, the better.

50
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,160
Secondly, I hate it

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,150
when people suddenly act in ways I don't understand.

52
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,329
This includes, but is not limited to

53
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,370
making sounds I don't understand.

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,079
Acting in ways I don't understand.

55
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,900
Showing expressions that I don't understand.

56
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,280
Is there a standard?

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,940
I'm the standard.

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,550
If I don't understand it, it's a violation.

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,540
What's wrong with him?

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,360
So, in order to avoid this situation,

61
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
you'd better tell me

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,380
before you do anything in the future.

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,660
It's a point-based appraisal system.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,650
You get points if you do it right.

65
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,640
If you make a mistake, you'll lose points.

66
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
When you've accumulated 100 points,

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,010
I'll return the school's management rights to you.

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,649
Oh, right, it's written in the contract that

69
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,600
the fiancée you're playing is living with me.

70
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,850
So you have to stay here for the duration of the contract.

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,840
Every night at 8pm,

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,480
I'll send you the next day's work schedule.

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,440
Remember to prepare the objectives and key results in advance.

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,650
You're not allowed in my room.

75
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,860
[Grandpa]

76
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,350
Grandpa.

77
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,100
What are you doing? I told you you're not allowed here.

78
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm going back to school to get my luggage.

79
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,940
No.

80
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,930
Why?

81
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,990
No reason.

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,960
How can I get changed without my luggage?

83
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,930
I'll ask Shao Yiting to prepare some clothes for you.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,360
Principal, I've settled the matter with the school.

85
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,680
Tomorrow's work schedule. Come with me to the Gu Family mansion

86
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,430
to meet my grandpa.

87
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,820
Shao Yiting will send you the notes.

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,850
Chairman has been waiting for a long time. Please.

89
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,290
Have a seat.

90
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,070
Grandpa.

91
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,300
This is my fiancée, Xu Nian.

92
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,940
Mingyan.

93
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,100
Come out with me.

94
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,030
I'll be right back.

95
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,270
Stay here. I'll be right back.

96
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,670
These are my relatives.

97
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,030
Good luck.

98
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,600
If you do well, I'll give you points.

99
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,050
If you run away,

100
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,020
I'll sell the school to someone else tomorrow.

101
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,980
It's not like you don't know whose daughter Xu Nian is.

102
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,760
Just look for a shield.

103
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,320
Why did you choose her!

104
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,840
The press photos are too clear.

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,210
Besides,

106
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,039
it's a critical time for the group to acquire Xinliang Group.

107
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,130
I don't want to make any mistake

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,980
at this critical moment.

109
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,800
I guess I didn't train you for nothing.

110
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,370
Now you know to put interest first

111
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,900
and not let emotions get in the way.

112
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,920
Okay.

113
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,910
But after the storm is over,

114
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,740
this woman must leave the Gu Family.

115
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,680
Don't worry.

116
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,020
Once she is no longer of any use,

117
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,070
I won't keep her by my side.

118
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,220
Okay.

119
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,630
Shen Zhi is coming back soon.

120
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,400
I'll talk to Mr. Shen

121
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,380
about marriage after the storm passes.

122
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,220
She's not very pretty.

123
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,920
What's so charming about the Xu women?

124
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,600
In the past, Song Yuzhi charmed my brother.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,040
Now, her daughter has charmed you.

126
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,390
Yes.

127
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,510
You're with your father's lover's daughter.

128
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,440
Does that count as incest?

129
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,790
My dad is my dad.

130
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,230
I am me.

131
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,270
You're right.

132
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,690
After all, you're just an illegitimate child.

133
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,370
You haven't even met your father.

134
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,350
Of course there's no father-son bond,

135
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,800
right?

136
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,530
But this illegitimate son

137
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,580
became the president of the group.
