[Episode 8]

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,570
I should have visited you earlier,

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,200
but I was too busy.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,200
So I didn't come.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,010
Sorry.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,880
Since you're come, stay here for on night.

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,240
I'll ask Ms. Chen to clean up a room for you.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Okay. Thank you.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,410
It's getting late.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,520
You should rest early.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,440
What does he want?

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,930
Why is your room

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,010
so empty of furniture?

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,560
I live in the school.

17
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,450
This isn't my room.

18
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,850
Seriously, why did you come here?

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm here to see if you are still alive.

20
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,979
Are you worried about me?

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,340
Why would I be worried?

22
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,900
I'm afraid if you die,

23
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,820
you won't be able to fulfill your obligations in the contract.

24
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,740
Fine, now you know

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,410
that I'm still alive.

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,430
I'm going to sleep.

27
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,770
Go to another guest room.

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,300
No.

29
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,610
I'll sleep here tonight.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,180
How can he

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,480
just lie down on the bed?

32
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,240
Stop!

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,520
Did I let you go?

34
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,360
Why can't I leave?

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,630
The contract says you'll do whatever I ask you to do.

36
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,290
Did I ask you to leave?

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,630
The contract doesn't say I have to sleep with you.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,579
But it says

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,090
you can't go against my will.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,620
Besides, I didn't ask you to sleep on the same bed with me.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,380
You sleep on the floor and I sleep on the bed.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,960
You have a problem with that?

43
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,510
Go get your bedding.

44
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,980
You win.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,190
Xu Nian, tell me a joke.

46
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,820
What's wrong with him?

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,030
He is not only sleeping in my bed

48
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,040
but asked me to tell him a joke. I'm a mute!

49
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,680
Xu Nian.

50
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,540
Xu Nian.

51
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:14,890
Xu Nian.

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
Why did you suddenly get up?

53
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,140
Didn't you ask me to tell you a joke?

54
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,590
I have to think for a while.

55
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,630
Go ahead.

56
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,020
Dad, do you think there are ghosts in this world?

57
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,790
Of course not.

58
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,000
But I'm a little afraid.

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,770
Don't think too much.

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,860
It's getting late.

61
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,590
Give me back my head.

62
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,640
Go back to your coffin and sleep.

63
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,410
I have a funnier one.

64
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,710
No need. You're too slow in telling stories.

65
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,230
Who said he's not my birth father?

66
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,790
Even so, I'm still better than you.

67
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,000
You're not welcomed here. Leave.

68
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,220
Do you really think your trick will work?

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,120
This is the trick I played over ten years ago.

70
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,870
You are too naive.

71
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,200
Jiang Wanli has always claimed that she's from a scholar family.

72
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,790
Xu Yao is the daughter of her ex-husband.

73
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,760
But in my opinion,

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,370
my dad has two families.

75
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,540
Maybe Xu Yao is his illegitimate daughter.

76
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,870
My mom was such a poor woman.

77
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,030
She didn't know this secret before died.

78
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
Why are you sleeping next to me?

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,580
You scared me with your ghost story.

80
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,470
You call that a ghost story?

81
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,880
Are you really scared?

82
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,610
I was afraid of ghosts in my childhood.

83
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,810
But since my mom died,

84
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,180
I have held a belief that if there were ghosts in the world,

85
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,610
my mom would always stay by my side and protect me.

86
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,270
Then I am not afraid of them anymore.

87
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,670
Let me teach you a method.

88
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,180
Next time when you're scared,

89
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,910
sing this song loudly.

90
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
♫Don't be afraid♫

91
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,050
♫I'm afraid of nothing♫

92
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,290
♫I'm not afraid of anything♫

93
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,140
♫I can do whatever I want♫

94

♫I'm not afraid of the dark or the ghosts♫

97

♫I'm the greatest♫

98
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880

♫I'm the greatest♫

102
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
Do you think it is appropriate for me to sing this song?

103
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,740
You sleep in bed.

104
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,880
Mr. Xu, no matter how long you delay,

105
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,390
Shanyu Group will still take over Xinliang Group.

106
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,710
By then,

107
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,160
I won't be able to offer the price I can offer you now.

108
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,190
No wonder you suddenly came back

109
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
and were being nice to me.

110
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,790
You are here to help him persuade me.

111
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,240
What does he mean?

112
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,050
What's going on?

113
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,940
I'm talking to Mr. Xu about the shares transfer of Xinliang Group.

114
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,770
Why now?

115
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,160
As long as Dad favors Jiang Wanli and her daughter,

116
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,080
Jiang Wanli will be confident that she can manipulate Dad.

117
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,840
No.

118
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,110
My relationship with Dad can't be as bad as before.

119
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,380
But the acquisition

120
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,410
might be an opportunity.
