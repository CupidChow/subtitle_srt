[Episode 11]

4
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,440
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,730
I'm going to the share transfer ceremony with you.

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,880
I thought you wouldn't go.

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,940
After all, it's the acquisition of your family's Xinliang Group.

8
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,430
My dad said

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
we have to hold a grand ceremony,

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,630
so I must attend it.

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,170
Okay.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,590
Let's go.

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,250
Why are you bringing your clothes?

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,450
This is my dress.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,300
I want to change into it at the venue.

16
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,010
Okay.

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,039
I really didn't expect that

18
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,440
Xu Nian will be the wife of the CEO of Shanyu Group.

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,120
That's because Mrs. Xu is from a noble family,

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,690
so she can have such a good daughter.

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,010
I do care more about my stepdaughter than Xu Yao.

22
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,229
But she's not my biological daughter

23
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,539
and now her status is on another level.

24
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,980
I'll have to consider about her before making any decisions in the future.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,650
You are too kind.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
If you don't act like a mother,

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,480
she'll disrespect you even more in the future.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,010
Nian, Mingyan, you're here.

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,030
Hello, Mr. Gu.

30
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,020
Dad, I'm going to say hello to Aunt Jiang.

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,000
Xu Nian, don't blame us for talking too much.

32
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,040
Your mother died early.

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,040
If your stepmother hadn't brought you up,

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
you wouldn't be here today.

35
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,650
Yes, we shouldn't be ungrateful.

36
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,090
I didn't act well before.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,640
I would like to apologize to you.

38
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,140
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,079
Did you do it on purpose?

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,660
The ceremony is about to begin.

41
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,300
This is the dress Mingyan prepared for me.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,770
Please change into this.

44
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,090
Forget it.

45
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,300
How can a mother argue with her daughter?

46
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,280
I'll go get changed.

47
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,070
Does this dress look familiar?

48
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,650
What do you mean?

49
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,580
I bought it at a very special place.

50
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,670
What a coincidence.

51
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,390
The owner's name is also Jiang Wanli.

52
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,020
What do you want?

53
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,280
You're not from a noble family.

54
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,960
You're just a hostess who forged your identity.

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,000
Xu Yao is not your ex-husband's daughter.

56
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,500
She is my dad's illegitimate daughter.

57
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,640
Before my mom passed away,

58
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,390
you already hooked up with my father.

59
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,290
So what?

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,790
Your dad knows

61
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,470
what kind of person I am.

62
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,810
You think you could threaten me

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,900
just because you found out about this?

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,330
You're too naive.

65
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,159
Father wouldn't have abandoned Mom for you.

66
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,640
Go and confront my dad about this.

[Share Transfer Ceremony of Xinliang Group]

68
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,190
Everyone, I invited you here today

69
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,990
to announce a very important matter

70
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,270
to all of you.

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,160
Before announcing this important matter,

72
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,420
I have something to say.

73
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,600
Before I know it,

74
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
I've worked in Xinliang

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,200
for about 30 years.

76
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,050
In the past 30 years,

77
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,870
I have been diligent

78
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,820
and dedicated.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,950
I started as a junior employee

80
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,250
and along with everyone here,

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
we have witnessed the growth

82
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,090
and glory of Xinliang Group together.

83
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,570
But

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,960
people will get old, right?

85
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
We'll all age.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I suddenly realized that my brain and body

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
can't keep up anymore.

88
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,330
So I have to retire.

89
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,950
Of course, I'm reluctant to leave.

90
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,659
But for the future of everyone here,

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,040
and for the greater success and achievements

92
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,020
of Xinliang Group.

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,870
I've decided to officially retire.

94
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,850
Thank you for your understanding.

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Thank you

96
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,480
for your hard work and daily life...

97
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,920
You're as stupid as your mother.

98
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,370
To be honest,

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,500
your father likes gentle women like me.

100
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,810
He insisted on having an affair with me, helped me to forge a clean identity

101
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,840
and begged me to be his wife.

102
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,320
You can only blame your mother

103
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,460
for not keeping her man.

104
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,450
Even if your mother is alive,

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,020
you two can’t beat me.

106
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,200
Remote control! Remote control!

107
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,140
Find it! Find it!

108
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
Mr. Xu, there's no remote control.

109
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,430
Pull out the plug.

110
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,409
Honey, what brings you here?

111
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,460
Has the ceremony started?

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
Just now, Nian and I...

113
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,400
What were you talking about?

114
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,150
It was all broadcasted.

115
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,820
You set me up!

116
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,970
Let's see who dares to touch her.

117
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,070
Honey.

118
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
Honey, what I said just now

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,160
was not true.

120
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,400
Your daughter framed me, honey.

121
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,880
Nian, is that true?

122
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,330
Yes, I did all of this.

123
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,210
But I just set up the stage,

124
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,810
she was the one who acted on it.

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,350
Honey,

126
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
I did do something wrong

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,330
and said something wrong.

128
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,930
But I've always been sincere to you.

129
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
She's your daughter.

130
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,000
She is the one

131
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,159
who wants to destroy the Xu family.

132
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,610
Xu Nian.

133
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,300
If you have anything to say,

134
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,700
you can tell me in private.

135
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,940
Don't do this to me.

136
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,370
You're embarrassing the Xu family.

137
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,440
You're embarrassing me.

138
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,820
Why are you doing this to me?

139
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:56,070
I knew it. He cares about his pride the most.

140
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,409
He doesn't even feel sorry for my mom.

141
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,670
I have to hold back.

142
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,570
I can't argue with him now.

143
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,670
Mr. Xu, I did some research in secret.

144
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,610
Jiang Wanli embezzled the assets of the Group

145
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,810
and transferred the funds to foreign accounts.

146
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,420
I'm afraid you were unaware about this, right?

147
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,840
It's thanks to Jiang Wanli that the Xinliang Group

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,470
ended up like this today.

149
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,730
Is that true?

150
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,490
Is that true? Answer me!

151
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,300
Honey, listen to me.

152
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,140
Why?

153
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,200
Why?

154
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,860
Give me a reason.

155
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,470
Haven't I been good to you and your daughter?

156
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,480
Why are you doing this to me?

157
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,280
Honey, all these years,

158
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,190
you've never admitted

159
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,910
Yao is your biological daughter.

160
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,240
I just wanted to give her extra assurance.

161
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,660
Whether I acknowledge her as my biological daughter or not,

162
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,410
she is still my own flesh and blood.

163
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,710
Was I not good to you?

164
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,240
Why are you doing this to me?

165
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,390
Dad, Mom.

166
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,870
The guests outside are saying that mom was a hostess.

167
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,070
Okay.

168
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,010
I have to take care of many guests outside.

169
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,690
Deal with it yourselves.

170
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,370
Dad!

171
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,500
Honey!

172
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,390
Shut up!

173
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,470
Mom.

174
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,740
What happened?

175
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,390
Don't go.

176
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,220
Go out and give them an explanation for me.

177
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,850
Xu Nian!

178
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,970
Yao.
