[Episode 21]

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,050
But seeing you in so much pain,

5
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,540
I decided

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,020
to give it to you.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,430
I didn't expect that

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,640
I would meet Gu Hongze again after so many years.

9
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,990
But last time, he begged me to meet him.

10
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,450
This time, I asked him to meet me.

11
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,800
Now I have no attachment

12
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,039
to my past relationships.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,930
I just want to raise Nian well.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,680
I want Nian to grow up healthily and light-heartedly.

15
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:24,000
I must protect my home.

16
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,810
When I saw Hongze at the hotel,

17
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,270
he sprang at me like he was out of his mind.

18
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,150
He looked very clear-headed.

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,800
I was really pissed off.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,789
I am already married.

21
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,420
I couldn't betray my family.

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,950
I didn't let him succeed this time.

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,520
I slapped him and left.

24
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,530
Hongze apologized to me.

25
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,050
He said he was drugged by his brother that day.

26
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,729
Luckily, he didn't hurt me.

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,300
He promised me that he wouldn't make things difficult for the Xinliang Group anymore.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
I forgave him.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,450
But I hope

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,530
I won't have any dealings with him anymore.

31
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,840
Why? Why would we be photographed like that?

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,360
We didn't do anything.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,290
Why did they report like that?

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,020
Why did they slander me?

35
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,300
Xu Tao refused to listen to my explanation.

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,160
What should I do?

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,600
Nian is still young.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,700
I have to hang in there.

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,020
Mum.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,770
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,590
I shouldn't have any doubts about you.

42
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,140
I was blinded by love

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,500
and lost my direction.

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,880
Now I know what to do.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,650
The conference today

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,420
is to announce your marriage with Shen Zhi.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,290
After some time,

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,900
when the storm is over,

49
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,270
we'll get Xu Nian back.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,020
I've talked to Hongyu about it.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,250
Don't worry.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,900
He will listen to me.

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,400
The conference is being held today

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,579
to announce two matters.

55
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,760
Wait a minute.

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,410
[Engagement Conference]

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,410
[Gu Mingyan, Shen Zhi]

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
How could I be absent

59
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,080
at such an important moment?

60
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,670
I have two things to declare.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,260
First, my wedding date with Gu Mingyan is still the same.

62
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,780
All the stupid stories in the papers

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,870
about him and Miss Shen

64
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,279
were made up by

65
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,230
someone with an axe to grind.

66
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,140
My relationship with Gu Mingyan

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
will not be affected by any unfounded rumours.

68
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,640
Second,

69
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,840
I'm pregnant.

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,530
We may get married early.

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,810
Wait.

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,380
Dad.

73
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,659
I've promised you not to mention it.

74
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,580
But now Xu Nian is pregnant.

75
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,409
The consequences are rather severe.

76
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,020
We have to say it now.

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,610
Xu Nian is my brother, Gu Hongze's daughter.

78
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,550
She and Mingyan

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,650
are siblings.

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,120
Gosh, what's going on?

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
What a mess in the high society.

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,090
I remember now.

83
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,150
Gu Hongze was exposed for having an affair with Mrs. Xu.

84
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,280
But I didn't expect them to have a child.

85
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,360
No way.

86
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,810
Dear reporters,

87
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,030
Xu Nian

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,230
is indeed Hongze's daughter

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,980
and my granddaughter.

90
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,200
But it's definitely not as ridiculous

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,480
as everyone says.

92
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,560
Because Mingyan

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,409
is not Hongze's biological son.

94
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,430
Back then,

95
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,590
in order to heal the pain of losing my son,

96
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,830
I adopted Mingyan

97
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,910
as my grandson.

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,600
Of course, all procedures have been completed.

99
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,480
All these years, I treated him

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,640
like my own child.

101
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,610
He's one of our family.

102
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,910
So I didn't make it public.

103
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,290
As for Xu Nian

104
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,980
being Hongze's daughter and my granddaughter,

105
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,470
I didn't know it until a while ago.

106
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,120
Thank God for pitying me

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,440
who lost my son.

108
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,200
Now you two

109
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,630
love each other deeply.

110
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't worry.

111
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,600
I won't be that old-fashioned to break you up.

112
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,390
I won't apply any restrictions on you too.

113
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,940
Now I urge everyone

114
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,290
to give them some space.

115
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,440
Let's give them our blessings.

116
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,550
I see.

117
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,540
They're still family after all the fuss.

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,780
I thought there would be something explosive.

119
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,970
Since Gu Mingyan was adopted,

120
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
who will inherit the Shanyu Group, he or Xu Nian?

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,360
They're a couple. It doesn't matter who inherits it.

122
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,980
Why did you do that?

123
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,010
Dad, listen to me.

124
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,530
I don't want things

125
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,530
to go beyond our control.

126
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,400
Let me take you back to get some rest first.

127
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,830
Dad, be careful.

128
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:50,920
How is it?

129
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,480
Mingyan.

130
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,650
This is just the beginning.

131
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,410
Grandpa, I was too impulsive today.

132
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,040
Don't be mad at me.

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,350
Actually,

134
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,090
I was just worried that you wouldn't recognize me.

135
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,550
Silly girl, you're Hongze's daughter after all.

136
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,620
It's only a matter of time before you return to your family.

137
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
However,

138
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
I planned

139
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:39,720
to pass the Shanyu Group down to Mingyan.

140
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,039
But his current identity...

141
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,160
What a pity.

142
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,340
Grandpa,

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,560
you may lose a grandson nominally,

144
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,670
but you still have a granddaughter and a grandson-in-law.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
Once Mingyan and I are married,

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
we'll still have a filial affection for you.

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,970
Plus, now Mingyan and I are a family.

148
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,150
If I were the CEO of the Shanyu Group,

149
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,560
Mingyan would surely do his best to assist me.

150
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,520
You want to be the CEO?

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,060
I know I have so much more to learn.

152
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,890
But Grandpa is here with me.

153
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,780
You can take your time teaching me

154
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,880
and make up for

155
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,760
the time we lost as grandpa and granddaughter.

156
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,390
Mingyan,

157
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
as your uncle,

158
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,610
I've treated you as my own nephew for so many years.

159
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,570
But we should make a clear distinction between public and private interests.

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,920
The Shanyu Group

161
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
is my dad's lifelong hard work after all.

162
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,470
Even though you and Nian are getting married in a few days,

163
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,050
for us,

164
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,650
you're just an outsider.

165
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,900
Did you gather everyone here today

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,000
to replace the CEO?

167
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,000
Mingyan, you've misunderstood me.

168
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,870
They reached out to me,

169
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,620
and I couldn't refuse,

170
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,710
so I came out to take charge.

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,630
Dad, I know

172
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,140
you don't want to leave all your efforts

173
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
to an outsider.

174
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,990
Directors,

175
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm sure you all know about what happened to our family.

176
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,350
Now, please have a show of hands.

177
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,690
It will form a decision if more than half agree.

178
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,020
If you agree with replacing the CEO,

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,610
please raise your hand.

180
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,210
Resolution adopted.

181
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,840
Next, the candidate for the future CEO...

182
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,460
Wait.

183
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,840
Before we vote,

184
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,470
I'd like to share my opinion.

185
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,920
I agree with Xu Nian to be the CEO of the group.

186
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,200
Dad.

187
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,280
You just recognized Xu Nian as your granddaughter.

188
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,990
She's never involved in any business in the group.

189
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,770
If you want to train her,

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
you can start from...

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,720
Let's vote now.

192
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,490
Raise your hand if you agree.

193
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,520
The votes are exactly over half.

194
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,210
Wait.

195
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,400
Dad.

196
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,210
I was still caring about our father-son relationship before this.

197
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,700
But at this point,

198
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,160
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

199
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,080
Xu Nian is not your granddaughter.

200
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,290
The test report

201
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,560
is also a fake.

202
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,250
I already switched it long ago.

203
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,560
How dare you swap the report?

204
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,540
I knew

205
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,010
you wouldn't allow me to become the CEO easily.

206
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,410
That's why I made a backup plan.

207
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,190
You didn't expect that, did you?

208
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,790
I'm the only one from the Gu family.

209
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,880
In the past, you favoured Gu Hongze

210
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,400
and ignored me.

211
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,620
After Gu Hongze died,

212
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,830
you were even willing to support an outsider who is not related.

213
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm your son.

214
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,010
Why are you doing this to me?

215
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,330
You did hide it well.

216
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,260
But I know you're up to no good.

217
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,310
Once I hand over the Shanyu Group to you,

218
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,430
you'll show your true colours.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,110
It would be a disaster

220
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,100
for me and the group.
