[Episode 14]

4
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,420
You're awake.

5
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,080
You were drunk last night

6
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,070
and you held my hand and refused to let it go.

7
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,470
You were talking all night.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,830
I could speak?

9
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,600
I can speak now!

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,800
Yes, you can.

11
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,920
You were talking all night.

12
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,789
I can speak now!

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,970
Yes, you can.

14
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,610
I can speak now!

15
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,340
I can speak now!

16
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,080
Gu Mingyan, I can speak now!

17
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,150
I can speak now!

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,140
I can speak now!

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you hear it?

20
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,940
I said a lot.

21
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,570
I heard it.

22
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,180
I can speak now!

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
Stop jumping. Stop it.

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
Gu Mingyan, let's talk.

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,750
Stop jumping.

26
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,940
Alright. Since you want to talk so badly,

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,370
let's go and practice speaking.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,090
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

29
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,660
Thank you. Thank you.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,250
Grandpa, I wish you long longevity and good health.

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,610
How can she speak now?

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,320
You can speak?

33
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,500
Then go chat with our relatives and friends.

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,750
Mingyan, come with me.

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,530
I have something to tell you.

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,000
Come.

37
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,730
The acquisition of Xinliang Group has been completed.

38
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,380
It's time for you and Xu Nian

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,840
to break up.

40
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,500
Miss Shen will be back soon.

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,690
When she arrives, you should meet her.

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,690
Grandpa.

43
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,980
I don't think it's the right time to break up with Xu Nian.

44
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,480
You're dating Xu Nian because you don't want to marry Miss Shen.

45
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,140
But don't forget what you promised me.

46
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,100
Mingyan.

47
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,150
I told you so many times

48
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,930
that useless things

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,110
should be abandoned.

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,230
Old Gu, it's time to cut the cake.

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,670
Okay.

52
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,880
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

53
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,589
Thank you.

54
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,120
Let's have a good time.

55
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,300
Thank you.

56
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,210
Wow, such a big cake.

57
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,370
Okay.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,590
Okay.

59
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,470
Here is the cake.

60
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,840
Guys.

61
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,130
It's my birthday today.

62
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,430
Let's share the cake.

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,159
Okay.

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,980
Here.

65
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,580
Here.

66
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,720
Here.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
I want a piece. I want a piece.

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,760
Who wants a piece?

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,710
Me. Me.

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,860
I want this peach.

71
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,580
Xu Nian, have a piece.

72
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,240
Yes, Xu Nian, have one.

73
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,280
Grandpa, I'm allergic to cream.

74
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,540
I'll get rash if I eat the cream cake.

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,200
Oh.

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
You're allergic to cream.

77
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,040
Then you

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,620
shouldn't eat the cake.

79
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,660
Okay.

80
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,090
Thank you, Old Gu.

81
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,350
Come on.

82
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,450
Eat more of the cake.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
You all can't wait, right?

84
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,260
We can't wait.

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,980
I'm surprised that Miss Xu is allergic to cream.

86
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,050
Hongze is also allergic to cream.

87
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,530
Test Xu Nian's DNA.

88
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,159
Okay.

89
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,470
Wait.

90
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,750
Don't tell anyone about this.

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,640
Okay.

92
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,210
I've almost fulfilled all my obligations in the contract.

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,540
It's time for me to leave.

94
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,690
Okay.

95
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,450
I'll let you sign the break-up agreement tomorrow.

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,050
Great.

97
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,430
My days of living with you will be over soon.

98
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,650
You're very happy about it?

99
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,300
His grandpa asked him to break up with me.

100
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,010
I have no reason to stay.

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,500
The problem caused by Jiang Wanli has just been solved.

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,650
Now she wants to leave me? What kind of person would do that?

103
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,070
After all, he and I have been together for so long.

104
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,860
Why didn't he ask me to stay?

105
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,830
It makes sense.

106
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,160
He doesn't like me.

107
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,290
Why should he ask me to stay?

108
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,470
[Break-up Agreement]

109
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,010
Wait.

110
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,680
Read these documents.

111
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,950
When I investigated Jiang Wanli, I found there was

112
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,140
something suspicious about your mom being secretly photographed.

113
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,210
Gu Hongyu?

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,169
Were these photos taken by Gu Hongyu?

115
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,220
Those photos of us were also taken by him.

116
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,690
Gu Hongyu did all this.

117
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,330
Only when I get Gu Hongyu to admit it himself

118
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,620
can I clear my mother's name.

119
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,170
But if I leave the Gu family now,

120
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,830
it'll be hard for me to do it.

121
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,610
Mr. Gu.

122
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,460
I think it's irresponsible of me to break up with you now.

123
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,590
Your grandpa is forcing you to marry Miss Shen.

124
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,280
I should help you solve this problem

125
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,210
before we break up.

126
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,330
It’s not a bad thing for me

127
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,690
to marry Miss Shen.

128
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,390
Rich families have this kind of tradition.

129
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,740
Marriage is sacred.

130
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,200
It shouldn't be a means to exchange interests.

131
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,280
Besides,

132
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,000
you haven’t even met Miss Shen.

133
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,450
How about we still pretend to be a couple for now?

134
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,090
As soon as you meet someone you truly love,

135
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,110
I'll break up with you.
