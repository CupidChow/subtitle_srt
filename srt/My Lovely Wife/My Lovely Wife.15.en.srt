Mr. Gu,

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,850
I think it's too irresponsible to break up now.

6
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,850
Grandpa Gu forced you to marry Miss Shen.

7
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,490
I should help you solve this problem

8
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,450
before we break up.

9
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,590
Actually, it's not that bad

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,870
to marry Miss Shen.

11
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,510
Isn't rich folks marrying each other like this?

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,890
Marriage is sacred.

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,390
How can you use it as an exchange of interests?

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,600
Besides,

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,250
you haven't even met Miss Shen.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,720
Why don't you wait for a while?

17
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,320
I can give way

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,330
when you have someone you like.

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,380
Fine.

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,100

What a surprise.

28
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,560
Xu Nian is really Hongze's daughter.

29
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,330
Cool.

30
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,530
I'll go see my granddaughter now.

Let's go.

32
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,730
Why haven't you broken up?

33
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,640
Grandpa,

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,160
you used to be in charge of the group.

35
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,650
But this time, I want to make my own decision.

36
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,530
Xu Nian and I were indeed partners at first.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,860
But now we really want to be together.

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,329
I know that a marriage with the Shen family

39
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,940
could lead to a better future for the group.

40
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,980
But even if I don't marry the Shen family's daughter,

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,470
I can make the group better.

42
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,760
Are you willing to give up everything

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,450
to be with her?

44
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,010
Yes.

I, as an old man,

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,690
won't argue with you anymore.

49
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,750
Grandpa, do you mean

50
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,740
we can be together?

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,900
What? Who do you think I am?

52
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,970
Would I be that old-fashioned to break up a loving couple?

53
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,360
I am not a fan of sour grapes.

54
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,690
Mingyan,

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,020
you're the successor I value very much.

56
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,880
I've paved the way for you to the Shen family.

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,480
If you don't want it,

58
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,660
you're on your own now.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,660
Grandpa, I won't disappoint you.

60
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,000
All right.

61
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,060
Mr. Shen wants to play Go with me later.

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,430
He sucks at it but still loves to play.

63
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,920
By then,

64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,960
I'll solve your problem in passing.

65
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,680
OK. I'm leaving.

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,290
Goodbye, Grandpa Gu.

67
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,300
Remove the word Gu.

68

69
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,180
you can call me Grandpa,

70
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,150
just like Mingyan does.

71

But now we really want to be together.

73
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,440
Even though I knew he was lying to Grandpa,

74
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,130
he sounded so sincere.

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,890
Does he have feelings for me too?

76
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,510
Xu Nian, what are you thinking about?

77

Yesterday,

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,890
I told Mr. Shen about you.

84
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,409
Then he said in

85
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,480
a sarcastic way

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,659
that he wanted to see

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,930
what kind of girl you had found.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,960
I thought you'd marry her anyway.

89
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,370
So I told him

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,690
you two are getting married.

91
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,540
I'll send him an invitation

92
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,540
when the time comes.

93
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,780
Let's do it next month then.

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,270
Grandpa, I do want to marry her.

96
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,320
But look at my illness.

97
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,700
I haven't recovered yet.

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,340
For Nian and me, getting married so soon is not that...

99
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,300
Your illness

100
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,270
should have been cured long ago.

101
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,120
At that time, I thought with your current state,

102
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,690
you must be more vigilant about people around you.

103
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,230
Besides, your illness

104
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,340
is not something terminal.

105
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,470
It's just a psychological disease.

106
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,520
It'll be fine as long as it's cured.

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,360
I'll ask Dr. Zhao

108
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,030
to make a complete treatment plan for you.

109
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,730
You have to cooperate then.

110
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,530
Do I have to see a doctor for that?

114
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,600
Stick to it. Hold my hand.

Yes.

116
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,090
I can't hold it.

117
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,760
You can do it. Push harder.

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,800

causes him to have trust issues

148
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,220
and be wary of the people

149
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,140

150
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,520
The person closest to him

151
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,810
is the best candidate to help him

152
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,970
overcome the mental illness.

153
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,090
Me?

154
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,550
Yes.

155
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,110
I can't make it.

156
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,660
If you can't,

157
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,600
no one else can help Mr. Gu.

158
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,930
This disease can be potentially severe or detrimental.

159
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,790
Now Mr. Gu's condition is under control.

160
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,120
Once his condition deteriorates,

161
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,920
he'll have no physical contact with anyone ever again.

this time,

169
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,040
I should help him.

170
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,110
What should I do?
