You're right.

5
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,580
After all, you're just an illegitimate child.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,580
You haven't even met your father.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,330
Of course you won't have a strong bond with him.

8

00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,320
But it was me

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,570
who became the president of the Group.

11
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,270
Xinliang Group is really something.

12

They are about to be acquired

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,990
so they sent their daughter to another man's bed.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,300
What a clever tactic.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,280
She's even a deaf-mute.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,310
I don't know how Mingyan fell for her.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,789
Don't look down on deaf-mutes.

Maybe she is good at other things.

Actually, he pursued me.

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,890
I had no interest in him at first.

21
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:32,030
But I was too capable.

22

Oh, right.

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,070
Mingyan also said I was his first love.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,820
He would ask me to have fun with him every night.

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,280

Mingyan, why are you eating fish?

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,890
Aren't you allergic to fish?

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,520

It was not entirely his decision.

It's just business.

49
