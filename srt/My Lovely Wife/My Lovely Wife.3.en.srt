[Episode 3]

4
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,300
Stop there!

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,090
Stop there!

6
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,440
Stop there!

7
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,430
Stop there…

8
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,590
Xu Nian, do you remember me?

9
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,860
You bit me yesterday.

10
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,440
Wait for me.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Just you wait.

12
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,950
Hello, I'm Gu Mingyan,

13
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,320
the CEO of Shanyu Group.

14
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,230
I want to make a deal with you.

15
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,530
I know you can't talk.

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,329
Let's discuss it somewhere else.

17
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,810
Let's go.

18
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,380
What's wrong?

19
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,840
Xu Nian ran away.

20
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,220
You two losers!

21
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,390
How could you let her escape?

22
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,340
What else can you do if you can't even guard a mute?

23
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,190
Gu Mingyan saved her.

24
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,470
Gu Mingyan?

25
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,140
OK, I see.

26
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,120
You two can leave now.

27
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,510
Looks like Xu Nian has something to do with Gu Mingyan.

28
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,430
What's their relationship?

29
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,050
Bitch!

[Engagement Employment Agreement]

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,440
What do you mean?

32
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,290
Media reports stated that

33
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,980
I'm a playboy living a promiscuous life.

34
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,590
I need you to quash the scandal for me.

35
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,250
I can help you with it.

36
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,900
But why do we have to be engaged?

37
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,900
Getting engaged

38
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,300
is the most effective and reliable way I can think of now.

39
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,850
Not only can it clear my name, but you will also be vindicated.

40
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,930
We can kill two birds with one stone.

41
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,510
I don't think so.

42
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,500
Don't worry. We're just establishing an employment relationship.

43
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,630
I won't do anything to you.

44
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
We'll terminate the contract soon.

45
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,580
Why don't you read the contract first?

46
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,090
You'll get the same salary as PR officers in our company.

47
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
The company will contribute five mandatory insurance and three funds for you.

48
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,510
You'll be working eight hours per day

49
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,430
for five days a week.

50
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,909
The pay for the time you work overtime will be tripled.

51
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,409
Weekends are off.

52
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,650
If there's an emergency, you have to be on call at any hour.

53
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
I'll let you have days off in lieu then.

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,280
Employee benefits are the same as others.

55
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,550
If you perform well,

56
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,940
I'll give you 3,000 yuan extra as a bonus every month.

57
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,770
[Xu Nian, I don't know where the parents heard the news. They thought the school would close permanently.]

58
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,770
[They are all here now. The principal is very anxious. Please come back soon.]

59
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,210
The conditions

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,260
are favourable enough for ordinary people.

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,730
Sign it.

62
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,620
Sign what?

63
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,620
Where is Xu Nian?

64
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,230
She left.

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,530
She left before I finished?

66
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,010
By the way, I've arranged a place to stay.

67
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,430
We can check in tomorrow.

68
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,050
I understand how you feel.

69
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,560
Stop talking so much.

70
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,500
If the school can't continue,

71
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,450
you should refund our money.

72
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,530
Don't keep our children from going to other schools.

73
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,820
This is a consensus of all parents.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,840
If you don't refund it,

75
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
we'll sue you for fraud.

76
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,370
Xu Nian.

77
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,400
Everyone, listen to me.

78
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,210
Who are you?

79
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm a teacher working in the school,

80
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,900
and also the daughter of the school founder.

81
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,010
I promise you that I will handle all the problems well.

82
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,030
It won't affect students' studies.

83
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,380
We also welcome you to supervise the operation of the school.

84
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,650
Okay, we'll trust you first.

85
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,070
But if the school is going to close permanently,

86
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,290
you must inform us in advance.

87
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,090
The school will not close permanently.

88
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,250
Parents, don't worry.

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,030
It's getting late now.

90
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,630
Please go back first.

91
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,560
Let's go.

92
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,170
Xu Nian, has your dad decided not to sell the school?

93
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,740
Not yet.

94
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,030
How dare you say that just now?

95
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
Principal, don't worry.

96
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,670
I'll keep my word.

97
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,360
Then you must persuade your dad.

98
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,950
We must be responsible for the kids here.

99
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,620
If the school gets sold,

100
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,880
where else can the kids go to?

101
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,920
I get it.

102
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,700
I will solve this problem.

103
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,430
Come in.

104
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,810
Close the door.

105
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,820
Why did you

106
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,860
leave without saying goodbye yesterday?

107
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,520
I had an emergency last night.

108
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,140
So I left without telling you.

109
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,580
I'm really sorry.

110
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,040
Did you come to see me this morning

111
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,340
because of an emergency too?

112
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,060
I agree with the engagement employment contract

113
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,160
you offered last night.

114
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,680
I knew you would say yes to it.

115
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,090
It's such a perfect plan.

116
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,600
Sign it.

117
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,720
But I have one condition.

118
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,230
Go ahead.

119
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,000
You need to buy the land use rights of the special education school.

120
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,670
Why?

121
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,640
The Shanyu Group

122
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,590
wants to acquire the Xinliang Group, right?

123
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,780
My dad has the right to use the land of the special education school.

124
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,910
He's going to sell it

125
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,290
and use the money to save the Xinliang Group.

126
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
If you buy the school's land use rights,

127
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,210
you can destroy the self-rescue plan of Xinliang

128
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,420
and help me avert the school's crisis.

129
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,210
This is also a plan to kill two birds with one stone.

130
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,770
You have no reason not to agree.

131
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
I won't say yes to it.
