00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,990
Will it be okay? Let's not go.

5
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,960
It's okay.

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
I can do it.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,690
Gu Mingyan.

8
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,160
I saw something.

9
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,370
-What is it?
-I saw something.

10
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,810
I'm leaving.

11
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,110
I'm going to sleep in my room.

12
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,220
Xu Nian, what are you thinking about?

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,100
♫In the early days, we were thick as thieves♫

14
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,100
♫What're you doing? Can we hang?♫

15
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,260
♫People come and go, lessons on the road♫

16
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,950
♫We were meant to stay♫

17
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,410
♫I need closure♫

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,320
♫I need to know that we will be okay♫

19
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,160
Why don't I go back to school?

20
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,280
♫On our separate ways♫

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,940
This is so awkward.

22
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,990
♫I feel closer♫

23
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,310
♫We know the arms I lean♫

24
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,620
♫Are on these sheets♫

25
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,090
♫Over me♫

26
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,300
I'll continue to fix the electric meter at night.

27
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,220
There's nothing to be awkward about, right?

28
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,180
Okay, then I'll cook dinner tonight

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,200
to reward electrician Gu.

30
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
How about corn and pork rib soup tonight?

31
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,120
Okay.

32
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,830
You can choose the movie tonight.

33
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,430
I chose one, it's over four hours.

34
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,740
You can sleep only after you finish watching it.

35
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,130
It's a deal. I'll accompany you to the end.

36
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,200
Hello, sir.

37
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,990
I'm at the underground parking lot. Where are you?

38
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,190
I think it's No. 637.

39
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,360
Are you driving the car with the headlights on?

40
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,620
Okay.

41
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,530
Let go of me!

42
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,640
Let go of me!

43
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,750
Let go!

44
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,920
Who are you?

45
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,020
Let go of me!

46
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,510
Let go of me!

47
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,180
Let me go!

48
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,990
Hello, Mr. Gu. Welcome.

49
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,450
A DR that you give to only one person in a lifetime.

50
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm here to pick up the diamond ring.

51
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,180
Let me check your order and ID card.

52
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,930
Okay, here you are.

53
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,530
Mr. Gu, take a look.

54
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,480
This is the proposal ring

55
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,060
from the My Heart series that you ordered from us.

56
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,760
The meaning behind it is a sincere heart that is dedicated to you alone.

57
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,200
This is the true love agreement between you and Ms. Xu.

58
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
Once your information is confirmed,

59
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,860
you can't change or delete it.

60
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,390
Hello.

61
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,690
Gu Mingyan, Xu Nian is held captive by me.

62
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,240
Jiang Wanli, what do you want?

63
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,710
What do I want?

64
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,550
You'll know when you come.

65
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,620
I'll wait for you at the rooftop of Xinliang's abandoned factory outside the city.

66
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
I'll wait for you there.

67
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,720
Come here alone.

68
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,970
If I see someone else,

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,850
I promise you will only see Xu Nian's body.

70
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,250
Gu Mingyan.

71
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,380
Xu Nian!

72
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,210
Xu Nian!

73
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,110
Gu Mingyan.

74
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,990
Jiang Wanli.

75
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,370
Jiang Wanli, you're smart.

76
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,100
You can't get anything if you hurt Xu Nian.

77
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,460
Let Xu Nian go.

78
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,790
You can tell me what you want.

79
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,010
I'll satisfy you.

80
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,670
It's too late. It's too late.

81
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,320
Xu Nian!

82
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,280
Jiang Wanli.

83
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,700
Jiang Wanli.

84
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,000
You must be in need of money now.

85
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,560
Let Xu Nian go.

86
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,040
I can give you as much as you want.

87
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,680
Money?

88
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,340
I don't want money now.

89
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,190
I just want her to die.

90
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,180
Xu Nian! Jiang Wanli, no.

91
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,040
Don't come over.

92
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,810
I won't.

93
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,140
I won't come over.

94
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,820
Let Xu Nian go.

95
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,200
Weren't you guys very capable?

96
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:05,980
Xu Nian.

97
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,430
You deserve to die just like your mother.

98
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,130
And you, Gu Mingyan.

99
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,170
Aren't you capable?

100
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,850
I want you to watch

101
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
the person you love die in front of you,

102
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,700
but there's nothing you can do about it.

103
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,990
Xu Nian!

104
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:30,920
Xu Nian.

105
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,760
Gu Mingyan.

106
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,690
Don't let go.

107
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,630
I don't want to die yet.

108
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,730
All of you

109
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,909
who dared to fight me will die.

110
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,660
Come up!

111
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,590
Put down your weapon.

112
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,510
Take her away.

113
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,980
Go.

114
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,790
Are you okay?
