[Episode 19]

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,900
Tell me.

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,280
What is it?

6
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,530
I want to talk to you about Xu Nian.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,550
Xu Nian?

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,450
Xu Nian!

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,440
Xu Nian!

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,489
Stop looking. She's not here.

11
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,980
What did you do to Xu Nian?

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,830
Mingyan.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
Don't be so nervous.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,890
Xu Nian should be safe now.

15
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,080
No, maybe we should call her Gu Nian.

16
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,500
Half an hour ago,

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,850
she, my niece-in-law, just found out

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,390
that she's a descendant of the Gu family.

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,360
She couldn't accept it

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,120
and ran out.

21
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,310
What do you mean?

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,370
In that case,

23
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,430
I'll cut to the chase.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,430
This is the result of the paternity test

25
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,320
my father had done for her before.

26
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,680
The report shows that

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,750
Xu Nian is the biological daughter of my brother and Song Yuzhi.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,450
But the strange thing is,

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,630
my father knew Xu Nian was a descendant of the Gu family,

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,580
yet he actively facilitated your marriage.

31
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,669
This can only indicate one fact,

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,550
that you

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,390
are not my brother's biological son.

34
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,750
My father brought you back,

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,260
insisted that you're Gu Hongze's illegitimate son,

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,329
and supported you to fight for the position of the Gu family heir with me.

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,430
I suspected your identity once.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,690
But you've been abroad for many years, always careful,

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,360
and with my father protecting you,

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,170
so I've never been able to verify it.

41
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,660
But fate is so magical.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,370
Xu Nian appeared.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,510
If you don't love her that much

44
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,730
and insist on marrying her,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,350
I might not get the chance to verify it.

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,980
But now...

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,390
What do you want?

48
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,230
After all, it's a family scandal.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,790
I don't want the Gu family to be criticized.

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,890
As long as you resign from your position as CEO,

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,990
renounce your inheritance, and leave the country,

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,870
and stop competing with me,

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,930
I can pretend that nothing happened.

54
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,220
If not,

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,360
if this gets out,

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,240
who will be the most hurt?

57
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,880
Public opinion can kill people.

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,850
Don't forget how Song Yuzhi died.

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,630
I'll give you one day to think about it.

60
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,690
When I graduated,

61
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,190
I joined Xinliang Group,

62
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,110
which was your grandpa's company.

63
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,890
At that time,

64
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,780
I wanted to create my own career

65
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,720
and make a world of my own.

66
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,740
After I joined the company,

67
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,990
I saw your mother.

68
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,180
I admired her.

69
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,900
But I could only watch from afar, right?

70
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,900
We had disparate social statuses.

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,500
Then one day, your grandpa informed me

72
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,080
that he intended to invest more in my development.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,560
But the condition was

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,350
to marry your mother.

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,560
I was very happy.

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,900
I agreed without thinking.

77
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,030
Later I found out

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,860
she was pregnant.

79
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,300
She didn't tell me.

80
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,550
And I didn't ask.

81
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,900
So, did you know a long time ago

82
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,360
that I wasn't your biological daughter?

83
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,480
I've always known.

84
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,260
I've always known that you're not my biological child.

85
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,540
But power and status

86
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,500
were too tempting.

87
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,840
Besides, I admired her, right?

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,200
So I promised her

89
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,970
I would treat you like my own child

90
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,570
and take care of her forever.

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,330
Then later on? Why did you change later?

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,150
A marriage based on a monetary relationship

93
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,830
won't be a happy one.

94
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,810
Besides, when I was facing your grandpa and your mother,

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,720
I was under a lot of pressure.

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,690
Later Jiang Wanli appeared.

97
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,850
I gave all my love to Jiang Wanli.

98
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,620
Later she got pregnant.

99
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,510
She forced me

100
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,380
to divorce your mother.

101
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,630
I knew

102
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,180
if this matter were made public,

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,480
I would lose everything.

104
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,900
Your grandpa would kick me out.

105
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,760
Later,

106
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,790
there was the acquisition of Xinliang Group.

107
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,480
And the scandal between your mother and Gu Hongze was exposed.

108
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,290
So I wanted to shift all the blame

109
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,390
onto your mother.

110
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,510
Because I knew that only by shifting the blame onto her

111
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,310
would your grandpa have no reason to kick me out.

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,350
So, from then on, I had been using emotional abuse towards your mother.

113
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,909
But I really didn’t know

114
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,540
Jiang Wanli...

115
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,220
Jiang Wanli would do those to your mom...

116
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,659
Until...

117
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,650
Until your mother passed away.

118
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,620
Later, Jiang Wanli treated you like that.

119
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,540
I was not entirely unaware either.

120
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,570
But...

121
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,870
But Yao is...

122
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,250
Yao is my biological daughter.

123
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,640
I can not be fair.

124
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,940
I can't.

125
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,810
So I'm really Gu Hongze's daughter.

127
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,900
Then, Mingyan and I...

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,300
Mingyan and I are...

129
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,730
Hello.

130
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,500
Mr. Gu, we found Xu Nian.

131
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,380
Where is she?

132
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,850
At her mother's grave.

133
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,300
Okay, I'll be right there.

134
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,060
Mom.

135
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,240
Before I met Mingyan,

136
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,300
I always thought

137
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,750
that clearing your name

138
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,450
was my only obsession in this world.

139
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,370
But now someone suddenly told me

140
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
what I'd been persisting for so many years

141
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
was wrong.

142
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,460
Now I'm even in love with my elder brother.

143
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,760
Mom.

144
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,380
Tell me

145
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,320
what I should do now.

146
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,500
You're back.
