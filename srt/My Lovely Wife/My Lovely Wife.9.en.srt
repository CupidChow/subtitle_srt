Don't touch it.

5
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,289
Aunt Jiang will give me a massage later.

6
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,270
You can't handle it.

7
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,289
Aunt Jiang comes from a good family.

8
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,140
But she learned massage for you.

9
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,090
On the contrary,

10
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,160
I'm a terrible daughter.

11
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,229
I wonder where Aunt Jiang learned it.

12
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,660
When she was in Manhui…

13
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
She knew it long ago.

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,280
Manhui?

15
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,210
Dad.

16
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,240
You've been so worried about the group

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,230
that you have poor health all this time.

18
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,310
Maybe you misunderstood that I was helping Gu Mingyan.

19
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,190
But I don't want to see you

21
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,770
and lose everything in the end.

22
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,690
It's better to negotiate now

23
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,090
and fight for the best interests.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,940
In that case, it's not only beneficial for the group but also for you.

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,200
I'll support whatever decision you make.

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,340
Let's go back. It's too cold.

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,260
Xinliang Group is Mr. Xu's lifelong effort.

28
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,890
I've added some additional terms.

29
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,060
Someone once told me

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,750
if acquisition is not for win-win,

31
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,579
it will definitely result in failure.

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,840
I think Mr. Xu

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,610
would prefer to witness the new development of Xinliang Group

34
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,230
instead of its collapse.

35
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,710
Okay.

36
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,770
I'll agree to it.

37
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,700
But I have two conditions.

38

What are they?

39
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,810
First,

40
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,780
you can't fire any employee of Xinliang Group.

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,470
They've been with me for so many years.

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,990
I owe them too much.

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,500
Okay, no problem.

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,290
I promise you that.

hold a grand equity transfer ceremony for me.

47
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,220
I want everyone to know

48
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,320
that I, Xu Tao, transfer the shares

49
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,090
for the better development of Xinliang Group.

50
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,080
I can promise you that too.

51
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,080
Okay.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,490

Xinliang Group is the result of your hard work.

56

You can't sell it so easily.

57
