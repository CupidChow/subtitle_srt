1
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,170
Hello. I'd like to order.

2
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,460
What would you like to eat?

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,800
Don't come near the register.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Until we catch the thief,

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,130
you're the prime suspect.

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,630
Go away.

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,600
Step away from the counter.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,530
Miss, what would you like to order?

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,570
I want a beef burger,

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,700
hash browns and a black tea with no ice.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,030
Please find a seat inside.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,630
I'll bring it to you shortly.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,030
Is that really necessary?

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,670
So what if it is?

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,230
Xiaojun was just trying to help you.

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,600
What did he do wrong?

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
So I'm wrong for being careful?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,330
Should we wait until more money disappears

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,670
and we all get taken to the police station?

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,600
So that gives you the right to label people?

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,730
We're colleagues!

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,870
Jiang Zhihao,

24
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,270
are you out of your mind?

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,900
Before you came,

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,330
I was managing this store.

27
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,530
If you want to argue, do it outside!

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,200
Let's talk outside then.

29
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,170
What do you want?

30
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,270
What do I want?

31
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,830
Apologize to Xiaojun.

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,370
Let me tell you,

33
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,330
working with Teacher Tian doesn't make you special.

34
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,170
I'm not buying your act.

35
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,930
I'm trying to reason with you.

36
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,970
Reason?

37
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,530
With your fists?

38
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,670
If fighting could solve the problem,

39
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,770
if fighting could stop people

40
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,930
from labeling us,

41
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,530
fine, I'm game.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,930
No one wants to be suspected,

43
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,000
and no one should be.

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,829
We can't let one mistake

45
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,300
condemn us to bear this guilt for life.

46
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,570
At least that's how I feel.

47
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,270
You too, right?

48
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,670
Isn't Xiaojun the same?

49
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,970
Go apologize to Xiaojun.

50
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,230
Until we find the real thief,

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,770
no one should be suspected.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
Order.

53
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,900
Choose what you want to eat.

54
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,970
Xiaojun.

55
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,130
Help watch the counter.

56
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,100
I haven't finished washing the cloth.

57
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,329
Coming!

58
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,070
Hey!

59
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,170
Excuse me, what are you doing?

60
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,430
Why aren't you helping customers order?

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,300
I'm sorry for the wait.

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,170
What would you like to eat today?

63
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,630
Whatever.

64
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,070
Today's special then.

65
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,970
Special.

66
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,970
Would you like to upsize your drink?

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,330
OK.

68
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,000
Ice and sweetness.

69
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,030
All set to normal.

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,200
Reading card information.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,670
Please wait.

72
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,370
Please enter your chip bank card PIN.

73
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,070
Press confirm after entering.

74
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,170
Chip bank card ejected.

75
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,430
Please take your card.

76
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,300
Please try again.

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,370
Hello?

78
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,830
Hello, Mom.

79
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,500
It's me.

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,970
I was just about to call you.

81
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,870
The money for this month...

82
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,400
Why haven't you sent it yet?

83
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,570
I probably won't be sending money this month.

84
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,530
Because I...

85
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,470
Utilities, rent...

86
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,130
After paying all those bills,

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
I barely have enough money to eat.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,830
If you can't afford food,

89
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,570
you need to figure something out.

90
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,300
Didn't you always have ways to make money before?

91
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,730
That was before.

92
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,670
I want a new life now.

93
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,870
You want a new life?

94
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,770
What about your family?

95
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,100
What about all of us?

96
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,830
Do you think we don't need to survive?

97
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,200
Should we just live on air?

98
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
How can you be so useless?

99
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,230
Why are you talking to me like this?

100
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm trying my best too.

101
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,630
I'm working hard to make money.

102
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,400
But I just can't right now.

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Pressuring me won't help.

104
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,100
Come in.

105
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,570
Here's the market research report I prepared.

106
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,170
Do I need to hand it over to anyone?

107
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,570
Just leave it on the desk.

108
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,270
Our current target demographic is still mainly students and office workers.

109
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,530
And I think if we add more

110
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,900
campus offline events

111
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,170
and some co-branding initiatives,

112
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,100
it would really help improve the company's public image.

113
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
These reports and plans you've made

114
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,000
could be done by any fresh college graduate.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,970
The key is in the details of those co-branding initiatives

116
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,770
and my other...

117
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,870
Perhaps Dad sent you to the store

118
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,730
because he knows

119
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,590
you're not suited for strategic decision-making.

120
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,870
Don't disappoint him with the position he's given you.

121
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,000
Maybe at the Richu store

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,430
you'll find your place.

123
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,560
You may go now if there's nothing else.

124
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,500
Director.

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Here's the information you requested.

126
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,370
Please take care of those documents on the desk.

127
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,230
Okay.

128
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,970
There's a

129
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,670
collaboration proposal with Nuo Toast.

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
I heard it's a famous bakery.

131
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,330
Let me see it.

132
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,270
Shred the rest.

133
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,170
Okay.

134
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,830
Lucy,

135
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm downstairs at the client's place.

136
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,070
This client is quite demanding.

137
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,700
You need to be extra careful when cleaning.

138
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,530
Remember,

139
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,200
you must finish cleaning before the client arrives home

140
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
and leave the premises.

141
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,770
Okay,

142
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,270
I'm only cleaning the living room today.

143
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,430
I should have plenty of time

144
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,700
and won't run into the client.

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,570
Good. Report back to me when you're done.

146
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,130
Okay, thanks Lucy.

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,870
Don't meet the client.

148
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,670
Remember to clean the screen.

149
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,630
Don't use water.

150
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,430
Make sure the painting is hung properly.

151
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,730
Isn't it already hung properly?

152
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,670
Clean carefully

153
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,700
to avoid breaking anything.

154
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,700
Alright.

155
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,370
Move it.

156
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,970
What should I do?

157
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,000
This is our new product.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,270
Please try it. Hello.

159
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,670
Thank you.

160
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,170
Thank you for coming.

161
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,400
Next customer, please come in.

162
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,730
Thank you.

163
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,730
Just two left.

164
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,670
How lucky.

165
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,730
Yes, indeed.

166
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm sorry, we've sold out of toast today.

167
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,100
Please come early tomorrow. Thank you.

168
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,730
Thank you.

169
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,200
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

170
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
Thank you for coming.

171
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,430
Sucking up so early in the morning?

172
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,370
Dad went to play ball.

173
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,870
I know he plays ball every weekend.

174
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
What are you up to?

175
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,000
Going on a date?

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,900
Dressed like Cruella.

177
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,270
Going to the office.

178
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,430
Going to the office on your day off?

179
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,270
No wonder Dad praises you everywhere,

180
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,570
saying he has such a capable daughter.

181
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,200
Look at that Yuequan

182
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,730
and Lin Guangsheng,

183
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,660
you handled them all so perfectly.

184
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,670
Maybe I should learn from you.

185
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,530
You handle everything so well,

186
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,870
as if all those things

187
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,130
were designed by you from the beginning.

188
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,700
If you hadn't mentioned it, I would've forgotten

189
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,970
about Lequan and Lin Guangsheng,

190
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,370
and who caused that mess.

191
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,900
Thanks.

192
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,430
So I should thank you

193
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,290
for always cleaning up my messes.

194
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,570
You really can't get married.

195
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,270
If you get married,

196
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,170
it would be a huge loss

197
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,770
for our company.

198
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,700
Even if I get married,

199
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,300
I won't leave the company.

200
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,100
I agree with that.

201
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,900
Since I'll be running the company later,

202
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,630
losing such a good employee like you

203
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,170
would be a real shame.

204
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,030
Just drinking black coffee in the morning is enjoyable.

205
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,400
It's lonely eating breakfast alone.

206
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,630
I can keep you company.

207
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm not like that Deng Weiyu,

208
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,130
who only cares about that nearly bankrupt store.

209
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,030
I prefer being alone.

210
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,800
Talking while eating causes indigestion.

211
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,900
Excuse me.

212
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,430
Alright, now I have some good news to announce.

213
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,100
Our Richu store

214
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,500
will only operate until the end of this month.

215
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,100
What do you mean?

216
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,500
Didn't we agree until the end of the year?

217
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,230
What do you mean 'what do I mean'?

218
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,970
It means exactly what I said.

219
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,170
You'll be transferred to a more suitable department.

220
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,200
Dad was the one who sent me there.

221
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,570
Does he know about this?

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,500
Whether to open or close a branch,

223
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,560
don't I have the authority to decide?

224
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,970
I offered you a perfectly good flagship store to manage,

225
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,770
but you refused.

226
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,830
What exactly are you trying to prove?

227
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,330
Brother.

228
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,630
Please give me a little more time.

229
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,330
Even if I give you more time,

230
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,070
will a miracle happen?

231
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,000
Even if there is a miracle,

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,170
it won't happen to you.

233
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,230
Meeting adjourned.

234
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,130
Keep trying.

235
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,730
Thank you, Deputy Director.

236
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,400
Let me through.

237
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,930
Jiang Zhihao, what are you doing?

238
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,200
Frying eggs.

239
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,300
Why are you frying eggs?

240
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,830
To eat, what else?

241
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,770
I want some too.

242
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,900
Okay.

243
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,270
Wait.

244
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,570
Is everyone free?

245
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,430
Let's do some cleaning, shall we?

246
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,530
Manager.

247
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,130
Let me do it.

248
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,230
Sure, thanks.

249
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,400
Excuse me.

250
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,330
Sorry, we're closed.

251
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,370
Aren't you...

252
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
The breakfast was delicious.

253
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,100
I brought you a customer.

254
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,430
Big Brother.

255
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,670
Why didn't you come find me?

256
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,230
If I hadn't heard rumors

257
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,300
about you meeting Daba's gang at the hotel,

258
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,230
I wouldn't have known you were out.

259
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,800
Don't want to be with me anymore?

260
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,970
You went to jail for me,

261
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,500
at least let me have a chance to repay you properly.

262
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,730
No need to repay me.

263
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,730
I chose to go in myself.

264
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,470
Come back to the company.

265
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,030
I won't treat you unfairly.

266
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,830
Excuse me, sir,

267
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,870
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,170
Dayong is still an employee of Linlin.

269
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,600
He's working right now.

270
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
If he resigned,

271
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
he wouldn't be an employee anymore, right?

272
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,530
He wants to resign.

273
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,790
You're not going to make things difficult for him, are you?

274
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,900
We'll respect his personal decision.

275
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,900
That's good then.

276
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,130
Let's talk later.

277
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,190
I'll wait for you at the noodle stand.

278
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,330
Brother Dawei.

279
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,930
Come, have something to eat.

280
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,970
I just ate at the shop.

281
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,230
Your company has good benefits.

282
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,730
Not bad.

283
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,930
I won't treat you poorly either.

284
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,530
Have you made up your mind?

285
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,390
When will you come back to help me?

286
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,530
Brother Dawei.

287
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,130
I don't want to live like I used to anymore.

288
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,830
Do you know

289
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,070
what kind of shop I work at?

290
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,070
Isn't it just a breakfast shop?

291
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,730
For me,

292
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,570
it's not just a breakfast shop.

293
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,630
It's where someone like me,

294
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,400
an ex-convict, can start over.

295
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,030
As long as I have time and opportunity,

296
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,630
I want to give it my best shot.

297
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,900
Please support me, Brother Dawei.

298
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,100
What are you guys doing here?

299
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,470
Just thought it's been a while since I came to read comics,

300
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,130
so I dropped by.

301
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,700
I've read this one too.

302
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,630
Why are you here?

303
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,230
You...

304
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,130
Did you just go see Brother Dawei?

305
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,330
Although we haven't worked together for long,

306
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,970
I still...

307
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,130
I still hope you'll stay.

308
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,930
Don't you think we're like

309
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,630
characters in a comic book?

310
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,470
I loved this one when I was a kid.

311
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,270
They always argue during competitions,

312
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,530
but in the end,

313
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,630
they come together to win.

314
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,970
Isn't that inspiring?

315
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,430
Am I that important?

316
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,670
Of course you are.

317
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,730
You were determined to leave,

318
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,800
weren't you?

319
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,170
Let me tell you,

320
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,230
once you give up on a competition,

321
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,670
it's over.

322
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,900
What are you doing?

323
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,690
Brother Dawei gave this to me.

324
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,330
He said

325
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,690
this is a gift for doing time in his place.

326
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I can go to him anytime if I need help.

327
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,500
So you mean

328
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,030
you're not leaving?

329
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,570
When did I say I was leaving?

330
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,570
So you read this type of comics?

331
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,200
Yeah.

332
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,330
This kind

333
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,430
gets my blood pumping too.

334
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,130
Artsy romance style.

335
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,430
I don't know what you did so well last time,

336
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,970
but after your service,

337
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,600
that client called and said

338
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,970
they want to sign a long-term contract with our company

339
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,000
and specifically requested you.

340
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,670
Here's the contract.

341
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,470
They've gone through several cleaning staff before,

342
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,670
but weren't satisfied with any of them.

343
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,700
So is it related to the diamond?

344
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,430
Dear customer,

345
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,170
I am the home cleaner.

346
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,030
While cleaning,

347
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,600
I found this diamond ring under the sofa.

348
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,500
If you receive this,

349
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,130
please call our company to confirm.

350
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,100
Thank you.

351
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,100
This Mr. Fang is very picky.

352
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,030
Take a close look at his contract.

353
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,730
And do your best.

354
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,430
Remember the client specifically mentioned

355
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,300
that you must leave within his specified time.

356
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,970
Perhaps he doesn't want to see strangers.

357
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,600
On the safe

358
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,430
move it and wipe.

359
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,700
Where is the safe?

360
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,070
This one?

361
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,770
Is this the safe?

362
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,330
OK.

363
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,470
Remove stains.

364
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,470
Make square corners with the quilt.

365
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,400
Please clean the mattress and quilt with a mite remover

366
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,570
and clean up water stains.

367
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,100
Hello.

368
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,570
I'm the home cleaner.

369
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,470
The bathroom showerhead is loose and damaged.

370
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,800
I suggest replacing it.

371
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,970
Shrimp, peanuts, pineapple.

372
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,330
Alright.

373
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,390
I probably don't need to cook, right?

374
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,930
Kid, it's never too late to turn back.

375
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,830
Xiaojun paid back the money.

376
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,300
Hurry up!

377
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,500
This way we can sweep.

378
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,270
There are crumbs all over the floor.

379
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,270
Why are you suddenly sweeping? You're bringing all the dust over here.

380
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:46,730
Go away.

381
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,400
We're sweeping here.

382
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,870
Stop messing around.

383
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,870
Stop spreading the bubbles around.

384
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,070
Don't step over here anymore.

385
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,830
Take him away.

386
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,000
Get him.

387
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,070
Alright, Xiaojun, you

388
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,030
should leave now.

389
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,870
No way. He's causing trouble.

390
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,830
I'm part of this place.

391
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,160
I'm staying right here.

392
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,600
So handsome.

393
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,500
Come on, hurry up. Stop fooling around.

394
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,430
It's a statue.

395
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,770
A statue.

396
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,500
So handsome.

397
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,430
So cool.

398
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,700
We'll get caught.

399
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,430
Let me ask you.

400
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,800
Why did you close down the breakfast shop at the entrance

401
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,260
and then go back to work at Linlin Breakfast?

402
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,730
You also know about Guangsheng and Xueqing's divorce.

403
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,300
It was all their fault.

404
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,730
So you know I went back to Linlin.

405
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,330
Zhilu told me this morning.

406
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,430
Dad.

407
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,000
Since you know I'm back at Linlin,

408
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
I'm working there legitimately, right?

409
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,570
It's a big company.

410
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,900
I can learn how to run a business from them.

411
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,500
That's not wrong,

412
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,230
but that breakfast shop you're going back to,

413
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,030
the people working there

414
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,930
are all ex-convicts.

415
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,470
Yes,

416
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,370
they are rehabilitated people, that's true,

417
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,030
but they're working honestly.

418
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,770
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

419
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,530
They're willing to change,

420
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,670
so we should give them a second chance.

421
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,700
Whatever you say.

422
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,370
Dad, where are you going?

423
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,470
Where to?

424
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,100
Jiang Zhilu, you little snitch!

425
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,760
Come down and watch the store!

426
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,530
Dad, where are you going?

427
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,730
I'm hungry. Going to find something to eat.

428
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,390
You're not inviting me to eat?

429
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,370
Are we that close?

430
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,870
If you have something on your mind

431
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,400
would you tell me?

432
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,830
The highest level of connection is when hearts understand each other.

433
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,230
We're father and son.

434
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,960
You must understand me, right?

435
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,830
I'm your son.

436
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,430
Shouldn't you

437
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,130
understand me better than anyone?

438
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,170
Please don't be angry anymore.

439
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,430
It's so hot.

440
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Have I ever trusted you before?

441
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,770
Haven't you?

442
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,270
When I messed things up before

443
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,830
and Mom scolded me badly,

444
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,500
you always stood up for me.

445
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,030
That's what trust is.

446
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,230
When you got demerits at school,

447
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,530
I could go to school and plead for you.

448
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,600
If you're unemployed,

449
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,330
I can support you.

450
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,800
If you mess things up,

451
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,370
I can handle that too.

452
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,930
But now,

453
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,330
I really don't know

454
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,570
if I can still protect you anymore.

455
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,170
Dad.

456
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,570
Don't worry about me,

457
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,970
okay?

458
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,970
Forget it.

459
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,100
Kids grow up,

460
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,700
and I can't control you anymore.

461
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,600
I really can't manage you.

462
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,230
I'm hungry.

463
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,700
You really don't care?

464
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,100
I'm so hungry my stomach hurts.

465
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,370
What do you want to eat?

466
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,500
Whatever.

467
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,730
Hot pot.

468
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,500
That works.

469
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,470
Did you bring any money?

470
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,530
No.

471
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,570
Hello.

472
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,170
Hi.

473
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,970
Excuse me, are you closed?

474
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,730
We're out of grilled items.

475
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,970
Do you have anything else?

476
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,230
That curly-haired guy is so cute.

477
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,970
No way, I think I...

478
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,970
He's so handsome.

479
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,900
Is that the one who just greeted us?

480
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,500
Look.

481
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,500
The photo I took yesterday,

482
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,630
the angle was amazing.

483
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,130
Mine too.

484
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,730
Look. You should go greet them.

485
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,300
They seem to like you.

486
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,760
He looks very different with or without clothes.

487
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,990
Headquarters has decided to close the Richu store.

488
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,530
Don't say anymore.

489
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,570
A small shrimp fighting against a big whale -

490
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,530
that kind of thing only happens on TV.

491
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,070
I never believed in it.

492
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,270
Chicago Burger, Medium Iced Milk.

493
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:55,830
Okay.

494
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,370
But life is like that.

495
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,970
Often, at the most unexpected moments,

496
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,630
miracles happen.

497
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,270
Chicago Burger.

498
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,030
Sukiyaki beef layered omelet. Good.

499
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,830
Sir, what would you like to order?

500
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,830
A cup of hot tea. Fei,

501
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,070
that early delivery,

502
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,770
I put it there.

503
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,370
OK, good, no problem.

504
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,130
I always feel that miracles are heaven's

505
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,470
last chance for hardworking people like us.

506
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,730
Good.

507
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,570
Queen's Cream Toast, Chicago Burger,

508
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,470
newly launched.

509
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,230
Here you go. Hello.

510
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,170
Thank you.

511
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,700
Number 808?

512
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,100
This 808

513
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,270
meal set.

514
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,000
Thank you. Chicago burger,

515
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,070
and Queen's cream toast.

516
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,200
Order now

517
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,970
and skip the line. No need to call.

518
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,800
Good morning. Welcome.

519
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,130
If that's the case,

520
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,100
I can't go against destiny.

521
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,530
I must fight back

522
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,270
and claim victory.

523
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,830
So that's why there are so many people lately,

524
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,230
because of this.

525
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,330
Let's check out Dayong's physique.

526
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,630
It's amazing.

527
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,370
Let's see what color this is.

528
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,470
No wonder I keep getting messages

529
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,300
about wanting to sign me for a debut.

530
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,800
I thought it was a scam.

531
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,170
Dayong, let me tell you.

532
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,630
That's definitely a scam.

533
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,500
Dayong,

534
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,830
you should really trust him.

535
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,630
He's an expert in scams himself.

536
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,230
I feel a bit guilty,

537
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,430
but if things continue like this,

538
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,400
our daily performance

539
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,030
won't make it to the top three.

540
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,300
No, Manager Weiyu,

541
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,130
with our looks,

542
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,800
you should have confidence in us.

543
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,270
We're number one.

544
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,200
You!

545
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,370
We're all so handsome,

546
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,100
aren't we?

547
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,200
I am.

548
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,670
I'm just keeping a low profile usually.

549
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,970
Are you done?

550
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,770
This store is about to close anyway.

551
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,500
Feeling good, aren't you?

552
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,300
What's there to feel good about?

553
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,600
No.

554
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,800
Fei,

555
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
move over there.

556
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,700
So what if I am?

557
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,370
We only have one month left.

558
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,370
Aren't you going to give it your all?

559
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,100
Let's show them what we can do,

560
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,030
right?

561
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,900
Being stars for a month,

562
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,900
everyone gets to enjoy it.

563
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm the one who should be the star.

564
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,670
I can do it too.

565
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,070
I just haven't taken my clothes off.

566
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,830
Take them off.

567
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,030
Take your pants off.

568
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,130
Alright, nobody wants to see that.

569
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,130
We only have one month left.

570
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,460
Let's do our best, okay?

571
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,130
So many excuses.

572
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,199
Come on,

573
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,570
let's go, everyone!

574
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,699
One, two, three!

575
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,030
I'll go clean the bathroom.

576
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,030
Let's be number one!

577
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,030
I'll go clean the bathroom with him.

578
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,830
Zhihao's special

579
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,960
super ultimate Osaka-style pancake.

580
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,730
It's delicious!

581
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:03,930
I really miss

582
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,190
the breakfast you used to sell in front of the beauty salon.

583
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,100
But now is good too.

584
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,700
Your income is stable now.

585
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,460
Why are you so pessimistic today?

586
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,600
It's all because of work.

587
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,270
OK.

588
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,900
Mr. Fang really sheds a lot of hair.

589
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,100
People hire house cleaners

590
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,070
usually because they're too busy with work.

591
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,330
But not him.

592
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,370
He sticks sticky notes everywhere,

593
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,830
and after I finish cleaning,

594
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,500
he checks everything one by one.

595
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,900
He even makes sure the angle

596
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,200
of every item matches exactly how he placed it.

597
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
Like he measured it with a protractor.

598
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,470
But he pays well, right?

599
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,170
Why do you know me so well?

600
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,600
Didn't Uncle Guang pay off all the debts before he left?

601
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,430
Your financial pressure

602
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,270
should be much less now, right?

603
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,400
Why not do something you actually want to do?

604
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,570
Paying off debt was simpler.

605
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,970
You just needed to work hard and make money.

606
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,270
That's why I took this house cleaning job.

607
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,200
The hours are flexible,

608
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,830
the pay is good,

609
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,160
and I can still help out at home after work.

610
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,730
But I don't know if continuing like this

611
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,460
is really the right thing to do.

612
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,830
But if I quit,

613
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,470
I don't know what else I should do.

614
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,670
Not like you.

615
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,600
You always know what you want to do.

616
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,230
You know what you want to do too.

617
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,300
No, I don't.

618
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,430
In the end, everyone

619
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,330
ends up in the same place.

620
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,130
A coffin.

621
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,390
You're being really negative today.

622
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,370
It's true though.

623
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,800
Whether you sleep on the bus or get off to pee,

624
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,430
or whether you want okonomiyaki or instant noodles,

625
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,930
it's all fine.

626
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,170
If you don't like it, just don't eat it.

627
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,430
I want to eat.

628
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,360
I want to try something different.

629
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,300
Try a bite of the noodles.

630
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,170
Just try it

631
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,300
together with this.

632
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,170
Is it good?

633
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
It's obviously delicious.

634
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,700
Here we go.

635
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,100
Let me make something special for you.

636
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,500
I'll customize it for you.

637
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,670
Sir, your takeout is ready.

638
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,870
Be careful. Please come again.

639
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,170
Miss, what would you like to order?

640
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,670
I'll take care of this.

641
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,500
One Chicago burger.

642
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,170
Would you like a drink?

643
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,400
Miss Lin, excuse me.

644
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,470
My large iced milk hasn't arrived yet.

645
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,070
The large iced milk isn't here yet.

646
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,930
Bar staff!

647
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,930
Why isn't the large iced milk ready?

648
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,830
Dayong!

649
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,830
Looking good!

650
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,800
Strike a pose. Come on!

651
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,100
Aren't you about to debut?

652
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,170
What's going on?

653
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,830
What are you all doing? Don't you have work?

654
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,160
What's happening here?

655
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,330
Dayong, you're

656
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,600
just wearing that?

657
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,070
I didn't get that one,

658
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,330
the white one.

659
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,570
He's a star! Why wear clothes?

660
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,970
Yeah, this look suits you. Super handsome.

661
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,600
You know what?

662
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,270
Yesterday because of you,

663
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,900
all the chicken sold out.

664
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,030
Dayong, is the bacon and egg ready?

665
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,070
Yes,

666
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,270
there are empty seats inside you can take.

667
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,600
You can pay after eating. Where's Xiaojun?

668
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,000
I need ketchup.

669
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,900
Ketchup.

670
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,230
Do you have ketchup?

671
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,200
Ladies.

672
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,330
Your takeout is ready. Over here.

673
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,630
OK, just a moment.

674
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,200
Thank you.

675
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,770
Thanks. Please come again.

676
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,930
Thank you.

677
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,170
How many in your party? Just one?

678
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,200
Just one.

679
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,930
Dayong, there's one more order of sizzling noodles.

680
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,870
Yes, these new uniforms look great.

681
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,470
Why did headquarters give you those

682
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,670
old defective ones before?

683
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,800
Let bygones be bygones.

684
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,030
We need to move toward future success.

685
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,070
Today's performance must be better than yesterday's.

686
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,170
Let's get moving,

687
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,330
shall we?

688
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,730
OK.

689
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,700
We've been really swamped lately.

690
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,530
I've brought two girls to help out.

691
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,900
Afei, Xiaojun, please train them for me.

692
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,370
Thanks.

693
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,730
Alright. Yes, manager.

694
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,430
Come, I'll teach you how to assemble burgers first.

695
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,500
There isn't any.

696
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,470
How about I demonstrate it for you once?

697
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,170
OK.

698
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,800
Hello, look over here.

699
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,070
What's distracting you?

700
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,070
There's nothing interesting to see here.

701
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,100
There are no hot dogs over there.

702
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
There's only Dayong over there, OK?

703
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,930
Afei.

704
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,770
Same as last time.

705
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,370
Combo with iced tea.

706
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,630
Thank you. You can sit at any empty table inside.

707
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,370
Thanks.

708
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,270
Good.

709
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,570
That difficult customer, Ms. Lin,

710
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,130
ordered fifty meals again today.

711
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,930
We need to deliver them before 9:30.

712
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,470
I've already restocked

713
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,870
the bacon and chicken in the fridge.

714
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,800
Ms. Lin. OK.

715
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,730
Soy milk, unsweetened and sweetened.

716
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,500
Remember to separate them.

717
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,530
Don't deliver the wrong ones again.

718
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,200
OK.

719
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,000
Dayong, you're still in charge of the grill today.

720
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,630
Yes, we have rich curry.

721
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,000
I'd like one rich curry.

722
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,300
OK. And add an egg,

723
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
half-cooked.

724
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,160
One half-cooked egg, no problem.

725
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,770
Is that OK?

726
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,800
OK.

727
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,300
There's a seat available over there.

728
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,700
You can pay after eating.

729
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,930
Jiang Zhihao.

730
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,430
What are you doing here?

731
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,570
Working.

732
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,530
So you're the one helping Deng Weiyu.

733
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,200
Jiang Zhihao, stop chatting with customers.

734
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,370
What are you doing?

735
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,230
Brother.

736
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,500
I came to check on my brother at work,

737
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,970
and ran into an old friend.

738
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,170
Let's have dinner together after work.

739
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,630
We should have a lot to talk about.

740
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,600
So working at Richu

741
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,130
was the strategist's idea.

742
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,070
I thought the Richu store

743
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,230
was just an unimportant branch to you.

744
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,100
Don't think

745
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,900
I don't know what you're up to.

746
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,100
Aren't you just trying to prove to Dad

747
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,300
that you can revive that failing store?

748
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,600
I had no idea your ambition was so great.

749
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,800
What about that pitiful act you put on before?

750
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,930
Was it all fake?

751
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,500
Kang, it's ready to eat.

752
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,430
Hurry up.

753
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,830
Want me to serve you some?

754
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,730
Those recent incidents...

755
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,270
Don't tell me you were behind them too?

756
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,530
The chicken processing plant,

757
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,370
and making Xie Jinghan and Li Peizhen turn against me.

758
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,570
Turn against me.

759
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,430
What do you mean turn against you?

760
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,530
Kang,

761
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,300
were you really

762
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,130
two-timing both of them?

763
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,000
Peizhen and Jinghan are my goddesses!

764
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,630
You've gone too far!

765
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,500
You think this is enough to bring me down,

766
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,800
don't you?

767
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,630
Deng Weiyu,

768
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,100
let me tell you,

769
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,100
no matter what you do,

770
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,930
your mother will always be nothing but trash in the Deng family.

771
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:15,930
Deng Weikang,

772
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,870
to defeat you,

773
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,800
I've been preparing for a long time.

774
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,930
Richu Five Tigers,

775
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,970
let's go!

776
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,200
I got fired.

777
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,070
I really didn't see anything!

778
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,900
So that's how you treat someone who's not your real brother?

779
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,700
Your brother just said he's not his biological son.

780
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,670
What does that mean?

781
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,870
What about his father?

782
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:42,970
His real father.

783
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,270
Actually, I have another identity.

784
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,800
Yes, I want to report rats

785
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,900
at the Richu branch of Linlin Breakfast Shop.

786
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,300
Actually, my initial purpose in finding you

787
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,960
was to deal with Deng Weikang.

788
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,200
I want to take over Linlin Breakfast.
