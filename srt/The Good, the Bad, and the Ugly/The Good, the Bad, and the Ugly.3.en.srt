1
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,200
Many things

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,570
people actually know are wrong.

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,200
They just deliberately choose to ignore them.

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,400
I believe this world

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,000
still has a distinction between right and wrong, good and evil.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,530
The ultimate karma

7
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,260
will eventually come back to oneself.

8
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,930
So if I know the truth,

9
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,430
I can't ignore it.

10
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,200
From Qi University?

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
You're my junior!

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,700
Hello, senior.

13
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,700
Come join my department.

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,500
Isn't it Qi University tradition for seniors to look after juniors?

15
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,800
Kang, you wanted to see me?

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,500
Take him to meet everyone in the department.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,130
This is my assistant.

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,470
If you have any questions in the future, you can ask her.

19
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,970
Pursue excellence.

20
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,630
Embrace all rivers.

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,700
The new store opened,

22
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,800
and then people in the kitchen got cross-infected with the flu.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
They're now in the emergency room getting treatment.

24
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,930
We're opening for business in an hour,

25
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,570
and we promised to make

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,430
100 free breakfasts today.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,229
And you're only telling me about this problem now?

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,130
Just a moment.

29
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,800
Here's your meal. Thank you.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,570
Thanks. Please leave us a good review.

31
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,900
OK. Hello.

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,770
- Is everything free?
- Yes.

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,470
Then I'd like one...

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,300
Ming.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,370
Go check it first.

36
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,400
- OK.
- Outside.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
- Good.
- Right.

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,930
Has anyone not ordered yet?

39
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,130
- Can we order that...
- That...

40
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,600
Can I order that latte?

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,570
Yes.

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,100
Five blueberry croissants,

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,500
and refill the soy milk.

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,900
If it's good, please leave a positive review.

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,170
Ming, go check

46
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,530
- if anyone hasn't ordered yet.
- OK.

47
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,329
Keep things orderly.

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,030
Junyi, are the crispy fries ready?

49
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,300
The 30th anniversary event.

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,700
The case about giving away toys with meal purchases.

51
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,630
Today's bid scores are out.

52
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,470
But...

53
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,329
Kang.

54
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,570
This vendor is very familiar with our family.

55
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,430
The owner is my father's friend.

56
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,200
This is the best one, right?

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
It was chosen by the selection committee.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,300
Then there's nothing to worry about.

59
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,800
The toy factory matter is simple.

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
First, help me think about

61
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,200
the temporary difference I mentioned to you last time.

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,430
How to bring this sub-brand to Japan.

63
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,970
I told my father about it,

64
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,400
and he immediately rejected it.

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,530
Help me figure out how to convince him.

66
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,070
Chairman, excuse me.

67
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,470
May I have a moment?

68
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,670
I wonder if you remember

69
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,200
the temporary assignment case.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
I've already rejected it.

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Chairman,

72
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,030
the VP probably hasn't had time

73
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,870
to show you these materials.

74
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,630
Since everyone has no objections

75
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,630
to this temporary assignment plan,

76
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,600
let's proceed with implementation.

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
I'll get ready right away.

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,430
I'll make sure the Japanese

79
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,430
eat our breakfast every day.

80
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,400
We don't need you for the expansion.

81
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,100
Jiang Zhihao,

82
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,800
you'll go to Japan.

83
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,670
But the temporary assignment case

84
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,000
was proposed by the VP.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,070
But you were the one who convinced me.

86
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,000
Let me see your execution ability,

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,130
if it's as strong as you claim.

88
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,170
Dad, expanding into the Japanese market

89
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,130
is a very important matter.

90
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,230
You have other things to take care of.

91
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Fine.

92
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,700
Shall we now discuss

93
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,100
the autumn special menu?

94
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,500
After getting the LinLin Breakfast Shop order,

95
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,730
I won't have to worry about money anymore.

96
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,030
Kang said

97
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,830
as long as you do a good job,

98
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,470
you'll get what you deserve.

99
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,470
Your father bribed

100
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,470
to help Lin Guangsheng's factory win the bid.

101
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,100
This kind of under-the-table dealing

102
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,400
almost caused LinLin Breakfast

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,500
to be associated with heavy metals.

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,930
We're selling breakfast,

105
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,630
the source of daily energy.

106
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,690
You've damaged our company's image.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,130
Do you think you still deserve to stay?

108
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,800
Kang,

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
what do you mean?

110
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,870
You should leave.

111
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,600
Didn't you say to text me for important matters

112
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,500
instead of video calling?

113
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,230
I've been so worried these days

114
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,490
and you won't tell me anything when I ask.

115
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,070
Are you okay?

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,930
You don't need to worry.

117
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,130
I've already taken care of his family.

118
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,330
They won't trace anything here.

119
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,270
I just can't help but worry.

120
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,400
Focus on your studies there.

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,700
I've got everything under control here.

122
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,430
Don't worry, okay?

123
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,830
Aren't you going on a business trip soon?

124
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,230
Is everything prepared?

125
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,670
You're a student now,

126
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,270
not my secretary.

127
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,030
I just told you and you've already forgotten.

128
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,270
Fine.

129
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,630
Go ahead and get ready then.

130
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,800
I won't bother you anymore.

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,700
Bye.

132
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,700
Bye-bye.

133
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,300
Everything is ready outside.

134
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,070
Is it OK?

135
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,030
All good?

136
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,570
Not really.

137
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,300
What's wrong?

138
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,770
Still nervous?

139
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,970
No, not at all.

140
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,600
You've arranged everything for me.

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,260
What would I be nervous about?

142
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,070
Don't worry.

143
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,170
The media reporters coming today

144
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,430
are all acquaintances of my mother.

145
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,270
They won't ask you any tough questions.

146
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,670
The coverage will definitely be positive.

147
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,600
Let's go.

148
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,400
Regarding this incident,

149
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,170
we are truly sorry.

150
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,100
In a moment, our Vice President

151
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,470
will provide further explanation.

152
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,430
This time, LinLin

153
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,930
used an unscrupulous chicken supplier,

154
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,670
disappointing our customers

155
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,400
who have supported LinLin Breakfast for so long.

156
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,299
We have already removed

157
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,929
all problematic products.

158
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,600
Today,

159
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,370
we also have a new initiative

160
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,500
that we'd like to share with everyone.

161
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,770
Here we have excellent local farmers.

162
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,170
We will use the highest quality ingredients

163
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,030
to provide brand new products.

164
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,570
For every purchase made by consumers,

165
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,400
we will donate 5% to charity

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,130
to give back to society.

167
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,530
Regarding the supplier issue,

168
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,630
and the oversights that occurred,

169
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,470
we have conducted an internal review.

170
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,770
We will launch a small farm initiative to give back to society.

171
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,370
We'll continue to support local agricultural products.

172
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,630
Basically not a single word was changed.

173
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,700
That's too much.

174
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,170
However,

175
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,600
he actually spoke

176
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
pretty well.

177
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,000
You should talk to your brother when you get a chance.

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Fashion is important.

179
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,700
He dresses like a driver.

180
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,760
It looks terrible.

181
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,870
Xie Jinghan is here too.

182
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,030
Xie Jinghan has been with the company for a long time.

183
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,090
Yes, that's right.

184
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,370
Let me ask you something.

185
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,070
Your brother's former secretary, Li Peizhen,

186
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,400
do you remember her?

187
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,400
Peizhen?

188
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,100
Of course I remember.

189
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,730
The pretty one, right?

190
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,370
What about her?

191
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,170
Between those two,

192
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,300
who's more important to your brother?

193
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,600
Peizhen and Jinghan?

194
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,130
I think Peizhen is more my brother's type.

195
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,630
You're good at sports.

196
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,330
Do you know how to take photos?

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,030
I asked you to help me ask again but you won't.

198
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,970
Don't you know that wedding venue owner?

199
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,530
No, I've already asked.

200
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,930
There's nothing. There's simply nothing.

201
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,900
Are you holding a grudge?

202
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,370
Because I didn't invite you to my wedding?

203
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,230
So you won't help me?

204
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,970
No, even if you invited me,

205
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,370
I still wouldn't know who that person is.

206
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,470
You could check the security footage.

207
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,600
You're the neighborhood chief.

208
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,070
No, I've already...

209
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,570
Excuse me, please.

210
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,000
Stop making a fuss.

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,570
I have a calligraphy class later.

212
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,730
Lin Liying.

213
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,670
Can you please help me, Chief?

214
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,600
I voted for you last time.

215
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,330
Fine, then vote for me next time.

216
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,470
What do you mean?

217
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,970
What exactly do you want?

218
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,700
Ding Huowang.

219
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,000
We've known each other for so many years.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
Can't you be more helpful?

221
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,900
Ding is actually not bad.

222
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,430
He became the neighborhood chief at such a young age.

223
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,230
Right?

224
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,630
He's quite handsome too.

225
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,070
Gentle and caring, isn't he?

226
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,270
Are you crazy?

227
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,700
You're the crazy one.

228
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,570
You say you only depended on Xiao Qian,

229
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,130
and didn't actually like him or whatever.

230
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,630
But then you immediately

231
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,800
find a new target.

232
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,100
I get it.

233
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,400
This is just transferring your affection, right?

234
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,130
But have you thought about...

235
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,900
Ding is our friend.

236
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,570
He's been single his entire life.

237
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,600
After you've healed from your heartbreak,

238
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,430
you'll dump him.

239
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,730
I feel bad for him already.

240
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,800
Jiang Zhihao.

241
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,070
Why are you being so mean?

242
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,030
Am I that kind of person?

243
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,270
If I choose Ding,

244
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,570
I'll stay with him properly.

245
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,530
OK then.

246
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,400
Great.

247
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,430
Congratulations.

248
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,930
Best wishes to you both.

249
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,770
Why are you scolding me?

250
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,170
Do you really think I'm that kind of person?

251
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,570
Don't you know you have a history?

252
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,630
When you broke up with Gao Bohan in college,

253
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,670
you immediately found someone else,

254
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,570
like Du Zhengzhe,

255
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,500
and that smart guy,

256
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,270
what's his name...

257
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,570
that top student,

258
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,130
Zeng Xianzhong.

259
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,230
Who?

260
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,200
You know,

261
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,970
that 'Ciao Ciao' guy.

262
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,830
The one who taught you to say 'Ciao Ciao.'

263
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,030
That's 'Ciao Ciao.'

264
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,330
Whatever.

265
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,300
How do you even remember his name?

266
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,630
How should I know?

267
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,170
The past is the past,

268
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,730
and now is now.

269
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,130
Right now,

270
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,430
all I want is to find

271
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,490
the person who ruined my engagement.

272
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,930
I'm looking for Ding

273
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,800
because he's the neighborhood chief.

274
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,330
He probably knows a lot of people

275
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,530
and might help me find some

276
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,800
useful security footage.

277
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,070
So you're not after Ding.

278
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,330
Why don't you just die?

279
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,600
But didn't you say

280
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,100
you were quite grateful to that person?

281
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,200
My mom reminded me,

282
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,300
look at what this person did.

283
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,700
Why didn't they say it to our face?

284
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,870
What were they really up to?

285
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,200
Why did they do this

286
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,800
and embarrass our whole family?

287
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,930
Well...

288
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,400
Did Ding find that person?

289
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,770
Yes.

290
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,230
We found some surveillance footage,

291
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,030
but none of them captured this person.

292
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,130
Seems pretty clever.

293
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,830
I must find him

294
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,670
and ask him face to face.

295
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,800
Why were you so angry just now?

296
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,770
I don't know why I got so angry either.

297
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,200
I really don't know what my dad is thinking.

298
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,670
Deng Weikang's small farm project

299
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,670
is clearly full of holes,

300
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,000
yet he's still so proud of it.

301
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,470
What's the problem?

302
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,830
I didn't study marketing.

303
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,600
You're so good at it,

304
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,070
can't you teach me?

305
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,130
His small farm project

306
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,700
fails just on cost control alone.

307
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,800
Really?

308
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,600
Why don't you just tell your dad directly?

309
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,100
Wouldn't that prove you're better than Deng Weikang?

310
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
My dad only has eyes for him.

311
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,830
If I stand out too much,

312
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,570
it will only annoy him.

313
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,600
So you're willing to spend your whole life

314
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,900
at Linlin Breakfast,

315
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,770
working under your brother?

316
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,330
Do you think with my abilities

317
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,430
I should be Deng Weikang's subordinate forever?

318
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,230
Tell me.

319
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,370
You see things clearly as an outsider.

320
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,300
Between me and Deng Weikang,

321
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,530
who do you think should take over Linlin Breakfast?

322
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,170
I'm not your dad.

323
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,930
Why are you asking me this?

324
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,730
We're best friends,

325
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,500
of course I hope you take over.

326
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,530
I almost forgot to wish you a nice trip.

327
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,830
Aren't you going

328
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,470
on vacation in a few days?

329
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,500
Yes.

330
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,570
With your boyfriend?

331
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,670
What boyfriend?

332
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,730
My youth and time

333
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,570
have all been dedicated to your family's Linlin Breakfast.

334
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,100
Actually,

335
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,200
I think Deng Weijie has a point.

336
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,030
Listen,

337
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,400
small farmers have higher costs,

338
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,730
and their profits are naturally more limited.

339
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,200
So you agree with her?

340
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,130
Of course not.

341
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,300
I'm trying to help you find solutions.

342
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,930
Do you know why my sister always fails?

343
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,000
Because she's always hesitating and lacks courage.

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
This plan is just a diversion.

345
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,599
Once the noise dies down,

346
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,829
we can just cancel the small farmers program.

347
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,170
But... okay.

348
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,099
Let's not talk about this anymore.

349
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,569
I'm tired.

350
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,300
You should go home and rest too.

351
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,130
So my thoughts don't matter at all.

352
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,570
You just want to know what Deng Weijie is thinking

353
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,770
and if she's planning to go against you.

354
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,100
Why are you bringing this up?

355
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,570
Then why can't we go public?

356
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,800
What are you worried about?

357
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,470
Here you go again.

358
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,000
The truth is,

359
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,300
you're just afraid that Deng Weijie is better than you.

360
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,500
You're just using me to keep tabs on her.

361
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,970
Xie Jinghan.

362
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,630
Jinghan.

363
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,430
Alright, don't be angry.

364
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,800
Let's not fight about this every time.

365
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,600
Don't be upset.

366
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,000
Give me a kiss.

367
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,470
Uncle Zhou is actually quite nice.

368
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,270
He listened to everything I said

369
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and will report to my father later.

370
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,660
Why don't we meet tonight to discuss it further?

371
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,400
Let's go to that place.

372
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,930
Sure, that works.

373
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,930
Okay, see you tonight.

374
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,400
Bye.

375
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,270
Weiyu, you're still working overtime?

376
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,370
Let's do it tomorrow. They've turned off the AC.

377
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,300
Weiyu.

378
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,700
Could you grab the event materials for me?

379
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,770
Sure.

380
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,370
Could that be Xie Jinghan?

381
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,930
This belongs to my brother.

382
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,830
Do you have anything on Xie Jinghan?

383
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,700
In the same place.

384
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,070
Sister Peng.

385
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm going to Japan in a few days.

386
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,000
Would you like me to buy something for you?

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,830
You're going to Japan?

388
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,800
Are you going to visit your mother?

389
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,070
Ms. Wang will be so happy to see you.

390
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,830
I remember she loves pineapple cakes.

391
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,500
I'll go buy some right away.

392
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,170
You must bring them to her.

393
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,500
You're going back to Japan?

394
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,830
To visit my mom

395
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,100
and take care of some business.

396
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,500
Your mom lives in Japan?

397
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,770
Yes,

398
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,200
I used to live in Japan with her.

399
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,300
So is your mom Japanese?

400
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,970
Do I look like it?

401
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,130
Every time I see you,

402
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,270
I can't stop

403
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:40,370
thinking about that moment,

404
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,630
I don't want to

405
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,300
say goodbye now.

406
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,230
I won't say goodbye.

407
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,030
Thanks for coming today.

408
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,200
Okay, thanks. See you next time.

409
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,770
Zhilu,

410
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,500
come straight home after work.

411
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,630
I know.

412
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,000
Bye.

413
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,230
Weiyu,

414
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,000
bring me back a souvenir, okay?

415
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,170
Zhilu,

416
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,000
I finally found you.

417
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,530
Did you think

418
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,630
you could hide from me?

419
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,800
I forgot my phone.

420
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,330
Go get it yourself. My car is coming.

421
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,570
Okay, thanks. Take care.

422
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,770
Bye.

423
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,270
Don't think that quitting your job

424
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,970
means you can get away with

425
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,270
seducing my husband.

426
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,470
I've told you a hundred times,

427
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,200
I didn't seduce your husband.

428
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,330
Then what's this?

429
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,730
A loan agreement. What else?

430
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,830
If you weren't

431
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,130
flirting with him at the office,

432
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,570
would he casually lend you 500,000?

433
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,730
What's going on?

434
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,670
Mom, it's nothing.

435
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,000
I can handle this myself.

436
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,230
You can handle it?

437
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,130
You've already handled it your way.

438
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,300
Tell me,

439
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,170
when are you going to pay me back?

440
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,300
Tomorrow at 10 at the company entrance.

441
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,100
I'll bring you the money.

442
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,730
You better pay up tomorrow.

443
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,870
Yeah right.

444
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,630
You think my lady is easy to bully?

445
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,570
She said she'll pay tomorrow.

446
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,430
What more do you want?

447
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,270
But what if she...

448
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,600
What if? What do you mean?

449
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,100
You already know she works here.

450
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,430
Don't you?

451
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,160
Our place has a minimum charge.

452
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Pay up.

453
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,070
Don't look so glum.

454
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,900
There's nothing in this world that can't be solved.

455
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,300
Do you need an advance?

456
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,400
It's okay, Mom.

457
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,070
I can handle it myself. Thanks.

458
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,900
Then stop slacking off

459
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
and help me attend to the customers.

460
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Zhilu, where are you going so early?

461
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,430
Nowhere special.

462
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,300
I saved you some breakfast.

463
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,130
Lucky you.

464
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,770
I have an upset stomach today,

465
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,500
that's why I'm giving it to you.

466
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,030
Is it good?

467
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,930
I'll take it with me.

468
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,830
Zhilu.

469
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,370
Enjoy my breakfast,

470
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,030
stay energetic!

471
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,730
I couldn't explain properly yesterday,

472
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,100
so today I'm going to make things clear.

473
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,830
First,

474
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,700
I did not seduce your husband.

475
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,130
I have zero interest in him.

476
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,970
Second,

477
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,470
please stop coming to my workplace

478
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,370
and harassing me.

479
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,570
If you come again, I'll call the police.

480
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,070
Here's 50,000.

481
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,470
I'll pay the rest in installments.

482
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,230
Not a penny less.

483
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,830
Zhilu, how dare you!

484
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,960
There's only 50,000 in this envelope.

485
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,630
It's missing a zero!

486
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,530
Are you kidding me?

487
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,200
The IOU doesn't specify

488
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,130
that I can't pay in installments,

489
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,330
nor does it set a repayment deadline.

490
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,600
This is all I have right now.

491
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,170
Take it or leave it.

492
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Zhilu.

493
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,130
What?

494
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,600
You still claim you're not having an affair with my husband?

495
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,470
He just lent you 500,000 like that?

496
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,900
Nothing comes that easy in this world!

497
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,870
Maybe your husband thinks I'm pretty,

498
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,800
so he lent me the money.

499
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
If you don't pay me back today,

500
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,770
I'll sue you for home-wrecking.

501
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,830
Zhilu.

502
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,870
Ma'am.

503
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,870
Could you please be more polite

504
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,370
to my girlfriend?

505
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,030
She's your girlfriend?

506
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,430
Do you know what she's done?

507
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,370
Her business is my business.

508
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,270
I know everything about Zhilu.

509
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,370
Then do you know

510
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,470
she owes me 500,000?

511
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,670
Of course I know.

512
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,830
That's why I'm here to pay for her.

513
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,290
Yifei, what are you doing?

514
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,270
This is my family's tea house.

515
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,300
Please don't bother my girlfriend anymore.

516
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,900
Come to me instead, OK?

517
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,030
There's an ATM outside.

518
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,800
Let's go out now,

519
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,700
and I'll transfer the money to you right away.

520
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,600
Yifei, this isn't your business.

521
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,770
Sit down.

522
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,200
Come,

523
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,400
wait for me.

524
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,230
Wait for me!

525
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,970
Wait!

526
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,300
Finally resolved.

527
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,100
That woman was your former supervisor?

528
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,670
She talks too much

529
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,530
and is incredibly mean.

530
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,770
Why did you come?

531
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,130
Well, I just...

532
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,330
had a meeting with

533
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,430
a supplier.

534
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,470
They wanted to buy tea from our family.

535
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,370
Yifei,

536
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,330
do you know it's obvious when you're lying?

537
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm not lying!

538
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,570
It's true...

539
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,930
I was destined to rescue you this time.

540
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,330
How much longer are you going to keep this act up?

541
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,800
No one's here. Strange, isn't it?

542
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,030
They changed the location last minute.

543
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,700
How could they change it so suddenly?

544
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,770
Oh no.

545
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,100
Alright, I should get going.

546
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,230
The vendor needs to see me.

547
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,800
I'll head out first.

548
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,430
Let's talk later.

549
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,630
Niu Yifei.

550
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,970
I'll definitely pay you back the money I owe.

551
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,870
Don't worry about it.

552
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,000
Bye.

553
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,030
Welcome.

554
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,970
Hello, miss.

555
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,630
How can I help you?

556
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,330
I'd like to buy coffee as a gift.

557
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,130
But I don't know how to choose.

558
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,830
I see.

559
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,130
So his age is...

560
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,900
About the same as mine.

561
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,100
That day was okay.

562
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,000
Good thing you told me

563
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,300
what the situation was like.

564
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,070
You know when I arrived at the scene.

565
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,370
Wait.

566
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:14,970
Okay.

567
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,430
Wait, let me go first.

568
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,870
Then I shouted at her.

569
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,130
Made a cool entrance.

570
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,170
She was totally scared.

571
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,900
She asked me who I was.

572
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,500
I said,

573
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm Zhilu's boyfriend.

574
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,800
Can you get to the point?

575
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,070
In the end, it was all sorted out.

576
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,730
Save me.

577
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,570
I'm dead too.

578
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,830
You gave me 500,000 then

579
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,400
and I transferred it right away.

580
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,170
But why did you suddenly have so much money?

581
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,730
Can you please focus on the game

582
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,370
and stop asking so many questions?

583
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,870
Fine, I'm just curious.

584
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,430
When Zhilu got in trouble,

585
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,670
why didn't you step in to help her yourself?

586
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,730
If Zhilu didn't tell me,

587
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,390
she must have had her reasons.

588
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,830
Your logic is weird.

589
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,270
If Zhilu didn't tell you,

590
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,870
how did you know?

591
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,900
Your logic is the problem.

592
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,960
I'm her brother. How could I not know?

593
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,830
Okay, you go first.

594
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,600
Don't jump yet.

595
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,770
Jump straight in.

596
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,370
Say thanks to Yifei.

597
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,130
(Niu Yifei)

598
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,790
Grandma, dinner's ready!

599
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,700
Why did you cook so much?

600
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,430
Someone has a birthday today.

601
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,600
A birthday is just one day.

602
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,500
There are only three of us.

603
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,200
What if we can't finish it?

604
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
If only your father were here too.

605
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:55,470
Happy birthday to you.

606
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,030
Happy birthday, Grandma Hongzhu.

607
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,000
Happy birthday.

608
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,870
Did Liying ask you to come?

609
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,530
Grandma,

610
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,630
I remember your birthday very clearly.

611
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,170
What does it have to do with Liying?

612
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,970
Can't I wish you happy birthday?

613
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,930
Quick, make three wishes at once.

614
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,500
One shouldn't be too greedy in life.

615
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,670
I only have one wish.

616
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,530
Happy birthday.

617
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,270
Grandma, what did you wish for?

618
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,600
If I tell you, it won't come true.

619
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,400
She wished for Dad to come home soon.

620
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,670
My wish is...

621
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,300
You,

622
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,400
find yourself a good man

623
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,100
and get married soon.

624
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,870
Me.

625
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,830
I'm perfectly fine on my own.

626
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,200
Why should I rush to find a man and get married?

627
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,970
There's one more dish.

628
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,900
Don't run away.

629
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,630
There's another dish.

630
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,670
Stay and have dinner with us.

631
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,800
Grandma, not now.

632
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,630
I don't know if Aunt Xueqing welcomes me.

633
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,500
You know about her and my mom.

634
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,330
I'd better leave now.

635
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,870
She should be back soon.

636
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,170
It's my birthday today. I'm in charge!

637
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,870
I can invite whoever I want.

638
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,370
The garbage truck is here.

639
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,000
Let me help you.

640
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,030
This...

641
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,130
Thanks for just now.

642
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,400
No need to thank me for taking out the trash.

643
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,300
I'm thanking you because Grandma is happy.

644
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,300
There's something.

645
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,600
Mr. Guang.

646
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,500
Dad.

647
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,070
Dad.

648
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,470
Dad.

649
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,770
Lin Liying, get in the car.

650
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,400
Mr. Guang.

651
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,800
Ride carefully.

652
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,100
Dad.

653
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,230
Lin Guangsheng.

654
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,530
Hurry up.

655
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,930
Mr. Guang.

656
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,400
Dad.

657
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,570
Mr. Guang, slow down.

658
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,070
Be careful.

659
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,300
Hurry up.

660
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,770
I'm already rushing.

661
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,870
Lin Guangsheng.

662
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,630
Is it nice to have your daughter chasing you like this?

663
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,270
Lin Liying, hold on tight.

664
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,530
We're not going to do anything to you.

665
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,870
Look, everyone's faster than you. Guang...

666
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,930
Wait a moment, safety first.

667
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,830
Mr. Guang... Dad.

668
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,630
Mr. Guang is over there.

669
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:18,900
Be careful.

670
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,600
This is dangerous... Dad.

671
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,270
Lin Guangsheng.

672
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,400
Lin Liying.

673
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,870
Or do you want a drink?

674
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,530
In broad daylight?

675
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,670
Sure.

676
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,630
You'll drink whatever I give you.

677
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,830
Why ask such a stupid question?

678
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,429
At least you've seen him, right?

679
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,770
He's still alive and well in this world.

680
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,230
Don't be upset anymore.

681
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,090
We need to go back to have dinner with Grandma later.

682
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,670
So he still remembers Grandma's birthday.

683
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,699
Coming back to see her.

684
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,370
Wanting to know how we're doing.

685
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,469
I also want to know how he's doing.

686
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,969
Have you ever thought about

687
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:55,630
why Mr. Guang left home?

688
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,700
He has no sense of responsibility.

689
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,370
Dumping everything on us.

690
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,370
Leaving debts for the whole family.

691
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,830
If that's what you think,

692
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,200
then do your mom and grandma

693
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,970
think the same way?

694
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,300
Would Mr. Guang dare to come back then?

695
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,230
I'm not defending him.

696
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,470
Look,

697
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,200
sometimes people are just like this.

698
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,730
Right?

699
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,570
You suddenly act on impulse

700
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,130
and make a decision.

701
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,430
But after you've done it,

702
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,070
you might think

703
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,200
there were other options.

704
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,800
But what can you do when it's already done?

705
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,730
There are people like that, right?

706
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm really not trying to defend him.

707
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,470
I'm defending myself.

708
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,300
I mean,

709
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,100
I'm speaking for myself.

710
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,830
It was me.

711
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,530
What was you?

712
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,600
On your engagement day,

713
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,970
that audio recording

714
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,430
and that secret video,

715
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,160
I was the one who released them.

716
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,870
I'm running out of time.

717
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,600
What else can I do?

718
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,800
You have such poor judgment about people, right?

719
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,430
I can't wait until after you're engaged

720
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,330
to tell you.

721
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,170
Right?

722
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,630
Jiang Zhihao.

723
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,270
Do you think my life isn't ridiculous enough?

724
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,570
I don't think that way.

725
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,570
Lin Liying.

726
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,970
[Face hit]

727
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,770
She's pretty hot, right?

728
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,770
Who?

729
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,230
Lin Liying.

730
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,870
Let me tell you.

731
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,600
I will definitely win her over.

732
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,400
Lin Liying.

733
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,570
Yeah.

734
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,300
Senior, let me tell you.

735
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,730
We're neighbors.

736
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,070
She's mean and has no class.

737
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,070
She's just a tomboy.

738
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,300
And the key point is...

739
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,130
Her feet stink.

740
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,530
It's disgusting, you know?

741
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,830
Alright, I get it.

742
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,270
So give up this idea.

743
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,830
You won't be happy with her.

744
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,700
Senior.

745
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,900
But when a girl hits this hard...

746
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,430
does it hurt?

747
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,930
Give up, senior.

748
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,400
[Reveal]

749
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,370
Jiang Zhihao.

750
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,600
This is for you.

751
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,170
Why are you suddenly treating me?

752
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,200
Then I'll take it back.

753
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,030
I want it.

754
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,100
I'm in a good mood.

755
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,530
What happened to you?

756
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,900
Say something.

757
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,370
I'm eating the pearls.

758
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,170
Here he comes.

759
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,070
Senior.

760
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
You haven't told him yet.

761
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,200
I don't know how to say it.

762
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,870
What are you guys trying to tell me?

763
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,630
We're together now.

764
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,000
You're the first to know.

765
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,270
What? You two are together?

766
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,900
When did this happen?

767
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,770
Why do you care so much?

768
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,930
No, wait.

769
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,970
Jiang Zhihao, what are you smiling at?

770
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,530
Congratulations to you both.

771
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,900
Let me take a photo for you.

772
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,700
Let's take a picture then. Sure.

773
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,070
Take a good one.

774
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,800
It's our first photo together.

775
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,730
Lin Liying, smile.

776
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,900
Give me a smile.

777
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,170
How about this?

778
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,300
Is this okay?

779
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,400
Lin Liying, smile more happily.

780
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,700
How about now?

781
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm just going abroad to study.

782
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,170
It doesn't mean we're breaking up.

783
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,370
And I'll come back anyway.

784
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,700
Why did you wait until it was confirmed to tell me?

785
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,330
You know very well

786
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,100
how important this school is to me.

787
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,270
Something as important as studying abroad,

788
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,370
why are you only telling me now?

789
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,470
I'm your girlfriend!

790
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,030
I told you as soon as I confirmed it.

791
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,170
You can't go.

792
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:46,770
After I graduate,

793
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,170
we can go together. Isn't that okay?

794
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,970
By then, my opportunity will be gone.

795
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,830
Can't you think about me for once?

796
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,570
Making a scene.

797
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,600
Being unreasonable.

798
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,230
Let me tell you

799
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,000
what making a scene really means.

800
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,170
This is making a scene. You're making a scene!

801
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,870
That hurts!

802
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,070
From the very first day we were together,

803
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,800
I've been making scenes.

804
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,030
It really hurts!

805
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,430
Lin Liying.

806
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,970
Lin Liying.

807
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,970
You don't need to feel so wronged.

808
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,530
In this world,

809
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,830
there must be someone who loves you.

810
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,800
Maybe he's right beside you.

811
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,870
That person is...

812
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,970
me.

813
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,800
What are you writing?

814
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,970
What are you doing?

815
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,270
What are you doing?

816
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,200
Why are you drawing me?

817
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,170
What do you mean?

818
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,830
Where's Zhihao?

819
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,930
He has a wonderful girlfriend now.

820
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,200
I liked you before Gao Bohan did.

821
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,860
I've liked you for a long time.

822
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,030
Actually, we've been together for 3 years.

823
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,400
Why didn't you tell me?

824
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,070
It seems our relationship

825
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,600
is already known by others.

826
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,270
You're not even my biological child.

827
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,100
If I had sent you to an orphanage back then,

828
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,070
you might have had a better life than now.

829
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,400
Jiang Zhihao, don't you know how to knock?

830
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,000
If this were following K-drama pacing,

831
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,400
this would be episode 8,

832
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,130
and we'd be kissing in the next moment.
