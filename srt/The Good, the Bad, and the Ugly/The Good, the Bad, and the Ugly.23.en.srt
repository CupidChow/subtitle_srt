1
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,970
I've finished drawing.

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,670
Does anyone want one?

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,430
My hero coupon? What's that?

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,600
I want one. Wait a second.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,000
Everyone gets one.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,800
Give me one.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,200
Here you go.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,230
Lin Liying, this is for you.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,430
Hero Coupon.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,170
Great Hero Jiang Zhihao,

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,270
please save me.

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,330
What the hell?

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,200
Just keep it.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,530
You'll need it someday.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,400
Have you finished writing?

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,300
Hurry up and write.

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,500
What? I'm writing already.

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,270
Hurry up!

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,370
How do you write the character for 'hero'?

20
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,230
It's already written up there.

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,330
Great Hero Jiang Zhihao, please save me.

22
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,330
I accidentally scratched my dad's car.

23
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,830
If he finds out, I'm dead.

24
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,530
Number 3, Chen Zhongwei.

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,030
Why is your child so naughty?

26
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,630
Scratching my car like this.

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,170
I'm so sorry.

28
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,900
I truly apologize.

29
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,599
Please check how much the paint job will cost.

30
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,200
I'll compensate you for it.

31
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,289
Hurry up and apologize to the car.

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,200
As you know,

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,530
children are always a bit mischievous.

34
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,230
I know a car shop

35
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,530
that can definitely make

36
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,260
your car look beautiful again.

37
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,470
Also, I see your car...

38
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,330
Great Hero Jiang Zhihao,

39
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,770
I hope you'll take Monday off

40
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,100
so I can be on cleaning duty

41
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,600
with Wang Congming.

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,470
Thanks,

43
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,330
Class Beauty Lai Minghui.

44
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,270
Hello, Mr. Wu.

45
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry,

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,330
Jiang Zhihao needs to take a day off today.

47
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,930
Great Hero Jiang Zhihao,

48
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,170
please save me.

49
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,570
Be my bodyguard

50
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,130
and escort me home.

51
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,729
By Diyifei.

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,729
Shorty Fei.

53
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go play video games.

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,330
I'm busy today.

55
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,530
It's fine if you don't come,

56
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,830
but give us money.

57
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,030
You guys,

58
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,930
extorting kids

59
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,030
and bullying those smaller than you.

60
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,500
I won't let you bully my friend.

61
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,160
You're being quite arrogant.

62
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,800
You deserve this.

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,600
Stop it!

64
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,430
Try acting tough now.

65
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,870
Stop pretending to be a hero.

66
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you doing?

67
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Which bastard hit my son?

68
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,470
Jiang Zhihao.

69
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,600
Mom.

70
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
How many times have I told you

71
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
not to play the hero?

72
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,100
Look at you now. You're more like a coward than a hero.

73
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,230
A son who makes his mother worry

74
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,630
is no great hero at all.

75
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,829
Niu Yifei.

76
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,630
Stop pretending. Niu Yifei, let's go home.

77
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,370
Get up.

78
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,400
Niu Yifei.

79
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,570
Niu Yifei.

80
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,600
Niu Yifei.

81
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,430
Niu Yifei.

82
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,570
Yifei.

83
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,600
He said

84
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,630
I was the one who provoked the Deng family.

85
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,170
It was all my fault.

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,130
He's always been a busybody since he was little.

87
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,500
Acting like everything is his business.

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Do you remember when he was a kid,

89
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,670
how he loved playing that hero game?

90
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,930
In the end, it was always my mom

91
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,570
who had to clean up his mess.

92
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,390
But only my mom could keep him in line.

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,730
Sometimes I think,

94
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,300
he's so immature,

95
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,630
he should stay single forever.

96
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,430
Whoever ends up with him is in for trouble.

97
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,030
I'm that unfortunate one.

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,800
Your smile is too genuine. Sorry.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,970
Congratulations to you both.

100
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,530
I thought it was over between you two.

101
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,870
What about you?

102
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,430
Drinking so much every day.

103
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,530
Are you okay?

104
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,600
We broke up.

105
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,670
Lin Liying,

106
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,830
I just realized

107
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,630
we've known each other for so long,

108
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,630
but we've never really had drinks together like this.

109
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,590
Because we didn't have common problems.

110
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,630
Cheers.

111
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,730
Men.

112
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,530
Welcome.

113
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,070
Welcome.

114
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,530
Is it neighbors' night today?

115
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes, first time.

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,930
I'm looking for Lulu.

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,130
Niu Yifei,

118
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,230
I'm leaving.

119
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,300
You two talk.

120
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,070
Okay.

121
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,200
Won't you have a few more drinks?

122
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,230
No thanks. I've had too much.

123
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,870
Bye, Liying.

124
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,970
Bye.

125
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,730
What are you doing here?

126
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,530
I just...

127
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,370
I...

128
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,970
Don't tell me you're here to keep me company.

129
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,200
I'll have my mom put you on her blacklist.

130
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,770
No, no.

131
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,270
It's not because of you.

132
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,170
Look.

133
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,200
I found this.

134
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,130
A love letter.

135
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,900
I was just talking about this with Lin Liying.

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,860
Why are you giving me this?

137
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,430
Well,

138
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,130
I think if Jiang Zhihao continues like this,

139
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,630
it's not going to work.

140
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,900
He's always helped me before,

141
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,600
now I want to help him.

142
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,170
Jiang Zhihao loves saving others.

143
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,600
I thought if we could let him be a hero again,

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,430
he'd be full of life again.

145
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,700
So?

146
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,830
That's Lin Liying's glass.

147
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,370
I like you.

148
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,070
I want to pursue you.

149
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,100
What?

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,070
Jiang Zhihao.

151
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,470
Jiang Zhihao.

152
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,870
Can you tell Niu Yifei

153
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,670
to stop bothering me?

154
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,970
It's one thing that he pesters me every day,

155
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,370
but he even comes to my workplace

156
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,170
to confess his feelings.

157
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,470
Can't he see I'm not interested in him?

158
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,100
Can you please handle this?

159
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,530
Why is Niu Yifei here too?

160
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,000
Dad wanted to treat him to some normal food.

161
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,130
Zhilu.

162
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,169
If you don't mind,

163
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,770
I tonight... I do mind.

164
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,430
No, it's not like that.

165
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,400
We've known each other for so long.

166
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,130
You know my life is simple.

167
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,030
I'm not some weirdo

168
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,530
or a bad person.

169
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,500
So what I'm saying is,

170
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,100
if we could go on three dates,

171
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,000
and if you really don't like me after that,

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I won't bother you anymore.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,900
I wouldn't even go on 0.3 dates.

174
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,970
Mr. Jiang.

175
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,630
Actually,

176
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,570
to be honest,

177
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,530
Yifei isn't a bad guy.

178
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,500
Right?

179
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,830
Besides,

180
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,600
he

181
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,270
owns a tea house.

182
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,130
If you two got together,

183
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,630
your future would be secure.

184
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,430
And yes,

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,300
he might not be handsome enough,

186
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,070
but you're beautiful.

187
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,330
Your future children

188
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,300
will probably not be too ugly.

189
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,570
Besides, you're

190
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,670
not getting any younger.

191
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,470
Having a partner

192
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,030
would put my mind at ease.

193
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,630
It's not like I can't support myself.

194
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,560
Why should I settle for someone...

195
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,470
someone I have no feelings for?

196
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,230
I just don't like him.

197
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,030
But you see,

198
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,170
feelings

199
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,600
can be developed.

200
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Just give him a chance.

201
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,400
Right? You

202
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,900
should give him a chance.

203
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,170
Yes.

204
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,400
I'd like to take this opportunity,

205
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
with Mr. Jiang here

206
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,700
and Zhihao present,

207
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,970
to formally announce

208
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,700
that I want to pursue Zhilu with marriage in mind.

209
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,670
What nonsense are you talking about?

210
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,700
Jiang Zhilu,

211
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,770
I've never had big ambitions in life,

212
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,330
so my advantage is

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,900
I can make you the center of my life.

214
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,100
Whatever you want to do is fine.

215
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,400
You are my sun,

216
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
and orbiting around you makes me happy.

217
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,400
Good.

218
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,970
Jiang Zhihao,

219
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,070
Zhihao,

220
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,030
Zhihao.

221
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,170
Jiang Zhilu isn't that fragile.

222
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,130
Niu Yifei isn't that strong either.

223
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,630
If you want to reject him,

224
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,870
don't be so hurtful with your words.

225
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,630
Dad,

226
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,870
stop playing along with them.

227
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,830
I...

228
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,330
Actually, if you're all doing well,

229
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,830
then I'm doing well too.

230
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,230
Can I stand up now?

231
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,030
I'll put the money in myself.

232
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,530
Great, thanks.

233
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,630
I'm off to work.

234
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,600
It's late. Let me walk you home.

235
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,030
You don't need to pretend anymore.

236
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,300
We've been found out.

237
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,170
Sorry about earlier.

238
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,830
I was so harsh to you.

239
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,830
It's fine.

240
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,130
I'm the one who asked for your help.

241
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,730
I knew you were acting.

242
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,770
But your performance was great.

243
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,970
Your death stare was intense.

244
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,970
I was so scared I almost

245
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,300
didn't know what to say.

246
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,470
Come on.

247
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,670
I work at a hotel.

248
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,870
Acting skills are standard equipment.

249
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,090
Alright, I'm heading to work now.

250
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
Actually,

251
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,930
I know how you feel about me.

252
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,970
It seems everyone knows.

253
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,100
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,030
It's always so obvious.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,730
No need to be sorry.

256
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,230
I know.

257
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,830
I'm very likable,

258
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,330
pretty and cute.

259
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,870
Probably everyone loves me.

260
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,670
So,

261
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,930
thank you for liking me.

262
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,200
I've heard

263
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,870
when someone says 'thank you' to a confession,

264
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,530
it means rejection.

265
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,500
Actually,

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,600
I think we don't need to do anything special

267
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,270
for Jiang Zhihao.

268
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,600
He'll get over it himself.

269
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
I was going to say

270
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,230
we could kill two birds with one stone,

271
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,500
and help distract you at the same time.

272
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,770
Help me with what?

273
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,600
You must be feeling bad too.

274
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm going to work now.

275
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,370
Don't walk me out.

276
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,770
I'll hail a cab up ahead.

277
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,230
Bye.

278
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,570
Let me tell you this time,

279
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,270
we're finally here.

280
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,030
This is

281
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,400
Deng Weikang, the eldest son of Linlin Breakfast Shop.

282
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,270
Hello.

283
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,800
Yes, please sit.

284
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,230
Your company Baiwu is doing great now.

285
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,930
Getting listed on the market.

286
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,830
Must be busy, right?

287
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,600
I'll introduce you when there's a chance

288
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,030
to our other partners

289
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,000
and investors.

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,270
My brother and I

291
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,770
have some plans

292
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,230
that we believe will make money.

293
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,930
Are you interested?

294
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,200
Want to hear about it?

295
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Of course I am.

296
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Here.

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,070
Drink up. Thanks.

298
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,270
Cheers. Thank you.

299
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,600
Yes.

300
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
You can bring it to me after work.

301
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,570
It's fine. No rush.

302
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,100
Come back after your shift.

303
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,630
That's ridiculous.

304
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,230
Hello.

305
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,830
Manager, excuse me.

306
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,890
The Deputy Director wants to see you.

307
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,100
The meat sauce noodles have no meat.

308
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,500
The milk tea has no milk flavor.

309
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,970
And there was wire in the teppanyaki noodles.

310
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,800
These customer complaints are being handled too slowly.

311
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,530
What are we posting on social media?

312
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,730
All the comments below are complaints.

313
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,170
This customer service might as well not exist.

314
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,300
We're understaffed.

315
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,900
My team is already working overtime every day.

316
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,370
We simply can't handle everything.

317
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,030
I know they're working overtime every day,

318
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,890
but you seem to be leaving early quite often lately.

319
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,030
Why?

320
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,400
Letting my staff handle things on their own

321
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,330
is the real way to lead a team,

322
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,330
isn't that right, Deputy Director?

323
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,860
Where are you going?

324
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,300
Back to work,

325
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,030
or you'll say customer service is useless again.

326
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,230
Sister Peng.

327
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,730
Weiyu, you're back.

328
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,030
You're cooking?

329
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,230
I'm making something for you to eat.

330
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,660
Why are you wearing a wrist brace?

331
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,300
My hand

332
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,200
hurts so much I can't sleep at night.

333
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,800
That serious?

334
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
The doctor says

335
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,569
if I don't have surgery soon,

336
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,930
my hand will be useless.

337
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,599
Let me contact a doctor at Qi University Hospital for you.

338
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,859
You should go see them.

339
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,069
Even with surgery,

340
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,569
I won't be able to work like I do now.

341
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,030
I have to accept I'm getting old.

342
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,770
I'll tell the Chairman in a few days

343
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,130
that I plan to retire and go back to my hometown.

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Sister Peng told me

345
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,970
she's planning to retire.

346
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,070
We've lived together for so many years,

347
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,100
she's like family to us.

348
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,000
I never thought all good things must truly come to an end.

349
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,330
Are you okay?

350
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,970
It's just retirement,

351
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,900
not like we'll never see her again.

352
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,930
In this family,

353
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,630
it seems really hard to tell

354
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,430
the difference between scheming

355
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,730
and genuine care.

356
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,770
I truly care about you.

357
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,630
Just say what you want to say.

358
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,770
There's something.

359
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,830
I need a three-month leave.

360
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,570
I want to travel abroad.

361
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,330
If I have time,

362
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,970
I'll see what else I can do.

363
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,500
Three months is too long.

364
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,770
I won't approve it.

365
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,130
It doesn't matter.

366
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,430
If you don't approve,

367
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,230
I'll just quit.

368
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,900
What do you mean?

369
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,270
Don't you understand?

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,470
The company matters.

371
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,670
I don't care anymore.

372
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,070
How can you not care?

373
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,100
Aren't you tired?

374
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,170
Why don't you travel abroad too?

375
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,800
Take some time to reflect.

376
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,370
Think about why you've achieved everything,

377
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,200
yet you're still so unhappy.

378
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,360
Could it be that what you're pursuing now

379
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,430
isn't what you really want?

380
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,870
Think it over carefully.

381
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,100
Get some rest early.

382
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,230
That was fun. Thank you for coming.

383
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,100
Thanks for having me.

384
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,630
Thank you very much. Thanks for coming. Please visit again.

385
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm sorry, we were just-

386
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,330
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,200
I should have respected your thoughts.

388
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,700
All these days, you didn't want to

389
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
contact me at all?

390
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,130
When two people are together,

391
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,500
conflicts and disagreements are bound to happen.

392
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,570
How could you ignore me like this?

393
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,030
Please.

394
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,700
Be careful.

395
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,270
So I'd like to explain to you

396
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,730
my original intention and goals for opening this bakery,

397
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,190
as well as my future plans.

398
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,400
So that someone who is very different from me,

399
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,100
my future life partner,

400
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,700
can understand me better

401
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,230
and feel more secure walking forward with me.

402
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,470
Then I'll start my presentation.

403
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,530
For the first point,

404
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,230
the most important thing is rebuilding our brand.

405
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,800
Since we're starting from scratch,

406
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,700
regarding consumers,

407
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,200
I've also contacted many suppliers I haven't worked with before.

408
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,670
I have some leads, but still...

409
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,030
I'm sorry, I-

410
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,070
I'm really a bit nervous.

411
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,030
But if you have any questions during the presentation,

412
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,030
you can ask me right away,

413
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,730
and I'll answer immediately.

414
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,530
I have a question.

415
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,530
Yes?

416
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,230
Does this report

417
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,470
include anything about Scotland?

418
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,860
This is really quite nice.

419
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,800
How cold do you think this refrigerator is?

420
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,570
For our second stop,

421
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,070
let's go to France.

422
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,300
France... would you like to go?

423
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,270
The Louvre.

424
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,930
Let's go to the Louvre.

425
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,870
Okay, I've never been there.

426
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,030
Where else can we go?

427
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,500
I made lots of side dishes you love.

428
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,770
They're all in the refrigerator.

429
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,800
And also,

430
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
your favorite soup.

431
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,570
Remember,

432
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,570
you need to heat it up.

433
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,070
Heat it before drinking.

434
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,800
No matter how busy you get in the future,

435
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,230
remember to eat properly.

436
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,800
And don't drink so much.

437
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,830
Thank you.

438
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,530
Sister Peng has left.

439
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,900
Remember to eat, okay?

440
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,600
Take care.

441
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,970
In the end, everyone has to

442
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,830
face their problems on their own.

443
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,230
What can you do for Jiang Zhihao?

444
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,370
Jimmy and I want to give you

445
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,370
the upcoming event.

446
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,030
It's a good opportunity.

447
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,230
Think about it again.

448
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,490
Sister Shanru, I've already made up my mind.

449
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,330
To be honest,

450
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,600
if he can't overcome

451
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
this level of difficulty on his own,

452
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,860
I don't want to approve this leave.

453
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,560
Because I don't think he deserves it.

454
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,300
Sister Shanru,

455
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,830
you once said

456
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,970
the success of an action

457
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,770
depends on how strong the motivation behind it is.

458
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,670
I want to help Jiang Zhihao.

459
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,600
I'm not considering the consequences.

460
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,830
I just want to help him.

461
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,570
If I don't approve your leave,

462
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,970
what do you plan to do?

463
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,800
There's not just an either-or choice.

464
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,460
There's always a Plan B, right?

465
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,730
Looks like you've learned quite a bit from me.

466
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,390
Your wings have grown strong.

467
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,200
Thank you, Sister Shanru.

468
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,030
Go ahead.

469
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,800
I'm sorry.

470
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,670
Sorry, I'll be done in a moment.

471
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,800
What's wrong?

472
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,070
It's nothing. Just a second.

473
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,030
Be careful. You might burn yourself.

474
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,000
Don't get burned.

475
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,170
Here, let me do it.

476
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,100
Okay.

477
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,200
So many eggshells.

478
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,300
Excuse me, I... Manager,

479
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,530
we need to pay here.

480
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,230
Alright.

481
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,270
Sir, someone inside needs to pay.

482
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,570
Just a moment, please.

483
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,970
Okay, I'll handle it.

484
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,470
Miss, you want to pay? Okay, right away. Sorry.

485
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,730
I haven't eaten anything yet.

486
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,870
You don't need to bring my meal. Nothing has arrived yet.

487
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,800
Yes.

488
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,670
This is burnt. Let me make another one, okay?

489
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,900
Um...

490
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,300
I ordered a sunny-side-up egg,

491
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,830
but this is fully cooked.

492
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,870
Liying,

493
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,500
sunny-side-up eggs can't be fully cooked.

494
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Then how cooked should it be?

495
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,960
Medium-rare. Use a medium-rare one for now.

496
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,300
It's fine. I'll put it here. I...

497
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,870
You handle it. Okay.

498
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,430
Please deliver the gentleman's black tea.

499
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,300
Black tea. Got it.

500
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,500
Just a moment. Sorry.

501
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,230
Things are really not going smoothly today.

502
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,400
I'll practice more on frying meat and eggs.

503
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,970
I'll prepare more change.

504
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,100
Or maybe we should switch jobs.

505
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,500
I'll go to the grill.

506
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,930
I'm just kidding.

507
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,870
Actually, I'm not very good at it either.

508
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,330
It takes some time.

509
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,870
Maybe we should go back to how it was before -

510
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,500
takeout only,

511
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,000
and no dine-in service.

512
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,900
Wouldn't that be going back to square one?

513
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,290
Is running a restaurant really that difficult?

514
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,630
Go and call him back.

515
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,670
You go.

516
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,930
You go.

517
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,870
Or you go.

518
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,370
Stop looking at me, okay?

519
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,900
What?

520
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

521
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,870
Zhilu, come here for a second.

522
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,700
No.

523
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,090
You know how to make pancakes, right?

524
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,930
We currently have this...

525
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,130
Deputy Director,

526
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,430
I just received instructions from the Chairman.

527
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,470
He said all current projects are to be suspended.

528
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,830
Written reports must be prepared by Friday

529
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,000
for his review.

530
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,700
I received it too.

531
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,100
I got it as well.

532
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,900
Dad,

533
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,430
Chairman,

534
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,930
why are you doing this?

535
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,130
This will greatly impact the company.

536
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,590
We won't be able to keep up with the schedule.

537
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,770
As the Chairman of Linlin,

538
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,630
why can't I do this?

539
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,130
Is the company

540
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,030
no longer under my control?

541
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,630
What did you say on that TV show?

542
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,900
The new owner of Linlin?

543
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,970
How presumptuous!

544
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,930
You really think the company is yours now?

545
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,300
Don't tell me

546
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
you don't know what your mother did.

547
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,630
Until your mother's matter is resolved,

548
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,160
you don't need to handle any company affairs.

549
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,900
Deng Weijie's heart is no longer here.

550
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,970
Do you know that?

551
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,900
Deng Weikang.

552
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,230
Can he be trusted?

553
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,270
It's clearly just me left here.

554
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,300
What am I doing wrong?

555
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Why won't you ever acknowledge me?

556
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,470
Because you're Wang Rouyi's son.

557
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,330
I hate that you're just like her.

558
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,230
Always fantasizing about getting things

559
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,000
that don't belong to you.

560
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,030
Alright.

561
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,270
This radish cake.

562
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,630
I just flipped it.

563
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,770
Wait a minute.

564
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,800
Flip this over.

565
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,070
Look, you made my egg break.

566
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,670
Can you two please stop arguing?

567
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,570
- We're not arguing.
- We're not arguing.

568
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,699
The first customer ordered radish cake.

569
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,429
The second one ordered egg pancake.

570
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,630
With all these items, you assemble first.

571
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,429
I'll cut.

572
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm cutting now.

573
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,100
The third one is ham sandwich, okay?

574
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,730
What I need now is...

575
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,400
How should I do this? Can't you assemble first?

576
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,370
And give it to him later?

577
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,270
How am I supposed to explain this to the customer?

578
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,330
It's being cut.

579
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,199
The radish cake is being cut.

580
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,630
I want soft-boiled eggs, thanks.

581
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,429
Soft-boiled eggs coming up.

582
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,630
Put it here.

583
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,770
Here.

584
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,270
Thank you for your great kindness.

585
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,400
You're welcome.

586
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,170
This is ridiculous.

587
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,630
Whose shop is this anyway?

588
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,330
You're here.

589
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,170
Did you argue with Dad at the company again?

590
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,870
He hates when people confront him directly.

591
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,670
Next time just go along with him.

592
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,600
What are you doing?

593
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,570
What are you doing?

594
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,300
Aiya will accompany you to Japan.

595
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,560
I've already contacted the agent there.

596
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,470
Buy your house in Japan.

597
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,630
What does that mean?

598
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,930
Are you trying to get rid of me now?

599
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,830
Yes.

600
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,370
I'm the one who made you the successor of the company.

601
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,530
I know.

602
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,270
I'm your mother.

603
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,070
I know.

604
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,970
Now you want to drive me away.

605
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,670
I've done so much for you.

606
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,730
I know you've done a lot for me.

607
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,230
But it's already too much.

608
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,430
What are you laughing at?

609
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,830
Great hero Jiang Zhihao.

610
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,570
Please save my summer homework.

611
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,500
Jiang Zhilu.

612
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,100
Emergency!

613
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,700
Quick, go to your mom's cash register

614
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,570
and get me 500 dollars.

615
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,970
Dad.

616
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,270
130. Sorry.

617
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,570
Our meal today should be 85 plus 35.

618
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,370
It should be 120.

619
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,130
Boss, I think you calculated wrong.

620
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,530
Yes, I'm sorry.

621
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,200
120.

622
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,430
Yes, good.

623
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,970
I want to turn the beauty salon in front

624
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,770
into a breakfast shop.

625
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,200
Can you come help me?

626
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,970
I can't manage it alone.

627
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,430
Of course.

628
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,230
How can you manage it alone?

629
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,070
Of course I need to help you.

630
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,100
Thanks, Dad.

631
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,670
Come to my place and wash dishes for me.

632
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,400
I hate greasy stuff.

633
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,170
Liying.

634
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,870
Here's your 50 change.

635
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,030
Plain egg pancake, no problem.

636
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,700
Anything else?

637
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,600
Just a moment. Black tea.

638
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,200
Okay, we'll wait over there.

639
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,870
Life...

640
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,300
Many things you plan

641
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,500
are different from what

642
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,900
you actually achieve.

643
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,000
So don't push yourself too hard.

644
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,470
Get well soon.

645
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,700
It's okay.

646
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,030
Great hero Jiang Zhihao.

647
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,400
Please save me.

648
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,430
Be my bodyguard for a week.

649
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,400
My friend is Jiang Zhihao,

650
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,830
a great hero.

651
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,890
Yet he still got beaten up.

652
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,530
Great hero Jiang Zhihao.

653
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,470
Please save my son.

654
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,000
As long as you keep appearing before him,

655
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,870
Linlin will never listen to me.

656
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,670
That's what Deng Yongkuan said.

657
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,800
So I'm begging you,

658
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,900
as one last favor to me,

659
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
please leave.

660
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,200
You can't fight him alone.

661
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,670
Without me, you can't beat Deng Yongkuan.

662
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,930
I'm not going anywhere. Do you want me to

663
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,030
reveal everything we've done?

664
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,230
Should we die together?

665
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,500
Deng Weiyu.

666
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,360
What are you saying? Is this okay?

667
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,400
Great hero Jiang Zhihao.

668
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,000
Please save my son.

669
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,730
Tell him to wipe away his tears.

670
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,470
Come out quickly.

671
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,270
Jiang Zhihao, open the door!

672
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,470
Yifei has already gone home.

673
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,170
How much longer are you going to hide in there?

674
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,300
We can't use this room

675
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,030
It's so annoying.

676
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,200
Come out now!

677
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,130
It's all my fault.

678
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,470
Are you crying?

679
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,800
What are you crying for?

680
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,700
So you know it's your fault.

681
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,030
If you hadn't stuck your neck out,

682
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,890
Yifei wouldn't have gotten hurt.

683
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,830
But you know,

684
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,400
Yifei also said

685
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,330
he thinks you're brave

686
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,860
for standing up to bullies.

687
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,870
He also said

688
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,570
you're a great hero.

689
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,200
Great hero Jiang Zhihao.

690
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,500
Please save my son.

691
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,530
Tell him to wipe away his tears.

692
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,500
Come out quickly.

693
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,770
A true hero

694
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,270
doesn't make his loved ones worry.

695
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,900
The great hero's mother,

696
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,770
Lai Xiurong.

697
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,670
Deng Weiyu.

698
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,130
Deng Weiyu, where are you going?

699
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,330
Where are you going?

700
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,530
Don't leave.

701
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,470
Deng Weiyu!

702
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,530
Don't go!

703
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,800
Don't you dare give up on me!

704
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,830
Deng Weiyu!

705
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,470
We're in this together.

706
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,270
We're in this together.

707
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,900
You can't abandon me.

708
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,670
We're from the same country.

709
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,470
I'm here to collect 100 dollars from you.

710
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,570
Thank you. Thank you.

711
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,200
The radish cake will be ready soon.

712
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,830
Just one more minute. Okay.

713
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,100
Excuse me. Here's your order.

714
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,360
Green onion omelet, not spicy. Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

715
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,100
Hello. Your sandwich is here.

716
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,600
Thank you. Enjoy your...

717
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,060
Are you trying to run my restaurant into the ground?

718
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,070
I'm coming.

719
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:18,930
Thanks for your hard work.

720
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,800
Your food is over here.

721
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,470
Welcome.

722
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,230
Sit here, Dad.

723
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,800
Thank you.

724
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,270
You finally came out.

725
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,030
I'll do it.

726
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,700
Been waiting for you for a long time.

727
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,570
Okay.

728
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:30,900
Dad, let me help you.

729
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,700
This one. That one.

730
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,430
Go ahead.

731
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,600
There's a pork cutlet sandwich for dine-in.

732
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,000
Is it the pork cutlet sandwich? Yes.

733
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,630
Good.

734
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,130
If I hadn't been so nosy

735
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,400
and helped Deng Weiyu,

736
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,230
would I wake up now

737
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,870
and see my mom?

738
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,130
I've decided to let myself go.

739
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,730
I won't be your pawn anymore.

740
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,730
You did it, didn't you?

741
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,370
Deng Weikang is your brother.

742
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,400
Do you really want to see him go to jail?

743
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,600
After you left,

744
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,470
Dad and I,

745
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:39,700
and Zhilu,

746
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,900
we've all been living well.

747
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,970
Mom.

748
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,670
I miss you so much.

749
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,030
I know.

750
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,370
You'll always be Mom's big hero.
