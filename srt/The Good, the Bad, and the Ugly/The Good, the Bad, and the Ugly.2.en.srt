1
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,730
Anyway, Lin Guangsheng has always disliked me

2
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,870
so I don't need to be polite to him.

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,130
We can only replace the paint tomorrow.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,230
I'll take care of it for you.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,700
But don't forget

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,330
the conditions you promised me.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,800
Once I get the order from Linlin Breakfast Shop,

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,270
I won't have to worry about money anymore.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,900
Who played that?

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,930
Who played that? Turn it off!

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,870
Where's the control panel?

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,200
Behind the door next to the main table.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,970
Who played that?

14
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,200
Everyone was shocked.

15
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
Nobody knows how it happened.

16
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,300
Xiao Qian always seemed so normal.

17
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,960
How could anyone know he was this kind of person?

18
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
Zhilu, morning.

19
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,970
Morning.

20
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,630
What morning? It's already afternoon.

21
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,870
Miss, your clothes are ready.

22
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,030
And then?

23
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,170
The wedding was called off.

24
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,600
Lin Liying just stood there frozen,

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,030
not knowing what to do.

26
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,530
Aunt Xueqing was about to cry,

27
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,590
and Grandma Hongzhu nearly fainted.

28
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,470
Liying must be devastated.

29
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,190
She even came specially to get her hair washed that day.

30
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,270
Jiang Zhilu,

31
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,900
when you look for a partner in the future,

32
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,700
better find someone kind.

33
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,200
And you should know what their family does,

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,870
and about their siblings and parents,

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,800
their neighbors,

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,100
and preferably their entire ancestry.

37
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,130
You need to know everything, understand?

38
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,170
Do you understand?

39
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,300
Alright,

40
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,360
help me with this treatment. I need to use the bathroom.

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,630
Actually, Aunt Xiurong is right.

42
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,570
Look at the two of us,

43
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,400
we've practically grown up together.

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,230
All that ancestry stuff,

45
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,000
parents, siblings,

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,900
we know everything about each other.

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,970
So...

48
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,070
I was thinking... so...

49
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,030
Jiang Zhilu?

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,030
Sit down.

51
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,330
Niu Yifei,

52
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,660
I don't just wash anyone's hair, you know.

53
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,870
What are you doing in my room again?

54
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,230
My foot hurts. Sit.

55
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,829
Over here.

56
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,000
I need you to recover something for me.

57
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,530
With your computer skills, you can definitely do it.

58
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,930
Okay, let's do it.

59
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,230
Hurry up, come on.

60
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,570
OK, good.

61
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,370
Computer genius!

62
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,400
What's this? Drive D needs your rescue.

63
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Let me.

64
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:37,830
This one.

65
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,430
He's ordered cheap materials before anyway.

66
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,430
When it's discovered, he'll just think he was cheated by the supplier.

67
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,430
He won't suspect someone set him up.

68
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,900
Hurry up!

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,830
I can try this,

70
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,630
but you need to give me some time.

71
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,600
Morning!

72
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,030
Bro.

73
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,600
Deng Weiyu, I didn't know you were so hardworking.

74
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,770
Sister Peng took the day off,

75
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,630
so I thought I'd help everyone...

76
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,700
Dad,

77
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,670
look.

78
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,000
My favorite

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,030
Double Crispy Chicken Burger.

80
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,100
Don't you know that customers in recent years

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,630
are increasingly focused on healthy eating?

82
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,370
Sis, you need to be bolder in business.

83
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,100
If others are already doing it,

84
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,030
what's the point of us just following along?

85
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,430
I specifically found an award-winning director

86
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,400
to shoot our chicken commercial this year.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Deng Weikang.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,570
Isn't advertising my department's responsibility?

89
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,330
How could you find an award-winning director?

90
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,330
Even if you had the money, he wouldn't work with you.

91
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,400
Deng Weiyu.

92
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,230
What do you think?

93
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,130
[Advertisement]

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,800
The ad seems like it will be effective.

95
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,630
Linlin Breakfast doesn't support useless people.

96
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,790
Learn more from your brother and sister.

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,470
Why are you doing this?

98
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,730
Your father has always looked down on me.

99
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,230
Don't you know?

100
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,870
He thinks I only got this job through family connections.

101
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,900
That I'm completely useless.

102
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,030
No matter how hard I work,

103
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,960
he never says a single word of praise.

104
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,830
Just because of that,

105
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,470
you want to hurt him?

106
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,830
Because I like you.

107
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,030
I know your father

108
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,130
has never respected me.

109
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,930
But...

110
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,300
But I've liked you for a long time.

111
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,430
Lin Liying, my feelings for you are real.

112
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm not...

113
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,200
Then why did you marry me?

114
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,190
You're the person in charge here, right?

115
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,970
Please come with us.

116
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,100
I need to clarify some legal responsibilities with you.

117
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,630
I thought I was seeing things.

118
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,160
I can't believe you're visiting an aquarium.

119
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,970
Do you think fish

120
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,870
living here

121
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,070
are happy?

122
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,130
You look like you want to die right now.

123
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,100
But this fish tank

124
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,300
is too small for you.

125
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,630
If I tell you

126
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,870
I'm not that sad,

127
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,400
would that be terrible?

128
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,070
It's like moving into a

129
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,970
house you don't like.

130
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,900
Then burning it down with fire.

131
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,330
And then you have to move out.

132
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,370
Have to move out.

133
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,870
Have to move out.

134
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,600
Actually, moving out is a good thing.

135
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,970
Should I thank the person

136
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,630
who played that video?

137
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,830
If it weren't for him,

138
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,330
I would have gotten engaged to Xiao Qian.

139
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,500
And then life would just go on day by day.

140
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,770
Day after day.

141
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,630
Forgetting that I don't love him.

142
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,870
Forgetting that I once loved so deeply.

143
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,500
Am I a terrible person?

144
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,370
The money

145
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,470
gave me security.

146
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,000
It gave my mom and grandma

147
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,900
a better life.

148
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,530
It let me clean up

149
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,460
all the mess my father left behind.

150
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,070
I even thought I could marry him

151
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,270
and spend my whole life with him.

152
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,200
Am I going crazy?

153
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,100
Lin Liying.

154
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,630
I feel like I'm getting to know you better and better.

155
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,070
So you're such an M.

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,800
If you can laugh, it's all good.

157
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,700
I'm going to buy some fish.

158
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,570
Fish that always stay in the same tank

159
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,300
will never be happy.

160
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,500
You're right.

161
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,100
Moving is the right thing to do.

162
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,570
Moving is good.

163
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,600
Boss.

164
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,970
I want to buy this.

165
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,930
Okay.

166
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,430
This kind?

167
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes. What color do you want?

168
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,230
I want every color.

169
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,100
How many of each color?

170
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,030
Five of each.

171
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,770
Alright, I'll pack them for you.

172
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,970
Thank you, boss.

173
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,600
You keep fish?

174
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,730
What a pity.

175
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,700
Deputy Manager.

176
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,670
Please come in.

177
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,230
The red bean pastries you wanted,

178
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,500
I bought them for you.

179
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,360
You even got the right flavor.

180
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,270
You're really capable.

181
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,100
Dad.

182
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,270
Your favorite red bean pastries.

183
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,770
Those were your mother's favorites.

184
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,630
Here, eat them while they're hot.

185
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,970
If your mother hadn't been like that,

186
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,070
distracting me from work every day,

187
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,600
we would have at least 20 more branches by now.

188
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,430
If you keep acting like your mother,

189
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,090
we'll struggle to reach 200 branches this year.

190
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't expand so quickly. I'm afraid

191
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,530
I won't be able to take over.

192
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,130
What are you afraid of?

193
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,800
Dad.

194
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,430
I have an urgent document

195
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,100
that needs your...

196
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,170
Dad is resting now.

197
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,170
Don't bother him with work matters.

198
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,130
I didn't know you were coming.

199
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,860
I only prepared enough for two.

200
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,400
It's fine.

201
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm having dinner with friends tonight.

202
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,560
I'm not hungry now anyway.

203
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,870
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,230
Let me tell you,

205
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,200
I had so many things to do today.

206
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,770
I was busy until just now.

207
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,390
You haven't eaten already, have you?

208
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,700
I have.

209
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,670
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,730
Here.

211
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,300
What's wrong?

212
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,730
Don't tell me Deng Weikang upset you again.

213
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,970
Don't mention his name to me.

214
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay.

215
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,370
He's really something.

216
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,400
One wheel cake

217
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,370
can make my dad that happy.

218
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,800
You have no idea.

219
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,470
When I saw them today,

220
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,830
the look in his eyes...

221
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,470
It was like they were the real family,

222
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,030
and I was the outsider.

223
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,030
No wonder you were so eager to have dinner with me.

224
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,970
Looks like I need to have a few drinks with you today.

225
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,070
That won't do.

226
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,130
Two draft beers, please.

227
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,070
Well,

228
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,770
let me tell you,

229
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,930
my day wasn't much better.

230
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,470
Work was super busy today.

231
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,800
That secretary is so incompetent.

232
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,700
She's completely useless.

233
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,070
I have no idea what she was doing.

234
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,230
And then I...

235
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
What's wrong with you?

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
You look way too serious.

237
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,330
There's an issue with our chicken supplier.

238
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,990
I need to go back to the office.

239
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,270
The Health Department recently conducted

240
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,130
an unannounced inspection of a meat supplier

241
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,870
and discovered large quantities of expired smoked chicken

242
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,870
which not only wasn't destroyed

243
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,900
but had its labels altered

244
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,100
and was redistributed.

245
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,570
All of this expired smoked chicken

246
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,730
has been distributed to

247
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,329
a single chain of breakfast restaurants,

248
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,730
Linlin Breakfast.

249
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,900
Although there have been no reports yet

250
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
of consumers suffering from food poisoning,

251
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,630
it's feared that

252
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,300
panic has already spread.

253
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,730
Late again?

254
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,270
Come earlier tomorrow.

255
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,400
The news is already out.

256
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,470
Isn't this what you wanted?

257
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,270
Of course these tainted foods shouldn't be eaten.

258
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,530
But I think this kind of news

259
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,170
is still too harsh

260
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,430
and has caused some damage to Linlin.

261
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,030
Isn't there a gentler approach?

262
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,730
For example...

263
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,170
For example...

264
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,170
There's no 'for example' here.

265
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,970
At Linlin Breakfast, except for the chairman,

266
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,970
your brother-in-law Kang calls all the shots.

267
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,730
Your sister works like a dog and gets nothing,

268
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,130
so what can you possibly change?

269
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,370
Right?

270
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,170
Besides removing the chicken

271
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,170
and finding new suppliers,

272
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,270
has Linlin considered that

273
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,930
crisis can be an opportunity?

274
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,730
Since there's been a food safety issue,

275
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,330
you need to make up points in this area.

276
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,670
How will you do it?

277
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,100
This is

278
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,830
my gift to you -

279
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,170
an opportunity.

280
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,270
Hello.

281
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,630
Um, hello.

282
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,900
Are you Uncle Zhou?

283
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,130
Who are you?

284
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,100
I'm, uh,

285
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Jiang Zhihao's friend.

286
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,100
He contacted you for me before.

287
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,300
Uncle Zhou, I...

288
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,830
May I come in?

289
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,970
I've already fired the quality control manager.

290
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,530
For all of Linlin Breakfast's food suppliers,

291
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,400
I've ordered a thorough investigation of raw material sources.

292
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,800
If we find even one more instance

293
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,670
of dishonest practices or cutting corners,

294
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,170
we'll remove those products immediately.

295
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,770
Dad,

296
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,330
the eldest son of Lequan Foods' owner

297
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,070
was my classmate at Harvard.

298
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,130
He says they can supply us with chicken,

299
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,200
and the contract is already in process.

300
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,030
They can deliver immediately.

301
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,430
The contract hasn't even been signed yet.

302
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,870
Won't there be issues with delivery this way?

303
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,170
Do you want more problems?

304
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,900
I'm the one facing the media.

305
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,770
I can't afford any more mistakes...

306
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,400
What I need is now, immediately,

307
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,700
to turn around our corporate image.

308
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,300
And you're still discussing

309
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,570
basic issues like supply with me?

310
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,270
Investigation?

311
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,530
Only starting after the incident happened?

312
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,200
What if tomorrow we discover

313
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,130
problems with beef and pork too?

314
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,230
Weikang.

315
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,470
Go try the restaurants on the street below yourself.

316
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,970
Every breakfast shop uses Lequan chicken.

317
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,500
There are tons of one-star reviews online.

318
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,830
Should I read them all to you?

319
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,570
What do I need you for?

320
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,200
Two days.

321
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,570
I'm giving you two days.

322
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,870
Get rid of this 'unethical business'

323
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,170
label for me.

324
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,370
Okay, bye.

325
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,770
Vicky, are you ready?

326
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm rushing something for a client. Five minutes.

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,500
Five minutes, okay?

328
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,200
Weiyu.

329
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,170
You're still working overtime?

330
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,500
Do it tomorrow. The AC is already off.

331
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,300
It's fine. It's not hot.

332
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,730
Weiyu.

333
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,270
Help me grab the event materials.

334
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,230
Okay.

335
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,130
You spent the entire afternoon thinking

336
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,730
and this is all you came up with?

337
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,970
A whole department with over a dozen brains

338
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,630
and all you could produce is this terrible plan.

339
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,100
Is it really that hard to transform our company's image?

340
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,430
Do it all over again.

341
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,030
Yelling at people again?

342
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,570
Isn't it obvious?

343
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,500
I

344
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,470
could hear you from way outside

345
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,870
shouting so loudly.

346
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,170
That bastard Xiao Qian.

347
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,470
He creates a mess

348
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,830
and doesn't clean up after himself.

349
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,500
Now I have to clean up his mess.

350
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,330
It'll get resolved eventually.

351
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,200
I need to fix this within two days

352
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,870
while Deng Weijie is watching closely

353
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,700
waiting for me to fail.

354
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,870
After all these years

355
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,770
Weijie is just what he is.

356
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,130
But that brother of yours who returned from Japan

357
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,230
you might want to keep an eye on him.

358
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,600
What about him?

359
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,600
Let me show you our proposal.

360
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,270
Collaborating with farmers who practice sustainable farming

361
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,000
and humane animal husbandry

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,270
will greatly help transform

363
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,570
our company's image.

364
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,900
Then we'll donate a portion of our profits

365
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,230
to underprivileged children

366
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,090
for their school lunch programs.

367
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,330
And for these high-quality chicken products?

368
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,000
Our first two products to launch are this

369
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,730
mullet roe sauce chicken burger.

370
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,400
What do you think?

371
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,830
They all look delicious!

372
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,130
They seem a hundred times better

373
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,790
than what Jiang Zhihao makes.

374
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,500
And then there's this one.

375
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,700
My song is on!

376
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,600
Mom,

377
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,930
I don't have a microphone.

378
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,730
Jiang Zhihao!

379
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,230
What? They came here for your feedback.

380
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,030
And you're just singing?

381
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,930
I'm singing seriously,

382
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,470
and I am listening, okay?

383
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,530
Have you calculated the costs?

384
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,830
I wouldn't spend over 100 dollars

385
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,330
to eat some

386
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,570
mullet roe sauce.

387
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,770
What is it, gold?

388
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,860
Do you have to be so rude?

389
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,270
It's all your fault.

390
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,400
I can't keep up.

391
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,970
Mom, can you select it for me again?

392
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,670
You sing terribly and blame others?

393
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm going over to sing.

394
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,030
So noisy!

395
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,370
You're the noisy one!

396
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,070
No, you are!

397
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,300
You're the noisiest!

398
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,370
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,300
Jiang Zhihao just likes to talk nonsense.

400
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,430
Don't mind him.

401
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,570
No, he's right.

402
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,630
I hadn't considered

403
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,000
the cost issue with the mullet roe.

404
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,800
And the chicken supply volume

405
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,030
is actually a problem too.

406
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,070
Sir,

407
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,400
this is where I work.

408
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,630
Not yours.

409
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,130
Jiang Zhihao is here to enlighten you.

410
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,100
Then my sales performance needs your guidance too.

411
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,570
From

412
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,970
here

413
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,330
to here,

414
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,800
you can order anything.

415
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,270
I can't get the others.

416
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,400
If you can't finish, we can send the wine home.

417
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,800
No need.

418
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,130
I

419
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,370
can finish it.

420
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,530
When I was leaving the office earlier,

421
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,530
I saw him still working overtime.

422
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,570
He's really hardworking, you know.

423
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,430
Working overtime until just now.

424
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
I took this when he left, you know.

425
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,970
One, two, three.

426
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,970
Want me to help you drink?

427
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,570
No need.

428
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,930
Wait for me.

429
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,430
What?

430
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,400
Jiang Zhilu, what are you doing?

431
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
Offering you a drink.

432
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,930
See?

433
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,700
It's fine.

434
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,400
Alright, we can continue now.

435
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,430
Want to play something else?

436
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,370
Sure.

437
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,230
Loser chooses the next game.

438
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,570
I can't believe Jiang Zhihao gets drunk after just one drink.

439
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,970
Not even a full glass.

440
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,170
You seem pretty impressive though,

441
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,870
drinking whiskey like it's water.

442
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,200
The host club next door is recruiting.

443
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,370
Want to apply?

444
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,500
I actually only drink half.

445
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,230
I get rid of the other half.

446
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,000
You get rid of it?

447
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
Like,

448
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,900
switching drinks, adding water,

449
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,230
spitting it out in the bathroom,

450
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,330
sleight of hand.

451
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,300
I learned it in Japan.

452
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,270
Want me to teach you?

453
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,370
Working in a place like this,

454
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,000
you might find it useful.

455
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,370
A place like this?

456
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,670
What's that supposed to mean?

457
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,400
You think working in a place like this

458
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,730
means I have bad values?

459
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,600
That's not what I meant.

460
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,730
I think working in a place like this...

461
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,130
Working here is great.

462
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,500
It's free-spirited, and

463
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,130
glamorous too.

464
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,130
I'm... I'm actually quite envious.

465
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,500
Envious of what?

466
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,860
Let me tell you something.

467
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,200
There are three things in this world that don't matter at all:

468
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,330
namely,

469
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,200
Jiang Zhilu's former company,

470
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,230
Jiang Zhilu's ex-boyfriend,

471
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,070
and Jiang Zhilu's judgment.

472
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,170
What do you mean by Jiang Zhilu's judgment?

473
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,470
I'll tell you another time.

474
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,100
Okay, you'd better.

475
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,630
Thank you for listening to me talk so much today.

476
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,030
Not many people

477
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,730
are willing to listen to me.

478
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,100
Even though I don't know if you're working right now,

479
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,630
but still,

480
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,700
I enjoyed talking with you.

481
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,570
Why hasn't the car arrived yet?

482
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,870
You two are being

483
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,270
so gross,

484
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,730
flirting like that.

485
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,170
Asking for trouble.

486
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,370
What should we do?

487
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,730
Mrs. Xiurong.

488
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,070
Why are you here?

489
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,600
Mrs. Xiurong, I'm fine.

490
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,570
Thank you.

491
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm okay.

492
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,230
Here, this is for you.

493
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,630
You still remember my mom likes apples.

494
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,530
This is for you.

495
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,470
Do you want to go upstairs?

496
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,870
My mom would be very happy.

497
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,030
Stop lying.

498
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,690
I'm not stupid enough to go argue with her again.

499
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,570
Let's go, Lin Liying.

500
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,470
You're back.

501
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,270
Who were you talking to?

502
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,300
The apples are so small.

503
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,370
They look all dried up.

504
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,830
I can tell they won't taste good.

505
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,630
Is that so?

506
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,090
Then I'll throw them away.

507
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,800
By the way.

508
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,770
What have you been busy with these days?

509
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,300
You're rarely home.

510
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,030
I've been looking for a job.

511
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,330
Life goes on.

512
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,530
Need to make money.

513
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,670
No one expected.

514
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,800
That the one who hurt your father was actually Xiao Qian.

515
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,000
By the way.

516
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,530
Have you ever thought about

517
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,600
On your engagement day

518
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,500
who actually released that recording?

519
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,200
I don't know either.

520
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,330
I don't know. I've been thinking about it.

521
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,230
Keep the apples. I'm going grocery shopping.

522
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Then I won't throw them away.

523
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,170
Just leave them there.

524
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,200
Hurry up. How is it?

525
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,230
Done.

526
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,200
It's ready.

527
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,900
What's the matter?

528
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,970
I put effort into this.

529
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,630
It took quite a lot of time.

530
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,770
So I was thinking

531
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,100
if there were some photos

532
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,370
I would feel much better.

533
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,200
Here.

534
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,870
Got it. Go check over there.

535
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,800
Okay, you use it.

536
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,930
Lin Guangsheng never liked me anyway.

537
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,330
I don't need to be nice to him either.

538
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,470
Zhilu is so cute.

539
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,030
Stop arguing.

540
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,300
Tomorrow is the only chance to replace the coating.

541
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,670
I'll handle it for you.

542
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,130
Thanks, brother-in-law.

543
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,500
I'm going to marry her.

544
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,170
He's ordered cheap materials before anyway.

545
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:58,600
After it's discovered,

546
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,030
he'll just think he was cheated by the supplier.

547
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,170
He won't suspect someone set him up.

548
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,030
Make sure that bucket of coating is used.

549
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,670
Let us know when it's been used.

550
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,530
Then it's no longer your concern.

551
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,830
Don't forget the conditions you promised me.

552
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,170
Remember.

553
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,760
Once I get the order from Linlin Breakfast Shop,

554
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,360
I won't have to worry about money anymore.

555
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,130
Brother Kang said

556
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,800
as long as you handle this well,

557
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,570
you'll get what you deserve.

558
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,800
Uncle Zhou.

559
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,800
Uncle Zhou.

560
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,230
Uncle Zhou.

561
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,970
Uncle Zhou.

562
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,300
Brother.

563
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,800
Why are you here?

564
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,970
I moved Mr. Zhou's chicken farm

565
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,800
to a bigger, more comfortable place

566
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,860
that's better for raising chickens.

567
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,130
What do you mean?

568
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,130
Don't you get it?

569
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,230
I signed him.

570
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,200
I also connected with

571
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,330
some small farmers who work with him.

572
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,930
Planning to launch two chicken breakfast items,

573
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,670
the ones you designed.

574
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,230
You stole my project.

575
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,969
How can you call it stealing?

576
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,500
Such a good plan -

577
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,630
of course I had to implement it for you.

578
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,500
Mullet roe chicken burger?

579
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,870
I don't even eat that.

580
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,870
Do you think

581
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm doing a terrible job with Linlin Breakfast

582
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,070
and need you to save it?

583
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,400
Or are you trying to prove to Dad

584
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,530
that you're better than me

585
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,429
and more suitable to be the VP?

586
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,400
Dad doesn't expect much from you,

587
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,530
he won't even notice all your efforts.

588
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,730
You don't actually

589
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,460
think you can make something of yourself, do you?

590
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,030
Know your place.

591
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,429
Your mother is Wang Rouyi, not Zhou Linlin.

592
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,230
Stop being so self-righteous,

593
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,600
pretending to help others.

594
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,800
The truth is,

595
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,160
you're just in the way.

596
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,800
Deng Weikang.

597
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,500
What are you doing?

598
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,130
My brother signed Mr. Zhou.

599
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,300
He stole our project.

600
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,100
Maybe it's for the best.

601
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,230
Uncle Zhou will have access to all of Linlin's resources.

602
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,070
The supply will be more stable.

603
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,130
My father should be happy about this.

604
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:27,800
Actually, I haven't figured out yet

605
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,170
how to report this case to my father.

606
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,370
It's really stressful talking to him.

607
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,470
Let Deng Weikang do the talking.

608
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,530
That would take some pressure off me.

609
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,900
Anyway,

610
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,900
I'd definitely mess it up if I tried.

611
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,130
It's okay. Don't worry.

612
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,300
Let's leave it at that.

613
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,400
Deng Weiyu,

614
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,330
you're also part of the Deng family.

615
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,000
Releasing those recordings would harm your family too.

616
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,600
What exactly do you want?

617
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,500
Do you believe in karma?

618
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,500
Actually, on the day you resigned,

619
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,370
I saw you from a distance carrying your box

620
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,970
standing in front of the elevator.

621
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,430
I just had a feeling you wouldn't do something like this.

622
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,630
I really wanted to go up and say something to you.

623
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,700
But I

624
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,430
didn't have the courage.

625
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,130
So I've always felt a bit of regret.

626
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Anyway, you're the biggest victim in this matter,

627
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,130
so I think you have the right to know the truth.

628
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,730
Why don't you tell your brother or sister?

629
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,230
They wouldn't care.

630
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,900
Then why tell me?

631
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,370
I believe that in this world

632
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,370
there's still a distinction between right and wrong.

633
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,770
Many things

634
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,130
everyone actually knows are wrong.

635
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,900
They just deliberately choose to ignore them.

636
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,270
So if I know the truth,

637
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,070
I can't ignore it.

638
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,200
Otherwise,

639
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,500
the final karma

640
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,170
will come back to me.

641
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,200
How old are you to still believe in that?

642
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,970
What about you?

643
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,870
Don't you believe me?

644
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,000
Deng Weiyu.

645
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,270
Call me the great hero.

646
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,830
Alright, wipe your nose.

647
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,400
Cilantro egg bun,

648
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,570
cilantro egg pancake,

649
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,730
two options.

650
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,870
How come there are two options?

651
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,800
Do I actually have a choice today?

652
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,000
Are you buying or not?

653
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,130
Yes.

654
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,400
I want one cilantro egg bun

655
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,830
without cilantro.

656
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,670
There's no such thing.

657
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,570
I thought I had a choice?

658
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,330
Your choice is

659
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,530
to buy from me or go somewhere else.

660
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,230
Kids shouldn't be picky eaters.

661
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,870
Cilantro is healthy.

662
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,370
Fine, then I choose.

663
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,030
I'll take both.

664
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,000
What's wrong with you today?

665
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,430
You're acting weird.

666
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,230
Today is a good day.

667
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,100
Miaomiao, have you decided?

668
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,900
I can't concentrate at all.

669
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,670
Who on earth

670
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,430
played that video?

671
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,800
How dare someone do that?

672
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,970
Lin Liying

673
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,530
In this world,

674
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,700
there must be someone who loves you.

675
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,670
That person is...

676
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,530
me

677
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,270
You still deny having an affair with my husband?

678
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,730
He wouldn't just casually lend you 500,000.

679
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,500
Your brother's former secretary, Li Peizhen,

680
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,570
do you remember her?

681
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,370
Between the two of them,

682
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,700
who matters more to your brother?

683
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,400
The truth is you're just

684
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,500
afraid that Deng Weijie is better than you.

685
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,730
You're just using me to keep tabs on her.

686
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,530
Xie Jinghan

687
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,070
Bystanders see things clearly.

688
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,530
Who do you think, between me and Deng Weikang,

689
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,230
should be the successor of Linlin Breakfast?

690
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,930
Uncle Guang

691
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,400
Dad

692
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,200
Lin Guangsheng

693
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,070
Is it nice to have your daughter chasing after you like this?

694
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,230
Right now,

695
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,100
all I want is to find

696
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,630
the person who ruined my engagement.

697
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,330
It was me.

698
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,170
That audio recording

699
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,630
and that secret video,

700
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,460
I was the one who released them.

701
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:13,630
Do you think my life

702
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,530
isn't ridiculous enough?
