1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,930
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

2
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,530
From now on at the company,

3
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,070
I finally don't have to be so nervous anymore,

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,000
always afraid of making mistakes.

5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,730
Because I have you fighting alongside me.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,470
This is the first time I feel

7
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,270
that I truly have family.

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,590
Haven't we been fighting side by side all along?

9
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,170
That's different.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,230
If it's different,

11
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,030
should we change how we address each other?

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,300
What do you mean?

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,500
Call me brother.

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,600
Call me brother.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,530
How could I possibly call you brother?

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,830
Just do it.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,470
Come on.

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,330
Will you or won't you?

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,630
Say brother.

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,870
I won't.

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,870
Come here.

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,100
This BL drama...

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Did you even watch it properly?

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,470
They're biological brothers.

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,400
Real brothers would never act like that.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,030
In the real world, brothers

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,200
fight over inheritance

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,670
and turn against each other.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,530
They're never that close, okay?

30
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,400
Not everyone is like that.

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,770
Real life can be more dramatic

32
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,930
than any prime-time soap opera.

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,090
It's all about testing people's hearts.

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,570
Give me one.

35
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,770
No way.

36
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,200
You just licked your fingers. That's gross.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,470
I did not!

38
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,829
Zhihao.

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,490
How long are you going to be like this?

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,470
You've been like this since the funeral.

41
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,900
Not even washing your hair. It's disgusting.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
You're no better.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,900
Don't make Mom worry.

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,470
I know.

45
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,630
You still need to eat.

46
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,130
You need to cheer up.

47
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,230
Xiurong is gone.

48
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,570
Shide is so absent-minded.

49
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,870
Those two children

50
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,870
will need our help in the future.

51
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,030
Zhihao and his family,

52
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,470
I wonder if they're eating properly.

53
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,230
I'll cook a couple more dishes later

54
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,030
and take them over.

55
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,560
Mom, you already had me take food over the day before yesterday.

56
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,930
Their fridge is full.

57
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,430
Right.

58
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,730
I forgot.

59
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,770
I just took over a pot of braised meat.

60
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,230
They couldn't have eaten it all so quickly.

61
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,400
Stop worrying.

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,030
Yesterday when I was out for a walk,

63
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,400
I saw Shide by the roadside

64
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,900
watching people play chess.

65
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,930
He seemed to be in good spirits.

66
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,200
Move your cannon to attack the chariot.

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,060
Just capture it with your cannon.

68
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,330
Quickly advance that piece.

69
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,370
Move it up! In chess, you need to think three moves ahead.

70
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,970
What's the point of only focusing on what's right in front of you?

71
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,470
No.

72
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,500
Let me tell you how to move.

73
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,030
But I heard from their neighbors that

74
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,230
they often hear someone crying in their house at night.

75
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,230
It sounds like it's Shide's voice.

76
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,330
Lunch box.

77
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,570
Jiang Shide.

78
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,900
Do you have a grudge against me

79
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,870
or against braised pork?

80
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,670
There's no braised pork left.

81
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,830
They sold out.

82
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,270
What's your excuse this time?

83
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,970
The person in front of you

84
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,830
bought 30 braised pork lunch boxes.

85
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,700
Strange. When I go buy it, they have it.

86
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,370
When you go, they're sold out.

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,570
I want to eat braised pork!

88
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,470
Let me tell you,

89
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,770
their spare ribs are especially delicious.

90
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,730
You admit it now,

91
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,930
it's because you want to eat spare ribs.

92
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,300
Well then,

93
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,930
here, eat this.

94
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,530
Green peppers. Here.

95
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,900
All the green peppers are yours. I don't want to eat green peppers!

96
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,400
After all these years,

97
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,370
you still don't know what I don't eat?

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You don't have any dishes left.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
Are you going to eat plain rice?

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
It's all your fault.

101
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,970
Fine. I'll buy it next time.

102
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,600
Zhilu seems to still be going to work.

103
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,100
But her condition

104
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,670
must be pretty bad too.

105
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,400
Yet watching it sink

106
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,100
Who can restore that love

107
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,700
Undo the harm of ignorance

108
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,300
Restless peace, covered in darkness

109
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,170
Can everything return to zero

110
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,270
But what worries people most

111
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,500
is Zhihao.

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,230
Don't drink that!

113
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,630
That coffee is poisoned!

114
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,330
Don't drink it!

115
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,500
Don't drink it. Put it down.

116
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,870
You can tell he's a bad person just by looking at him.

117
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,900
See?

118
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,170
Put it down. Don't drink anymore.

119
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,600
I've watched Zhihao grow up since he was little.

120
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,270
The more he seems like nothing's wrong,

121
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,400
the more something is actually wrong.

122
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,600
He was so close to his mother.

123
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,200
How could he get over it so quickly?

124
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,900
Jiang Zhihao, I got a gutter ball again!

125
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,700
Jiang...

126
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,570
Jiang Zhihao.

127
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,000
Teach me!

128
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,200
You're the one who suggested bowling.

129
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,830
I used to be good at this in college.

130
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,090
How did my instructor teach me back then?

131
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,600
Why don't you admit that your bowling skills

132
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
were terrible to begin with?

133
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,600
You know,

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,930
in life,

135
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,500
many things you imagine

136
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,170
and what you actually accomplish

137
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,870
are two different things.

138
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,200
So you

139
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,030
don't need to rush yourself to feel better.

140
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,900
It's okay.

141
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,770
Lin Liying.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,370
This feeling is just like

143
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,630
when you've tried hard for a long time

144
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,270
and gone through countless difficulties

145
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,370
trying to climb a mountain.

146
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,930
But when you finally reach the top of the mountain,

147
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,670
before you can even stand firmly,

148
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,370
you get kicked back down.

149
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,170
You no longer have

150
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,430
the strength to climb back up again.

151
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,470
I had already accepted

152
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,570
the fact that my mom was gone.

153
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,770
But...

154
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,930
But...

155
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,100
After the funeral, I...

156
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,030
I felt like there was a huge void in my heart.

157
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,530
Nothing could fill it.

158
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,300
Do you want to get hot pot?

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,070
Your way of comforting people is

160
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,030
as terrible as your basketball skills.

161
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,670
Are you feeling any better?

162
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,970
A little better.

163
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,630
Hot pot?

164
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,430
You're paying.

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,770
Fine. Let's go.

166
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
You can hire someone to take photos.

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,600
I can also hire someone to investigate.

168
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,660
Yes, I hired someone to take those photos.

169
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,700
Deng Weijie bribed my father.

170
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,130
He destroyed my family.

171
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,630
If I had to choose again,

172
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,360
I would still do the same thing.

173
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,430
You knew this would hurt people,

174
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,230
but you did it anyway.

175
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,230
How are you any different from them?

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,030
I never wanted to be a good person.

177
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,630
This world is so strange.

178
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,970
Good people die young.

179
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,600
I just want to be a normal person.

180
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,930
If we have to consider

181
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,200
everyone else's feelings for everything we do,

182
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,330
then we might as well do nothing at all.

183
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,170
I don't care what you do to me.

184
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,100
After all, I ruined your family.

185
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,830
But I have to be honest with you.

186
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,000
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm the one who helped you

188
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,130
discover Fang Nuo's affair.

189
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,530
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

190
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,470
With a marriage like this,

191
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,530
I suggest you get out of this misery as soon as possible.

192
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,470
You're right.

193
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,560
That's why I've already divorced him.

194
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
So today is my

195
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,570
last day cleaning here.

196
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,770
After this, I'll quit my job.

197
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,070
I'm not firing you.

198
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,600
I admire your

199
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,870
courage to force your opinions on others.

200
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,970
I think it's great.

201
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,100
Keep it up.

202
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,470
Deputy CEO, I'd like to report something.

203
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,670
The Tangzhong toast series.

204
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,870
This is phase one,

205
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,630
and this is phase two.

206
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,230
I can't approve this budget.

207
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,700
But all the relevant data

208
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
is already in this report,

209
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,130
and our online store was previously already...

210
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,700
The last person who made this decision

211
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,630
has already paid for her failure.

212
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,430
What do you think?

213
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,730
Okay, I understand.

214
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,870
I heard you cut the budget for the online store.

215
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,770
Dad.

216
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,070
The benefits of the stay-at-home economy during the pandemic

217
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,200
are already gone.

218
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,330
Rather than developing e-commerce,

219
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,300
I think we should focus on improving

220
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,730
the service experience in our physical stores...

221
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,130
Do you think Wei Jie didn't consider this?

222
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,570
I just want to trust my own judgment...

223
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,000
A new broom sweeps clean.

224
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,260
You're in a hurry to establish yourself,

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,330
but in the end, you'll only burn yourself.

226
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,100
That's enough.

227
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,700
Let's not talk business during meals.

228
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,470
It's bad for your stomach.

229
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,730
I made some chicken soup with yam

230
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,270
to nourish your stomach and boost your energy.

231
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,730
Sister Peng, the soup can be served now.

232
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,030
Coming.

233
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,330
I'll get it.

234
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,930
You see, Weiyu and the others are still young.

235
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,800
They don't have much experience.

236
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,130
For any company decisions,

237
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,230
you, as the chairman,

238
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,270
should personally guide them.

239
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,630
So,

240
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,970
your health is the most important thing.

241
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,830
I'm full.

242
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,170
You can eat without me.

243
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,630
Your father hates it when people are impatient.

244
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,930
You've just become the deputy CEO.

245
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,700
Go along with him first.

246
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,230
Bring up your plans again after some time.

247
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,930
It's all about patience.

248
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,330
Your mother has the most experience with this.

249
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,700
How is Jiang Zhihao doing lately?

250
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,170
After his mother's funeral,

251
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,670
he's been on leave at home.

252
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,970
Is that so?

253
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,070
The company is being too nice to him.

254
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,130
That was his mother.

255
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,570
Of course he needs some time to process it.

256
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,670
How long are you going to keep acting like brothers?

257
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,000
When will it end?

258
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,300
He's your biggest competitor.

259
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,100
Alright, I get it.

260
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,400
Can you please stop talking about this?

261
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,370
We've come this far.

262
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,170
I don't want to see you regret it.

263
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,070
Who is it?

264
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,230
Mom, you...

265
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,270
Girlfriend, please stop checking my phone.

266
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,670
Relentless calls.

267
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,870
When will you introduce me to her?

268
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,400
Let's have a meal together.

269
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,730
We'll talk about it later.

270
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,870
It's a promise.

271
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,570
It's hot.

272
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,100
Smells good.

273
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,069
I want the fattiest piece.

274
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,069
You should eat the leaner part.

275
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,329
I'll pick a balanced piece for you.

276
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,369
Bowl.

277
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,170
This one is good.

278
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,630
It's hot.

279
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,599
Smells so good.

280
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,170
Really hot.

281
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,130
What time is it now?

282
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,530
You're eating this when you got back?

283
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,770
That's so sinful.

284
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,400
Put down that bag of salt-water chicken first.

285
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,800
Then talk about our sins.

286
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,600
Why did you make this?

287
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,230
I'm climbing a new mountain.

288
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,470
What mountain?

289
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,200
Nothing.

290
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,060
I dreamed about Mom yesterday.

291
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,500
Really?

292
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,300
Yes, really.

293
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,970
Your mom used to love braised pork.

294
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,370
Remember when we lived in Jinshan?

295
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,300
There was a place nearby that sold braised pork rice.

296
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,230
No exaggeration.

297
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,570
She could eat it seven days a week.

298
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,500
Every time I brought braised pork rice home,

299
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,560
she'd compare it to that restaurant.

300
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,730
We moved away so long ago.

301
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,730
As if she still remembers the taste.

302
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,400
Maybe I should just come back and sell breakfast.

303
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,800
Please.

304
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,730
Don't joke with me.

305
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,430
I'm counting on you to stay on your boss's good side.

306
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,530
Hold on tight.

307
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,070
Make some money so I can enjoy life.

308
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,230
Every office worker who hates their job

309
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,800
thinks like this.

310
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,730
Check your savings.

311
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,800
Look at the numbers.

312
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,030
You'll wake up.

313
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,300
So you have a lot of savings?

314
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,900
No, I'm in debt.

315
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,160
That's what I thought.

316
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,500
Dad, eat this radish.

317
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,830
You are?

318
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,930
I'm here to get some documents for my boss.

319
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,000
The study is over there on the right...

320
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
I know. I come here often.

321
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,070
You go ahead with your work. Wet.

322
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,630
The floor is wet.

323
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,960
Be careful with that...

324
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,470
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,730
This area is still wet. Sorry about that.

326
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,930
No.

327
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,330
My water broke.

328
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,630
I...

329
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,030
I'm so sorry.

330
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,630
I just finished cleaning.

331
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,570
I've troubled you.

332
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,930
It's okay. Listen.

333
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,970
Those documents.

334
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,670
Please.

335
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,470
Could you take them to my boss at the office?

336
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,530
This is more urgent.

337
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,430
Right now?

338
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,400
Yes.

339
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,270
Please.

340
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,500
Hello, honey. Yes.

341
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,870
My water broke.

342
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,330
Bring my hospital bag.

343
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,930
Meet me at the hospital, okay?

344
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,800
Yes, now about the carpet and sofa

345
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,700
please keep an eye on them for me.

346
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,430
I know she's a neat freak.

347
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,770
Okay.

348
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,000
Thanks. Yes, meet at the hospital

349
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,770
Hurry up.

350
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,030
Pregnant women really have bad tempers.

351
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,670
I'm heading out now.

352
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,730
Hang in there, little brother.

353
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Thank you.

354
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,530
Just combine the transportation and cleaning fees.

355
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,930
Thanks.

356
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,670
Shanru, your lunch is here

357
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,200
enjoy your meal.

358
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,070
Stop!

359
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,730
You...

360
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,030
Your shrimp...

361
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,670
Shanru.

362
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,830
I bought... I made a mistake.

363
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,630
Um...

364
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,230
You don't need to come to work anymore.

365
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,060
How did you know I'm allergic to seafood?

366
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,430
Fang Nuo told me.

367
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,000
He's a person from the past now.

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,930
Let's pretend he doesn't exist.

369
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,000
He's still very much alive

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
how can we pretend he doesn't exist?

371
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,630
If you deny his existence,

372
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,400
you're denying your past self.

373
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,170
Anyway, I have something to ask you.

374
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,270
As you can see,

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,700
my assistant is on maternity leave,

376
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,030
I found a temporary replacement

377
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,530
who nearly killed me.

378
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,830
So,

379
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,930
while my assistant is away,

380
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,670
would you like to work for me?

381
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,730
I...

382
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,670
Yes,

383
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,570
come work at my company.

384
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,000
But I'm just a cleaner.

385
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,270
I...

386
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,830
Lin Liying,

387
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,970
you've picked off all the leaves.

388
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,700
What are we supposed to eat now?

389
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,870
It's just a job,

390
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,930
is it that hard to decide?

391
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,230
I don't know how to be an assistant.

392
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,430
It really is difficult.

393
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,600
The boss is asking for you

394
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,970
because she trusts your abilities.

395
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,130
I've never worked at such a prestigious company before,

396
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,300
and when I was cleaning for her,

397
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,930
she was so picky.

398
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,830
I don't know if I can do a good job.

399
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,230
What about you?

400
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,930
You probably don't remember,

401
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,730
do you know how mischievous you were as a child?

402
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,470
Whenever there was something new and exciting,

403
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,800
you were always the first to rush forward.

404
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,230
One time,

405
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,770
you took Jiang Zhihao

406
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,170
and Jiang Zhilu

407
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,500
and all of you ran off to that

408
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,630
what was it...

409
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,100
an abandoned warehouse to explore.

410
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,400
Lai Xiurong and I couldn't find any of you.

411
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I almost called the police.

412
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,870
I was the one who led them?

413
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,470
If you really want to go,

414
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,770
then just go.

415
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,830
Don't be afraid.

416
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,630
Worst case, you'll get fired.

417
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,830
Mom

418
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,430
can still afford to support you.

419
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,970
You don't have much money,

420
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,170
yet you talk like you're so impressive.

421
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,930
I still raised you well despite not having much money.

422
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,330
Chairman,

423
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,860
it's time to leave for Temporary Difference.

424
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,870
You look in good spirits.

425
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,130
Have you sorted out your family matters?

426
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,330
Things were a bit chaotic for a while,

427
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,060
but everything's settled now.

428
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,670
Good.

429
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,330
Let's go.

430
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,230
Let me introduce you to the Chairman.

431
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,070
Dad.

432
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,570
This is Jason I mentioned to you before.

433
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,500
Hello, Chairman.

434
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,830
If there are any issues with the food today,

435
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,490
you can hold him accountable.

436
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,070
You can come to me, it's fine.

437
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,800
Since it's our soft opening today,

438
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,170
we didn't invite too many people,

439
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,200
just some close friends

440
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,030
and influential KOLs.

441
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,370
No worries. I'll take care of this.

442
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,230
You go attend to the other guests.

443
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,130
Jason is very young.

444
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,030
Yes,

445
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,270
Chairman.

446
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,870
You can pair this salmon with grapefruit.

447
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,830
And this is tartar sauce.

448
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,300
Xuerui, senior.

449
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,130
Why aren't you drinking?

450
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,130
I'm not drinking today.

451
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:47,800
Um,

452
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,830
get me a Bloody Mary... Never mind, it's fine.

453
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,900
Why not? What do you mean?

454
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,830
Why? That won't do.

455
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,270
You go ahead and get busy. Hurry up. What?

456
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,300
Jupiter!

457
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,000
Wait a second.

458
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,030
Jupiter,

459
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,630
let me introduce you.

460
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,330
Jason, hello.

461
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,230
Hello, Jason. Our handsome chef.

462
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,900
So handsome! Everything okay?

463
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,930
How's the food?

464
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,870
I haven't tried it yet.

465
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,500
Take a sniff.

466
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,800
Just smell it, right? Take a sniff.

467
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,930
You guys enjoy. Go ahead with your work.

468
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,830
Take care of them.

469
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,500
Okay.

470
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,130
Thanks for coming.

471
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,100
Thank you. No problem.

472
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,400
Come on, cheers!

473
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,870
Thank you.

474
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,130
Zhihao.

475
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,500
I want to go outside and check the foot traffic in this area.

476
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,700
Come walk with me.

477
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,930
Sure, no problem.

478
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,670
The menu for Temporary Difference

479
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,330
was finalized by you and Weiyu, right?

480
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,070
I was only involved in the initial discussions.

481
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,100
After I was transferred to the Chairman's office,

482
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,530
Chef Jason took over designing the menu.

483
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,900
In the salmon breakfast plate I had today,

484
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,100
there was grapefruit in it.

485
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,570
What the Chairman means is...

486
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,330
The target customers of Temporary Difference

487
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,830
are high-spending consumers.

488
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,800
These people earn a lot of money,

489
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,930
but they also have many health issues.

490
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,130
Like Director Liu,

491
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,530
he has chronic illnesses

492
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,390
and has to take medication daily.

493
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,370
You know some medications

494
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,630
cannot be taken with grapefruit, right?

495
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,430
This is truly an oversight on our part.

496
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,330
Chairman,

497
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,130
what if we add another option to the menu

498
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,700
for those who can't eat grapefruit?

499
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,130
We could substitute it with passion fruit.

500
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,400
What do you think?

501
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,730
I'll leave the details for you to handle.

502
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,070
Chairman,

503
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,100
this blood cake stall

504
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,070
usually has long lines,

505
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,070
but there aren't many people today.

506
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,700
How good is it?

507
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,830
Two blood cakes, please.

508
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,630
Okay,

509
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,800
extra peanut powder, please.

510
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,730
Sure.

511
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,630
Would you like it spicy?

512
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes.

513
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,530
Don't you usually eat blood cake as a dessert?

514
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,530
Why different today?

515
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,830
Trying something new?

516
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,230
Chairman,

517
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,830
you actually remember that.

518
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,330
Because I happen to know someone

519
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,800
who eats blood cake the same way you do.

520
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,300
What kind of person are they?

521
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:25,930
She says

522
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,730
sweetness can cover up many of life's bitterness.

523
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,870
She's like candy,

524
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,600
bringing happiness to people.

525
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,030
Chairman, do you remember

526
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,900
when we ate

527
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,960
blood cake with egg crepes together?

528
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,000
You also said you often think of someone.

529
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,670
This person must be very important to you

530
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,770
for you to think of her so often.

531
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,400
Here you go.

532
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,000
Here.

533
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,070
Thank you.

534
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,770
100 yuan. Keep the change.

535
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,130
Really? Thank you.

536
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,570
Thank you.

537
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,600
It smells so good.

538
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,570
Chairman,

539
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,700
I came back to the company today

540
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,070
to submit my resignation.

541
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,570
Why?

542
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,870
I have plans for my life

543
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,230
and things I want to do next.

544
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,070
It's a pity,

545
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,830
but since you've already decided,

546
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,430
I'll respect your decision.

547
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,160
Come, let's sit here and eat our blood cakes.

548
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,770
Thank you, Chairman.

549
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,170
The blood cakes here are really delicious.

550
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,790
Even though you've resigned,

551
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,700
we can still come here together next time.

552
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,330
It's really delicious.

553
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,430
Are you really quitting?

554
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,970
Yes.

555
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,900
Resigning is something

556
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,970
as serious as whether I can get an extra braised egg in my noodles.

557
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,600
How could I joke about that?

558
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,300
What about this temporary assignment?

559
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,760
You haven't even started working on those planning projects.

560
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,870
Deng Weiyu.

561
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,700
I've already helped you become VP.

562
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,430
Isn't that loyal enough?

563
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,070
I have my own life plans too.

564
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,870
You need to learn to grow up.

565
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,930
Fine, I understand.

566
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,900
Just go do what you want to do.

567
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,690
I'll definitely support you anyway.

568
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,330
When you submitted your resignation,

569
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,860
did my father say anything?

570
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,970
The chairman wouldn't be bored enough

571
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,630
to care what a resigning employee is going to do.

572
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,730
But he did tell me

573
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,570
he has some suggestions for the temporary menu.

574
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,230
I'll organize them later

575
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,200
and discuss them with Jason.

576
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,600
About the menu?

577
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Yes.

578
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,830
He only told you?

579
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,800
Maybe because I happened to be next to him.

580
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,830
Got one!

581
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,500
Ma'am.

582
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,930
What would you like, handsome?

583
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,600
How much are these green onions?

584
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,000
120, 270.

585
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,530
270. Do you need a bag?

586
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,270
No need, I have a car.

587
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,730
OK, 270. Let me put this down for a moment.

588
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,170
270.

589
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,530
Give me one set meal.

590
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
OK.

591
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,630
Jiang Zhihao.

592
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,700
Did you know I have a math exam today?

593
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,500
Is that why you're selling breakfast again?

594
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,630
To cheer me on?

595
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,970
Yes.

596
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,930
But even though you have an exam,

597
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,870
I won't give you a discount.

598
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,000
It'll be ready soon.

599
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,170
Grand reopening!

600
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,000
Excuse me, kids first.

601
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,830
Here you go. Good luck!

602
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,870
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

603
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,100
Selling braised pork wraps? Thanks, ma'am.

604
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,970
Yes.

605
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,400
This is for you,

606
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,200
but it's not a braised pork wrap.

607
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,430
It's your first day at work today.

608
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,430
Good luck!

609
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,270
Alright.

610
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,700
Hurry to work.

611
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,530
Bye-bye.

612
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,270
Just a moment.

613
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,370
Coffee's ready.

614
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,170
Good.

615
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,670
Excuse me. The coffee is ready.

616
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,070
That's mine. Sorry.

617
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,800
Thank you.

618
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,930
This is mine.

619
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,000
Thank you. OK.

620
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,800
Excuse me, miss.

621
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,430
This is my coffee. Sorry.

622
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,730
Boss,

623
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,100
where's my oat milk latte?

624
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,630
Just a moment.

625
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,370
OK. I'll prepare it right away.

626
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,130
Add a double shot.

627
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,070
OK, no problem.

628
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,870
Hot.

629
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,730
OK.

630
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,100
Hello, I'm here to pick up Zhuo Shanru's

631
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,300
Sister Shanru's clothes.

632
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,030
OK.

633
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,230
Come, over here.

634
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,100
Good.

635
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,500
Wait for me a moment.

636
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,830
Jerry, I...

637
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,170
J-I-M-M-Y.

638
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,600
Jimmy.

639
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,770
Sorry.

640
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,230
I want to heat up a bagel.

641
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,469
Where's the kitchen?

642
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,699
Thanks.

643
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,230
Remember,

644
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,760
I don't eat before important presentations.

645
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,000
Are you doing okay?

646
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,930
Still adjusting to the routine.

647
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,730
How about you?

648
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,300
How's the production going?

649
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,000
Don't worry about me.

650
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,470
It's you.

651
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,030
Working with our boss,

652
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,030
you need a strong heart.

653
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,100
You're really doing great so far.

654
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,700
At 4 p.m.,

655
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
the presentation for the airline company.

656
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,930
Make sure you double-check everything.

657
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,970
You know our company

658
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,200
isn't in the best shape lately.

659
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,030
We must get this deal.

660
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,870
I have.

661
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,300
I've reorganized all the materials.

662
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
It should be fine

663
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,400
I think.

664
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,130
This is Pan-Air's

665
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,170
first collaboration with a food brand.

666
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,330
I believe

667
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,970
only by partnering with Notoast

668
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,100
can we achieve a one-plus-one

669
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,870
equals infinite value.

670
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,130
CEO Zhuo,

671
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,170
I'd like to be straightforward

672
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,100
and share my honest thoughts.

673
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,430
Regarding the recent divorce scandal at Notoast,

674
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,900
I know you're also a victim,

675
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,800
but I must admit,

676
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,270
Fang Nuo was the soul of Notoast,

677
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,770
but he's gone now.

678
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,970
I don't know if Notoast

679
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,230
will still be the same Notoast as before.

680
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,900
It seems

681
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,700
our first proposal

682
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,500
isn't satisfactory to VP Huang.

683
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,400
That's okay.

684
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,670
We have another one.

685
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,000
Please take a look at it.

686
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,100
Liying, show the other one.

687
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,930
The other... the other one.

688
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,800
The other one is...

689
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,300
I don't have another one.

690
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,770
You didn't bring it?

691
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,070
You can't even do something this simple?

692
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,030
What are you here for?

693
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,830
No, I... let me ask you.

694
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,930
I'm really sorry, VP Huang.

695
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,370
We've embarrassed ourselves.

696
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,000
This assistant is new.

697
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,230
I'll teach her properly when we get back.

698
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,130
Tomorrow,

699
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,230
I'll definitely bring the presentation tomorrow.

700
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,960
Please give me another chance.

701
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,770
Shanru.

702
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,130
Is everyone from the planning department back?

703
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,400
Meeting in 5 minutes.

704
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,330
Amy is going to her goddaughter's birthday party,

705
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,030
and Tongtong is attending a class reunion.

706
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,230
It's so last minute for them...

707
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,730
If we don't get this deal,

708
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,530
everyone,

709
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,470
including myself,

710
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,900
will be out of a job.

711
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,570
Ask them if they want to come back.

712
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,570
Okay, I'll call and ask them.

713
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,030
Shanru.

714
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,670
I just double-checked again.

715
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,400
I'm absolutely certain

716
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,930
that I didn't receive another briefing.

717
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,190
Don't you understand the situation yet?

718
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,230
There was never any other briefing.

719
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,370
I said that on purpose

720
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,200
to give them

721
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,100
another chance to work with us.

722
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,800
Is my explanation

723
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,500
clear enough for you?

724
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,700
So you're still standing here

725
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,800
waiting for me to apologize?

726
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,700
No.

727
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,430
I'll go make the call.

728
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,800
Shanru,

729
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,730
about tonight at 8:30,

730
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,830
the dinner with Mr. Baimu,

731
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,300
should I reschedule it?

732
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,770
You go instead of me.

733
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,700
Me?

734
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,430
Sincerely apologize to him

735
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,290
and reschedule the appointment.

736
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,030
I worked hard through connections

737
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,070
to get this meeting with him.

738
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,030
Don't mess this up.

739
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,130
Okay,

740
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
should I go alone?

741
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,970
What, do you need an assistant?

742
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,130
No.

743
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,370
Mr. Baimu

744
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,900
You're the clueless one.

745
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,900
Or is it Miss Baimu?

746
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,870
Lin Liying

747
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,030
Gao Bohan

748
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,770
I'm just going to study abroad.

749
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,030
It doesn't mean we're breaking up.

750
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,100
I'll still come back.

751
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,000
Something as important as going abroad,

752
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,130
why didn't you tell me?

753
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,500
I'm your girlfriend!

754
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,370
I told you as soon as I knew for sure.

755
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,230
Can't you think about me for once?

756
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,500
You're being unreasonable.

757
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,670
Unreasonable, am I?

758
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,700
I'll show you what being unreasonable really means, Lin Liying.

759
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,500
This is what being unreasonable looks like. Stop it! That hurts!

760
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,630
Since the first day we got together,

761
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,000
I've been unreasonable. Stop hitting me! I'm telling you...

762
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,730
Why are you Baimu?

763
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,770
How can you be Mr. Baimu?

764
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,570
The 'Bo' in Bohan.

765
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,930
It's just 'white' and 'wood' characters.

766
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,570
And I studied art,

767
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,970
eventually becoming an illustrator.

768
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,300
What's wrong with that?

769
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,730
Nothing's wrong.

770
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,100
I just didn't expect you to be so famous.

771
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,730
What did you expect?

772
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,670
Did you want me to be poor and miserable?

773
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,670
I once wished for that,

774
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,870
but it seems

775
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,900
the universe didn't take my order.

776
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,430
What about you?

777
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,700
How are you?

778
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,300
How did you end up working at Notus?

779
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,570
Let's talk about work first.

780
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,730
Wait.

781
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,770
I know what you're going to say.

782
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,900
But actually, I've never tried Notus.

783
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,900
After today, you will have.

784
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,830
What I mean is,

785
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,930
I don't plan to collaborate with Notus.

786
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,330
I came today

787
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,370
because a close elder

788
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,100
asked me to.

789
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,070
I

790
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,100
couldn't refuse.

791
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,430
So that's why,

792
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,400
but I won't take any commercial projects.

793
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,990
Is there really no room for negotiation?

794
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,900
Really none.

795
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,670
So can we still

796
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,000
enjoy this meal?

797
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,070
This meal

798
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,270
can be expensed.

799
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,430
Then we can start chatting.

800
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,030
How are you?

801
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,830
I'm really hungry.

802
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,170
Why don't you go first?

803
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,600
Actually, I've been divorced three times.

804
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,300
My first wife

805
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,870
took all my money and ran.

806
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,700
Then my second wife

807
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,500
had a child with me.

808
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,730
But later I found out

809
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,600
the child wasn't mine.

810
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,970
Then my third wife

811
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,330
told me something about

812
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,800
all worldly things

813
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,570
being empty and meaningless,

814
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,400
and then she became a nun.

815
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,460
My life hasn't been great either.

816
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,230
My father's toy factory went bankrupt.

817
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,870
On the day of my engagement party,

818
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,400
I discovered that the person responsible for our factory's bankruptcy

819
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,970
was my fiancé.

820
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,730
I wanted to seek justice,

821
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,600
but my father took money from the enemy

822
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,730
and sided with them.

823
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,230
What I just said

824
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,800
was just a joke.

825
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,330
What I just said was all true.

826
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,370
Excuse me, miss.

827
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,000
Alright.

828
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,100
We'd like to order a bottle of red wine.

829
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,900
OK, no problem. Coming right up.

830
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:47,830
It's on me.

831
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,700
Excuse me, miss.

832
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,800
Great.

833
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,300
Two bottles. OK.

834
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,830
You don't eat spicy food. Eat from this side.

835
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:57,900
Go ahead, eat.

836
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,830
I don't believe it.

837
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,570
I can't believe you care about stray animals now.

838
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,330
You used to be afraid of even Chihuahuas.

839
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,470
That's impossible.

840
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,300
I'm a very caring person, okay?

841
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,470
You are caring.

842
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,530
Lin Liying.

843
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,970
Jiang Zhihao.

844
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,170
Gao Bohan.

845
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,830
Being with you

846
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,230
and then rashly breaking up

847
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,630
is the thing I regret most in my life.

848
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:16,830
If mom were still here,

849
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,730
what do you think she would want you to do?

850
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,600
Don't worry.

851
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,700
Your mother is gone,

852
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,130
but life must go on.

853
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,800
Mom,

854
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,300
Jiang Zhihao was mean to me.

855
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,600
Did you talk back to him?

856
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,100
Auntie, I'm Jiang Zhilu.

857
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,630
I thought you looked familiar just now.

858
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,830
You're my mother's guest.

859
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,070
Don't get involved with Jiang Zhihao.

860
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,870
Break up with his sister quickly.

861
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,330
Do you know why?

862
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,770
How could you do this?

863
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,970
How could you act this way?
