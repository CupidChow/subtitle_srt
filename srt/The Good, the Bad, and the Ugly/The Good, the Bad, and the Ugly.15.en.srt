1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,030
What's so great about Gao Baihan?

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,800
I hope his flight gets delayed.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,130
People cut in line when he boards.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,200
He gets diarrhea while boarding.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,370
And there's no toilet paper.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,130
He can't find a taxi after landing.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,330
He's going to study abroad, right?

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,700
So I hope he gets...

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,000
Ostracized by his classmates.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,230
Disliked by his professors.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,800
Forgets to save his thesis.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,970
And can't graduate.

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,470
Why are you cursing him?

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,470
He didn't mean it.

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,970
Strange.

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,630
We haven't actually broken up.

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,530
It's already over.

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,070
From now on, my birthday wish every year

19
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,430
Will be for you,

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,630
Lin Liying.

21
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,090
That you'll never run into Gao Baihan again.

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,200
What if I want to see him?

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,370
What are you doing?

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,800
Heartbroken and still stealing my food?

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,289
I forgot to make a wish. Do you have any more of those popping candies you like?

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,300
You must have missed these snacks.

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,270
Yes, indeed.

28
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,430
Cheers.

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,470
Thanks.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,330
You've been in America for about 10 years now.

31
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:35,870
Pretty much.

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,300
Yes, it's been 10 years.

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,600
Are you married?

34
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,930
Three times already.

35
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,370
Three times.

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,330
What are you laughing at?

37
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,130
You're talking nonsense.

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,229
I'm not married.

39
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,800
I can't believe it.

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,470
You're handsome.

41
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,200
And successful in your career.

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,930
How could you possibly not have a girlfriend?

43
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,800
Tell me.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,570
Why?

45
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,700
Is it because of a divorce?

46
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,530
Cheating,

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,430
getting caught,

48
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,670
kicked out...

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,270
What?

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,900
Actually, all these years

51
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,760
there's been someone in my heart.

52
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,070
Don't use such a lame line.

53
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,630
Lin Liying, don't listen.

54
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,930
If you're going to talk about Lin Liying,

55
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,570
this script is terrible.

56
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,930
It's you.

57
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,170
Jiang Zhihao.

58
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,370
The person in my heart all these years

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,900
has always been you.

60
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,400
I told you

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,770
he would fall for it.

62
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,900
Lin Liying.

63
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,500
Why do you always take his side?

64
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,070
Have you forgotten

65
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,670
how upset you were back then?

66
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,300
Let me tell you,

67
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,070
people need to learn to grow up.

68
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,970
Gao Bohan,

69
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,630
I don't love you anymore.

70
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,830
Go love him instead.

71
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,600
Love him, kiss him,

72
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,329
shut him up with your lips.

73
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,030
Go away.

74
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,370
Jiang Zhihao, go away.

75
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,300
Don't come near me. Jiang Zhihao, what are you doing?

76
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,870
Don't come near me. Kiss him.

77
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,600
Kiss him. Do it.

78
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,930
One kiss won't hurt.

79
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,800
Hurry up.

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,300
Jiang Zhihao! Lin Liying, take him away!

81
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,700
That's for Dad.

82
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,930
Dad left early this morning.

83
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,200
You're spacing out.

84
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,700
Jiang Zhihao.

85
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,170
Don't you think Dad's been acting strange lately?

86
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,500
Dad seems pretty normal to me.

87
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,630
No, that's just it. He's too normal.

88
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,800
You know what Niu Yifei told me the other day?

89
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,930
What?

90
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,800
He said he saw Dad taking the bus.

91
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,870
I've seen him for several days

92
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,900
waiting for the bus.

93
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,200
He takes the bus every day.

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,270
That's right.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,230
He asked how to get to the car wash

96
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,330
and wanted me to teach him how to take the bus.

97
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,370
Then I casually asked him

98
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,470
if he wanted to apply for a senior citizen card.

99
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,230
Turns out he's not even 65 yet!

100
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,330
He looks way older than his age.

101
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,700
Right?

102
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,100
You're saying my dad takes the bus to the car wash?

103
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,930
He goes to wash cars?

104
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,330
That's right.

105
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,500
You know your father's hobby?

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,630
Now he's

107
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,900
living frugally.

108
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,200
He has money.

109
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,530
Money and people.

110
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,000
What do you think he can do?

111
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,200
Mr. Jiang.

112
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,870
Want to come join us?

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,230
You guys go ahead.

114
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,830
What you see here

115
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,100
are all the co-branding partners we're currently negotiating with.

116
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,870
That means

117
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,030
this proposal uses a dual co-branding approach

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,700
to collaborate with Panda Airways.

119
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,600
We'll handle everything this time

120
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,370
and try our best to meet all your requirements.

121
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,130
We've also secured Mr. Baimu.

122
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,570
We approached him ourselves,

123
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,630
but he wasn't interested in commercial partnerships.

124
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,630
Really?

125
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,730
It seems

126
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,970
the power of good food works wonders.

127
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,970
We've already spoken with Mr. Baimu.

128
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,030
He says he's a fan of our Nuo Toast

129
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,800
and really enjoys our products,

130
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,030
so he's willing to collaborate.

131
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,230
I've actually never tried Nuo Toast.

132
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,170
Based on our last meeting,

133
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,200
the collaboration is as good as done,

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,260
no backing out now.

135
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,270
What I mean is,

136
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,170
I don't plan to collaborate with Nuo Toast.

137
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,030
No plans to work with Nuo Toast.

138
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,130
If it's Mr. Baimu,

139
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,870
we would be very interested.

140
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,970
That's great!

141
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,970
So what Deputy Director Huang means is

142
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,830
we can start drafting the contract and proceed with the process.

143
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,570
What I'm saying is,

144
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,770
if you can secure Mr. Baimu,

145
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,100
then things should go smoothly from here.

146
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,430
Okay.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,930
After that,

148
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,260
I'll have Liying schedule a time with you.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,130
Alright.

150
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,370
Shanru.

151
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,870
Sales are down this week.

152
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,800
The Qingcheng store is closed too.

153
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,470
Got it.

154
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,630
The items on the shelf weren't baked today.

155
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,630
Take them all down.

156
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,870
Make sure customers get everything at its freshest.

157
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,300
Yes, understood.

158
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,330
Shanru.

159
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,630
I might not have been clear this morning.

160
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,670
But last night,

161
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,170
Mr. Baimu clearly rejected me.

162
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,430
Do you know something?

163
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,200
The sales figures from last month and this month

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,730
are worlds apart.

165
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,500
A few months ago,

166
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Fang Nuo was still a loving husband who adored his wife.

167
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,670
And now?

168
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,100
In this world,

169
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,630
the only constant truth

170
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,700
is that everything changes.

171
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,470
Gao Bohan didn't want to cooperate yesterday,

172
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,130
but that doesn't mean he won't want to today or tomorrow.

173
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,370
Whatever method or means necessary,

174
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,300
we need to change his mind. I can't think of...

175
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,970
Invite him to the company for a meeting.

176
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,570
The sooner the better.

177
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,100
Use your senior-junior relationship.

178
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,470
Beg if you have to, but get him here.

179
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,400
Beg?

180
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm really...

181
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,630
not good at begging.

182
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,700
Do I need to...

183
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,900
You're not working today?

184
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,330
And you can even cook?

185
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,470
I took two hours off.

186
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,900
I thought

187
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,530
it should be my turn to cook once in a while.

188
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,130
Dad.

189
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,900
You've been leaving early and coming home late.

190
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,300
What have you been doing?

191
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,130
It's not what you think.

192
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,600
I haven't been gambling.

193
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,000
Really, I haven't been gambling.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,230
I just found a simple job.

195
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,130
Thought I'd save some money.

196
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,070
Just in case we need it for emergencies.

197
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,800
It's more reassuring that way.

198
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,100
We know.

199
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,770
We've seen it all.

200
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,330
You've been following me?

201
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,900
Actually,

202
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,630
that car wash job

203
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,670
isn't that hard.

204
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,970
It's tiring, sure,

205
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,700
but I get paid in cash every day.

206
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,230
It's very satisfying.

207
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,600
And also,

208
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,170
I can build my muscles.

209
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,670
I'm not bragging, look.

210
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,970
My muscles are showing now.

211
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,900
I wish your mom could feel them.

212
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,400
Besides,

213
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,230
your little stall doesn't make much money either.

214
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,670
Your mom is gone.

215
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,470
The beauty salon

216
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,530
doesn't bring in any income anymore.

217
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,930
But don't worry.

218
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,470
See?

219
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,030
I'm in good shape.

220
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,370
No need to worry.

221
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,030
Life must go on.

222
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,100
Eat.

223
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,400
Have you thought about going back to your job?

224
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,830
Not at all.

225
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,030
But wait,

226
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,670
you were doing fine at your job.

227
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,070
Then suddenly you wanted to do your own thing.

228
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,230
You wanted to open your own breakfast shop.

229
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,030
I already did.

230
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,530
That's hardly a breakfast shop.

231
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,800
Just a tiny stall.

232
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,470
And you're so full of yourself,

233
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,100
making those so-called 'limited editions.'

234
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,700
How much can you really make?

235
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,170
Dad's so old now.

236
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,430
He's gone from being childish to mature.

237
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,930
If you want, open a real breakfast shop.

238
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,600
A proper store.

239
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,070
Right, Weiyu?

240
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,200
What?

241
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,730
I told him to open his own shop.

242
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,170
If you're not going back to Linlin,

243
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,830
then of course it's better to open your own shop.

244
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,000
But have you really made up your mind?

245
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,530
If Mom were still here,

246
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,490
what do you think she would want you to do?

247
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,270
Founder of renowned premium toast chain.

248
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,830
After his extramarital affair was exposed,

249
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,530
his business has taken a significant hit.

250
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,600
Besides the three directly-operated stores closed this month,

251
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,100
the co-branded products with breakfast shops

252
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,630
are also reportedly experiencing poor sales.

253
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,870
Lin Liying.

254
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,370
Come out and look at this!

255
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,270
This...

256
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,900
Is this your company?

257
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,830
Will we not get paid?

258
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,230
What's wrong?

259
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,070
Why are you here so early?

260
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,200
It suddenly started pouring.

261
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,330
Yeah.

262
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,590
My colleagues went out for lunch and haven't returned yet.

263
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,600
Did I come too early?

264
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,430
Have you eaten?

265
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,500
I can get something for you.

266
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,430
I haven't eaten yet.

267
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,830
I was preparing materials for our meeting.

268
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,370
Meeting?

269
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm leaving.

270
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,000
Hold on, please!

271
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,700
Who said the boss is Mr. Baimu's fan?

272
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,930
That part is true.

273
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,000
And that today is her birthday?

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,170
And wanted to give her a special surprise?

275
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,370
That part is false.

276
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,670
I even bought special gifts.

277
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,730
To help you save face.

278
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,900
That's really thoughtful of you.

279
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,130
I'm a bit upset.

280
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,070
Don't think of it as a meeting.

281
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,270
Just sit down and listen to a brief presentation.

282
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,630
Have some afternoon tea.

283
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,000
How does that sound?

284
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,070
No.

285
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,630
How did you get hurt? Did I...

286
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,930
Did I just do that?

287
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,270
Yes.

288
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,900
So you should help bandage it.

289
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,700
And listen to the presentation while you're at it.

290
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,170
Fine. Sit down.

291
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,300
I'll take care of it.

292
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,100
Yes!

293
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,830
Hurry up.

294
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,030
You still carry a first aid kit with you?

295
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,470
Of course.

296
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,330
It's very useful in emergencies.

297
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,200
The rain has stopped.

298
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,070
It rains a lot around here.

299
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,100
Shanru, why aren't you going in?

300
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,930
Yeah.

301
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,530
The guests have already arrived.

302
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,000
We need to hurry inside to prepare for the meeting.

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,230
Okay, no need.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Don't attend the upcoming meeting.

305
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
Where should we go then?

306
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,800
Let's go buy coffee.

307
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,770
Let's go.

308
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
Is it good?

309
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,930
It's okay.

310
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,430
Shanru.

311
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,900
Where's Jimmy and the others?

312
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,370
They went to take care of something else.

313
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,730
Hello, Mr. Baimu.

314
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,970
I'm Shanru.

315
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,070
Hello. I've heard so much about you.

316
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,900
Finally meeting you in person.

317
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,960
I heard you and Liying were senior and junior at school.

318
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,370
Although Liying just joined Notus,

319
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,100
she's really excellent. Look,

320
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,600
this collaboration project was her idea.

321
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
Our partners really love it.

322
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,130
Liying is great, really.

323
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,800
And she's very attentive too.

324
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,700
This proposal is excellent.

325
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,400
The collaboration is fine.

326
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,700
It's just that...

327
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,370
Business partnership.

328
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,030
Mr. Baimu probably won't sign in the near future.

329
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,300
Happy birthday.

330
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,230
I'm leaving.

331
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Mr. Baimu.

332
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,930
This three-way collaboration

333
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,900
offers high exposure

334
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,270
and a substantial budget.

335
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,600
I really

336
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,000
don't understand

337
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,900
why you're refusing.

338
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
I don't mean anything by it.

339
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,370
I just don't see a reason to collaborate.

340
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,300
So you're saying

341
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,170
our current proposal

342
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,700
doesn't move you?

343
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,900
Okay.

344
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,770
Then I'll be direct.

345
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,800
For this project,

346
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,470
you're the only illustrator we want.

347
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,500
So no matter how good this proposal is,

348
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,230
if you're not interested, we don't want it either.

349
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,030
Could you give us another chance?

350
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,300
Liying and I will create a new proposal.

351
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,500
One that you'll see

352
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
and immediately want to collaborate with us.

353
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,900
Okay?

354
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,430
Shanru.

355
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,370
I really don't know how to write proposals.

356
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,030
You're about to learn.

357
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,370
Read these books.

358
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,570
Even if I finish reading all these and drinking all this,

359
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,570
I still might not be able to write it.

360
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,570
Gao Bohan actually made a good point.

361
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,270
Without an urgent reason,

362
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,600
you can't do things well.

363
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,530
Alright.

364
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,470
I'll give you an urgent reason.

365
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,230
If we don't get this project,

366
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,700
prepare to be unemployed.

367
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,170
No way.

368
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,830
Not just you, but everyone,

369
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,930
because Notus might be gone.

370
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,900
You can take this as pressure,

371
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,000
but you can also use it as motivation.

372
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,000
Proposal Studies.

373
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,830
Dad.

374
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,100
Can you help me with something?

375
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,900
Sure.

376
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,600
Let's go.

377
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,430
Here.

378
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,530
So much breakfast!

379
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,730
Could you

380
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,500
try this dish for me?

381
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,400
Did you make all this?

382
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,330
Yes.

383
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,570
Try it.

384
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,470
It's quite unique.

385
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,830
This is called...

386
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,130
Blood Cake Omelet.

387
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,070
Blood Cake Omelet.

388
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,530
That's special.

389
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,500
Never seen this before.

390
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,970
This is called Exploding Lava Fried Bun.

391
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,430
Actually, I haven't finalized the name yet.

392
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,900
This one is obviously

393
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,800
French toast.

394
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,500
Yes. I haven't named this one either,

395
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,970
but I added lots of cheese inside,

396
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,230
the expensive kind, regardless of cost.

397
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,130
Try it.

398
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,200
Have a taste.

399
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,500
It's fragrant.

400
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,900
The cheese smells great.

401
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,200
Dad.

402
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,300
I want to discuss something with you.

403
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,930
What is it?

404
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,670
I want to turn the beauty salon in front

405
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,430
into a breakfast shop.

406
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,470
A breakfast shop?

407
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,200
That's great.

408
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,800
Your mother

409
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
always loved lively places.

410
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,030
After she passed away,

411
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,370
the beauty salon felt so empty.

412
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,600
I support you.

413
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,170
But I might not be able to handle it alone.

414
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,770
Can you help me?

415
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,630
Of course!

416
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,500
How could you run it by yourself?

417
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,100
I'll definitely help you.

418
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,330
Thanks, Dad.

419
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,530
Is it good?

420
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,730
Let me tell you,

421
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,400
you could add more cheese.

422
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,100
Cheese?

423
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,230
But that would cost too much.

424
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,030
I've already added many layers.

425
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,770
This one is good too.

426
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,430
This one,

427
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,600
it looks really...

428
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,500
delicious.

429
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,230
Mom's favorite cilantro.

430
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,770
Hello, miss.

431
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,200
This way, please.

432
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,030
Okay.

433
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,430
Hello.

434
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,800
Come.

435
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,570
That's 35 dollars.

436
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
Okay, wait.

437
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,160
I'll pay after it's ready.

438
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,700
Please line up here.

439
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,100
Blood cake omelet, right?

440
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,970
Okay, just a moment.

441
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,170
Alright.

442
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,930
Announcement from the office:

443
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,030
Today at Shichang Elementary School parking lot,

444
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,630
there's a blood donation vehicle.

445
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,500
We'd like to ask all of you,

446
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,330
passionate youth and core members.

447
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,630
Stay strong and healthy

448
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,700
Donate blood, save a life.

449
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,630
After donating blood,

450
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,430
make sure to replenish your nutrients.

451
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,370
Our Good Neighbor.

452
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,430
San Francisco Beauty Salon Breakfast Shop is now open!

453
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,500
Before you came for haircuts,

454
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,070
now you come for breakfast.

455
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,730
Our chef Jiang Zhihao

456
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,370
has carefully developed special breakfast items.

457
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,770
They're incredibly delicious!

458
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,500
Dear neighbors,

459
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,670
you can't find these anywhere else.

460
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,100
Come quickly to San Francisco Beauty Salon

461
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,670
for breakfast now!

462
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,800
Hello.

463
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,630
Thank you, Mr. Jiang. Director.

464
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,630
Let me tell you,

465
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,670
our Zhihao's breakfast

466
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,000
is incredibly delicious.

467
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,870
I believe it.

468
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,570
Come often in the future.

469
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,370
Sure, no problem.

470
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,970
I'll definitely bring lots of people here, okay?

471
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,730
Really?

472
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,700
Yes, thank you.

473
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,130
Would you like anything else?

474
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,670
Fried tangyuan, 80 dollars.

475
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,030
It's on the house.

476
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,970
Lin Liying,

477
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,170
stop playing on your computer

478
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,230
and eat faster.

479
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,470
Thanks.

480
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,570
You should tell Zhihao

481
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,800
that opening a shop should be in the city center

482
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,400
where there are more people and it's livelier.

483
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,900
He can make his own decisions.

484
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,170
Mom, I need to work overtime later.

485
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,300
There's too much work and I can't finish it all.

486
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,870
Eat before you go to work.

487
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,030
You need to eat before working.

488
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,900
I don't even know what appetite feels like anymore.

489
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,070
Just eat a little.

490
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,730
Jiang Zhihao.

491
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,630
I really don't understand

492
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,130
why you suddenly started selling smoked chicken sandwiches.

493
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,200
Isn't it good?

494
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,330
It's delicious.

495
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,200
Then that's all that matters.

496
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,130
If you're selling it just for me...

497
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,930
This puts a lot of pressure on me.

498
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,230
What if they don't sell well?

499
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,030
Don't worry.

500
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,330
Don't stress yourself out.

501
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,970
I was only against you when I refused to sell before.

502
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,900
Bullying a child.

503
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,070
Mom.

504
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,530
What's wrong?

505
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,930
That guy was mean to me.

506
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,300
I want another toast.

507
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,770
And also an egg pancake. Okay.

508
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,130
Did you talk back to him?

509
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,030
What? Did you lose the argument?

510
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,830
Well, nothing we can do.

511
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,400
Go home and practice more.

512
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,030
Are you just brushing me off?

513
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,500
Of course not.

514
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,130
How could I brush you off?

515
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,830
You're not whipped cream.

516
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,930
What? Not funny?

517
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,870
Exactly.

518
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,100
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,430
I was just joking.

520
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,630
Just kidding around.

521
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,270
She has a tough personality.

522
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,400
Can't take a joke.

523
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,860
She'll be fine in a minute.

524
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,400
Here's my business card.

525
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,260
Thank you for taking care of Miaomiao's breakfast.

526
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,900
You're a producer?

527
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,870
Wait for me a moment.

528
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,800
Niu Yifei.

529
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Flyers.

530
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,300
Here.

531
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,130
Next time if you want to eat here,

532
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,670
book in advance so you won't have to wait.

533
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,770
Sure.

534
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,830
Is this your phone number?

535
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,730
Yes.

536
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,130
Great artist,

537
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,230
seriously?

538
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,330
You're not replying to messages or answering calls.

539
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,370
Didn't we agree to meet at 2?

540
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,700
It's been over an hour now.

541
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,530
Should I call the police for you?

542
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,900
Did something happen?

543
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,330
Hello?

544
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,830
I'm so sorry.

545
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,830
I didn't mean to stand you up.

546
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,870
I'm completely stuck right now.

547
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,100
I can't make it there.

548
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,800
Can we reschedule?

549
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,400
Wait.

550
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,830
Or maybe you could come rescue me?

551
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,970
Rescue you?

552
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes.

553
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,570
You could come rescue me.

554
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,570
Could you come rescue me? Please!

555
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,700
Come save me!

556
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,130
What does that mean?

557
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,370
This is a food competition show

558
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,070
produced by an international platform.

559
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,300
The third season will be filmed in Taiwan.

560
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,570
You can think of it as

561
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,630
a breakfast shop version of Hell's Kitchen.

562
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,770
A milder version.

563
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,070
I'd like to invite

564
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,170
San Francisco Beauty to participate.

565
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,030
But my shop just opened.

566
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,170
It's open already.

567
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,070
Why do I feel like you're

568
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,030
a grown-up version of Miaomiao?

569
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,400
I'm her idol.

570
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,200
My shop just opened,

571
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,400
so I don't want to get involved in all this stuff right now.

572
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,830
San Francisco Beauty will be a hit.

573
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,670
Don't be so modest.

574
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,270
So you can tell fortunes too?

575
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,570
Your breakfast is unique,

576
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,700
service is efficient,

577
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,030
prices are reasonable.

578
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,970
The boss is handsome enough.

579
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,270
Get on TV, do some promotion,

580
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,800
and by my calculations,

581
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,730
you could open a branch next year.

582
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,770
One location only,

583
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,800
no branches ever,

584
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,670
thank you.

585
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,470
How about scheduling a feature interview first?

586
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,530
Free publicity.

587
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,900
Think about it.

588
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,670
That sounds possible,

589
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,670
doesn't it?

590
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,600
She

591
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,770
looks so familiar.

592
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,500
Why are you here?

593
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,670
I haven't contacted you in ten years.

594
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,470
I know I shouldn't be here.

595
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,500
When you went to study in America,

596
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,370
I was upset with you,

597
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,770
so I couldn't bring myself

598
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,430
to tell you that...

599
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,400
Even with the distance,

600
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,600
we should have tried... ex-boyfriend.

601
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,290
Even though we broke up in the end,

602
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,700
we tried until the very end, didn't we?

603
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,500
Being with you

604
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,330
and then rashly breaking up

605
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,370
is the thing I regret most in my life.

606
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,430
Today when I heard you were going on a blind date,

607
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,300
I knew I had to come.

608
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,330
I'm sorry.

609
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,000
It's been ten years.

610
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,900
I should be brave for myself just once.

611
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,530
Gao Bohan.

612
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,230
Can our unfinished love story

613
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,700
continue?

614
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,370
Where are you going?

615
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,670
How could you say something so disgusting?

616
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,400
Are you okay?

617
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,730
That was very convincing just now.

618
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,930
How could you write such disgusting lines?

619
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,630
You really owe me one.

620
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,600
Alright, hurry up and come eat when you're done.

621
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,670
Still want to eat?

622
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,570
I...

623
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,700
Being with you

624
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,200
is the thing I regret most in my life.

625
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,970
Rekindled romance.

626
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,530
No way. What nonsense is this?

627
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,700
What did I just see?

628
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,430
Jiang Zhilu!

629
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,200
Table three. Cut it.

630
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,500
How much is this?

631
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,970
120. Thank you.

632
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,200
Perfect.

633
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,830
Thank you for coming.

634
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,490
Please come again. Thank you.

635
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,800
Jiang Zhilu.

636
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,100
Can you be a bit more friendly?

637
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,800
Who would want to come back with that attitude?

638
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,070
Have you seen what time it is?

639
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,430
The fact that I'm standing here with my eyes open

640
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,270
is already impressive enough, okay?

641
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,900
Hurry up and hire someone.

642
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,770
Otherwise one day I'll just drop dead right in front of you.

643
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,670
I already posted the ad. Didn't you see it?

644
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,700
Someone should be coming soon.

645
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,030
Hello.

646
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,870
Welcome!

647
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,470
We're here for an interview.

648
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,200
Really?

649
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,730
I'll just touch up my makeup. I'll be right back.

650
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,530
Jiang Zhilu.

651
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,230
What?

652
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,570
Finish what you're doing first. Alright.

653
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,100
It's okay. Hurry up.

654
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,930
You two carry on.

655
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,770
We'll shoot some footage.

656
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,600
Okay.

657
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,370
Sorry about this. Let's go.

658
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,070
It's cooler inside.

659
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,030
Good.

660
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,300
Hurry up!

661
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,770
Come, please sit.

662
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,770
No.

663
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,770
We're here to conduct an interview.

664
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,730
So you're the interview team?

665
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,700
Yes.

666
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,970
Those two are still busy.

667
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,900
You can interview me first.

668
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm all ready.

669
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,970
Sir, there's no rush.

670
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,270
I'll let them get organized first.

671
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,600
Set up the equipment.

672
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,270
Shoot some background footage.

673
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,030
Then we'll start the interview, okay?

674
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,430
Go ahead and shoot then.

675
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,830
Okay, carry on.

676
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,700
Let me tell you, prepare for the questions.

677
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Is my hair messy? Take a photo of this side.

678
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,670
Be careful. No, it looks fine.

679
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,630
Then take a photo of the food too.

680
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,870
This is my home.

681
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,900
And then,

682
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,970
I've been watching that light outside since I was a child,

683
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,530
spinning round and round.

684
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,800
This is where I grew up.

685
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
And

686
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,600
this shop

687
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,100
was opened by my mom and her best friend

688
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,230
together.

689
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,700
Yes, so

690
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,230
the name 'San Francisco Beauty Salon'

691
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,429
existed before I was born.

692
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,469
When I can keep this sign

693
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,469
spinning like this,

694
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,929
I feel

695
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,100
that I still have

696
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,429
some kind of connection with my mom.

697
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,030
I don't know how to do hair, right?

698
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,070
I'm only good at making breakfast,

699
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,870
so I

700
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,469
changed it into what you see now.

701
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,030
Emotion is indeed good packaging.

702
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,330
Consumers aren't just eating food,

703
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,760
they're also consuming stories.

704
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,530
You're really impressive.

705
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,969
It suddenly sounds so sophisticated.

706
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,230
I just wrote down

707
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,130
the story you told me, that's all.

708
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,270
This place

709
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,630
has great potential.

710
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,860
Do you have a breakfast you'd recommend the most?

711
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,330
Blood cake egg crepe.

712
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,430
Why?

713
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,570
Because it was my mom's favorite.

714
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,600
Now I understand why Miaomiao likes you.

715
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Miaomiao?

716
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,800
But I don't like her.

717
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,100
She wants to eat unhealthy food every day.

718
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,900
When I refuse to make it for her, she gets angry with me.

719
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,230
This kid says one thing but means another.

720
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,230
It's okay. You go ahead with your work.

721
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,760
I'll organize the content.

722
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,800
What's up with Deng Weiyu?

723
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,630
I invite him but he never comes,

724
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,270
and he doesn't even read or reply to messages in the group.

725
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,900
It's not hard to understand.

726
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,760
He must be busier now than before.

727
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,060
Looks like I'm the one who hasn't read the messages.

728
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,000
Deng Weiyu doesn't even say anything about not coming.

729
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,830
Yeah, it's happened I don't know how many times.

730
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,200
What's his deal anyway?

731
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,160
I'll definitely bring him next time.

732
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,270
Very good.

733
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,800
Excellent.

734
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,900
Fix his hair a bit.

735
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,030
Good. Very nice.

736
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,900
Perfect.

737
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,870
Great.

738
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,330
What would you like to eat today, beautiful?

739
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,900
Everything looks so delicious.

740
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,970
It's hard to choose.

741
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,830
Get your deputy manager out here.

742
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,000
Deputy manager?

743
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,400
I think that's me.

744
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,100
How can I help you?

745
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,570
What are you doing?

746
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,270
You can't come in.

747
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,670
Our kitchen is temporarily closed. There's nothing I can do.

748
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,500
If you come in any further...

749
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,200
I'll scream harassment!

750
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,830
Excuse me, let me through.

751
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,600
I know you've been working hard lately and you're tired.

752
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,670
So...

753
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,000
I'll cook for you.

754
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,970
What would you like? Just tell me.

755
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,970
What?

756
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,900
I don't want to eat anything.

757
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,270
Why not?

758
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,530
I prepared all this specially.

759
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,900
It was a lot of work.

760
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,170
You can't be like this.

761
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,230
What are you doing?

762
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,230
Because...

763
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,770
Because what?

764
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,530
Tell me.

765
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,300
I think you've had it harder.

766
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,030
No, you're the one who's worked hard.

767
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,870
You've had it harder.

768
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,970
No, you.

769
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,230
You.

770
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,200
It's you.

771
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,070
You.

772
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,470
One kiss isn't enough.

773
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,600
Come here.

774
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,500
More.

775
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,730
A hundred kisses.

776
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,030
What are you smiling about?

777
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,400
I'm so happy.

778
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,700
Comfortable.

779
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,460
Do you ever feel at times like this...

780
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,030
a bit uneasy?

781
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,530
Like this happiness could disappear at any moment...

782
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,390
or that we'll have to pay some terrible price for it?

783
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,570
You're overthinking.

784
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,570
Let's just have our late-night snack.

785
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,300
I love late-night snacks the most.

786
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,470
The happiness is real.

787
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,970
And so is the price.

788
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,700
These past few months, have you...

789
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,430
Will you take responsibility, Weiyu?

790
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,030
I've been wanting to see your restaurant.

791
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,070
But I ended up with those society ladies...

792
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,630
playing mahjong until too late.

793
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,290
Good thing you're still here.

794
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,570
Mom.

795
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,900
Ma'am.

796
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,800
So this is the girlfriend you've been hiding?

797
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,770
She's beautiful.

798
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,900
What's your name?

799
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm Jiang Zhilu, ma'am.

800
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,630
Jiang Zhilu.

801
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,830
Mom.

802
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,170
Let me take you home first.

803
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,070
Okay.

804
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,470
Zhilu, can you call a taxi yourself?

805
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,670
Sure.

806
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,100
I just remembered.

807
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,700
Ma'am, I thought you looked familiar.

808
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,230
My family owns the San Francisco Beauty Salon.

809
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,160
You're one of my mother's clients.

810
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,470
Please come visit us again sometime.

811
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,630
It's now my brother's breakfast shop.

812
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,870
Weiyu, let's go now.

813
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,800
I need to talk to you.

814
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,870
It's okay. Take your time.

815
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,000
I'll go by myself.

816
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,900
Bye.

817
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,470
Deng Weiyu.

818
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,900
Deng Weiyu!

819
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,500
I told you not to get involved with Jiang Zhihao.

820
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,730
Don't you understand?

821
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,860
Break up with his sister immediately.

822
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,830
Jiang Zhihao has already left Linlin.

823
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,870
He won't appear in front of you anymore.

824
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,930
That's exactly why you shouldn't be dating his sister.

825
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,370
Jiang Zhihao will be a threat to you for the rest of your life.

826
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,370
Aren't you afraid he might someday use...

827
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,500
His mother is gone now.

828
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,570
No one knows about this anymore.

829
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,570
I don't care.

830
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,300
Break up with Zhilu immediately.

831
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,070
Don't push me.

832
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,570
You know for your sake,

833
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,070
I'm capable of doing anything.

834
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,030
You're tired.

835
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,600
I said no. Don't you understand?

836
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,130
No.

837
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,330
Do you know why?

838
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,970
I've looked up the news.

839
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,370
After all these years,

840
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,330
Deng Yongkuan still hasn't married you.

841
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,530
You've done so many things,

842
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,430
but what's the point?

843
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,230
In the end, you have nothing.

844
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,470
Deng Weiyu is my son.

845
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,800
He's about to be the successor.

846
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,270
I won't end up with nothing.

847
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,970
Fine.

848
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,500
If you don't take the money,

849
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,890
then consider this a declaration of war.

850
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,130
I destroyed He Meixia by myself back then.

851
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,970
Now with just a word from me and Weiyu,

852
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,500
we can destroy Jiang Zhihao anytime.

853
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,430
It's your choice.

854
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,830
What did you say? What's-

855
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,830
What's wrong?

856
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,470
What are you pretending for?

857
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,000
Hello. Would you like to get your hair done?

858
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,900
My mom might be out.

859
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,370
It's okay.

860
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,430
If you want to wash your hair,

861
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,430
I can help you.

862
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,890
I'm the owner's daughter.

863
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,330
No, thanks.

864
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,400
I'm leaving.

865
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,530
Why are you looking at me like that?

866
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,970
You just watched her like that.

867
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,670
How would I know?

868
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,200
She looked like she was faking it.

869
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,400
How could you do that? She's not me...

870
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,270
How could you do such a thing?

871
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,770
I forbid you to blame me for this.

872
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,430
Anyone else can blame me,

873
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,170
but not you.

874
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,370
This was done for you,

875
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,830
for your sake.

876
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,570
You must remember,

877
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,370
we're on the same side.

878
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,600
Sir, why did you trip my dad?

879
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,430
San Francisco Beauty Salon

880
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,930
was just a barbershop.

881
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,700
I don't think it can survive for long.

882
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,100
Didn't I tell you to break up with her?

883
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,360
I was going to break up with her tomorrow.

884
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,630
Deng Weiyu,

885
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,800
what's wrong with you today?

886
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,000
Go away!

887
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,570
I really hate you!

888
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,230
Or should we just keep pretending?

889
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,200
You're really pushing your luck.

890
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,770
This way, the two of us

891
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,930
will avoid trouble.

892
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,130
Who is this person in the photo?

893
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,370
She's holding a child.

894
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,330
Where is she now?
