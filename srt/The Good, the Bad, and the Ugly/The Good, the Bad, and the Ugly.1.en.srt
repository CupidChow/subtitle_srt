1
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,970
Every story has a beginning.

2
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,130
And this story

3
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,730
begins five years ago.

4
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,630
I'm not very good at

5
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,300
how to win against my husband.

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,970
You need to show your tiles when you win.

7
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,230
You need to make a move.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,770
Five circles.

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,530
Sweet enough?

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,830
Take one.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,900
Seven characters.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,470
So sweet. I must take this tile.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,770
Listen, Zhihao.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,430
Your LinLin Breakfast

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,930
is having that 30th anniversary commemorative toy

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,800
and our Guangsheng Toys

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,570
is also bidding for it.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,900
Since you're in charge

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,600
when the time comes

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,070
you need to help us out.

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,330
Help me, Uncle Guang.

22
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,830
No problem at all.

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,800
Given the relationship between our families

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,670
your business is our business.

25
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,670
We'll definitely

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,030
help you all the way.

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,470
Dad.

28
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:14,970
I'm only responsible for-

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,700
[Knocking]

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,330
I'm only responsible for coordinating departments.

31
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't have the authority to choose vendors.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
That's up to the selection committee.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,070
Let me tell you.

34
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,300
The other day I was playing cards

35
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,170
with Manager Zhang from your company

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,630
and he personally told me

37
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,270
that

38
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,130
he's one of the members on the selection committee.

39
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,070
Put in a good word for Uncle Guang.

40
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,970
I heard you're highly valued

41
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,900
by the boss at LinLin Breakfast.

42
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,800
Whether we can go to the Mediterranean next year

43
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,930
depends on you.

44
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,800
Yeah, didn't we talk about taking a cruise?

45
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,670
We've mentioned it several times.

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,600
Mom, not you too?

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,770
Whose turn is it?

48
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,229
You stop playing when we talk about cruises.

49
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,570
We got the LinLin Breakfast order!

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,170
Well

51
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,170
we must first thank our hero

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,770
the rising star of LinLin Breakfast

53
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,229
Jiang Zhihao.

54
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,570
Sit down and eat with us.

55
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,700
With you on our side

56
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,600
our project went so smoothly.

57
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,130
Xiao Qian.

58
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,470
Will this really not lose its paint?

59
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,970
We've applied primer to increase adhesion.

60
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,630
Theoretically, it shouldn't

61
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,900
but if it's played with every day

62
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,470
or not properly taken care of

63
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,230
there's a chance

64
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,500
it might a little... Why so much nonsense?

65
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,829
Just tell him it won't

66
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,200
and be done with it.

67
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,930
What child carries a scouring pad around

68
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,670
scrubbing away

69
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,970
at their toys? Dad!

70
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,500
Dad... No, I didn't...

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,130
You're being too harsh.

72
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,400
Have some cola.

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,829
Okay, calm down.

74
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,300
I'm teaching him.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,329
Xiao Qian.

76
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,500
Uncle Guang.

77
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,070
This project is really important.

78
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,970
We can't cut corners.

79
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,300
I know.

80
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,360
I've been making toys for many years.

81
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,470
I

82
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,770
know what I'm doing.

83
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,270
Right, you know what you're doing

84
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,000
and he knows even better, okay?

85
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,370
You can't eat this.

86
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,530
Why not?

87
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,270
It's sweet and your throat hurts, so you can't have it.

88
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,230
Oh, your throat hurts too?

89
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,330
Mine doesn't hurt.

90
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,900
Then what can I eat?

91
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,170
Pizza.

92
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,800
This is really cute.

93
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,470
Everyone stop!

94
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,000
Put aside your work.

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,900
Linlin Breakfast starts now.

96
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,030
Terminate the cooperation with Guangsheng Toys.

97
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,130
Where is the person in charge?

98
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,730
Wait, excuse me, sir.

99
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,800
What's happening?

100
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,700
Can't your factory take rush orders?

101
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm in a hurry.

102
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,700
I need them by next week.

103
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,300
Yes, money is not an issue.

104
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,900
It's for our 30th anniversary celebration.

105
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,770
These four toy models:

106
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,170
hamburger and sandwich.

107
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,970
If you have any news...

108
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,870
If you hear anything,

109
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,300
let me know immediately.

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,770
Director,

111
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,570
come with me to the meeting room.

112
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,870
Your toys have been tested

113
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,030
and found to contain excessive heavy metals.

114
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,970
That's impossible.

115
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,200
How could this happen?

116
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Zhao clearly told me

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,100
that this batch of materials was fine.

118
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,600
How could it exceed...

119
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,930
Did you know your father took money from Guangsheng Toys

120
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,500
to bribe the reviewers?

121
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,270
What do you mean?

122
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,300
You're saying my father took bribes to influence reviewers?

123
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,899
Zhang Guodong, one of the selection committee members,

124
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,100
has already admitted to taking bribes.

125
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,500
The company is now investigating this matter,

126
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,670
including you.

127
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,400
Investigate me?

128
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,270
Director, you must be joking.

129
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,600
There must be some misunderstanding.

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,270
Although my father likes to...

131
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,870
play mahjong... I've said what I needed to say.

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,300
The higher-ups are fighting among themselves,

133
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,430
and it's possible

134
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,470
he's being sacrificed.

135
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,530
It's all because he likes to show off.

136
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,870
He deserves it.

137
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,970
Jiang Zhihao.

138
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,470
Get up!

139
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,770
Jiang Zhihao, open the door!

140
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,930
If you don't get up, I'm coming in.

141
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,430
Are you dressed?

142
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,970
Jiang Zhihao!

143
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,400
What are you doing?

144
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,930
Get up!

145
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,870
Jiang Zhihao!

146
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,200
Hurry up!

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,500
Alright already!

148
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,970
Are you practicing Iron Palm?

149
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,900
Dragon Subduing Palm!

150
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,930
I still have seventeen more strikes.

151
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,330
Are you getting up or not?

152
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,070
Time to eat!

153
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,730
I'm seriously injured!

154
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm not eating!

155
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,570
What now? Practicing Shadowless Kick?

156
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,900
Get up now!

157
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,030
Hurry up!

158
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,500
After breakfast, go submit your resume!

159
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,600
I just lost my job!

160
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,970
You're making such a fuss over nothing.

161
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,830
Don't play dumb with your mother.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,330
Pull yourself together!

163
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,170
Fine!

164
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,630
Pull yourself together and find a job. Okay!

165
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,130
Everything for 35!

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Everything for 35!

167
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,670
Selling breakfast?

168
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,670
Yes,

169
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,530
would you like to buy some breakfast?

170
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,630
How is it? Tasty?

171
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,430
A bit dry.

172
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,270
Too dry.

173
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,770
Okay. Let's improve it tomorrow, shall we?

174
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,930
Improve tomorrow.

175
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,600
Everything that happened above

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,570
took place five years ago.

177
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,830
I never thought

178
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,700
that five years later,

179
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,000
the past I thought was over

180
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,130
would actually

181
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,429
come back to find me again.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,770
Excuse me,

183
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,100
is Hot Dog coming this afternoon? Yes.

184
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,330
Great, thanks.

185
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
Help me follow this woman.

186
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,770
Lin Guangsheng doesn't like me anyway.

187
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,430
I don't need to be nice to him either.

188
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,070
He's ordered cheap materials before.

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,670
After it's discovered,

190
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,000
he'll only think he was cheated by the supplier.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
He won't suspect someone is setting him up.

192
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,770
Excuse me.

193
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,000
Hello.

194
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,970
Who are you looking for?

195
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,830
Hello.

196
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,970
Don't you serve breakfast until 10?

197
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,130
We sold out at 7:30.

198
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,770
Come earlier tomorrow.

199
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,970
I came here to...

200
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,970
I don't know if you remember...

201
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,630
But our beauty salon is open.

202
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,570
How about a haircut?

203
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,470
Your hair is quite long.

204
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:27,930
It's okay, I...

205
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,230
No, guys like you...

206
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,070
Look better with a neat cut.

207
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,270
We're very skilled.

208
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,700
Careful.

209
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,460
Let me give you a relaxing massage first.

210
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,330
That... that hurts.

211
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,030
Does that hurt?

212
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,370
It's because you're under a lot of stress.

213
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:40,870
I'm... just relax.

214
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,170
I wanted to ask you something.

215
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,400
We'll have plenty to talk about later.

216
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,870
Here, put your hands in.

217
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,000
The stylist isn't here right now.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,870
She'll be back soon.

219
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,630
Business has been too good lately.

220
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,760
The phone's been ringing off the hook.

221
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,900
Hello, San Francisco Beauty Salon.

222
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,570
Okay, I got it.

223
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,600
Excuse me.

224
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,770
I need to take care of something.

225
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,070
Please have a seat.

226
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,430
Jiang Zhihao.

227
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,700
Come on, it's obvious.

228
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,530
Lin Guangsheng is already drowning in debt.

229
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,700
What would kidnappers gain

230
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,600
by kidnapping him?

231
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,230
Why are you taking my vegetables? Don't.

232
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,470
Lai Xiurong, let me tell you.

233
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,030
If anything happens to our Guangsheng,

234
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,130
you'll be an accomplice to murder.

235
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,930
Fine.

236
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,100
If something really happens to him,

237
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,470
it would serve him right.

238
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,070
Who told him to make those dangerous toys

239
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,700
that ruined our family? Okay, stop.

240
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,800
I'm begging you both.

241
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,970
That Linlin Toys incident

242
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,730
with the breakfast toys

243
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,870
that turned your families against each other.

244
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,070
You've gone over this eight million times already.

245
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,600
Aunt Xiurong, Aunt Xueqing,

246
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,970
please, I'm begging you.

247
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,230
When it comes down to it,

248
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,170
it was your husbands who caused all this.

249
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,930
Please,

250
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,400
can't you two get along?

251
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,370
I want to get along too,

252
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,000
but she...

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,530
she's always targeting me.

254
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,030
I shouldn't have called Ah Ding over

255
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,100
to scam you out of everything.

256
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,200
Alright, how about that?

257
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,270
How do you like that, you wicked woman?

258
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,170
That's enough, Mom.

259
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,200
You think I'm afraid of you?

260
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,170
Have you forgotten how last time you went grocery shopping

261
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,500
and fainted after arguing with Little Cai?

262
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,300
Come check your blood pressure.

263
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,230
Don't walk away!

264
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,670
We're not finished yet! Enough!

265
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,830
What?

266
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,330
It's all your fault.

267
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,600
That's enough.

268
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,930
You want to embarrass yourself more?

269
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,770
The whole neighborhood knows now. Let's go home.

270
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,500
I'll leave it to you.

271
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,900
I can't be away from my company for too long.

272
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,870
Lin Liying.

273
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,900
Why are you just standing there?

274
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,130
Can't you come over?

275
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,830
What does this have to do with Lin Liying?

276
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,800
It's you!

277
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,300
You're so stupid and still getting scammed.

278
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,670
I shouldn't have helped you.

279
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,970
Let your family be... Mom, that's enough!

280
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,970
All your money was stolen.

281
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,000
You fool.

282
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,930
You're the fool. Your whole family are fools.

283
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,430
Jiang Zhihao.

284
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,130
Jiang Zhihao.

285
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,700
Get up.

286
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's go.

287
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,030
You're faking it.

288
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
These few.

289
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,500
Lin Liying.

290
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,770
Your nails are all dirty.

291
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,070
It's disgusting.

292
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,300
Xiao Qian will suffer your domestic violence every day.

293
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,770
None of your business.

294
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,530
Jiang Zhihao, your butt.

295
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,830
Your butt!

296
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,900
It's not my fault.

297
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,870
Well.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,270
At my wedding with Xiao Qian,

299
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,130
there won't be a seat for you.

300
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,100
With the current relationship between our families,

301
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,360
I need to consider my mother's feelings.

302
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,600
That's fine.

303
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,800
I'll save one red envelope.

304
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,160
So you're really marrying Xiao Qian?

305
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,000
What else?

306
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,670
Xiao Qian used to work at your family's factory

307
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,300
and he always liked you.

308
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,500
Even when your family had troubles, he stayed loyal.

309
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,570
Someone like you who values loyalty

310
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,300
would naturally be moved by that.

311
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,430
What are you talking about?

312
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,130
What does that mean?

313
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,670
You make it sound like Xiao Qian and I

314
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,630
are together just out of obligation.

315
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,030
You don't understand.

316
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,570
I'm leaving now.

317
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,130
Why are you here?

318
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,830
Are you done?

319
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,670
Don't you remember who I am?

320
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm Deng Weiyu.

321
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,530
Deng Weikang's brother.

322
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,830
Wait.

323
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,970
Brother.

324
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,630
You guys first...

325
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,930
73-year-old Ms. Cai slipped at the Zhongshan store

326
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,970
and fractured her left hand.

327
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,829
She's about to go to the media,

328
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,970
and you're still arguing about who's right or wrong?

329
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,230
What's the point?

330
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,170
Go apologize quickly!

331
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,069
Deng Weiyu.

332
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,829
You go.

333
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,089
You're good at apologizing, aren't you?

334
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,069
Fine.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,930
Do you remember five years ago

336
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,930
when you were at Linlin?

337
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,490
The 30th anniversary toy project you were in charge of?

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,370
The Guangsheng Toys,

339
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,330
with the excessive heavy metal content in the paint.

340
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,430
Wasn't that case closed?

341
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,630
I resigned and left. Is there more to it?

342
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,230
Guangsheng's boss was actually framed.

343
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,030
I know the truth about that incident.

344
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,070
What are you daydreaming about?

345
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,600
It's your turn.

346
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,770
Get on the horse.

347
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,000
It's right at my horse's mouth.

348
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,500
Make way, please.

349
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,470
Are there any winning ones in that stack?

350
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,800
Can you focus? There aren't any.

351
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,730
How long are we going to keep checking these?

352
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,300
Everyone uses electronic receipts and carriers nowadays.

353
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,230
It's eco-friendly, you know?

354
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,000
You don't understand.

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,800
It's more exciting when you find a winner this way.

356
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,000
Not a single winning ticket.

357
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,630
Otherwise we could at least cover some utility bills.

358
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,700
And my hair dryer keeps malfunctioning.

359
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,030
It needs to be replaced.

360
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,630
Jiang Zhilu, are you checking these properly?

361
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,570
Excuse me.

362
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,800
It should have been replaced long ago.

363
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,030
It's your fault for selling off

364
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,630
all the new equipment recently.

365
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,170
Keeping only those antiques.

366
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,300
How are you supposed to style people's hair?

367
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,670
I don't get it.

368
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,970
Where else would I get money if I didn't sell them?

369
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,470
If you hadn't taken Lin Guangsheng's money,

370
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,470
then helped him bribe people,

371
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,600
and embezzled those funds,

372
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
wasting it on some dry noodle business investment.

373
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,030
Would you please stop talking about this?

374
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,700
I had no idea

375
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
that Lin Guangsheng was selling unsafe toys.

376
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,600
Before, he did it to save money,

377
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,130
which was bad enough.

378
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,270
But now he's working with LinLin Breakfast,

379
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,630
a major corporation,

380
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,230
and he still dares to do this.

381
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,030
What have you ever done right

382
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,200
to be so self-righteous?

383
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,830
Just look.

384
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,330
Your son has no job because of you,

385
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,130
wasting away at home all day.

386
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,700
That's not true. I sell breakfast every day.

387
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,830
I'm not wasting away. You...

388
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,270
Shut up!

389
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,870
Okay, I'm going to work now.

390
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,730
Didn't you just get off work?

391
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,330
Yes.

392
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,030
But I quit that job.

393
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,470
Mom, this is my new workplace.

394
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,670
Don't worry.

395
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,400
I'll tell you more when I get back.

396
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,730
Bye! I'm running late.

397
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,730
Jiang Zhilu!

398
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,800
It's a Japanese hotel.

399
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,700
Hotel?

400
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,400
What kind of hotel?

401
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,270
Jiang Zhilu

402
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,670
Aren't you going to explain?

403
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,170
Well,

404
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,870
my original job was exhausting

405
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,630
and I was always getting scolded by my supervisor.

406
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,170
Anyway, I happen to love drinking,

407
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,700
so turning my hobby into a job isn't bad at all.

408
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,800
Haven't you watched 'Light the Night'?

409
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,130
It's just drinking and chatting.

410
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,630
Don't worry.

411
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,930
What time do you get off work?

412
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,130
Jiang Zhihao

413
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,830
Don't try to pull that

414
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,570
sweet pick-up service thing.

415
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,930
It's really disgusting.

416
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Even though we're not blood-related,

417
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,930
there can never be anything between us.

418
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,370
If you fall in love with me,

419
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,970
Mom will kill you.

420
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,230
I was asking you to get me some rice noodles.

421
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,400
I checked your store's address,

422
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,170
and there's a place nearby with rice noodles I love.

423
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,600
So much for your 'sweet pick-up service' theory.

424
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,300
Idiot.

425
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,130
Your stomach is so big.

426
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,070
Eat, eat, eat.

427
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,670
Eating is all you know.

428
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,600
Ten bowls, Zhilu.

429
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,370
Don't you think it's strange?

430
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,730
They finally got such a big order,

431
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,900
why would they do something that would be discovered

432
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,700
as soon as it's inspected?

433
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,700
I, Uncle Guang, have been making toys for many years.

434
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,030
On this matter,

435
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,500
I know what I'm doing.

436
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,730
Xiao Qian

437
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,790
This one really won't lose its paint.

438
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,800
We apply primer first to increase adhesion.

439
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,930
Did you know your dad took money from Guangsheng Toys

440
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,400
to bribe the reviewers?

441
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,460
I know the truth about that incident.

442
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,670
Serves him right.

443
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,270
It's all because he loves showing off too much.

444
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,500
Here.

445
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,330
Thank you.

446
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,660
See you tomorrow. Okay.

447
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,300
Come again tomorrow.

448
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,870
I want a smoked chicken sandwich

449
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,200
with milk tea.

450
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,130
We don't have that.

451
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,130
Today we have rice noodle pancakes and black tea.

452
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,200
Do you want some?

453
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,170
Do you know,

454
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,530
there are many people in this world

455
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,230
who like smoked chicken sandwiches?

456
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,370
I know,

457
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,570
but today we only have rice noodle pancakes and black tea.

458
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,530
Do you want it or not?

459
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,500
You're going to be late for school.

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,230
Yes.

461
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,470
Good girl.

462
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,330
Wait.

463
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,630
Here, Xiao Qian.

464
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,830
Eat more.

465
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,930
If I had known you were staying for dinner,

466
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,170
I would have gone to the market early this morning

467
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,630
to buy some chicken.

468
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,730
Thanks, Mom.

469
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,900
How pitiful.

470
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,400
The future son-in-law sells frozen chicken,

471
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,870
yet we still have to buy chicken ourselves.

472
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,770
Mom,

473
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,430
don't talk like that.

474
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,470
If it weren't for Xiao Qian these past few years,

475
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,200
who knows what would have happened to our family.

476
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,700
Grandma,

477
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,770
Xiao Qian rarely comes to eat with us.

478
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,900
I...

479
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,670
Did I say something wrong?

480
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,130
He's been selling chicken for years

481
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,670
but never brought us a single piece.

482
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,000
It's not even expensive.

483
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,660
Yet he doesn't understand this basic courtesy.

484
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,500
Grandma.

485
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,170
Have some meat.

486
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,600
Grandma, the stuff from my factory

487
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,070
is all cheap quality.

488
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,970
It's frozen food

489
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,970
and eating too much isn't good for your health.

490
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,930
Next time I'll buy something better,

491
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,870
like Wagyu beef.

492
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,470
I'll bring Wagyu beef for you,

493
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,770
you see?

494
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,500
I'll bring you Wagyu beef.

495
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,370
He's very picky about food.

496
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,100
He only wants to eat what they call

497
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,630
whole foods.

498
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,230
That's all he'll eat.

499
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,500
The processed stuff goes to me.

500
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,770
Thank you for earlier.

501
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,860
Be careful riding your bike home.

502
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,730
I know.

503
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,170
I just ate garlic.

504
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,930
Me too.

505
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,400
Alright, I'm going now.

506
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,730
Say hello to your mom for me.

507
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,530
Okay, bye.

508
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,430
Bye.

509
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,400
Lin Liying!

510
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,700
There you are!

511
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,300
Where's our pay?

512
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,500
All the toy orders have been canceled now.

513
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,900
What about our salaries?

514
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,570
Who knows if you'll

515
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,700
run away like your father did?

516
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,570
Let me tell you.

517
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,430
If you don't pay us today,

518
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,200
we're not leaving.

519
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,970
We need to eat,

520
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,600
we need to live!

521
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,130
Hand over the money!

522
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,900
Where's the money? It's been too long!

523
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,830
We need to live! What are you doing?

524
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,030
Everyone, excuse me,

525
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,830
please listen to me for a moment.

526
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,200
Lin Liying really doesn't know anything about this.

527
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,770
What do you mean she doesn't know anything?

528
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,400
Don't give us that!

529
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,270
This company belongs to her father, not her.

530
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,400
What do you know about it?

531
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,200
We have families to feed!

532
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,630
No,

533
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm in the same situation as all of you.

534
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,130
I'm unemployed too.

535
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,930
I'm facing problems as well.

536
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,770
She's here today to solve the problem.

537
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,600
Solve it by giving us our money!

538
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,570
Don't give her a hard time. Did you get paid?

539
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,670
We'll leave once it's resolved. I didn't get any money.

540
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,170
Don't spread rumors.

541
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,230
We're here today to solve this problem.

542
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,030
She didn't run away.

543
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,230
Her father did.

544
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,430
She's here today to resolve the issue.

545
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,160
Okay, we'll sort this out soon.

546
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,230
I had someone transfer the payment for Linlin this morning.

547
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,330
Please check if you've received it.

548
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,730
Wait.

549
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,030
Remember to collect all the packaging.

550
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,370
No problem.

551
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,330
Easy, easy.

552
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,170
Wait.

553
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,900
These labels

554
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,170
need to be removed completely.

555
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,970
How many times do I have to say it?

556
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,400
Okay.

557
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,330
No, it's just the staff.

558
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,300
Some of the new ones are a bit slow.

559
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,200
Right.

560
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,300
Okay.

561
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,330
Let's have a drink sometime.

562
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,770
Jiang Zhihao.

563
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,830
I want to eat a smoked chicken sandwich tomorrow.

564
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,200
We don't have that.

565
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,170
Yes, you do.

566
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,670
It won't kill you to buy some.

567
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,430
Wait.

568
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,530
Go buy it somewhere else.

569
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,270
Miaomiao, we don't have that.

570
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,900
So you want a smoked chicken sandwich tomorrow?

571
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,930
No problem. Leave it to me.

572
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,330
Jiang Zhihao.

573
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,530
Come to my factory tomorrow to get a pack.

574
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,270
If you like it,

575
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,270
I'll charge you only the cost price.

576
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,700
Really?

577
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,300
Don't you only sell to Linlin?

578
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,800
You can sell to me too.

579
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,300
We know each other,

580
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,900
and you're Liying's friend.

581
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,500
Feel free to take a few packs.

582
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,170
Miaomiao.

583
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:15,730
I promise you,

584
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,070
you'll have your smoked chicken sandwich tomorrow.

585
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,500
High five!

586
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,430
Bye, Jiang Zhihao.

587
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,630
See you tomorrow.

588
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,000
Bye.

589
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,730
So I'll come to your factory tomorrow for the smoked chicken.

590
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,030
Sure, no problem.

591
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,130
Liying is inside.

592
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,470
It's just dinner with his parents.

593
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,270
Why so serious?

594
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,570
You even came specially to wash your hair.

595
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,300
Xiao Qian's parents care a lot about appearance.

596
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,200
So I should look more proper.

597
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,370
I never thought

598
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,900
I'd hear you say you want to look proper.

599
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,800
I didn't expect it either.

600
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,400
My daughter is getting engaged

601
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,730
while her father is hiding from debt collectors somewhere.

602
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,170
Your nose has been problematic since you were little.

603
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,030
Wait for me a bit longer.

604
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,500
No problem.

605
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,930
I'll wait for you here.

606
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,070
Lin Liying.

607
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,530
Do you remember in our second year of high school

608
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,930
when you secretly kept a cat at the factory?

609
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,200
Yes, I remember.

610
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,370
My dad eventually found out.

611
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,400
He said cat hair triggered my respiratory allergies.

612
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,370
I don't know how that happened.

613
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,600
I remember you were so careful back then.

614
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,100
And every time you went home,

615
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,470
you would use tape to remove all the cat hair.

616
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,070
You even fed it in the middle of the night.

617
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,400
But you still got caught.

618
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,300
I wonder how he found out.

619
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,700
Security cameras.

620
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,070
What do you mean?

621
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,270
What do you mean?

622
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,130
I remember back then

623
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,900
he was trying to catch someone smoking.

624
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,030
So he installed a camera in a secluded spot.

625
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,730
Mom, 180?

626
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,730
150 is enough.

627
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,070
150?

628
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,000
It was raining that day.

629
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,130
And you just had to bring the cat inside to feed it.

630
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,000
So you got caught on camera.

631
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,330
That was pretty unlucky.

632
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,530
I do remember that smoking incident.

633
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,330
My dad never caught that person.

634
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I remember that camera

635
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,060
wasn't connected to the factory system.

636
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,230
I wonder if it's still there.

637
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:16,970
Xiao Qian.

638
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,530
Xiao Qian.

639
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,230
You've worked at the factory for so many years.

640
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,070
Did you know about that camera?

641
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,970
I don't know.

642
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,330
Look.

643
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,270
He worked there for years and didn't know about it.

644
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,270
Probably nobody else knows either.

645
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,230
We'll be going now.

646
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,430
Bye.

647
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,660
Let me play something for you.

648
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,000
We can only replace the paint tomorrow.

649
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,470
I'll handle it for you.

650
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,760
He's ordered cheap materials before anyway.

651
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:03,800
After it's discovered,

652
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,670
he'll just think he was cheated by the manufacturer.

653
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,070
He won't suspect someone is setting him up.

654
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Don't forget the conditions

655
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,230
you promised me.

656
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,970
With the order from Linlin Breakfast Shop,

657
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,000
I won't have to worry about money anymore.

658
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,430
How did you get this?

659
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,200
About a month ago,

660
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,300
I received an anonymous email.

661
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,470
This file was inside.

662
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,470
And then,

663
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,430
This person should be Qian Youda.

664
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,470
Aren't they all the same?

665
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,870
Cut the crap.

666
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,730
Help me carry these two boxes out.

667
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,400
He's been Linlin's long-term supplier.

668
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,100
He's the manager of the frozen chicken factory.

669
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,270
He's also Guangsheng's former employee.

670
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,370
Because he seems to have been using

671
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,570
expired frozen chicken

672
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,130
to supply to Linlin.

673
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,370
I suspect this isn't his first time doing this.

674
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,330
It's just that I haven't obtained

675
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,970
any crucial evidence yet.

676
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
What are you so busy with anyway?

677
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,070
I might need to leave early.

678
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,300
Now... Dad.

679
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,300
What's wrong? I'm sorry.

680
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,930
Dad, Mom,

681
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,600
Grandma, Mom,

682
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,000
there's something urgent at my company.

683
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,870
I need to go back and take care of it,

684
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,400
so I might have to leave now.

685
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,930
I'm sorry. Why so suddenly?

686
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,470
But...

687
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,800
But the main dishes are...

688
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,700
Look, the fish is already here.

689
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,830
Can't you finish eating before you go?

690
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,730
Whatever you decide

691
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,930
is fine, okay?

692
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,000
Dad, Mom, you go ahead and eat.

693
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,470
Grandma, I'm leaving now.

694
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,570
At that time, he seemed to want to catch someone at the factory.

695
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,800
I remember that camera

696
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,199
didn't seem to be connected to the factory system.

697
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,570
Don't know if it's still there now.

698
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,570
Xiaopang.

699
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,500
Remove all the packaging before dawn.

700
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,000
Boss, this expired two months ago.

701
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,870
You're new here, aren't you?

702
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,700
Just relabel it if it's expired.

703
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,600
Do I have to explain everything?

704
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Is it your first day?

705
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,870
Xiao Qian.

706
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm here to get the smoked chicken.

707
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,070
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

708
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,330
I just wanted to take a walk

709
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,370
and stop by on the way.

710
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,830
So I can use it tomorrow.

711
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,030
Is it inconvenient?

712
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,930
It's fine.

713
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,600
Why wouldn't it be?

714
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,000
We're family.

715
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,630
Wait for me.

716
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,300
What's this room?

717
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,970
Don't tell me it's full of dead bodies,

718
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,200
like in horror movies.

719
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,100
You idiot.

720
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,470
Yes, it's full of bodies.

721
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,630
Chicken bodies.

722
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,970
Happy now?

723
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,330
Wait, I'll get the smoked chicken for you.

724
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,300
Thanks.

725
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,570
Zhihao.

726
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:28,870
What are you doing?

727
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,600
Nothing, just looking around.

728
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,870
Your business is doing better and better.

729
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,870
Making a lot of money, huh?

730
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,730
It's okay, not bad.

731
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,230
These new employees are hard to train.

732
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,430
Thanks.

733
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,600
No problem.

734
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,230
I want a smoked chicken sandwich

735
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,500
with a milk tea.

736
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,630
No.

737
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,700
I already told you yesterday.

738
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,970
Don't eat certain things carelessly.

739
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,390
Something bad will happen if you eat that, understand?

740
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,830
Congratulations.

741
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,100
Eat more.

742
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,200
Thank you.

743
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,370
Let's go make a toast.

744
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,100
- Mom, we're going to make some toasts.
- Okay.

745
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,330
Help yourselves to the food.

746
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,400
Xiao Qian, take care of them.

747
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,500
Okay.

748
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,570
Take your time.

749
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,600
Alright.

750
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,470
Where to?

751
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,700
That table first.

752
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,770
Here.

753
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,570
Happy marriage.

754
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,470
- Congratulations.
- I'll drink with you later.

755
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,800
Okay, let's drink later.

756
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
Stop fooling around.

757
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,430
I'll come find you later.

758
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,870
- I'll find you for a drink later.
- Okay.

759
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,570
Uncle, Auntie.

760
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,470
Looking good.

761
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,170
Drink up.

762
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,400
Let's discuss it.

763
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,000
Okay.

764
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,170
Let's eat first.

765
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,870
Mix the expired ones

766
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,570
with the fresh ones

767
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,100
so the taste won't change much.

768
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,800
I've told you so many times.

769
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,000
Those labels

770
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,470
should show expiration dates two months later,

771
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,730
why only one month?

772
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,770
What's so hard about adding two more months?

773
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,700
Redo them now.

774
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,030
As for this smoked chicken,

775
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,370
if the taste changes,

776
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,630
just add some black pepper.

777
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,870
Who put this on? Turn it off.

778
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,830
Turn it off.

779
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,800
Put it in the freezer,

780
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,970
then take it out again.

781
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,830
Don't you know how to be flexible?

782
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,970
It's nothing.

783
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,500
This must be a prank.

784
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,700
My business has grown quite a bit these years,

785
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,960
so people are jealous.

786
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,330
It's fine.

787
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,400
Everyone, drink more, eat more.

788
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,130
Just a prank.

789
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,630
I'll drink first. Ladies,

790
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,630
it's probably because we're too successful.

791
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,370
Just some pranks.

792
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,300
When you're successful, people will inevitably...

793
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,870
Lin Guangsheng has always disliked me anyway.

794
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,530
I don't need to be nice to him.

795
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,830
We can only replace the coating tomorrow.

796
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,670
I'll handle it for you.

797
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,760
He's ordered cheap materials before anyway.

798
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,530
After it's discovered,

799
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,200
he'll just think he was cheated by the supplier,

800
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,670
not that someone set him up.

801
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,830
Don't forget the conditions

802
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,500
you promised me.

803
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,930
With Linlin Breakfast Shop's order,

804
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,330
I won't have to worry about money anymore.

805
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,600
Liying,

806
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,330
this...

807
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,370
this isn't real.

808
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,470
You should believe me.

809
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,430
What's this room?

810
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,970
Don't tell me it's full of corpses.

811
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,970
Wait a moment, I'll get you some smoked chicken. Okay.

812
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,370
Turn it off!

813
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,600
Who played this?

814
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,100
Who did it?

815
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,300
Go turn it off!

816
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,070
Who played this?

817
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,470
There's something I need you to restore.

818
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,600
Who released that recording?

819
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,800
Then why did you marry me?

820
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,170
Should I thank

821
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,730
whoever played that video?

822
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,530
Jiang Zhilu.

823
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,100
When you find another partner in the future,

824
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,800
better find someone kind.

825
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,870
In this world,

826
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,070
the three things least worth caring about:

827
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,500
Jiang Zhilu's ex-boyfriends.

828
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,000
Don't tell me Deng Weikang upset you again...

829
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,630
Your sister worked like a slave and got nothing.

830
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,630
What can you change?

831
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,970
Know your place.

832
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,370
Your mother is Wang Rouyi, not Zhou Linlin.

833
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,570
Deng Weiyu.

834
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,830
What exactly are you trying to do?

835
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,300
Do you believe in karma?

836
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,330
I think you have the right to know the truth.
