1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,370
Toy. Toy.

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,670
Look at me. Look at me.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,200
Like me.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,200
I remember their names.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,270
In the process of making toys,

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,070
every bucket of ingredients

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,730
has been tested and processed.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,600
for decades.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,230
Five years ago,

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,800
we made a breakfast shop

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,830
for the 30th anniversary.

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,270
We were found...

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,170
Lin Liying.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,500
You've occupied the room for over two hours.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,730
I'm going to take a shower with my clothes.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,570
If you come in, my part will...

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,670
Pardon?

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,830
It's your turn.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,270
Lin Liying. Let's go inside.

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,970
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,970
Why are you dressed like this?

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,770
I came to ask Hong-joo to change her suit.

23
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,730
My dad’s.

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,070
It's here. It's here. It's here.

25
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,270
Isn't it pretty?

26
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,070
Awesome. Thank you, Grandma.

27
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,000
Then why are you wearing a suit?

28
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,129
Don't you think

29
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,230
I look like someone with a story?

30
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,270
I'm sure you'll attend the audition.

31
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,200
You're going to find a job?

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,370
Wear this.

33
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm sure there'll be no problem.

34
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,470
Turn around.

35
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,000
What do you think?

36
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,930
Kang Ji-ho, there's a hole in your pants.

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,770
No way.

38
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,470
Where is it? It's huge.

39
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,170
There's a hole.

40
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,830
Take it off.

41
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,400
I'll fix it for you.

42
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,600
Here.

43
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,800
Take it off.

44
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
No, I'm going to take a shower after that.

45
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,530
We won't do anything if you take it off.

46
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,000
Lin Li Ying.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Aren't you humiliating me?

48
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,530
I'm a man.

49
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,300
You'll be fine.

50
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,370
You'll be fine.

51
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,400
Take it off.

52
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,970
What are you afraid of? Take it off.

53
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,030
You two grew up together. Please.

54
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,530
I'll cover it for you.

55
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,070
Take it off.

56
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,870
It's too small, Grandma.

57
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,729
I...

58
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,830
I'll take it off at home.

59
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,130
Wait for me.

60
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,930
You...

61
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,970
Go on with your part.

62
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,430
I'm going to take a shower.

63
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,199
It's all recorded.

64
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,370
Save.

65
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,600
Here you go.

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,529
Excuse me.

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,730
Jun, wipe it for me.

68
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,330
There's going to be an interview soon.

69
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,030
When I was working,

70
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,630
I found that there wasn't enough manpower.

71
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,900
I'll leave this to you.

72
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm going to clean the toilet.

73
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,600
Call me when someone comes.

74
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,370
Why is there a new recruit interview again?

75
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,770
What is the company doing?

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,930
How many should we take care of?

77
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,970
Since it's an interview, it means it doesn't work.

78
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,370
I'm an assistant store.

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,470
Don't you even have the right to hire people?

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,370
Really?

81
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,330
But I want that 10,000 won.

82
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,030
I'm from the HR Bank.

83
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,159
Aren't all the interviewees the manager?

84
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,430
How do you know I'm not the manager?

85
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,360
Hello, Mr. Choi. Hello.

86
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,970
Hello.

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,130
What's your name?

88
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,430
This is my resume.

89
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,630
It says

90
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,070
2719.

91
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,570
You just came out?

92
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,830
You know the Japanese restaurant is different, right?

93
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,700
Did you see the golden hair?

94
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,270
The village head's daughter was kidnapped by him.

95
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,900
Everyone here

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,500
is at least five to ten years in prison.

97
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,370
So I think you look a little...

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,870
Dishes.

99
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,900
The last person who said that

100
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,070
was the most respected person in my life.

101
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,230
Ms. Tian.

102
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,130
Come on.

103
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,030
The police are here.

104
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,970
Run!

105
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,330
Let's go.

106
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,000
No, this is ridiculous.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,900
No one will believe it.

108
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,300
And who is Ms. Tian?

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,730
Ms. Tian

110
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,200
is a mysterious and famous person.

111
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,370
Trust me.

112
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,470
It's not wrong

113
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,370
It can't be wrong. No.

114
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,870
Delete the "Flying Shield".

115
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,270
Don't underestimate me!

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,270
Boss, it hurts!

117
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,370
You go first.

118
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,630
Leave it to me, boss. Okay.

119
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,600
Okay, I'm leaving.

120
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,630
Leave it to me. Keep blocking.

121
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,970
Let me go.

122
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,430
This is it.

123
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,130
That's it.

124
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Joon.

125
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,300
I followed Ms. Tian

126
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,000
with Ms. Tian.

127
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,730
Stealing.

128
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,660
and drug trafficking.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,630
So do you think

130
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,970
you and Ms. Tian are in the same level?

131
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,100
Or should I ask him

132
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,030
to have breakfast with you.

133
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,970
We'll be colleagues from now on.

134
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,130
Just kidding.

135
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,970
Harmony brings wealth.

136
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,300
Harmony brings wealth.

137
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,260
We're not colleagues yet.

138
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,530
Do you know how to cook breakfast?

139
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,330
Fried table. Can you do it?

140
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,770
Try it.

141
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,370
I think he really killed someone.

142
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,430
So what if he did?

143
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm interviewing right now.

144
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,830
If I say it tastes bad,

145
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,130
and said he made a mess,

146
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,700
he won't be accepted.

147
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,100
I...

148
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,530
I think the smell of this thing

149
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,470
something is wrong.

150
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,700
What?

151
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,370
What did you add?

152
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,100
Beef is not cooked

153
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,600
The point is when the oven is ready,

154
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,930
you have to put cheese in the hamburger meat.

155
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,230
mixed with meat juice

156
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,670
And onions

157
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,770
More vegetables

158
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,330
The taste will be different

159
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,330
This doesn't suit SOP

160
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,630
Sorry, I can't use you.

161
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,430
Thank you.

162
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,870
Are you done with the interview?

163
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,030
Mr. Choi.

164
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,370
Why are you slacking off in the bathroom?

165
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,770
You want me to help you with the interview?

166
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,630
Let me tell you.

167
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,270
He can't do it.

168
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,300
The food he made

169
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,900
is awful.

170
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,800
Right, Joon?

171
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,430
Yes.

172
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,570
It tastes awful.

173
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,730
You made this?

174
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,030
The meat

175
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,330
The steak is good

176
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,670
It's not too old or too burnt.

177
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,130
The heat is under control.

178
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,330
Do you have any food experience?

179
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,030
Delicious.

180
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,130
It's delicious.

181
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,370
Who said it wasn't good?

182
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,730
He...

183
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,530
He's Kang Ji-ho. He's Kang Ji-ho. He's Kang Ji-ho. He's Kang Ji-ho. He's Kang Ji-ho. He's Kang Ji-ho.

184
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,170
Yes.

185
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:07,830
You.

186
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,070
I saw your resume.

187
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,400
Welcome to the Japanese restaurant.

188
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,730
Are you the store manager?

189
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,700
I'm Deng Weiyu.

190
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,200
Hello. Hello. Hello.

191
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,070
Well...

192
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,700
Are you free tonight?

193
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,730
What do you want?

194
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,900
If you're free,

195
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,570
Help me welcome the guests. My treat.

196
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,200
Welcome.

197
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,630
You're Section Chief Kang Lok. Yes.

198
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,370
I haven't had dinner with you since I came here, have I?

199
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:30,870
Dae-woong.

200
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,000
Isn't it your birthday this month?

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,930
I'll celebrate your birthday too.

202
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,230
It's settled then.

203
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,970
By the way, your name is Fat, right?

204
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,500
Well...

205
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,030
I think the toilet door is broken.

206
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,570
Get someone to fix it.

207
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,230
That's it.

208
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,800
See you tonight.

209
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,530
Kang Ji-ho.

210
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,330
Do you know anything else

211
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,630
besides hamburgers?

212
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,930
Panini.

213
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,800
Muffin.

214
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,230
Sandwich.

215
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,800
It's not hard for me.

216
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,370
Apart from Kang Ji-ho's welcome party,

217
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,870
I'd like to thank the three of you

218
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,700
before I came to the store.

219
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,570
Well...

220
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,270
I look forward to working with you.

221
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,030
Nice to meet you.

222
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,960
Nice to meet you.

223
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,300
You must be tired from work.

224
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,570
It's a rare day

225
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,030
to extort the boss's time.

226
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,830
So you must drink wine, right?

227
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,270
Let me introduce myself.

228
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,270
I’m Lulu. Hello, everyone.

229
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,300
Lulu, what's your name?

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Fatso.

231
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,830
Fatso.

232
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,600
You're not fat at all. Why are you called Fat?

233
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,130
Here's to you.

234
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,700
Excuse me.

235
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,230
What's your name?

236
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,330
Your hair looks so nice

237
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,570
Thank you Joon

238
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,270
Hello, Jun.

239
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,330
I’m Lulu, Mei Mei Mei. Drink.

240
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,570
OK.

241
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,730
Hello.

242
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,460
Excuse me for adding some wine.

243
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,070
How should I address you?

244
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,970
Luo Dayong.

245
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,730
Dae-woong.

246
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,770
Okay, that's good. Yes.

247
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,770
We're busy chatting. Thank you.

248
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,730
Weiyu.

249
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,400
Cheers, Lulu.

250
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,330
Thank you.

251
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,670
Everyone, please

252
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,830
take good care of my brother.

253
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,000
Who's your brother?

254
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,100
My brother is Kang Ji-ho.

255
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,530
He's a gangster.

256
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,030
and a hotel flower.

257
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,930
A family.

258
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,430
Why don't you drink too?

259
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
If you want me to cooperate, you should give me some money.

260
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,870
Got it?

261
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,500
Luo Dayong!

262
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
It's really you.

263
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,600
I've been looking for you.

264
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,800
I heard you're not with Brother Tai

265
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
You got the wrong person.

266
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,430
I'm leaving.

267
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,930
What's the hurry?

268
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,300
After what happened last time,

269
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,330
my boss went to ask Tai for an explanation

270
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,200
He only wanted to vent his anger for his younger brother.

271
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,400
Tai paid for the area behind

272
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,030
He's a loser too

273
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,370
Come on, hit me

274
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,600
My boss hasn't had tea with Tai for a long time

275
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,700
Useless!

276
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,930
What are you doing?

277
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,870
Don’t you want to have tea with Tai?

278
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,400
How about we find Ms. Tian?

279
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,570
What are you?

280
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,800
Kang Ji-ho, what are you doing?

281
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,630
A man is talking.

282
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,370
Shut up, woman!

283
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,300
I'll put up with you for a long time.

284
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,730
Three years ago,

285
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,670
at the abandoned factory behind the mountain,

286
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,530
after I took the stab for Ms. Tian,

287
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,930
no one dares to ask me what I am.

288
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,530
Are you sure you want to know?

289
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,300
or get lost now?

290
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,230
or wait for Ms. Tian.

291
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,100
I guess your brother

292
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,200
doesn't want to have tea with him.

293
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,630
Long time no see, Trumpet.

294
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,300
You didn't even tell me you were coming.

295
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,870
I've reserved a VIP seat for you.

296
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,730
Please come in.

297
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,630
Let's go. I'll take you there.

298
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,070
Jun. Cheng. Brother Wu.

299
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,700
Long time no see.

300
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,829
You almost hit me.

301
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,130
Are you okay?

302
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,930
Yes.

303
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,329
It's okay, Dae-woong.

304
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,270
Here, Joon.

305
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,930
Here

306
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,730
No Joon

307
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,470
Joon

308
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,730
Fatso.

309
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,600
Deng Weiyu.

310
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,130
What are you planning with Jiang Zhihao?

311
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,330
He didn't even tell me.

312
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,730
He's weird.

313
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,330
What if something happens to him today?

314
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,300
Why are you dressed like that?

315
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,470
A fake gun? Are you crazy?

316
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,970
And he didn't tell me

317
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,970
why he suddenly came back to work.

318
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,200
You actually care about your brother.

319
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,830
Who cares about him?

320
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,630
I work here.

321
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,000
This is my shop.

322
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,030
He called

323
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,570
He was mumbling over there.

324
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,270
You didn't make it clear

325
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,670
If I hadn't acted well,

326
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,100
I wouldn't have succeeded today.

327
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,970
He's helping me.

328
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,370
For what?

329
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,600
Help me deal with the three of them.

330
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,330
and run the Japanese restaurant.

331
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,330
That way, I'll have more opportunities when I'm here.

332
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,990
Don't you think he did a great job?

333
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,500
I think he was really stupid.

334
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,470
OK?

335
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,030
I like him.

336
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,200
Do you like him?

337
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes.

338
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,470
I envy him.

339
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,100
For what?

340
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,630
Well...

341
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,230
Maybe I've always been careful.

342
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,870
I'm afraid of things.

343
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,030
I'm afraid of taking the wrong way.

344
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,100
So I think

345
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,430
if I can stay where I am,

346
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,170
is

347
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,530
is the safest.

348
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,830
What's wrong?

349
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,500
Are you sick?

350
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,400
The yolk

351
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,870
It's a little swollen.

352
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,000
Come here.

353
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,770
What are you doing?

354
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,330
When you're sweating, press the inner acupoints.

355
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,600
Three fingers on the wrist.

356
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,100
Do you feel it?

357
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,530
It's like...

358
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,770
It's moving.

359
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,400
There's a breath flowing.

360
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,500
It stinks.

361
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,530
Don't smell it.

362
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,870
It stinks. Don't smell it.

363
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,100
Jeremy's fart stinks.

364
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,100
It stinks.

365
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,630
Hurry up and suck it all out.

366
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,870
In other words, Wu,

367
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,370
your company works eight hours a day.

368
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,600
But once it arrives at six,

369
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,670
your boss

370
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,700
will get the signature form

371
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,100
and ask you to sign and go home.

372
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,030
Did you really get off work?

373
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,430
No way.

374
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,200
There's so much to do.

375
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,070
Someone reported you

376
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,800
that you've signed the contract and resigned.

377
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,230
You volunteered to work overtime for me.

378
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,870
Today, I'm here to seek justice for Wu.

379
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,200
This kind of malicious and unfair company

380
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
It’s a foreign trade company called Juiyang Company.

381
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,830
The person in charge is Lin Juiyang.

382
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,930
I mean,

383
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,270
I made a video of our story

384
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,200
to the self-media creator.

385
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,370
More than ten people

386
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,700
are here to interview my dad.

387
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,000
A dozen of people?

388
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,000
I just want to say

389
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm looking for someone

390
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,230
with the most traffic.

391
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,600
Not bad.

392
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,130
That's why I want to ask you

393
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,730
Do you want to come with me?

394
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,070
Are you sure?

395
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,270
Are you sure you can get the money?

396
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,200
I don't know about the money.

397
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,070
If that's all we care about,

398
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,630
But I think

399
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,330
more people will believe us.

400
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,330
It's also a pressure for breakfast.

401
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,630
Aren't we more likely to win?

402
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,730
Compared to money,

403
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,190
your dad's innocence is the most important.

404
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,300
Yes.

405
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
We're the victims.

406
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
They should be scared.

407
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,700
Liying.

408
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,600
I'll get

409
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,130
for what I deserve.

410
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,770
Really?

411
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,870
Yes.

412
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,300
I'll definitely go.

413
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,030
You said that.

414
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,570
I'll call them.

415
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,730
Yes.

416
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,330
Dad will go as he says.

417
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,030
Don't doubt me.

418
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,470
You heard it.

419
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,530
Recently,

420
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,600
Zhuang Zhuang received a video

421
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,170
a video about the breakfast.

422
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,700
It started five years ago

423
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,600
five years ago.

424
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,830
we'll invite the whistleblower

425
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,200
as well as her father.

426
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,130
[Kang Ji-ho]

427
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,970
Here we go.

428
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,670
Time's up. The show is very exciting.

429
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,130
Don't miss it.

430
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,130
See you later.

431
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,100
Liying, let me check with you.

432
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,530
the schedule.

433
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,870
It'll be very simple later.

434
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,930
I'll say the guide.

435
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,830
Then you just tell us what happened.

436
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,900
At last, our dad will make a summary.

437
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,000
Don't be too emotional.

438
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,230
Let's focus on nature.

439
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,670
And most importantly,

440
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,370
you must tell the culprit.

441
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,230
Li Peijin’s testimony

442
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,500
will be done between us.

443
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,730
Is that okay?

444
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,170
See you in the live stream room in five minutes.

445
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,570
Dad.

446
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Where are you?

447
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,070
I'm almost

448
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,700
I'm almost downstairs.

449
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,930
I'll pick you up.

450
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,130
It's not a big deal. It's a big deal.

451
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,700
Don't pretend to be fine

452
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,870
The toy accompanied us in our childhood.

453
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,400
[But someone dyed it with poison.]

454
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,800
And the poison was made by the hands of making breakfast.

455
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,330
It's time for breakfast.

456
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,830
Today,

457
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,230
we've invited two parties

458
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,330
The whistleblower Lin Li Ying

459
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,200
and her father Lin Guang Sheng.

460
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,230
What exactly happened?

461
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,330
your toy factory must go bankrupt.

462
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,630
Let's invite Liying to explain.

463
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,400
Hello, everyone.

464
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,100
Linlin Breakfast Restaurant asked us

465
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,130
for the 30th anniversary.

466
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,400
will be launched together with their new breakfast.

467
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,370
Vice President Deng Weikang

468
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,430
bribed our employees

469
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,930
and changed the paint into heavy metal.

470
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,730
I would like to ask my father Mr. Lin

471
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,370
to explain it to us.

472
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,030
It has nothing to do

473
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,970
breakfast.

474
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,630
It doesn't matter at all.

475
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,270
Dad.

476
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,800
I didn't manage this well.

477
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,630
I stole the materials.

478
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,370
I made the whole factory go bankrupt.

479
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,930
To make up for my daughter,

480
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,770
I failed in business

481
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,930
and property loss.

482
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,970
That's why I came up with this idea.

483
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,100
I personally feel

484
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,200
feel guilty.

485
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,470
And I...

486
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,500
I thought about it for a long time.

487
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,630
I want to

488
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,270
This one.

489
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,330
Before breakfast,

490
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,400
Okay. Okay.

491
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,330
Everyone.

492
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,930
I, Lin Guang Sheng,

493
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,570
sincerely apologize to you.

494
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:35,670
I'm sorry.

495
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,470
The live stream today is a bit...

496
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,970
What the hell?

497
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,300
You took his eldest daughter's money

498
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,930
the director's money.

499
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,070
Yes.

500
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,800
This...

501
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,730
Isn't our family asking for money?

502
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,330
I calculated this.

503
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,670
If we deduct our debts,

504
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,200
we can get 500,000 yuan.

505
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,730
How can you take money from others?

506
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,230
Mom and I paint there every day.

507
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,200
and finally brushed it off.

508
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,670
and finally survived.

509
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,630
Now you tell me

510
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,300
you took money from others.

511
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,600
Isn't that our fault?

512
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,330
No, listen to me.

513
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,830
At least from now on,

514
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,700
we don't have to worry about money anymore.

515
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,170
We just need to know that we did nothing wrong.

516
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,470
Isn't that enough?

517
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,930
Don't you think for Liying?

518
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,370
If you say that on the show,

519
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,770
What will everyone think of her?

520
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,970
Mom.

521
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,430
Please stop living in the past.

522
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,400
Okay?

523
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,030
It's been five years.

524
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,470
I don't want to keep distributing leaflets.

525
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,830
and carry the basket.

526
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,900
I know this is not the right way.

527
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,830
But it's the only way

528
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,570
to say goodbye to the past.

529
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,300
I feel sorry for Liying.

530
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,130
But only in this way

531
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,600
we can get more money.

532
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,770
Isn't it worth

533
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,970
worth

534
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,970
give us more money?

535
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,170
We're all forgetful anyway.

536
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,770
Only you forgot.

537
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,130
Lin Guang Sheng, listen.

538
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,300
I won't take a penny.

539
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,830
I've taken it.

540
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,770
Okay.

541
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,430
I have nothing to say to you.

542
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,900
Let's get a divorce.

543
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,270
No way.

544
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,900
I happen to have two ice sticks.

545
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,200
I forgot to eat one.

546
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,330
I ran into you here.

547
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,300
It's destiny

548
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,900
Come on. Have some ice. Okay.

549
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,870
Hey.

550
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,330
If I give you a chance now,

551
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,130
you won't get caught if you do one thing.

552
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,500
What are you doing?

553
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,430
Destroy all the breakfast restaurants.

554
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,700
I'm inside.

555
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,130
You're helping the evil.

556
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,500
I'm going to die.

557
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,570
You don't have any friends.

558
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,300
Okay.

559
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,370
Smash them all

560
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,870
Crush everything

561
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,530
and disappear on this earth, okay?

562
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,770
All breakfast is gone.

563
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,870
And I was not there.

564
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,130
I'm still alive.

565
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,000
Then you'll have friends.

566
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,100
Deal.

567
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,630
What flavor?

568
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,370
Grapes.

569
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,800
Is it good?

570
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,200
Not bad, right?

571
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,030
Fifteen.

572
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,700
16.

573
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,170
Chase Lee.

574
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,100
Eighteen.

575
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,800
19

576
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,900
Twenty.

577
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,200
That's right.

578
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,830
Okay. Okay. Okay.

579
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,330
Five thousand yuan.

580
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,400
In our cash register,

581
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
in our cash register.

582
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,330
Every day before the store closes,

583
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,730
as a receptionist,

584
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,100
and deduct 5,000 won fixed money.

585
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,970
and put them in a sealed bag.

586
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,730
and bid the amount and date.

587
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,900
Mr. Choi will come to the store on Friday.

588
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
That's today.

589
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,700
to the headquarters.

590
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,330
Easy.

591
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,230
Easy?

592
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,770
Yes.

593
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,500
If you're sure, sign it.

594
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,600
sign it.

595
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,530
Now? Remember.

596
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,200
A receptionist

597
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,070
to keep the money on that day.

598
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,770
So, as long as there's nothing missing,

599
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,370
you have to take responsibility.

600
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,730
Don't worry, I'm here.

601
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,370
How can money be wrong?

602
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,470
Did you clean the toilet?

603
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,930
It's not your turn to clean the toilet today.

604
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Go.

605
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,770
4,200.

606
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,600
Four thousand two days in a row.

607
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,500
Kang Ji-ho.

608
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,930
I paid the bill today.

609
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,870
Someone must know what I'm going to say.

610
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,970
This is your last chance.

611
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,330
Anyone wants to admit it?

612
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,530
Admit what?

613
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,700
Stop pretending.

614
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,500
Today's income is gone.

615
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,870
No way.

616
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,900
I took the money. I'm sure it's inside.

617
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,730
Do you want to take a look?

618
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,930
How long have I been here?

619
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,870
How could you do this to me?

620
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,100
It must be one of you

621
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,970
or not just one of you.

622
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,930
Who are you to suspect us?

623
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,570
You'll get money.

624
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,330
It's just the five of us.

625
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,200
So you're one of them.

626
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,870
I won't.

627
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,030
I don't need the money either.

628
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,900
What do you mean?

629
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,400
What's with that attitude?

630
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,670
It's true that we went in there.

631
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,330
But if you have no evidence,

632
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,730
you'd better keep your mouth shut.

633
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,200
Yes.

634
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,770
So what if we did?

635
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,700
You might steal your dad's.

636
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,530
It's not just money.

637
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,430
Okay, it's okay.

638
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,160
No one wants to admit it, right?

639
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,230
I knew it.

640
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,300
I called the police.

641
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,700
Just wait for the police.

642
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,430
Let's wait for the police...

643
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,230
Police.

644
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,930
Police in plain clothes.

645
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,170
Sir.

646
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,700
Excuse me.

647
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,000
What brings you here?

648
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,330
Didn't you just call the police?

649
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,970
A thief broke into our shop.

650
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,500
My colleague will be here soon.

651
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,430
All of you,

652
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,070
come to the police station.

653
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,130
Don't think I don't know

654
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,070
what your criminal records are.

655
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,770
I'm sorry, everyone.

656
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,429
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

657
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,770
I might have put it in my pocket

658
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,699
I put it in my pocket.

659
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,570
Excuse me.

660
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,000
How much do you need? Count it.

661
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,969
Count it.

662
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,130
Officer, I'm sorry.

663
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,570
You came all the way for nothing.

664
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,730
Do you want something to drink?

665
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,030
I'll use it for you.

666
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,030
No.

667
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,699
Stop wasting social resources.

668
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,330
Got it? Okay.

669
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,100
Excuse me.

670
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,500
I'm sorry.

671
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,370
You don't understand us at all.

672
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,230
Even if a Japanese restaurant is missing for breakfast,

673
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,730
it doesn't hurt at all.

674
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,070
But none of us

675
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,730
will be taken to the police station.

676
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,970
Does anyone dare to hire us?

677
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,430
Fatso.

678
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,370
He's got a baby. He's got a baby. Let's go. Okay.

679
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,900
Joon.

680
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,670
He has his mother to take care of.

681
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,870
Dayong.

682
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,700
You think his criminal record is not enough?

683
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,130
Also,

684
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,600
we should respect each other

685
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,970
We should respect each other.

686
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,600
Don't talk to us

687
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,300
with this attitude.

688
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,270
We all have family.

689
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,100
You can't be responsible for our future.

690
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,070
Can you see that the money

691
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,400
is his own, right?

692
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,170
Let me tell you.

693
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,330
he might have stolen the money.

694
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,170
But even if he did,

695
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,400
you can tell

696
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,030
what he said

697
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,430
is protecting us, right?

698
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,000
He looked like

699
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,600
a bit like the boss I used to work with.

700
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,800
Jiang Zhihao is so dramatic.

701
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,770
Get off work.

702
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,530
Let's go and get changed.

703
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,470
Let's go.

704
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,270
You go first.

705
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,670
I haven't washed the pot.

706
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,300
I didn't know I could be a cop.

707
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,730
I want to play that next time.

708
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,100
A gangster boss.

709
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,270
Please.

710
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,070
How dare you say that?

711
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,170
At least rent a suit.

712
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,100
And this. What is this?

713
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,670
It's obviously fake.

714
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,570
If I hadn't been quick,

715
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,070
you would have been exposed.

716
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,700
It's too sudden.

717
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,870
The rental store hasn't opened yet.

718
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,430
How can I borrow a uniform?

719
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,370
I can find this.

720
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,230
I’m very sincere.

721
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,370
How’s Ms. Tian’s bang?

722
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,700
Not bad, right?

723
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,900
I thought about it.

724
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,070
You think about it?

725
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,830
There is a saying

726
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,270
"The breeze is small, Yi Shui Han."

727
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,870
When I saw Ms. Tian not coming back,

728
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,770
At that time,

729
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,370
when he told me,

730
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,330
I thought of Ms. Tian immediately.

731
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,330
So big.

732
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,370
So fierce.

733
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,370
And the point is

734
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,530
So mysterious.

735
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,200
You search online.

736
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,170
about him online.

737
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,600
but there's no photo.

738
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,670
Do you know who stole the money?

739
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,930
Who?

740
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,700
Who?

741
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,430
The tall one?

742
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,830
Golden hair

743
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
or the curly one?

744
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,270
I knew it was him.

745
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,900
Mom.

746
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,670
Your eyes aren't good. I'm here.

747
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,270
Here.

748
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,500
Drink some water. It's hot.

749
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,470
I should help too.

750
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,230
Sometimes I wonder

751
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,900
if I was too strict with you.

752
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,230
When you guys were friends,

753
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,500
I should've been nicer to you.

754
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,670
and stricter to you.

755
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,630
and make you think

756
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,630
I'm a bad mother-in-law.

757
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,370
You might not have married him.

758
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,730
You can live happily now.

759
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,330
You said you wanted a divorce.

760
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,870
You can live your life now.

761
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,230
What's wrong?

762
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,700
It hurts.

763
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,700
Hang in there.

764
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,370
I should've known it hurts.

765
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,770
I'll see if you can ride

766
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,430
when you ride a motorcycle.

767
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,430
I inherited it, okay?

768
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,030
Genetic?

769
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,430
Do you want to inherit it from your mom?

770
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,130
You...

771
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,770
You didn't ride too slowly.

772
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,200
Let me tell you.

773
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,600
I usually have a driver.

774
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,370
I don't need a motorcycle.

775
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,000
Does it still hurt?

776
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,900
Feeling better? Feeling better?

777
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,070
Yes.

778
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,170
It's all the same.

779
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,870
He hit me.

780
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,670
Please.

781
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,800
It sounds like it's all my fault.

782
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,470
Okay.

783
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,370
That's good.

784
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,270
Yes, I remember.

785
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,700
Here.

786
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,470
Take this with you.

787
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,230
anytime, anytime.

788
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,300
Be safe.

789
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,830
Dad.

790
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,700
You're old.

791
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,970
You can't call me

792
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,230
just because you like it.

793
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,700
What are you mumbling about?

794
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,070
Take this.

795
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,100
Take it.

796
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,000
Okay.

797
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,130
It used to be.

798
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,830
Now is the present

799
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,370
My family is here

800
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,330
Where am I going?

801
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,000
You're a bad mother-in-law.

802
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,870
But I'm not

803
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,630
a filial wife.

804
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,030
OK.

805
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,070
Let's see

806
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,300
who is worse.

807
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,230
The headquarters decided to close the Japanese early store.

808
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,200
Even if a miracle happens,

809
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,730
it won't happen to you.

810
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:03,830
Before we catch the thief,

811
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:04,730
You're the prime suspect.

812
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,930
Apologize to Joon.

813
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,370
With your fist?

814
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,670
Why did you come back to the breakfast restaurant?

815
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,770
I really don't know

816
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,600
if I can still protect you.

817
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,400
Remember.

818
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,870
Clean up before the client gets home.

819
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,270
and leave the scene.

820
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,730
You really can't get married.

821
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm in charge of the company anyway.

822
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,170
If I lose a good employee like you,

823
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,230
to lose a good employee like you.

824
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,430
Deng Weikang.

825
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,700
To win you,

826
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,020
I've prepared for a long time.
