1
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,600
Alright, next up for tasting

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,270
is our temporary substitute

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,870
Chef Deng Weiyu's apple dish.

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,870
Please enjoy.

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,430
Let's ask our Wai Zui Ji to tell us

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,200
how you feel about this dish.

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,500
Actually, I was quite worried

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,400
that cooked apples would become mushy

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,900
and lose their flavor.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,200
But

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,870
you've maintained its crisp sweetness.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,430
That's impressive.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,370
Master Ma, what do you think?

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,030
This coffee has a strong apple flavor

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,600
with great complexity.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,330
I was just thinking I hadn't had coffee today

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,470
and felt off.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,000
Finally got my coffee now.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,800
Very good.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,100
What about Teacher Mana?

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,370
It reminds me of when I studied in Japan

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,070
and would rush to the supermarket for those cheap hand rolls.

23
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,030
Taking one bite of this

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,370
brings all those memories flooding back.

25
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,800
Even memories are coming back.

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,330
That's incredible.

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,900
Alright, next for tasting

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,930
is San Francisco Beauty Salon's Jiang Zhihao's creation.

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,630
A pomelo dish.

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,100
Pomelo-flavored chicken wrap.

31
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,500
I wonder what everyone thinks.

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,430
Have you tried it?

33
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,570
I noticed you haven't tasted it at all.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,130
I thought so too.

35
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,970
We really didn't see you taste it.

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,900
We only saw you and the pomelo

37
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
gazing at each other for a long time.

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,229
No way.

39
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,570
Don't tell me there's actually regret.

40
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,200
Alright.

41
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,830
The judges have now tasted all nine dishes

42
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,230
and must be very full by now.

43
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,770
What must be faced must be faced.

44
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,100
Take a deep breath.

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Alright, now for our judging.

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,030
Wai Zui Ji will announce for us

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,400
which contestant is eliminated.

48
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,230
Actually, we didn't discuss for very long.

49
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,100
We unanimously decided.

50
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,270
The one eliminated is...

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,170
Congratulations, Vice President.

52
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,730
Cheers.

53
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,470
Thank you.

54
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,800
Congratulations on advancing, Vice President.

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,430
Thanks.

56
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,800
Vice President, you're such a good cook.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,170
You never mentioned it before.

58
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,800
Not really. I'm just playing around.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,830
Playing around... My brother always says

60
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,270
I'm just playing house.

61
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,430
The Vice President's cooking skills are so excellent.

62
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,500
Must have inherited them from the Chairman.

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,900
That must be it.

64
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,800
Weiyu.

65
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,470
Well done.

66
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,230
Thanks, Dad.

67
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,330
Weiyu is already in eighth grade.

68
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,770
What grudge do you have against us two?

69
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,900
I've already let Weiyu move in.

70
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,500
Eating my food, using my things, isn't that enough?

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,000
He's your son, not your employee.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,730
Have you ever really looked at him?

73
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,830
Have you ever had a proper conversation with him?

74
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,730
Weiyu.

75
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,270
Go add some salt for me.

76
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,670
I forgot.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,900
I treat all my children the same.

78
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,300
How much should I add?

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,170
Three spoonfuls.

80
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,300
You said it was delicious last time, right?

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,600
But

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Dad said last time

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,870
it was too salty this way.

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,300
Is there any way to make everyone like it?

85
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,470
One dish

86
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,770
can't satisfy everyone.

87
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,000
You can't be too greedy when cooking.

88
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,530
Just like you,

89
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,970
you can't make everyone like you.

90
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,000
But

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,130
it's enough that some people like you.

92
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,300
Then...

93
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,400
what can I do to make Dad like me?

94
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
Sister Peng.

95
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,760
Where did you buy these hamburgers today?

96
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,730
Chairman.

97
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,870
Today's meal

98
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,430
was all made by Weiyu.

99
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,630
No wonder I thought this hamburger steak

100
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,070
smelled strange.

101
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,000
Can you even cook?

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,900
What if we get sick later?

103
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,630
Delicious.

104
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,600
Go make another one.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,570
Thank you, Dad.

106
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll go make it now.

107
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,430
I'll help you.

108
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,130
Sister Peng, look,

109
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,900
Dad finished everything.

110
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,870
Can I continue learning to cook from you?

111
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,330
Of course you can.

112
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,500
The restaurant is booked.

113
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,130
Which one?

114
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,330
Weiyu,

115
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,260
why did you finally decide to participate yourself?

116
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,230
After Jason left,

117
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,070
the atmosphere in the company became more unstable.

118
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,430
I thought rather than finding a substitute,

119
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,290
it would be more controllable if I competed myself.

120
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,030
Looking at the results,

121
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,960
you were indeed the most suitable.

122
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,070
Keep it up.

123
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
What about Jiang Zhihao?

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,930
How did he perform?

125
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,570
Why are you drinking so quickly?

126
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,370
I need to hurry to another place.

127
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,130
I'm just calming my nerves.

128
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,030
You nearly scared me to death.

129
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,900
I thought you were going to be eliminated.

130
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,000
Relax.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,200
There will be a loser's bracket anyway.

132
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,300
We don't have that.

133
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,330
That's too bad.

134
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,800
You should have told me earlier that you don't eat pomelo.

135
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Why?

136
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,300
Are you offering to pull strings for me?

137
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,170
All contestants should

138
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,330
be given ingredients they hate.

139
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,930
Just imagine

140
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,770
if someone allergic to shrimp

141
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,600
had to cook with shrimp.

142
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,300
Wouldn't that be dramatic and entertaining?

143
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,570
Miss,

144
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,030
that's attempted murder.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,900
How did you manage it?

146
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,570
Not eating pomelo

147
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,730
yet making pomelo dishes

148
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,130
that taste so delicious.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,570
That's quite a story.

150
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,500
Let me tell you.

151
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,970
Lin Liying,

152
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,030
what are you doing?

153
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,230
I just sent a box to your house yesterday,

154
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,700
and today you bring two boxes here.

155
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,730
When will this cycle of revenge ever end?

156
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,600
It's just returning the favor.

157
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,470
I already have two boxes at home.

158
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,670
I have some too.

159
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,400
I won't take them.

160
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,730
If you don't take them back...

161
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,700
You'll have to step over my dead body.

162
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,670
Fine.

163
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,770
Is that so difficult?

164
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,630
You're really stepping on me!

165
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,230
I forgot to tell Auntie Xiurong

166
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,830
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

167
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,370
Auntie Xiurong,

168
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,070
happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
You're quite quick-witted.

170
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,170
Jiang Zhihao.

171
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,830
What are you doing at my place?

172
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,830
Let me tell you, this is amazing.

173
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,700
Take a look.

174
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,530
Pomelo-flavored chicken roll,

175
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,300
pomelo-flavored fish lettuce wrap,

176
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,200
pomelo honey water.

177
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,870
And more,

178
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,630
and more.

179
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,830
Pomelo-flavored kimchi pork burger.

180
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,200
You're at it again.

181
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,230
You pull this stunt every year.

182
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,670
Try it. No, I don't want to.

183
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,600
Come on.

184
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,900
I don't eat pomelo, right?

185
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,200
So you have to be my taste tester.

186
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,030
I'll adjust according to your taste.

187
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,830
Just because I like it doesn't mean everyone will.

188
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,300
As long as you like it.

189
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,230
It's not like others are eating it.

190
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,770
The pomelo flavor is too strong.

191
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,970
I only added half the pomelo to this one.

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,460
You brought all the pomelos here?

193
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,090
You brought everything back.

194
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,000
The fridge is completely full.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,730
You need to take them away.

196
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,070
Relax.

197
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,800
I can adjust the seasoning for all of those.

198
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,900
Let me tell you,

199
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm building my reputation this year.

200
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,070
Next year I'm going to start charging.

201
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,600
How dare you!

202
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,430
You have the nerve!

203
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,090
This is our Mid-Autumn Festival pomelo battle.

204
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,630
And that's how

205
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,200
the pomelo-flavored chicken flatbread came to be.

206
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,070
Look at this.

207
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,370
Lin Liying is just... look.

208
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,500
This one.

209
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,230
Look, look at Lin Liying.

210
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,400
Her eyes always squint like this when she laughs.

211
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,430
And she can never catch the right moment for photos.

212
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,800
Like a complete idiot.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,130
Look at this one too.

214
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,570
You seem happy every time you talk about her.

215
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,370
Yeah.

216
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,770
It's really funny.

217
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,800
Look.

218
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,470
I can be funny too.

219
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,230
You two are different.

220
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,900
Lin Liying's type...

221
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,170
She has this natural silliness that's funny.

222
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,170
Most people don't get it.

223
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,570
Only I understand.

224
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,870
Look.

225
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,930
My stand-up comedy performance...

226
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,300
Will show you that my life is the real joke.

227
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,400
Welcome.

228
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,030
Hello.

229
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,400
We have a reservation for four under Miss Lin.

230
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,900
Alright. Is everyone here?

231
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,970
We have a friend who's parking.

232
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,600
Great. We have a special promotion today.

233
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,930
Kiss for pork belly.

234
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,670
Everyone can participate.

235
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,300
Kissing?

236
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,030
This...

237
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,300
I...

238
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
I'm the pork belly. She...

239
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,370
Don't bother.

240
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

241
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,500
Thank you for dining with us today.

242
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,630
We have a meat giveaway at 8 o'clock.

243
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,100
Just kiss for ten seconds and you'll get free pork belly.

244
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,030
Would you like to participate?

245
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,730
Just ten seconds.

246
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,100
This plate of pork belly will be yours.

247
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,900
We'll do it.

248
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,530
Ten.

249
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,630
Where's the restroom?

250
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,800
Straight ahead that way. Thanks.

251
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,570
Thank you.

252
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,370
Seven.

253
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,630
Six.

254
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,230
Five.

255
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,470
Four.

256
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,370
Three.

257
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,670
Two.

258
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,770
One.

259
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,130
Here's your pork belly.

260
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,230
Please enjoy.

261
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,160
Enjoy your meal.

262
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,130
Pork belly.

263
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,100
Why are you looking at me like that?

264
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,970
Lips to lips for a plate of beef.

265
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,530
I'm a money-saving wizard.

266
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,330
I'd even streak naked if needed.

267
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,100
It's burnt.

268
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,270
Eat it quickly.

269
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,270
Table two's bacon and egg pancake.

270
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,070
Table three's ham and egg toast.

271
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Thank you.

272
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,830
Here's your bacon and egg pancake.

273
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,530
And here's your ham and egg toast.

274
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,570
Jiang Zhihao.

275
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,430
What did you do to my mom yesterday?

276
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,100
Today she

277
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,630
gave me an extra 100 dollars for my allowance.

278
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,870
Can you take her out more often?

279
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,700
Kids don't need to worry about such things.

280
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,500
This is your pay for today.

281
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,370
And save this 100 dollars.

282
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,570
You're going to be late for school.

283
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,530
Hurry up.

284
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,530
Don't forget your backpack. Alright.

285
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,330
OK.

286
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,430
Bye. Good, bye.

287
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,530
Zhihao.

288
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,430
Dad.

289
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,470
Why are you still here?

290
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah.

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Didn't you say you were visiting your mom today?

292
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,630
I was thinking

293
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,670
I'd go after closing the shop.

294
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,130
Alright, I'll take care of things here.

295
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,900
Didn't you say you needed to buy

296
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,570
the kueh your mom likes?

297
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,930
You sure you can handle it?

298
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,570
Yes, of course I can.

299
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,230
This table ordered bacon and egg pancakes,

300
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,030
OK.

301
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,130
and they need more milk tea.

302
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,970
Got it.

303
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,300
Mom.

304
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,200
When you hear this song now,

305
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,800
does it still make you happy?

306
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,630
If you're not happy, you should tell me in my dreams.

307
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,290
Don't keep quiet all the time.

308
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,800
I brought your favorite food.

309
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,260
I've been looking for you for so long.

310
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,870
Finally found you.

311
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,800
I now have many breakfast shops.

312
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,230
I even opened one in Jinshan.

313
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,230
You said you would come help me.

314
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,530
You said sweetness could cover up life's bitterness.

315
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,370
But after you left,

316
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,870
everything tastes bitter to me.

317
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,570
You're so stubborn.

318
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,100
It was

319
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,170
just a misunderstanding.

320
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Our lives have

321
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,730
just passed each other by.

322
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,830
Was it worth it?

323
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,000
Chairman.

324
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,770
The worst thing in this world

325
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,900
is living with someone

326
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,500
who doesn't understand you.

327
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,700
Some things,

328
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,030
only time will tell what's right or wrong.

329
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,570
I'm not here today as the chairman.

330
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,200
I won't make the same mistake again.

331
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,770
Zhihao.

332
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,670
You're not getting any younger.

333
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,800
It's time to think about your future.

334
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,330
Do you really want

335
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,830
to be stuck in a tiny shop?

336
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,800
My father has said all this before.

337
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,400
We all have family waiting for us.

338
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,569
Don't let them down.

339
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,270
What's wrong? Didn't sleep well?

340
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,170
I didn't sleep at all.

341
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,760
Thinking about Jiang Zhihao?

342
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,700
How did you know?

343
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,730
Now I understand.

344
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
What it's like to like someone.

345
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,100
But keeping it bottled up inside without letting them know

346
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,200
is really painful.

347
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,170
If you gather your courage and confess to him,

348
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,400
even if you know

349
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
it might not work out,

350
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,030
at least you'll be true to yourself

351
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,560
and won't have any regrets.

352
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,370
Congratulations to everyone who advanced from the first round.

353
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,730
We're now moving to the second round.

354
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,630
The second round is our team collaboration challenge.

355
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,000
You each have a ball in your hands.

356
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,800
When you open the ball,

357
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,430
you'll find a colored small ball inside.

358
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,870
Find someone with the matching color,

359
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,670
and pair up with them.

360
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,730
Eight people will form four teams.

361
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,830
In this round, you'll need to work together side by side

362
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,370
to advance to the next level together.

363
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,830
Are you confident?

364
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,500
Yes.

365
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,830
Great. Please open the balls in your hands

366
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,930
and see what color you have.

367
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,570
First, let's see

368
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,170
San Francisco Beauty Salon has a red ball.

369
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,570
The other red ball belongs to

370
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,400
Temporary Difference.

371
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Congratulations on your successful pairing.

372
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,130
Good. Next,

373
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,130
Early Morning Club has a blue ball.

374
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,730
The other blue ball belongs to

375
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,770
Seven O'Clock Opening.

376
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,800
Congratulations on completing your pairing.

377
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,830
In the first round, you placed second and third respectively.

378
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,300
A powerful combination.

379
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,570
You must be confident about the next round, right?

380
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,900
I think I'll just try my best

381
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,530
to enjoy the moment of the competition,

382
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,630
and winning or losing doesn't matter.

383
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,700
According to your information,

384
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,000
you knew each other before the competition.

385
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,060
You must have good chemistry working together, right?

386
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,230
We used to

387
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,930
study menus together and such.

388
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,270
Chemistry shouldn't be a big issue.

389
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,700
Yes, we often taste test for each other

390
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,830
and give each other valuable feedback.

391
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,830
Yes, OK.

392
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,070
And being able to work with him

393
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,630
makes me feel at ease.

394
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,090
My confidence is boosted.

395
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,270
Temporary Difference

396
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,630
and San Francisco Beauty Salon - how will you collaborate?

397
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,830
Do you have any ideas?

398
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,670
I think... I plan to

399
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,030
use San Francisco Beauty Salon's

400
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,400
signature ingredient fusion

401
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,800
paired with Temporary Difference's newly developed secret sauce

402
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,530
to make a pie.

403
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,730
As for what dish exactly,

404
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,600
the audience will have to wait and see.

405
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,430
I think Temporary Difference is

406
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,930
an upscale brunch restaurant,

407
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,230
so we can't skimp on ingredients.

408
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,530
And since our San Francisco Beauty Salon

409
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,900
has never used seafood in our dishes,

410
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,070
I'll incorporate seafood this time.

411
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,130
OK.

412
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,800
You both ranked at the bottom in the first round.

413
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,900
About that pie,

414
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,230
do you have any ideas?

415
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,600
Just worry about your seafood.

416
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,770
I'll handle my part myself.

417
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,730
Since we have such good chemistry,

418
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,460
we shouldn't need to discuss such a small matter.

419
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,700
OK then.

420
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,200
Alright. Best wishes.

421
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Good luck with everything else.

422
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,300
Look at all these girls.

423
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,200
Some might be skipping work or class,

424
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,570
but they're all lining up here.

425
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,130
Really.

426
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,500
And it's been three days straight,

427
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,130
with no decrease in crowds.

428
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,730
Yes!

429
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,570
So do you know what the problem is?

430
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,270
What is it?

431
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,030
In the past, Nuo Toast's

432
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,200
main consumers were families.

433
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,870
We can't just rebrand

434
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,700
and lose our old customers.

435
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,370
Obviously, I mentioned before

436
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,170
that we can't abandon our old customers,

437
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,430
but you haven't given me a good solution.

438
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,830
What about our weekend hot pressed toast DIY event?

439
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,270
We could change it from a girlfriends' version to a family version.

440
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,770
Let the sisters come

441
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,700
and bring their kids along.

442
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,530
Right.

443
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,530
Parents can bring their children,

444
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,170
and we'll keep our customer base.

445
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,500
That's broad.

446
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,800
Until we have a new plan,

447
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,300
let's go with this for now.

448
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,370
After the family event,

449
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,570
okay. We still need to do the survey.

450
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,100
Okay.

451
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,300
Liying,

452
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,330
you remember you're my assistant, right?

453
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,400
I remember.

454
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,030
Don't we have a dinner meeting later?

455
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,330
Yes, we're meeting with Director Du this afternoon.

456
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,500
Come with me.

457
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,370
Okay.

458
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,670
I'll call a car.

459
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,170
This battle for the girlfriend economy

460
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,400
has been fought well.

461
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,660
You know Shuqin is coming back in 10 days, right?

462
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,070
I'll organize all my work

463
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,330
and hand it over to her.

464
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,200
Order dinner

465
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,330
for the entire company.

466
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,760
What are you doing here?

467
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,670
Um,

468
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,670
thank you for your umbrella.

469
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,070
You're busy. I'll head back now.

470
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,000
No,

471
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,670
I'm not busy.

472
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,430
Well,

473
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,070
why don't you come in and sit for a while?

474
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,970
I have some newly developed bread.

475
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,970
I'll cut a few slices

476
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,700
and you can taste test it for me.

477
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,400
Good, come in.

478
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,700
Over here. Sit here,

479
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,030
it's more comfortable.

480
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,470
Are you the only one here?

481
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,270
Yes,

482
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,700
I'm both boss and employee.

483
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,200
Business isn't as busy as before,

484
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,530
so I have more time

485
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,430
to develop my own bread recipes

486
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,230
and do more things I enjoy.

487
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,970
Here.

488
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,970
Thank you.

489
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,200
Try it.

490
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,630
Boss, I want some bread.

491
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,430
Okay, let me check.

492
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,360
Go ahead with your work.

493
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,270
All the bread here is freshly baked.

494
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,500
Do you have a favorite type of bread?

495
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,430
Milk.

496
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,070
Thank you.

497
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,670
How is it? Does it taste good?

498
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,200
Why did you decide to open a shop by yourself?

499
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,630
With your reputation,

500
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,290
you could surely find investors, couldn't you?

501
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,570
Let's not.

502
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,500
Having meetings every day, helping others decide what to do,

503
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,370
what adjustments to make,

504
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:14,970
and being so busy

505
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,370
that you forget what you want for yourself.

506
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,490
Don't you find this kind of life exhausting?

507
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,970
When you say that,

508
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,700
why does it feel like you're targeting me?

509
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,330
I'm not at all.

510
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,070
The person I know

511
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,800
should be someone

512
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,070
who has always been very clear

513
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,570
about what she wants.

514
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,770
How about you?

515
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,000
Are you doing okay?

516
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,700
I'm not doing well.

517
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,300
Deng Weiyu,

518
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,000
your room is so beautiful.

519
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,500
I didn't snoop around. It's so fancy.

520
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,870
Did you open the closet? Of course not.

521
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,130
Why would I open the closet?

522
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,660
Is someone hiding in there?

523
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,570
Are you sure you don't need help?

524
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,170
No need.

525
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,800
I've been on TV now,

526
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,570
the Executive Chef.

527
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,230
What about being paired with my brother?

528
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,130
It's fine.

529
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,470
He'll do his thing, and I'll do mine.

530
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,170
This is a team competition.

531
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,900
Aren't you going to discuss how to work together?

532
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,500
It doesn't matter.

533
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,270
He's not that weak.

534
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,470
We won't lose that easily.

535
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,970
Whatever.

536
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,170
Just finish the competition properly

537
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,530
and don't argue on the show.

538
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,470
Alright.

539
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,000
It looks delicious.

540
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,930
Apple coffee. That's impressive.

541
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,500
Is it okay?

542
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,430
It's good.

543
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,370
Dad.

544
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,830
Hello, sir.

545
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry. I thought

546
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,530
you wouldn't be back today.

547
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,370
Hello, sir.

548
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,170
I'm Jiang Zhilu,

549
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,500
his girlfriend.

550
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,300
Would you like to join us?

551
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,270
This is Weiyu's competition dish.

552
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:31,970
Okay.

553
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,970
Sit there.

554
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,170
It's fine.

555
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,470
Sit.

556
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,000
I can sit anywhere.

557
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,730
Sir,

558
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,800
I heard from my brother before

559
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,070
that your schedule is always packed,

560
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,170
so I wasn't sure

561
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,070
when would be a good time to visit you.

562
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,300
I'm sorry about that.

563
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,270
Your brother?

564
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,130
My brother is Jiang Zhihao.

565
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,670
He used to work at Linlin.

566
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,600
Now he runs his own breakfast shop.

567
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
So Jiang Zhihao is your brother?

568
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,230
Zhilu and Zhihao.

569
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,870
Your brother is very talented.

570
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,170
Talented?

571
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,270
Besides cooking,

572
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,030
he doesn't seem capable of anything else.

573
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,400
Is that so?

574
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,070
Looks like you and your brother are close.

575
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,370
I guess we are.

576
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,430
We've been arguing since childhood.

577
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,130
Dad, try this.

578
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,900
These are dishes I made in the first round of the competition.

579
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,330
This caramelized apple rose tart,

580
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,500
and this apple and shrimp hand roll.

581
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,430
Here you go, sir.

582
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,670
Thanks.

583
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,130
You have a girlfriend and didn't tell me?

584
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,300
If my meeting hadn't been canceled today,

585
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,230
when would I have met Zhilu?

586
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,130
My son is so socially clueless.

587
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,770
No, I'm not.

588
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,170
Let's find a time

589
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:46,900
I'll treat everyone

590
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,170
bring your family over

591
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,670
so we can get to know each other.

592
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,670
Sure, thank you, sir.

593
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,530
Don't just talk about it.

594
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,830
Weiyu,

595
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,970
go arrange the time and restaurant.

596
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,070
Okay.

597
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,570
Coffee's ready.

598
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,500
Thanks.

599
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,270
This is mine.

600
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,970
The proposal is ready.

601
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,830
Boss, I'm leaving.

602
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,000
Bye.

603
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,800
Yes, Xiaozhen is responsible for the meeting minutes this time.

604
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,070
Remind him about it.

605
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,370
Thank you, ma'am.

606
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,500
Okay, I'll be there soon.

607
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,230
Okay, thanks. Bye.

608
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,300
Hello.

609
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,670
Good morning, everyone.

610
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,830
Morning, L-I-N

611
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,730
Lin.

612
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,370
Jimmy,

613
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,870
I got Earl Grey bagels.

614
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,800
Here.

615
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,830
You're being so nice today.

616
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,830
Smells great.

617
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,930
I'm late.

618
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,600
Amy, what should we do?

619
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,530
Shanru isn't here yet.

620
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,630
Find her quickly.

621
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,930
I'll go check again.

622
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,200
Tongtong, are you ready?

623
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
Almost.

624
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,900
What do we do? Shanru still isn't here.

625
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,130
But Director Wang from Shengyuan Department Store is almost here.

626
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,470
Still can't reach her.

627
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,230
Should you start the meeting without her?

628
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,760
But Director Wang is notoriously difficult.

629
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,900
I can call

630
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,160
the building manager at Shanru's place.

631
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,530
What should we do?

632
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:50,800
Amy,

633
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,970
let me see Director Wang's information.

634
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,370
What are you going to do?

635
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,830
I'll give it a try.

636
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,600
It's over.

637
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,630
Director Wang looks very unhappy.

638
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,700
Tell your boss

639
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,600
to reschedule

640
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,300
and come see me herself.

641
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,870
Okay,

642
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,330
thank you, Director Wang.

643
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,730
This is for you.

644
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,370
Also,

645
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,970
you deserve a raise.

646
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,270
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

647
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,330
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

648
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,570
Goodbye, Mr. Wang.

649
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,000
Shanru, are you okay?

650
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,830
I...

651
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,230
Shanru?

652
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,370
Shanru?

653
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,600
What time is it?

654
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,800
It's the time you're supposed to be here.

655
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,970
Your phone.

656
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,330
Are you okay?

657
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,330
You're burning up.

658
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,430
Lie down.

659
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,200
Mr. Wang.

660
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
I've already taken care of Mr. Wang's matter.

661
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,900
He's not angry.

662
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,570
I just rescheduled with him.

663
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,570
You're really burning up.

664
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,770
And that... just rest first.

665
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,630
The afternoon proposal.

666
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,470
Don't worry. The afternoon matters...

667
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,800
I've taken care of them too.

668
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
Amy's project proposal...

669
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,470
Didn't you already discuss your ideas with her yesterday?

670
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,870
So don't worry about it.

671
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,330
Everything's fine, okay?

672
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,700
I've never seen you like this before.

673
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,370
Don't move.

674
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,230
I'll get you some fresh hot water.

675
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,230
Don't eat this anymore.

676
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,770
Come on, get up.

677
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,170
You really have nothing better to do.

678
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,900
Am I not giving you enough work?

679
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,300
I made it very light.

680
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,500
You need to eat before taking medicine.

681
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,470
Is the list of ad directors ready?

682
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,230
Yes, I've prepared it.

683
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,070
I found two ad directors.

684
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,930
One is Zhang Yuelin.

685
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,230
The other is Li Guanming.

686
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,960
Let's go with Li Guanming then.

687
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,070
But Zhang Yuelin just won

688
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,600
a major advertising design award.

689
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,170
Did I ask for your opinion?

690
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,070
You didn't ask for my opinion,

691
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,600
but I want to influence you.

692
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,400
Zhang Yuelin...

693
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,929
is the person who introduced me to Fang Nuo.

694
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,600
After Fang Nuo and I divorced,

695
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,929
all our friends

696
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,070
criticized him.

697
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,730
'How could you be so stupid?

698
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,030
Your wife was so supportive.

699
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,070
How could you cheat on her?'

700
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:42,370
But after criticizing him,

701
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,500
they all still took his side

702
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,429
and remained his friends.

703
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,730
Of course,

704
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,469
I know the reason why.

705
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,130
Because Zhuo Shanru is crazy,

706
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,030
a psycho.

707
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,400
She's just a woman who only cares about money.

708
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,730
She deserves to be miserable and alone forever.

709
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,100
You've said things like that too, haven't you?

710
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,130
I don't care anymore.

711
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,070
People are

712
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,070
unreliable creatures anyway.

713
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,700
Everything is fake.

714
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,730
Only money is real.

715
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,970
But...

716
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,900
Being alone in this house,

717
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,670
it feels so big

718
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,800
and so quiet.

719
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,530
So quiet that

720
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,430
I often feel like I can't breathe.

721
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,330
I even wonder

722
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,230
if I died, would anyone even notice?

723
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,200
This smell of death

724
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,400
will take a long time to reach next door.

725
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,730
So

726
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,790
let's choose Li Guanming.

727
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,600
Do you want to find a boyfriend?

728
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,330
I can introduce someone to you.

729
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,900
You want to set me up with someone?

730
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,830
The men around you are just Gao Bohan

731
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,800
and that

732
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,400
on-again-off-again boyfriend Jiang Zhihao.

733
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,070
You know,

734
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,730
while you're still young,

735
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:02,070
you should date as much as possible.

736
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,700
When I was your age,

737
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,160
I'd dated countless guys.

738
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,730
Look at you,

739
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,700
your corpse smell hasn't even spread yet

740
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,500
and I'm already here to save you.

741
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,000
Your cooking skills look terrible.

742
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
Is this even edible?

743
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,600
My cooking isn't great,

744
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,700
it was all made by that

745
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,960
on-again-off-again boyfriend of mine.

746
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,600
Eat some.

747
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,470
You need to take your medicine.

748
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,600
Is it that bad?

749
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,530
Good thing you're here to clean,

750
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,830
not to cook.

751
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Breakfast with the World.

752
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,170
Round Two Competition.

753
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,530
Now we're having the Group A showdown.

754
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,570
Let me introduce.

755
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,370
On my right is San Francisco Beauty Salon

756
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,470
and Linshi Cha's collaboration team.

757
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,900
Good. Do your best.

758
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,370
On this side is our Shishi Zaizai

759
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,130
and Mo Ling's collaboration team.

760
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,000
Please wave.

761
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,570
Know yourself and your enemy, and you'll win every battle.

762
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,870
How will they

763
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,530
incorporate each other's characteristics

764
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,130
to create their own collaborative dishes?

765
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,570
I think this really tests everyone's creativity.

766
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,830
But I need to tell everyone

767
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,600
that our elimination rules this time

768
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,770
are extremely cruel.

769
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,670
The winners will both advance.

770
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,270
From the losing team,

771
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,000
one person will be eliminated.

772
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,700
Let's begin now.

773
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,470
Breakfast with the World,

774
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,700
Round Two Competition,

775
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
Go!

776
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,730
OK, cut!

777
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,470
That's good.

778
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,570
Thank you. Here, lunch boxes are here.

779
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,400
Let's eat first.

780
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,000
Time to eat.

781
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,270
Food's ready.

782
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,500
Where's my food?

783
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,230
I'm so hungry.

784
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,630
What are we eating today?

785
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,370
Yeah.

786
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,430
Our opponents are from Linlin Group.

787
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,270
A-Yuan, stay steady.

788
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,270
You'll definitely advance smoothly.

789
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,530
About the judges... Boss, wait a minute.

790
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,270
I'll find a private place.

791
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,000
Hey.

792
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,030
Bri...

793
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,000
Bribe.

794
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,800
Boss, what are you doing?

795
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,070
Why don't you believe I can win

796
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,670
based on my skills?

797
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,530
What if that judge

798
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,590
turns around and stabs us in the back?

799
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,330
Fine, since you've already paid,

800
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,930
I'll pretend I don't know anything.

801
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:16,670
I'm begging you,

802
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,470
don't do this kind of thing again in the next round.

803
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,970
That's it for now. I'm going to prepare.

804
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,100
Then I'll find out who the judges are first.

805
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,000
Aiya.

806
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,170
If in our team,

807
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,900
one person must be eliminated,

808
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,930
it might not necessarily be a bad thing.

809
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,170
Deputy Director.

810
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,370
I don't quite understand what you mean.

811
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,070
OK, let's take a look at this team first.

812
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,970
This team must be the eye-candy group,

813
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,200
tall and handsome,

814
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,530
and good at cooking.

815
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,030
You're cutting so finely.

816
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,870
These diced pieces,

817
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,900
you just cut them all in one go?

818
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,170
You're really good.

819
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,370
Over here,

820
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,000
he's working on the onions.

821
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,230
You're going for a Western style now,

822
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,070
that's right.

823
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,530
Combined with these tomatoes.

824
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,600
OK, carry on.

825
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,530
Is this teriyaki sauce?

826
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,470
Smells so good.

827
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,960
Seems like you want to combine it with tomatoes.

828
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Okay, let's see what we have here.

829
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,070
Why are there so many colors here?

830
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,830
This is

831
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,870
rice noodles.

832
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,670
Red, yellow, white.

833
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,900
Then add shrimp.

834
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,830
It feels like we've truly arrived in Southeast Asia.

835
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,300
Everyone seems to be working with great enthusiasm.

836
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,330
Very

837
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:12,800
except for

838
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,700
San Francisco Beauty Salon.

839
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,230
Now just staring blankly in front of the refrigerator.

840
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,960
Who knows what's on their mind.

841
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,390
Coming back without bringing anything.

842
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,030
Strange.

843
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,430
Back to the battle.

844
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,670
Time is ticking away minute by minute.

845
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,070
Please keep going, okay?

846
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,730
The judges have finished tasting.

847
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,000
The scores have been sent backstage for tallying.

848
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,170
While waiting for the results,

849
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,800
let's hear what the judges have to say.

850
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,770
First,

851
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,400
Master Chef Ma,

852
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,770
what do you think?

853
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,170
The dishes this time are impressive.

854
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,230
Two dishes particularly stood out to me.

855
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,730
The first one is

856
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,270
Shi Shi Zai Zai.

857
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,730
Its texture is very sophisticated.

858
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,830
Did you use onions?

859
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,330
That's right. I minced the onions

860
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,130
and sautéed them to bring out the sweetness.

861
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,170
Well done.

862
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,700
Excellent.

863
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,130
And you,

864
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,230
San Francisco Beauty Salon,

865
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,330
your menu item,

866
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,600
crab seafood burger.

867
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
But this isn't real crab meat, is it?

868
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,600
It's not made from actual crab, right?

869
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,970
My crab wasn't very fresh,

870
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,130
so I used

871
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,030
an imitation crab technique.

872
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,270
Delicious. Not bad.

873
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,300
Thank you.

874
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,670
Actually, I was quite surprised.

875
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,730
This crab burger really looks like the real thing.

876
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,930
For vegetarians,

877
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,070
it's actually a great option.

878
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,800
Judges, your comments about him are quite impressive.

879
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,300
I wonder what Crooked Mouth Ji thinks?

880
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,900
It's tasty, yes.

881
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,230
But

882
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,500
the flavors are worlds apart.

883
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,470
Don't you think

884
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,300
San Francisco Beauty Salon and Temporary Difference

885
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,600
have no connection at all?

886
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,770
Besides,

887
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,770
a seafood burger without seafood

888
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,700
is like bubble tea without bubbles.

889
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,070
That does make sense.

890
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,770
There seems to be some disagreement.

891
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,470
That's okay.

892
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,770
Let's see what the results are.

893
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,300
Could the staff please bring up the envelope?

894
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:33,670
Thank you.

895
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,670
In this round of head-to-head competition,

896
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,130
the list of those who will advance

897
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,670
is right here in my hand.

898
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,930
Ladies and gentlemen,

899
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,870
those advancing today are

900
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,870
Shi Shi Zai Zai and Mo Ling.

901
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,200
Congratulations!

902
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,030
Congratulations to you all. Well done.

903
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,430
A beautiful competition.

904
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,530
Congratulations.

905
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,070
In other words, today

906
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,030
San Francisco Beauty Salon and Temporary Difference

907
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,230
will have one person

908
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,300
temporarily leaving our stage.

909
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,930
Ladies and gentlemen,

910
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,170
tonight

911
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,770
the one eliminated is

912
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,530
San Francisco Beauty Salon.

913
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,870
Do you have any opponent you fear the most?

914
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,530
I'm not afraid of anyone.

915
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,800
The last person who opened the refrigerator before the competition

916
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,700
was that female assistant from Temporary Difference.

917
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,230
Have you ever thought that Jiang Zhihao's biological father

918
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,700
might suddenly appear?

919
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,330
You've been preparing to confess for so long.

920
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,270
That was just a joke,

921
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,830
with a little embellishment.

922
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,430
Come on, just confess.

923
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,430
You confessed to me

924
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,300
and then pretended it never happened.

925
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,600
If that's not being a jerk, then what is?

926
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,130
You kissed her

927
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:47,970
and then didn't get together with her.

928
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,000
What do you call that?
