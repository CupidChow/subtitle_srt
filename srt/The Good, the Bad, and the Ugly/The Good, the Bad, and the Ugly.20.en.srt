1
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,700
Can you check this for me?

2
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,900
I need more shots with people and food.

3
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,530
Okay.

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,170
Come on, camera two.

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,900
Focus more on people with food.

6
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,470
Thanks.

7
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,300
For this head-to-head round,

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,770
the list of contestants who will advance

9
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,370
is right here in my hand.

10
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,530
Ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,700
those advancing today are...

12
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,730
Shi Shi Zai Zai and Mo Ling.

13
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,400
Congratulations!

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,530
Congratulations. Good job.

15
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,970
Excellent work.

16
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Now for today,

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,229
between San Francisco Beauty Salon and Time Lag team,

18
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,400
one contestant will temporarily leave our stage.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,030
Tonight,

20
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,670
the one eliminated is...

21
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,530
San Francisco Beauty Salon.

22
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,470
Cut!

23
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,200
Why? Let's pause the recording.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,970
Sorry, sis.

25
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,200
Xiaojie, I was on a roll.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,030
Why take a break? I need to pick up my kid.

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,970
It's okay, sis.

28
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,600
You're so capable. Why don't you record it yourself?

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,100
Sis, I can ask my assistant to pick up your kid.

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,900
Wait, let me tell you something.

31
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,300
I've called you here

32
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,830
because there are flaws in this competition.

33
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,670
The four of you

34
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,070
someone must know exactly what's going on.

35
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,300
A competition demands fairness and justice.

36
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,529
I don't know about other shows

37
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,630
if they have predetermined winners or bribes

38
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,800
or under-the-table dealings.

39
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,430
But the show I produce

40
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,030
absolutely does not allow any fraud.

41
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,330
We've already had internal discussions

42
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,530
and one of our judges, Waizui Ji,

43
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,200
will be leaving the show.

44
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,900
I'm giving you two options.

45
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,400
First,

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,230
since Shishi Zaizai got the lowest score this round,

47
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,900
they will be eliminated.

48
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,530
Second,

49
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,530
I can make public the fact that Shishi Zaizai bribed a judge,

50
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,790
exposing everything,

51
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,330
and you'll have to face the consequences yourselves.

52
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,370
I'll give you five minutes

53
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,900
to think it over and tell me.

54
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,030
Sister Junni.

55
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,230
What's going on now?

56
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,360
I don't know either.

57
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,370
I just got a call from my boss.

58
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,370
You're hurting me by doing this.

59
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,230
I didn't mean to.

60
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,830
But I was kept in the dark too.

61
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,530
I didn't know it would...

62
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,870
I only found out when I called my boss

63
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,630
this afternoon.

64
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,770
It's outrageous.

65
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,500
You're going to get me in trouble.

66
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,330
I'm sorry. I know.

67
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,570
But there's nothing I can do.

68
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,030
So what now?

69
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,330
What are we going to do?

70
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,170
I don't know. Wait a moment.

71
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,170
I'll call my boss.

72
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,030
Sorry.

73
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,030
Group 2 has been filming until now.

74
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,770
I said I'd treat you to dinner,

75
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,170
but ended up being very late.

76
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,470
I ordered a beer for you.

77
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,200
Thanks.

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,659
Is everything going well?

79
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,600
How could it not be?

80
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,270
We just need to find a replacement judge

81
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,670
to fill in for Wai Zui Ji.

82
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,570
I've used every connection I have.

83
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,430
What happened today

84
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,670
was entirely our production team's oversight.

85
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,470
Order whatever you want.

86
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,270
It's on me.

87
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,270
You said it.

88
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,170
Please, order freely.

89
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,070
I'm going to order a lot.

90
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,000
That's fine.

91
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,270
If you hadn't discovered it,

92
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,270
we'd still be in the dark today.

93
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,970
Speaking of that,

94
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,200
I really need to talk to you about something.

95
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,730
Do you know how many heartbeats I skipped because of you?

96
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,970
I messaged you before the competition

97
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,230
to check if someone was taking bribes,

98
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,300
but you didn't read or reply at all.

99
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,530
I've been so busy with this competition

100
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,970
that I haven't eaten anything yet.

101
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,370
How could I have time to check my phone?

102
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,570
Luckily I saw it at the last minute.

103
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,370
How did you know about

104
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,230
the situation between Shi Shi Zai Zai and Wai Zui Ji?

105
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,130
Fine. Since you've already paid,

106
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,730
I'll pretend I don't know anything.

107
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,570
But I'm begging you,

108
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,370
don't do this kind of thing again in the next round.

109
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,600
That's it for now. I need to go prepare.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,270
Jun Ni,

111
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,130
check your messages.

112
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,430
I need to tell you something.

113
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,430
I've looked into the crab incident.

114
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,830
It has nothing to do with Shi Shi Zai Zai.

115
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,800
I've also confirmed with Niu Yifei.

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,400
He did put the crab in the refrigerator.

117
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,130
I haven't finished yet.

118
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,830
I asked someone on site

119
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,930
to check the surveillance footage for me.

120
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,070
Before the competition,

121
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,530
the last person who opened the refrigerator

122
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,659
was that temporary female assistant.

123
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,070
But I find it strange.

124
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,200
You're in the same group as that temp.

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,330
It's not like we don't know each other.

126
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,460
She has no motive to sabotage you, right?

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,670
There's definitely no motive.

129
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,800
Maybe the crab crawled away by itself.

130
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,500
The crab crawled away?

131
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,030
Is that some kind of joke?

132
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,800
Let me ask you something.

133
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,830
Have you ever had that feeling

134
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
when you know a problem is definitely going to happen,

135
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,500
but you just don't want to deal with it,

136
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
to the point where you ignore its existence?

137
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,400
All the time.

138
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
Especially before we start recording a show.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,330
If I were to investigate everything,

140
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,130
we'd never get to film anything.

141
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,900
That's true.

142
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,600
If you're lucky, you dodge the bullet.

143
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,030
And if you're unlucky, you just face the failure.

144
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,970
Once you've imagined the worst, there's no such thing as the worst anymore.

145
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,200
That's right.

146
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,900
At least today's outcome was good,

147
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,770
right?

148
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,870
Niu Yifei.

149
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,370
Table three's egg pancake.

150
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,500
Table four's braised pork wrap.

151
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,630
Ask if they want drinks. No problem.

152
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,730
Okay.

153
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,870
Table three, your food is ready.

154
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,930
Thank you.

155
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,070
You wanted drinks, right?

156
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,830
Okay, no problem.

157
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,470
I'll get it for you in a moment.

158
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,000
Just wait a second.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,370
You can sit anywhere there's a seat.

160
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,730
Okay, here.

161
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,630
Alright, put it here.

162
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,300
It's all yours.

163
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,530
Okay, no problem. Thanks.

164
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,800
Niu Yifei, table one's braised pork wrap.

165
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Good, okay, no problem.

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,400
You can sit anywhere inside.

167
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,770
Table one, your food is ready.

168
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,800
Thank you.

169
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,870
Boss.

170
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,900
I want to try the award-winning pie you made in the competition.

171
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,870
So you watched the TV show?

172
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,770
Yes, I did.

173
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,100
Thank you.

174
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,400
Would you like to try

175
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,930
the blood cake egg pancake?

176
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,770
It's our signature dish.

177
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,500
Ma'am, please come in.

178
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,800
I look better on TV.

179
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,630
It's cooler inside.

180
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,700
Here's more. I'll put it here.

181
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,300
Okay.

182
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,970
Zhihao, table four ordered blood cake

183
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,930
and the dragon-phoenix special.

184
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,930
You can sit anywhere here.

185
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,500
Blood cake and dragon-phoenix, right?

186
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,000
Niu Yifei.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,430
Table one gets two complimentary drinks.

188
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,470
Two drinks for table one.

189
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,530
Ms. Chen, party of two.

191
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,300
Please come in.

192
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,370
Good, thank you.

193
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,500
Hello, may I have the last three digits of your phone number?

194
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,200
507.

195
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,930
507.

196
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,070
Mr. Wang, party of one.

197
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,630
Please come in.

198
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,830
Good, thank you.

199
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,170
Hello.

200
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,100
May I have the last three digits of your phone number?

201
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,200
Dad.

202
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,330
Dad.

203
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,970
Sit down.

204
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,370
It doesn't matter where.

205
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,670
Everyone is here.

206
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,730
Let's eat.

207
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,070
I heard from my assistant

208
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,000
that you took on some commercials.

209
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,470
The response after the show aired was quite good.

210
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,800
Some long-term clients reached out with offers I couldn't refuse.

211
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,730
It's good that you can manage both.

212
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,530
Actually, I should thank you, brother.

213
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,800
If he hadn't poached Jason away,

214
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,930
I wouldn't have had this opportunity.

215
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,030
Is it true?

216
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,230
But this isn't a bad thing.

217
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,530
If I can win the championship for Linlin,

218
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,570
the whole group's image

219
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,230
will keep getting better too.

220
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,500
You've really grown a lot.

221
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,400
Keep it up.

222
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Thanks, Dad.

223
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,200
Here.

224
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
This is your favorite.

225
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,270
Thank you.

226
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,170
World's first non-stick pan inventor.

227
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,600
French cookware brand.

228
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,500
Even heat distribution.

229
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,870
Lightweight and handy.

230
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,800
Making cooking full of endless possibilities.

231
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,130
French cookware brand.

232
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,230
Busy working?

233
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,970
Why are you working so hard?

234
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,200
Nobody cares anyway.

235
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,530
You're okay with him being so arrogant?

236
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,470
Just like you were before, isn't it?

237
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,770
When I was in that position,

238
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,770
you did everything to bring me down.

239
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,930
Now an outsider sits there,

240
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,130
and you feel nothing.

241
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,000
I do have feelings.

242
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,100
His financial reports

243
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,360
are much better than during your tenure.

244
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,000
If his arrogance

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,930
can make the company better,

246
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,800
then let him continue this way.

247
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,600
You may leave now.

248
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,970
A familiar gaze across the distance.

249
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,730
Separated by unfamiliar desolation.

250
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,470
Those unforgettable snowflakes.

251
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:36,630
Melt away at the slightest warmth.

252
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,000
The innocence of kindred spirits.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Carrying the lingering warmth of regret.

254
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,570
Trying to preserve all treasured memories.

255
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:58,330
Only to watch them sink away.

256
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:04,100
Who can restore those loves.

257
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,670
And heal the wounds of ignorance.

258
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:15,470
Even restless moments of peace are destroyed.

259
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,600
Only understood after tears have fallen.

260
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,300
Some twists of fate.

261
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,430
Shooting stars turned to dust.

262
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,870
By the once brilliant darkness.

263
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,670
Your drinks will be served shortly.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,500
Thank you.

265
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,970
Here's your food.

266
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,300
Thank you.

267
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,330
Excuse me, sir.

268
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,790
We can't share this table.

269
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,930
But everyone else is sharing tables.

270
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,530
Yes, but this is a VIP table.

271
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,400
It's reserved for important guests.

272
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
So...

273
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,730
Let me ask first. Alright, I'll get it to go then.

274
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,730
OK, you can wait outside. Thank you.

275
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm here.

276
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
I've arranged seats for you.

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,270
Great, thanks.

278
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,730
I want black tea. This lady here.

279
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,430
Can Miaomiao share the table?

280
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,330
Hello.

281
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,100
This isn't a VIP table.

282
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,300
Yes, she's a VIP.

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,630
I made a special new dish today.

284
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,370
Would you try it for me?

285
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,530
Really? Sure.

286
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,630
And Miaomiao gets the same. The same for Miaomiao.

287
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,270
Yes, the same.

288
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,370
That's her favorite. OK, what would you like to drink?

289
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,170
Lin Liying, where are you going?

290
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,430
Do you know what VIP means?

291
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,430
Lin Liying.

292
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,330
Um.

293
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,570
Miaomiao, here's your seat.

294
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,470
I'll go prepare your order now.

295
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,500
Get me a straw first.

296
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,670
Okay, a straw, right? Here you go.

297
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,270
Thank you.

298
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,400
Wait for me. Take your time, it's fine.

299
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,430
I've confirmed it for you.

300
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,900
Jiang Zhihao will attend your stand-up show.

301
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,270
Just focus on your class.

302
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,430
Don't worry about everything.

303
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,400
You've been preparing your confession for so long.

304
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,730
It would be a shame if he didn't go.

305
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,500
That's just a comedy bit.

306
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,300
I just added a little something.

307
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,460
Right, the confession.

308
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,770
You're too young to understand.

309
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,230
Jiang Zhihao, I'm available.

310
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,600
What do you mean you're available?

311
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,900
I'm the one who's available.

312
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,300
Stop trying to steal him.

313
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,770
Here we go.

314
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,200
Eat up. It's special, give it a try.

315
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,900
Let me know if it's good.

316
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,400
Alright. Here, Miaomiao, your smoked chicken.

317
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,330
Thank you. Here.

318
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,230
Enjoy your meal.

319
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,600
I need to get back to work. Okay.

320
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,370
Go ahead.

321
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,630
Eat up.

322
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,470
Niu Yifei.

323
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,500
Please give this to that gentleman.

324
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,870
Sure, no problem. Just a moment.

325
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll make it for you now. Wait a moment.

326
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,800
You look very handsome today, sir.

327
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,430
You just noticed?

328
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,500
Not bad, right?

329
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,800
This suit from my younger days.

330
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,270
Still fits me perfectly.

331
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,800
It's still so well-fitted.

332
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,530
Dad.

333
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,190
Why are you dressed like this?

334
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,430
My memory is really failing me.

335
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,670
I forgot to tell you.

336
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,069
We're having dinner with Weiyu's family tomorrow.

337
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,270
Don't forget.

338
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,770
You can go as our representative.

339
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,170
No way. I'm not going.

340
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,130
Let me tell you.

341
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,430
A dinner between these two families is a big deal.

342
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,430
Besides, our families are so connected.

343
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,530
Think about it.

344
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,170
You and Weiyu are good friends.

345
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,670
Now he's your sister's boyfriend.

346
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,570
And his father

347
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,700
used to be your boss.

348
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,570
He's now my chess buddy.

349
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,930
Chess buddy?

350
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,100
Yes, we just met recently.

351
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,630
What a coincidence, right?

352
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,200
So you must attend tomorrow.

353
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Don't forget.

354
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,300
Did Chairman Chen and Chairman Li visit your store?

355
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,600
Yes, they did.

356
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,300
Uncle, please stop asking them to come.

357
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,070
We have too much wine at the store already.

358
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,170
It's money that should be spent anyway.

359
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,000
Why wouldn't we let our own people profit?

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,730
Right.

361
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,500
I've prepared some wine today.

362
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,870
Let's have a drink.

363
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,170
Drinking?

364
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm very sorry about that.

365
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,830
Recently, I've been having

366
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,230
acid reflux.

367
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,800
I can't drink alcohol anymore.

368
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,630
Sorry.

369
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,630
There's a Chinese medicine clinic near Zhongshan Station.

370
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,700
They're very good.

371
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,400
I'll call them personally later.

372
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,600
Then I'll send you their information and address.

373
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,170
When you get there, just mention my name.

374
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,130
Really?

375
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,870
That's too kind of you.

376
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,970
I'm troubling you again.

377
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,000
Thank you.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
It's no trouble at all.

379
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,330
We're practically family now.

380
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,730
Just go easy on me when we play chess.

381
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,800
That's no problem.

382
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,130
Next time I'll give you a rook advantage.

383
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,770
Good, it's a deal.

384
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,830
Chairman.

385
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,600
I was your executive assistant.

386
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,670
I never knew you played chess.

387
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,270
Good thing my dad isn't a dragon or lion dancer.

388
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
Chess is good.

389
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,570
In chess, before we make each move,

390
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,570
we have to think about the next step.

391
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,900
Just like how we worry about our children's future.

392
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
We hope they have a good life.

393
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,230
Yet we fear they might take the wrong path.

394
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,430
But it's alright.

395
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,470
Helping our children find their way home

396
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,670
is what we parents should do.

397
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,700
Right, well said.

398
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,100
What's this about dragon and lion dancing?

399
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,270
What are you doing?

400
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,470
Chili pepper.

401
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,830
I bit into a chili.

402
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,630
Really now.

403
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,670
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,830
He's been like this since he was little.

405
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,330
Talking nonsense.

406
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,170
It's fine.

407
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,830
This son of yours

408
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,630
is so different from your personality.

409
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,600
Completely different.

410
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,370
Have you ever thought about

411
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,300
Jiang Zhihao's biological father

412
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,300
suddenly showing up?

413
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,130
Yes, I think about it every day.

414
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,530
I can't wait for him to appear

415
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,600
and take this rascal back.

416
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,800
He's been mischievous since he was little.

417
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,700
Still mischievous now.

418
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,800
I simply can't discipline him at all.

419
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,770
Dad.

420
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,370
Kick me out.

421
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,830
I'll tear down the door to get back to you.

422
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,530
And you, Jiang Zhilu.

423
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,730
Don't tell me if you need sales.

424
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,990
I can bring lots of friends to your place.

425
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,500
Your friends are here.

426
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,100
He's the only one who'll pay.

427
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,570
I have tons of friends.

428
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,730
Chairman Deng.

429
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,270
I'm working at 168 now.

430
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,830
So all these fancy meals in the future,

431
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,200
don't come looking for me anymore.

432
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,470
And those two getting married,

433
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,800
that's their family business.

434
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
We're two separate families.

435
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,370
Two families,

436
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,730
right, Dad?

437
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,800
What are you talking about?

438
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,170
Sit down.

439
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,430
I'm full.

440
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,000
Jiang Zhihao, what are you doing?

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,870
Pack this up for me. It's fine.

442
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,870
Let him go. Uncle, I'm sorry.

443
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,600
It's okay.

444
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
As long as you're happy. My brother.

445
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,100
Sister Peng has prepared a wonderful meal.

446
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,560
Let's all dig in, shall we?

447
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,670
Jiang Zhihao.

448
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,630
Don't you have anything to say to me?

449
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,200
You want to hear me say sorry?

450
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,970
Yes.

451
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,200
Deng Yongkuan is my father.

452
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,570
You think I was just pretending to be a hotel receptionist?

453
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,830
I had my suspicions.

454
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,230
So has he talked to you privately?

455
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,490
He wants you to return to the Deng family.

456
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm so outstanding.

457
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,830
Everyone wants to claim me as their son.

458
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,770
That's funny.

459
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,030
Jiang Zhihao.

460
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,530
If you don't see me as your sister,

461
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,130
you can get out right now.

462
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,060
What are you talking about?

463
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,400
Otherwise, why is it that for everything,

464
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,900
Dad and I are always the last to know?

465
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,670
You always do this.

466
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,230
You don't talk about your problems,

467
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,560
or when you're unhappy.

468
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,430
This is just my background.

469
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,030
Everything is the same as before.

470
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,000
It won't affect you and Deng Weiyu.

471
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
It's like this.

472
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,830
The same goes for your fight with Deng Weiyu.

473
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,270
If you're going to act, do it better.

474
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,030
Don't let me find out.

475
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,300
Otherwise,

476
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,770
every time I know you're not okay

477
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,170
or in trouble,

478
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,970
but I can't help at all,

479
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,700
it feels really awful.

480
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,730
From beginning to end,

481
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,430
have you ever considered me family?

482
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,470
Isn't family supposed to be

483
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,500
able to talk about everything?

484
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,630
What?

485
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,770
Jiang Zhilu.

486
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,470
Is your heart strong enough?

487
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,700
Want to hear a soap opera story?

488
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,330
Okay.

489
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,230
It didn't happen that long ago.

490
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,030
Anyway, when I was sorting through Mom's belongings,

491
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,430
I found a notebook.

492
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,670
And inside it said

493
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,330
Deng Yongkuan is my father.

494
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,500
Then,

495
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,130
about his relationship with my birth mother,

496
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,060
they separated because of some misunderstandings.

497
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,200
After the last round of team competition,

498
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,300
we eliminated two contestants,

499
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,600
leaving six competitors.

500
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,970
To discover what makes the perfect breakfast,

501
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,930
we've made an important decision,

502
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,600
which is

503
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,970
to pause filming

504
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,800
and let everyone rest.

505
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,900
But during these next three days,

506
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,570
I'd like you all to find the perfect bread,

507
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,770
using what you consider the finest bread

508
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,500
to create an unforgettable breakfast.

509
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,230
This is your next challenge.

510
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,200
Good. Cut!

511
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,130
That was good.

512
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,270
Thanks. This segment works well.

513
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,300
We still have interviews to record later.

514
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,200
Everyone please don't rush off.

515
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,800
What about me?

516
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,730
Should I leave, sis?

517
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,530
You look beautiful in that outfit.

518
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,370
I almost lost the last competition,

519
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,970
but I won't slip up this time.

520
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,770
How to win this competition?

521
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,900
I think I just need to make sure my ingredients don't disappear.

522
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,730
I'll guard my bread carefully.

523
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,630
That's good. Thank you.

524
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,570
Meizi, you're next.

525
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,470
I thought

526
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,130
we could fight side by side like before.

527
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,930
But if you want to play dirty,

528
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,400
fine.

529
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,070
From now on,

530
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,730
I'll defeat you as a competitor.

531
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,830
Just wait.

532
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,070
Cut.

533
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,270
Next person, please.

534
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,630
That's good. It works.

535
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,300
Okay.

536
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,500
Do you have any competitors you're afraid of?

537
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,330
I'm not afraid of anyone.

538
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,630
Yes.

539
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,800
Your sales this month are not acceptable.

540
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,200
So I need to talk to you.

541
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,100
Just a moment.

542
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,930
What is it?

543
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,930
The store manager meetings have been changed to

544
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,730
3 p.m. every Thursday.

545
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,300
I know.

546
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,560
Your handover was very clear. Thank you.

547
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,300
Yes, I'm quite busy since I just got back.

548
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,530
Your things...

549
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,700
So I'll schedule you for 3 p.m. tomorrow, okay?

550
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,070
Shanru,

551
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,870
I've already completed the handover.

552
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,830
Good.

553
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,730
Do you have anything to say?

554
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,230
I want to tell you that

555
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,470
these past few months have been challenging,

556
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,330
but also incredibly exciting.

557
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,660
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

558
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,230
Good work. You may leave now.

559
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,570
Shanru,

560
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,500
please let me stay.

561
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,300
I want to continue working here.

562
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,270
Please hear me out.

563
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,970
Even though I don't have formal education in this field,

564
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,000
and I stumbled into this job by accident,

565
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,930
I may not be as good as you think,

566
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,170
but when I see my proposals

567
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,900
being implemented,

568
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,530
I'm truly happy.

569
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,700
Really happy.

570
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,200
I never knew what I could do before,

571
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,300
but now I have a goal.

572
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,530
My life,

573
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,870
just like Noto Toast,

574
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,200
once hit rock bottom,

575
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,300
but now is climbing up step by step.

576
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,100
Noto Toast hasn't even reached its peak yet.

577
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,570
I can't leave.

578
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,100
Please let me stay.

579
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,560
I beg you, don't reject me.

580
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,700
Shanru, I'm here.

581
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,390
I've interviewed her for you.

582
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,000
She'll join the planning department tomorrow.

583
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,130
Take her with you.

584
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,030
Good. Thank you.

585
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,870
Why did you bring me here?

586
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,400
It's lonely watching this alone,

587
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,260
and I already bought the tickets.

588
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,800
Before I Confess.

589
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,970
You also invited Jiang Zhihao?

590
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,500
How could I possibly invite him?

591
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,800
Why are you here?

592
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,970
Junni has a performance today.

593
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,170
What are you two doing?

594
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,300
Dating?

595
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,730
I'll go get more drinks.

596
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,330
Dating my ass.

597
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,500
You're the one dating.

598
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
What did you say?

599
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,530
What are you drinking?

600
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,630
Coke.

601
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,400
For my next bit,

602
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,300
I want to talk with everyone about

603
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,200
whether there can be

604
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,470
pure friendship between men and women.

605
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,630
Impossible.

606
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,400
No way.

607
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,830
Let me speak first.

608
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,600
I believe there is.

609
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,000
Don't you think

610
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,330
when paired with the word 'pure',

611
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,400
everything becomes very clean

612
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,530
and sacred?

613
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,270
What? Why are you laughing so loud?

614
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,130
Don't believe me?

615
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,100
Let me give you some examples.

616
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,230
My former supervisor

617
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,600
looked like Captain America.

618
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,100
His body was like

619
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,670
his clothes were about to burst open.

620
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,100
He had a perky butt

621
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,030
and his

622
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,900
you know

623
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,330
was impressive.

624
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,800
One day he told me,

625
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,900
'Feel free to come to my place.

626
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,170
We'll really just be

627
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,200
purely watching streaming platforms.'

628
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,230
Come on!

629
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,970
At that time we were

630
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,900
young and full of energy.

631
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,330
I planned to watch for just 10 minutes.

632
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,500
But we ended up watching the entire Harry Potter series.

633
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,630
That's so lame.

634
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,330
Eight hours,

635
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,130
folks, eight hours!

636
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Next, I went on a dating site

637
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,970
swiping on my phone

638
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,930
and saw someone's profile that said

639
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,900
'purely cuddling to sleep'

640
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,400
so I immediately arranged to meet.

641
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,570
Please, just purely cuddling to sleep.

642
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,930
We're best at purely cuddling to sleep,

643
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,770
thank you.

644
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,430
Next is about my husband

645
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,200
who one day told me,

646
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,400
'You have to believe me.

647
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,230
That place

648
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,430
is really just for

649
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,970
pure massage.'

650
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,630
I believed him.

651
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,100
And now we're divorced.

652
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,270
If anyone dares to talk to me about pure friendship again,

653
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll twist their head off.

654
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,470
Okay, let's change the mood.

655
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,800
Actually,

656
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,100
there are many people

657
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,830
who love someone in their hearts

658
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,430
but don't dare to say it.

659
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,430
Alright, I'm one of them.

660
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,330
Who?

661
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,070
Wait, okay.

662
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,070
Huang Xiaohu has a song

663
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,030
'Oh My Love.'

664
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,500
That's a bad joke.

665
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,570
Sorry, let me try again.

666
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,500
Huang Xiaohu has a song

667
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,070
called 'More Than Friends'

668
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,670
'You never knew I wanted to be more than friends.'

669
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,230
I think this line isn't quite precise enough.

670
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,130
How do you think it should be changed?

671
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,130
'More than friends with benefits.'

672
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,530
That's vulgar!

673
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,130
Someone drag him out of here!

674
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,930
You know, many people know

675
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,670
I'm a show producer

676
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,830
and they always tell me,

677
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,200
'Your shows are all scripted

678
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,270
and planned in advance.'

679
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,800
Let me tell you,

680
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,100
he's my joke writer.

681
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,070
Shut up. No more.

682
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,330
You took the money, now do your job properly.

683
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,530
Don't just stand there.

684
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,930
Right. I was just...

685
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,400
Nothing.

686
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,030
Okay, it's fine.

687
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,400
Um.

688
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,400
I'm so nervous.

689
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,430
Actually, I'm performing today because

690
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,070
I want to confess to someone.

691
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,470
Who is it?

692
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,400
And that person is in the audience.

693
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,970
Who?

694
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,830
Tell me who.

695
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,830
Who is it?

696
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,730
Jiang Zhihao.

697
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,030
Can we stop being just friends?

698
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,900
Which one? That...

699
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,830
You?

700
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,300
Did you hear that?

701
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Get together!

702
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,070
We

703
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,929
are really just friends.

704
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,870
No chance.

705
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,199
See?

706
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,730
No script for this.

707
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,370
So awkward.

708
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,969
God, I'm so miserable.

709
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:53,070
Is anyone here stuck in the friend zone?

710
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,800
Raise your hand.

711
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,770
Make me feel better.

712
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,070
Put that down. I...

713
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,830
You can get lost.

714
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,970
Anyone else in the friend zone?

715
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,330
Can you raise your hand so I can see?

716
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,200
Miss, you...

717
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,900
Wait.

718
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,000
You seem to be sitting between

719
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,530
two people I hate.

720
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,270
Was this planned?

721
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,500
All set up.

722
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,530
Just kidding.

723
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,700
Which one is your 'just friend'?

724
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,870
Left or right?

725
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,000
We also 'just' watch streaming platforms together.

726
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,370
Just cuddle and sleep?

727
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,200
And just massages?

728
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,100
Lin Liying, what are you doing?

729
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,830
You already confessed to me

730
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,700
and then pretended it never happened.

731
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,630
If that's not being a jerk, what is?

732
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,830
You kissed her.

733
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,470
You kissed her

734
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,230
and then refused to be with her.

735
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,670
What's that about?

736
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,200
That was for the pork belly.

737
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,700
Pork belly?

738
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,800
You'd kiss her for a piece of pork belly?

739
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,070
No, it happened so suddenly.

740
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,500
What could I do?

741
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,230
That's hilarious.

742
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,130
How sudden was it?

743
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,370
Like this?

744
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,870
What are you doing?

745
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,600
I'm thirsty.

746
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,770
Your parents' bed?

747
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,900
Why did you ask me to come?

748
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,500
This is by appointment only.

749
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,070
Miss it and it's gone.

750
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,070
Here?

751
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,100
What are you doing?

752
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,330
What are you doing?

753
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,700
Checking the price.

754
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,500
Price?

755
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:47,530
Happy birthday to you.

756
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,500
That sounds nice.

757
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,230
Make a wish.

758
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,300
I wish I could win the lottery.

759
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Remember to share.

760
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,200
Okay.

761
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,430
My second wish

762
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,070
is that someone will give me a massage later.

763
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,770
I bought this.

764
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,100
Don't you like it?

765
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,930
I want to make my third wish now.

766
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,130
What are you doing?

767
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,300
Mosquitoes.

768
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,330
Mosquitoes.

769
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,530
There are mosquitoes on both sides.

770
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,470
So many of them.

771
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,570
Yeah.

772
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,230
You didn't think I was going to kiss you, did you?

773
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,800
Of course not.

774
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,870
I was just thinking,

775
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,600
who gets this many mosquitoes on their birthday?

776
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,770
Has anyone ever asked you this question?

777
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,030
What question?

778
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,130
Why aren't we together?

779
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,970
Dating?

780
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,270
If you're not curious about the other person at all,

781
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,330
wouldn't that be too boring?

782
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,570
Like I know you so well.

783
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,900
You sneeze when the seasons change.

784
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,030
And when watching movies,

785
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,900
you always want half salty, half sweet popcorn.

786
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,370
Also,

787
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,470
your birthday cake must be mango flavored.

788
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,100
There's no excitement left, right?

789
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,670
We know each other too well.

790
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,530
Even if there is love,

791
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,000
it's probably just habit.

792
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,700
Pure Friendship.

793
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,570
Thank you everyone. No script.

794
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,770
I'm Wang Junni.

795
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,070
Table for one. Do you have any seats?

796
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,100
We're fully booked at the moment.

797
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,800
The wait time might be about an hour.

798
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,900
One hour?

799
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,000
What a coincidence.

800
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,270
Do you two know each other?

801
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,800
If you do,

802
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,030
would you mind sharing a table?

803
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,170
Thank you. All dishes are served. Enjoy your meal.

804
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Is this your first time performing?

805
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,200
I think you were the funniest one just now.

806
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,800
And don't you think that line we added at the end

807
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,700
worked pretty well?

808
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,070
Thank you.

809
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,030
You had so many opportunities before

810
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,230
to cut in,

811
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,830
but you just had to interrupt

812
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,370
when I was confessing my feelings.

813
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,200
You've ruined my love life too.

814
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,270
So I guess that makes us even now?

815
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,030
I can't believe this.

816
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,700
If you hadn't confessed to him just now,

817
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,500
would they have had this chance?

818
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,570
Let me tell you something.

819
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,670
Many things are all about timing.

820
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,270
Have you ever wondered

821
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,900
why they've known each other for so long

822
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,830
but never got together?

823
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,170
Because they were waiting for

824
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,970
someone to make the first move.

825
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,930
And who just created the perfect moment

826
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,200
for them?

827
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,170
It was you, wasn't it?

828
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,100
You're really clueless.

829
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,370
How did you know

830
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,400
that's my name?

831
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,000
Excuse me for interrupting.

832
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,170
We have a promotion where you get pork belly

833
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,330
if you kiss. Are you interested?

834
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,430
- Sure.
- No.

835
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,870
Come on, it's just pork belly.

836
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,830
Call the police for me, thanks.

837
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,130
The bus won't be here for another 15 minutes.

838
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,600
So what should we do now?

839
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,400
Well,

840
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,970
we can only wait.

841
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,130
Wait.

842
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,200
We still have to wait like this?

843
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,000
You just kissed me.

844
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You...

845
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,170
Jiang Zhihao, you're such a jerk.

846
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,000
I was talking about the bus.

847
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,070
Or maybe we shouldn't wait anymore.

848
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,830
So are we taking a taxi?

849
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,630
What I mean is,

850
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,030
should we give us a try?

851
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,530
Lin Liying.

852
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,630
I thought I knew you well,

853
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,630
but you still surprise me.

854
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,270
Do you think I'm beautiful?

855
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,200
For example,

856
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,130
your lips are drier than I imagined.

857
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,130
Do you know lip balm exists in this world?

858
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,300
Lin Liying.

859
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,370
Will you be with me?

860
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,430
Just try making me wait again.

861
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,530
I don't want to stand in the way of your love anymore.

862
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,430
If my son can be happier than I was,

863
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,570
then I'll be happy.

864
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,800
You look a bit

865
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,530
chubby.

866
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:18,170
You're the one who's fat.

867
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:18,900
You've been fat for years,

868
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,630
and I've never complained about it.

869
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,800
We're breaking up.

870
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,270
The day your mother died,

871
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:23,300
I was there.

872
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,600
Don't touch me.

873
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,500
Mom already knew

874
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,900
you were Deng Yongkuan's son.

875
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,330
Deng Weiyu's mother was afraid you'd recognize each other,

876
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,270
so she watched Mom die without doing anything.

877
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,000
Is it that anyone

878
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,030
who gets involved with us

879
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,430
will come to a bad end?

880
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,700
I'm begging you to stay away from my life.

881
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,170
Just live miserably,

882
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,200
the more miserable the better.
