1
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,330
Jiang Zhihao

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,470
Go to Japan.

3
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,070
How's the progress

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,700
on that 30th anniversary toy?

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,430
We've signed the contract with the manufacturer.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,830
Once we confirm the samples are good,

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,600
we can start mass production.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,600
If I remember correctly,

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,400
isn't the factory owner

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,260
an acquaintance of Jiang Zhihao?

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,470
But

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,800
Guangsheng Toys won the bid fair and square.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
They passed all qualification checks.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
Then let's make sure they have problems.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,570
Don't forget

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,770
what you promised me.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,230
Brother Kang said

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,900
as long as you handle this well,

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,770
you'll get what you deserve.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,400
The toy factory employees said

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,100
their boss often cuts corners.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,600
We're just punishing him early.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,170
You're overthinking things.

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,700
Let's change the subject.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,400
I have a gift for you.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,470
Look.

27
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,370
Didn't you want to study in Japan?

28
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,430
I've arranged everything - school and accommodation.

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,870
You go first.

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,030
Once my temporary assignment comes through,

31
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,500
I'll come find you.

32
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,730
So after we're in Japan,

33
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,400
we won't have to meet

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
in secret anymore?

35
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,270
You need to understand

36
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,130
everything you're doing now

37
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,300
will make our future better.

38
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,600
You want my dreams to come true too,

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,630
don't you?

40
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,930
Hello everyone.

41
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,700
I'm Deng Yongkuan.

42
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,370
First, I'd like to thank

43
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,970
Chairman Jin

44
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,700
of Meiman TV Station.

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,170
It's an honor to meet everyone here today.

46
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,870
Linlin Breakfast

47
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,200
has been in the food industry for decades.

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I believe it has already become

49
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,570
a part of everyone's daily life.

50
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,230
Today's achievements

51
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,529
are thanks to our Vice President,

52
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,670
Deng Weikang,

53
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,830
and all the staff at Linlin

54
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,800
for their persistence and hard work.

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,070
I'm truly happy.

56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,270
Thank you all.

57
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,370
Our golden couple in the middle.

58
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,770
Next,

59
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,770
our two companies will have many collaborations.

60
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,400
If reporters have any questions,

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,300
we'll answer them one by one.

62
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,570
Hello?

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,370
Where is she?

64
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,870
She's already checked out.

65
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,530
Excuse me, when did she leave?

66
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,930
Around 7 or 8 in the morning.

67
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,600
Okay, thank you.

68
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,870
No way.

69
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,330
She checked out early. What do we do?

70
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,800
Checked out.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,630
We'll have to take a chance.

72
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,730
What do you mean?

73
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,030
Go find her.

74
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,670
Is it this way?

75
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,400
Peizhen.

76
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,470
You guys.

77
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,970
Long time no see.

78
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,370
Can we go in?

79
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,670
You must be Peizhen's good colleagues.

80
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,030
Right?

81
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,070
You knew she was on vacation

82
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,970
and came specially to see her.

83
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,100
Come, take a rest.

84
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,000
Have some grapes. You brought them.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,070
Okay.

86
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,630
Your colleague is really nice.

87
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,500
Look, she brought fruit when she stopped by.

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,300
And helped us make dumplings.

89
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,230
Ma'am.

90
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,170
I'll charge you just 5 yuan per grape.

91
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,530
Make it 10 for you.

92
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,470
You know quality.

93
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,370
Look.

94
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,970
I made all of these.

95
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,870
They look great.

96
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,070
They really are well-made.

97
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,700
But look at yours.

98
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,730
You've gotten worse.

99
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,170
After you went to Japan,

100
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,600
we rarely made dumplings anymore.

101
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,930
That's not true.

102
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,030
Yes, it is.

103
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,470
Let me think.

104
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,030
How many years have you been in Japan now?

105
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,170
After she went to Japan,

106
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,200
I kept saying I would visit her there,

107
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,370
but in the blink of an eye, years have passed,

108
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,770
and I haven't gone even once.

109
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,570
Sometimes I wonder

110
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,500
if you're really

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,570
working in Japan for your company.

112
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,100
Maybe I should visit you in Japan next month.

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,460
Auntie, that's not possible.

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Why not?

115
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,130
Business is really good in Japan right now,

116
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,900
and she's extremely busy with work.

117
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
Last time we went to see her,

118
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,330
she didn't even have time for us.

119
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,600
That's right.

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,330
That busy, huh?

121
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,730
Don't you know your daughter by now?

122
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,200
She only shares the good news, never the bad.

123
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,730
Don't be fooled by her constant smile.

124
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,100
She takes everything upon herself.

125
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
No matter how bad she feels,

126
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,170
she'll always say 'I'm fine, I'm good.'

127
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,230
So she's really struggling in Japan.

128
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,470
But she's such a good daughter.

129
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,929
She sends money back to me every month.

130
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,070
Mom knows how hard you all are working.

131
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,830
The soup seems ready.

132
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,330
Take a break and have some fruit.

133
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,800
We'll eat dinner soon.

134
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,900
Wait a moment.

135
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,470
Thank you.

136
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,370
Deng Weiyu

137
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,800
About what I promised you,

138
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,270
I'm really sorry.

139
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,230
I have too many concerns to consider.

140
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,430
Alright, I really need to go now.

141
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,230
Hello.

142
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,800
You told me

143
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,300
not to be shocked by the news,

144
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,800
that it's all fake.

145
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,370
I explained to you before the press conference.

146
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,900
Linlin needs to change her image now,

147
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,570
and Xie Jinghan's mother can help with this.

148
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,770
The marriage is just for show.

149
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,770
We won't actually get married.

150
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,500
When we got together,

151
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,930
you knew I couldn't go public.

152
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,830
You must feel hurt and sad.

153
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,470
I blame myself too.

154
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,300
Sometimes I think

155
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,770
we should break up,

156
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,730
but I just can't do it.

157
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,030
I need you.

158
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't lose you.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,500
I'll come see you

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,700
next month.

161
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,030
Next week.

162
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,100
I think I have three days off next week.

163
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,700
It depends on your schedule.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,830
Wishes fulfilled.

165
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,470
Safe travels.

166
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,130
Health and peace.

167
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,200
Here, have some.

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
But what you need

169
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
most right now is this one.

170
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,900
Keep this good match charm for yourself.

171
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,370
This is for you.

172
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,900
Why drag me into this?

173
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,800
How old am I now?

174
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
What do I need love for?

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,570
Keep it for yourself.

176
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,530
This one.

177
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,030
Good. Wishes fulfilled.

178
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,030
When are you going back to Japan?

179
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,000
Maybe I won't go back.

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,300
I'll stay with you, okay?

181
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,130
Then you won't

182
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,870
have to worry about me anymore.

183
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,800
Of course it would be nice if you stayed with me.

184
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,000
But no matter how old you are,

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
wherever you go,

186
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,630
whatever decisions you make,

187
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,870
Mom will still worry about you.

188
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,200
Mom actually worries too.

189
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,730
You're not happy at all.

190
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,730
You just don't let me know.

191
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,270
Mom.

192
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,000
So.

193
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,670
Since Mom is destined to worry about you for life,

194
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,830
you must be happy.

195
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,600
Don't make any decisions that make you feel wronged.

196
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,430
Mom will always be here,

197
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,070
you know?

198
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,200
My darling, prepare some snacks for me.

199
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,270
Mom will make you a cup of tea.

200
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,400
Here.

201
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,970
Don't be like that.

202
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,970
Congratulations.

203
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,130
Here, have something sweet.

204
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,600
Pink bubbles. Pop!

205
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Thank you all for your blessings.

206
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,830
We've received them all.

207
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,570
Yes.

208
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,770
Here, let's share.

209
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,370
Come on, together.

210
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,930
Thank you. Congratulations.

211
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,330
Come.

212
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,470
Weiyu, come here.

213
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,970
Have something sweet.

214
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,930
Is it sugar-free?

215
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,600
Full sugar. Today we only have full sugar.

216
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,370
Here, there's more. Come, have a drink.

217
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,570
Drinks, yes.

218
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,800
Everyone come and get some.

219
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,130
We only have full sugar today. Don't be shy.

220
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,900
Thank you.

221
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,930
Come on, help yourself.

222
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,530
Take one.

223
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,070
Let me tell you.

224
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,730
I've looked at many honeymoon destinations.

225
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,170
Let me show you.

226
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,970
Just a moment.

227
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,500
The Maldives?

228
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,570
How about we go here?

229
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,770
Too cold. Not suitable for a honeymoon.

230
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,400
Deng Weikang.

231
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,770
Long time no see.

232
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,900
And you are?

233
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,030
No, she's... she's here to congratulate you both.

234
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,300
She's a former colleague.

235
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,530
You first...

236
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,730
What are you doing?

237
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm his girlfriend.

238
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,100
We've been dating for many years.

239
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,070
Who is she?

240
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:54,700
No, let me explain.

241
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,830
She's a former colleague.

242
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,570
What do you mean 'former'? Weren't you in Japan?

243
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,270
Why did you come back?

244
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,370
Weren't you the one who told me to go to Japan?

245
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,400
Yes, but...

246
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,430
Didn't we already agree?

247
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,800
That you would just stay in Japan?

248
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,000
What agreement? What's the meaning of showing up suddenly?

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,300
What did you agree with me?

250
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,030
Well...

251
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,300
You better explain yourself right now.

252
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,900
No... who is she?

253
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,530
There was a temporary case before, so I...

254
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,100
I have our chat history.

255
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,730
Look.

256
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,230
Give it to me.

257
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,500
Don't look! Let go!

258
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,200
Wait, give it to me!

259
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,600
What's this?

260
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,930
No, she used to be my secretary.

261
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,700
So...

262
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,770
Just conversations, nothing more.

263
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,370
He called me just last night.

264
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,330
Said he was engaged to you.

265
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,800
It's just a fake engagement. Please calm down.

266
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,130
You calm down.

267
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,600
Don't touch me! Deng Weikang!

268
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,970
What's going on?

269
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,500
We're already engaged!

270
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,330
Are you lying to me?

271
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,970
Everyone knows we're engaged.

272
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,700
And now you pull this?

273
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,800
So what is she to you?

274
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,000
Your... your girlfriend?

275
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,470
She was...

276
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,200
She was my secretary.

277
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,730
So we... better clear things up now.

278
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,130
No, secretaries naturally have conversations.

279
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,100
This is Deng Weikang.

280
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,730
Proof that he took kickbacks from the chicken processing plant.

281
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,130
That's all I know.

282
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,730
You didn't take this to the media or lawyers.

283
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,770
Instead, you came directly to me.

284
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,630
What do you want?

285
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,930
I just want closure for my feelings.

286
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,830
An explanation.

287
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,200
I know.

288
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,900
The only one who can make Deng Weikang pay

289
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,530
is you.

290
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,300
Can you be more serious?

291
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,830
Sweep it cleaner.

292
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,470
Enough, stop watching.

293
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,130
You've seen it too many times.

294
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,300
I finally understand why

295
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,400
Grandma Hongzhu loves watching prime-time dramas so much.

296
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,170
Do you think my brother will be punished this time?

297
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,770
My father has always

298
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,500
turned a blind eye

299
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,000
to his mistakes.

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,860
He'll probably let him off the hook again this time.

301
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,230
Don't worry.

302
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,130
As long as we can plant

303
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,970
seeds of discontent about Deng Weikang in your father's mind,

304
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,870
we'll succeed.

305
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,830
And let me tell you,

306
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,300
from now on,

307
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,570
your father's tolerance for your brother

308
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,770
will only get lower and lower.

309
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,470
When he crosses your father's bottom line,

310
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,530
he'll explode

311
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,830
and be finished.

312
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,430
Okay, calm down first.

313
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,000
Wait until I get there.

314
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,030
Wait.

315
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,700
Deng Weiyu, are you there?

316
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,829
Did you drive?

317
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,670
Yes, why?

318
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,770
Hey,

319
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,700
Jiang Zhilu, where are you going?

320
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,530
Scan it yourself. I...

321
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,569
Come help me.

322
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,670
Jiang Zhilu,

323
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,800
where are you going? Where's your car?

324
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
The navigation is set up front.

325
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,170
Here.

326
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,370
You two!

327
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,830
What are you doing?

328
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,760
What's going on?

329
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,970
Wait... Zhilu!

330
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,630
Let her go!

331
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,800
Who? Who are you?

332
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,530
What are you doing?

333
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,230
Niu Yifei, what are you doing here?

334
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,930
Do you need something?

335
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,730
Mom!

336
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,030
Mom, are you okay?

337
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,430
This is ridiculous.

338
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,630
Are you crazy?

339
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,830
Mom.

340
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,500
From my perspective,

341
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
it looked like Deng Weiyu was pushing you onto the bed.

342
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,100
Who knew he was so weak

343
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,500
that he couldn't even help a drunk woman up.

344
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,070
Niu Yifei, can I ask you

345
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,330
to use your brain

346
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,400
before doing anything next time?

347
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Even if Deng Weiyu and I were really up to something,

348
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
do you think I'd leave the door open for you to see?

349
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,300
I just saw a couple outside

350
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,570
kissing like this.

351
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100
Alright, I'm sorry.

352
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,530
I was a bit impulsive.

353
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,630
You can punch me back if you want.

354
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,230
No need.

355
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,830
How's your mom doing?

356
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,170
She's fine, sleeping.

357
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,500
Her family will come to stay with her soon.

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Today was supposed to be the third anniversary

359
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,070
of my mom and her boyfriend... ex-boyfriend.

360
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,070
Mom even asked the motel

361
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,530
to decorate it beautifully.

362
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,730
But who knew that jerk

363
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,390
registered to marry someone else this morning.

364
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,830
That's so dramatic.

365
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,300
Anyway, thank you for accompanying me

366
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,630
and helping me take my mom home.

367
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,670
No problem.

368
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,830
Actually, you can call me for things like this in the future.

369
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,830
What did you say?

370
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,570
Nothing.

371
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
Coffee.

372
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,930
I'll go buy something to drink.

373
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,570
This coffee...

374
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,500
Yeah,

375
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,130
it's from the place you showed me last time.

376
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,170
I'm good at picking drinks,

377
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:56,770
isn't it good?

378
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,900
I like it,

379
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,200
I love it.

380
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,970
By the way,

381
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,500
did you receive the money?

382
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,700
My brother told me later

383
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,200
that Deng Weiyu saw it,

384
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,070
so he asked you to help.

385
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,170
Thanks.

386
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,770
Zhilu.

387
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Come here.

388
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,130
There are many flavors.

389
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,970
Let me see.

390
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Would you like some tea?

391
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,930
Or... anything is fine.

392
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,230
Anything is fine?

393
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,470
How about

394
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,630
sports drinks?

395
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,330
Wouldn't that be too sweet?

396
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,100
No, that one isn't very sweet.

397
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,370
You mean this one?

398
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,830
This dolphin-shaped one.

399
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,270
Do we have the materials for the meeting with Mr. Chen?

400
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,300
Are they ready?

401
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,170
Everything's prepared.

402
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,870
Did you bring everything?

403
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,830
Make sure. Yes, I've got everything.

404
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,900
Good.

405
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,670
Go get the car first.

406
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,800
We've made an appointment.

407
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Okay.

408
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,570
See you on the first floor.

409
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,170
Hello, Mr. Chen.

410
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,030
Yes.

411
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,730
Alright, we'll be there soon.

412
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,470
Good.

413
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,330
Jinghan.

414
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,470
I need to talk to you.

415
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,000
Please let me explain.

416
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,070
I was wrong about Li Peizhen.

417
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,800
I've made up my mind.

418
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,270
Let's get married.

419
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,000
I want to spend my life with you.

420
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't you like Bali?

421
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,430
We can honeymoon there.

422
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,530
What do you say?

423
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,460
We'll have a grand wedding in Bali.

424
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,030
You'll look beautiful in a wedding dress.

425
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,170
Will you marry me?

426
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,530
You said before you didn't want to make our relationship public.

427
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,460
You said it would be inconvenient for Weijie to know.

428
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,870
I believed you.

429
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,270
I thought you just weren't ready yet.

430
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,000
That you weren't sure about your feelings for me.

431
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,870
You're two-timing now!

432
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,630
Have you ever considered my feelings?

433
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,830
I was wrong about this.

434
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,730
I'll apologize any way you want

435
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,800
but I can't lose you.

436
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,300
Is it me you can't lose, or my background?

437
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,230
Mom.

438
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,830
Aren't you having breakfast?

439
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,290
You go ahead and eat. I'm going to the market.

440
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,430
Leaving so early?

441
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,500
Yes.

442
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,270
Liying.

443
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,270
Don't you think your mom's been acting strange lately?

444
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,070
She was just singing.

445
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,430
It's not just that.

446
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,770
Yesterday at dinner,

447
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,000
I complained her stir-fried cabbage was too salty,

448
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,170
and not only did she not argue,

449
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,300
she even poured me a glass of water.

450
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,730
And also,

451
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,700
this morning,

452
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,370
I sent a good morning picture to my friend,

453
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,600
but accidentally sent it to her instead,

454
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,730
and guess what,

455
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,930
she replied with a heart emoji.

456
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,570
See?

457
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,070
It's so scary.

458
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,870
Don't you think you should check on your mom?

459
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,230
Hello, Mr. Huang.

460
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,430
Long time no see.

461
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,370
It's been a while.

462
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,730
Chucky,

463
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,770
do you remember me?

464
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,470
Come,

465
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,270
do you recognize me?

466
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,630
I brought you some delicious snacks today.

467
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,200
Got treats for you.

468
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,070
Look. Come here.

469
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,700
Tasty treats.

470
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,770
What are you doing?

471
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,430
What's going on?

472
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,130
Here,

473
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,070
is it good?

474
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,770
Stand up.

475
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,400
Great!

476
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,770
So well-behaved.

477
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,170
So greedy.

478
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,430
Who's that guy?

479
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,530
So cute.

480
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,470
I don't know. How about another one?

481
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,570
I want more.

482
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,900
Stand up.

483
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,730
That's good.

484
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,730
Let it move around a bit.

485
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,100
It won't get depressed. Right.

486
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,230
Just like people.

487
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,470
Hello.

488
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,230
How may I help you?

489
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,460
Please have a seat.

490
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,900
Do you need any legal assistance?

491
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,900
I was wondering...

492
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,370
I'd like to ask,

493
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,170
if I want to...

494
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,400
file for divorce.

495
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,630
Divorce?

496
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,370
Are you currently living with your husband?

497
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,730
Are you still together?

498
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,000
Mom.

499
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,530
I never thought you were this kind of woman.

500
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,300
I didn't have an affair.

501
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,770
Much less destroy someone else's family.

502
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,530
Mr. Huang's wife passed away a long time ago.

503
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,500
His wife died, but your husband is still alive!

504
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,200
Who knows where Guangsheng is suffering right now.

505
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,530
How could you want to divorce him

506
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,000
for another man?

507
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,370
How can you face Guangsheng?

508
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,200
I've already told you,

509
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,930
I don't like Mr. Huang.

510
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,070
I like the dog he keeps at his house.

511
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,770
For a dog?

512
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,230
Why get divorced?

513
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,130
Are you planning to marry the dog?

514
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,500
I've wanted a divorce for a long time.

515
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,870
Five years.

516
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,900
I've been waiting for Lin Guangsheng for five years.

517
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,030
If it weren't for him,

518
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,530
would we be struggling so much now?

519
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,770
I believe I've done everything I could for him.

520
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,870
When he left here,

521
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,970
he left this

522
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,730
already signed divorce agreement on the table.

523
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,670
What does this mean?

524
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,000
He wanted to set me free.

525
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,730
I know.

526
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,630
Married couples

527
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,270
should share both good and bad times.

528
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes, I admit it.

529
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,670
Guangsheng was really good to me.

530
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,030
He treated me well when he was making money.

531
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,670
I shouldn't leave him

532
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,470
when he's down on his luck.

533
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,430
But it's been so many years.

534
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,570
Where has he been hiding?

535
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,470
Has he ever cared about my feelings?

536
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,900
Does he know

537
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
that for his sake,

538
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,270
I've begged many creditors

539
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,830
not to come after me for the debts?

540
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,500
No matter what,

541
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,170
I will find a way.

542
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,130
I'll do whatever it takes.

543
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,600
Even if I get divorced,

544
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,470
I'll find a way to take on all these debts.

545
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,330
I just want

546
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,470
to live my own life properly.

547
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,230
Is that not allowed?

548
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,100
Mom.

549
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,700
Have you thought about this question?

550
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,590
If our parents divorce, who would you stay with?

551
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm not really asking you.

552
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,830
My mind is just a mess.

553
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,800
I've actually looked into this.

554
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,530
The adoption relationship

555
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,700
is established separately with each adoptive parent.

556
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,730
So even if they divorce,

557
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,330
as long as they don't terminate the adoption,

558
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,170
I'll still be their child.

559
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,030
Look at how lazy my parents are.

560
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,500
They wouldn't divorce

561
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,300
and specifically abandon me, right?

562
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,200
Don't you think?

563
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,370
After all,

564
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,770
I'm cuter than Jiang Zhilu,

565
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,000
more likable,

566
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,230
right?

567
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,230
Jiang Zhilu is on her way here with a knife.

568
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,330
Run!

569
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,070
What about you?

570
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,690
Have you decided who you'd stay with?

571
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,800
I don't know.

572
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,100
I don't even dare to think about it.

573
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
It hurts just thinking about them separating.

574
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,470
I felt so happy when I was little.

575
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,630
My parents bickered a lot,

576
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,830
and Grandma said mean things.

577
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,900
But we all knew

578
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,300
that we cared deeply about each other.

579
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,970
So my mom has been

580
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,930
unhappy for so long.

581
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,100
I'm the only one who thought nothing had changed.

582
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,200
Ding.

583
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,200
Hey, Ding.

584
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,500
What's wrong?

585
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,070
What do you mean?

586
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,570
Okay, I got it.

587
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,400
What happened?

588
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,700
They might have found my dad.

589
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,170
Why are you changing the light bulb yourself?

590
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,900
Aren't you afraid of falling?

591
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,800
Be careful.

592
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,630
When you first married into this family,

593
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,800
you were treated like a princess.

594
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,600
Guangsheng wouldn't even let you touch a dish,

595
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,430
let alone change a light bulb.

596
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,300
When you encounter something, you have to learn from it.

597
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,200
If you really prefer that dog,

598
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,730
then go ahead.

599
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,300
I won't go there anymore.

600
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,200
Brother Huang and Chucky

601
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,330
are moving to Hualien next week.

602
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,270
So that dog's name is Chucky?

603
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,570
Mom, Grandma, I'm home!

604
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,570
Welcome back.

605
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,800
Do you have work tomorrow?

606
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,570
If you're free,

607
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,470
could you take me to the supermarket?

608
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,800
Tomorrow I need to go...

609
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,000
Where are you going?

610
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,230
Camping.

611
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,230
Camping?

612
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,930
Why so sudden?

613
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,630
With whom?

614
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,630
My classmates invited me.

615
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,770
Is it that chubby Yiting?

616
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,500
Yiting?

617
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,730
No, no.

618
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,830
It's Yuting.

619
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,300
She's tall and slim now.

620
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,900
Oh, Yuting.

621
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,429
You have such a good memory.

622
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,100
Are you two getting along?

623
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,300
We've made up.

624
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,500
Wait.

625
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,969
I have something for you.

626
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,170
Wait. What is it?

627
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,230
Here, take these snacks with you.

628
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,130
You can eat them whenever you want.

629
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,270
Thanks, Mom. Take this opportunity

630
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,230
to relax and clear your mind.

631
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,030
Okay.

632
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,230
Aren't you going camping?

633
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,760
Where's your sleeping bag?

634
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:01,000
I... I sleep...

635
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You borrow my sleeping bag and expect me to bring it to you.

636
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,270
Such a diva.

637
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,000
The sleeping bag is over there.

638
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,830
Get in, I'll drive you.

639
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,430
Mrs. Xueqing.

640
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,430
Okay.

641
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,570
Bye-bye.

642
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,470
Mom, bye.

643
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,100
Bye-bye.

644
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,070
Bye-bye.

645
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,900
Let's go.

646
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,030
Be careful.

647
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,130
Okay.

648
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,130
Why is it Zhihao?

649
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,430
Didn't she say she was going with Yuting?

650
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,430
Lin Liying.

651
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,870
There's motion sickness medicine there.

652
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,100
Take some.

653
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,400
How thoughtful.

654
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,670
What new pickup technique is this?

655
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,270
Are you a girl to be picked up?

656
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,330
You didn't tell your mom and them.

657
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,430
I want to find my dad first,

658
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,030
then tell my mom and grandma.

659
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,930
Otherwise, having hope

660
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,670
and then being disappointed

661
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,530
isn't that torture?

662
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,300
I guess you're right.

663
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,970
You can stop at that intersection ahead.

664
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,400
There's a bus nearby.

665
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,800
Thanks for helping me keep this from my mom.

666
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,070
You missed it.

667
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,130
Why take motion sickness pills for a ten-minute drive?

668
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,700
You're driving far away.

669
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,670
Just sit tight.

670
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,230
Just don't get carsick.

671
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,830
Jiang Zhihao.

672
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,300
I need to pee.

673
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,800
Didn't you just go at the rest stop?

674
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,000
I need to go again.

675
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,470
How urgent is it?

676
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,930
Two out of ten.

677
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,100
Two?

678
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,600
Are you nervous?

679
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,970
I've always wanted to find my dad.

680
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,200
But now that we're almost there,

681
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,270
I don't know what to do when I see him.

682
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,300
Hey,

683
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,900
the engine temperature seems too high.

684
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,770
What? What do you mean?

685
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,630
Wait, I need to pull over.

686
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,960
Let me stop for a moment.

687
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,900
What's wrong?

688
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,130
Is it smoking?

689
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,130
Let me see.

690
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,730
Step back.

691
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,100
What are we going to do now?

692
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,870
Do you have a tow truck number?

693
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,600
Why would you ask me that?

694
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,070
We don't have much choice now.

695
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,030
Let's call someone first.

696
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,500
How are you going to take me there like this?

697
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,560
Maybe the tow truck can give us a ride.

698
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,370
Call first. Hurry up.

699
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,630
Sir, what's the problem?

700
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,570
The radiator is leaking.

701
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,070
The radiator is leaking.

702
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,470
Will it be expensive?

703
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,270
We'll need to check it first.

704
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,500
Thank you for your help.

705
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,700
Okay, no problem.

706
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,200
Lin Liying.

707
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,700
Would you like a cup?

708
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,970
Special hand-brewed fresh coffee, two-in-one.

709
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,530
You can still smell the coffee?

710
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,500
All I can smell is engine oil.

711
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,960
If you don't want it, I'll drink it.

712
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,100
Don't you think this is

713
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,130
a halftime break given to us by heaven?

714
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,400
Heaven knows you're not ready yet.

715
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,500
This halftime break is quite expensive.

716
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,230
The radiator is completely broken.

717
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,700
Will you help pay for it?

718
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,700
I'll pay half.

719
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
Your car was already a piece of junk.

720
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,770
Complaining?

721
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,600
Want some?

722
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,600
Lin Liying.

723
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,960
I don't know how your father is doing now.

724
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,530
But he was framed back then.

725
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,170
He was also a victim.

726
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,000
Of course,

727
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,730
he did bribe the judges

728
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,400
and was rude to Xiao Qian.

729
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,630
But regarding the toy paint issue,

730
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,270
he was completely innocent.

731
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,070
So I think

732
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,470
you don't need to condemn him entirely

733
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,400
just because someone framed him.

734
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,170
That's not fair to him.

735
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,470
Let's listen.

736
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,900
Let's hear what Xiao Qian says.

737
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,600
What date?

738
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,800
Lin Guangsheng never liked me anyway.

739
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,170
So I don't need to be nice to him.

740
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,670
You need to confirm that barrel of coating was used.

741
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,300
Let us know after it's been used,

742
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,800
and then it's no longer your concern.

743
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,230
What about the conditions you promised me?

744
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,230
Don't forget,

745
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,890
once I get the order from Linlin Breakfast Shop,

746
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,230
I won't have to worry about money anymore.

747
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,530
Brother Kang said

748
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,130
as long as you handle this well,

749
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,770
you'll get what you deserve.

750
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,330
Calling you,

751
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,100
answering within three rings,

752
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,170
chance meeting at a coffee shop,

753
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,730
they say love is luck,

754
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,600
late night radio,

755
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,270
I think we can be together.

756
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,430
Special guest.

757
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,000
What are you doing?

758
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,300
I need to use the bathroom.

759
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,600
You just went.

760
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,700
Let's go.

761
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,630
Don't you want to find your father?

762
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,870
Is this really the place?

763
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,470
Let's go in and find out.

764
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,000
Happy.

765
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,500
Very happy.

766
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,870
Thank you.

767
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,800
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

768
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,830
Mengmeng, over here!

769
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,600
Mengmeng, this way.

770
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,530
Mengmeng.

771
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,170
Liying.

772
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,600
Long time no see.

773
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,470
Dad.

774
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,870
Your life is a performing art,

775
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,430
while mine is just a joke.

776
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,000
I bet you're

777
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,270
not just taking kickbacks from the chicken factory.

778
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:43,000
I agreed to everything he proposed back then.

779
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,460
Do you want to scold me too?

780
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,600
The recording of me and Xiao Qian,

781
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,330
where did it come from?

782
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,530
Some people just don't like my brother.

783
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,130
Jiang Zhihao, please,

784
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,430
stop singing.

785
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,300
Pink Girl Concert.

786
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,370
Mom, dress up nicely on Saturday.

787
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,730
I'll take you on a date.
