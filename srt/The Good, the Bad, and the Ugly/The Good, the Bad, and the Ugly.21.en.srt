1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,630
Please help me check this.

2
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,830
Thank you. Let me know if you need anything else.

3
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,900
Thank you.

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,670
A new necklace.

5
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,930
I'm really happy.

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,700
We've never had one before.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,030
This is our first one.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,700
Yes, it is.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,300
Let me cut this for you.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,070
Sure. This looks delicious.

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,170
Is it good?

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,970
It's delicious. Do you want some?

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,170
I'll feed you. Okay.

14
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,200
Lin Liying.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,770
Yours tastes really good.

16
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,030
What are you doing?

17
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,270
Taking a photo?

18
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,070
Don't eat my food anymore.

19
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,670
What's the big deal?

20
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,130
Stingy.

21
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,470
I'll eat my own then.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,470
This is delicious.

23
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,670
Thank you.

24
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,829
I'm so full.

25
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,700
So,

26
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,430
where are we going next?

27
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,000
Good question.

28
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,770
I've been planning for a while,

29
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,329
so I've decided...

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,430
Bowling?

31
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,170
Yes,

32
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,930
we're going bowling.

33
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,530
That's right.

34
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,400
We've been bowling for like forever,

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,530
and now we're going bowling again?

36
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,130
I'm dressed like this and we're going bowling?

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,730
Speaking of which,

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,530
why are you dressed like blue and white porcelain?

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,300
This is new! I just bought it.

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,270
I...

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,700
It seems a little bit...

42
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,000
It doesn't really suit you.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,700
It looks a bit...

44
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,530
old-fashioned,

45
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,270
and a bit...

46
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,730
Never mind.

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Say it.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,430
Just a little bit.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,930
You seem a bit...

50
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Fat.

51
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,930
Fat.

52
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,829
Just a tiny bit.

53
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,670
A tiny bit.

54
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,930
How dare you say I'm fat?

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,500
You're the fat one!

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,270
You've been fat for years.

57
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,400
I never complained about it.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,970
How dare you call me fat?

59
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,730
Lin Liying, let's go bowling.

60
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,700
It helps you lose weight.

61
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,770
We're breaking up.

62
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,030
You're beautiful.

63
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,270
It's too late.

64
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,530
The damage is done.

65
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,770
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,730
It's so hot.

67
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,370
No, it's not like that.

68
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,470
We've been friends for so many years.

69
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,830
I didn't realize I've become a bad friend.

70
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,470
Now you finally realize how mean you've been to me.

71
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,230
Lin Liying, can you hear me out?

72
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,530
Even though we know each other well,

73
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,400
but

74
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,570
this is also my first time being in a relationship with you.

75
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,230
I'm learning too.

76
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,370
I'll learn to be better.

77
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,330
When we were just friends before,

78
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,000
I messed up like this all the time.

79
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,230
No big deal, right?

80
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,230
You messed up our first date

81
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,960
and you seem pretty proud of it.

82
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,870
It's not like we'll only have one date.

83
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,270
Right?

84
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,330
We'll have many more dates together.

85
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,160
I won't be like this in the future.

86
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,070
Please don't be angry.

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,500
Don't you need to prepare breakfast?

88
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,530
It's about time.

89
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,970
Alright.

90
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,370
I'll help you prepare it.

91
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,299
Lin Liying.

92
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:34,900
I love you.

93
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,270
Shh.

94
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,530
Keep your voice down.

95
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,070
What breakfast are you making today?

96
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,030
Today I'm making braised pork.

97
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,160
And I need to prepare the ingredients.

98
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,030
So clever.

99
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,000
Wake up.

100
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
Did you get enough sleep?

101
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,470
Where are Uncle Shide and Niu Yifei?

102
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,400
I texted them to come after 8.

103
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,530
Business just got better and you're already being so willful.

104
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,670
I just wanted you to get enough rest.

105
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,430
Let her go.

106
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,870
I'm using my second wish.

107
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,700
Break up with her.

108
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,200
My third wish:

109
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,230
Be with my mom.

110
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,830
Okay, Miaomiao.

111
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,870
Hurry up and go to school.

112
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,600
Fang Nuo.

113
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,330
Where did you go this morning?

114
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,370
I was at home,

115
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,570
cleaning the room.

116
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,470
Then look,

117
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,970
while cleaning,

118
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,230
I found this.

119
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,730
These are all the love letters I wrote with Shanru before.

120
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,970
I didn't realize when I moved,

121
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,230
I took them all with me.

122
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,700
I've always felt

123
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,370
guilty about her,

124
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,530
so I arranged to meet her at the store

125
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,930
to see

126
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,670
if she wanted these back,

127
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,730
but she never showed up.

128
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,070
You know what?

129
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,230
When I walked into Nuo Toast,

130
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,560
I almost thought I went to the wrong place.

131
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,700
The whole style of the store is completely different now,

132
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,960
and all the products have been replaced.

133
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,300
The entire Nuo Toast

134
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,530
has no trace of me left at all.

135
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,170
It's as if I

136
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,570
never existed.

137
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,430
But because of this, I've come to understand something.

138
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,330
Look at her,

139
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,930
she's already started the second chapter of her life.

140
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,770
Why should I keep dwelling on the past

141
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,000
and blaming myself

142
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
without moving forward?

143
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,870
What I mean is,

144
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,500
what is there

145
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,800
that can't be started over?

146
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,600
I know this is impulsive,

147
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,530
but I believe we can definitely be better.

148
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,600
Throw all these away.

149
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,930
I don't want to see them.

150
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,170
Miss Wang.

151
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,830
Sister Peng.

152
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,600
What brings you here today?

153
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,630
I'm looking for Weiyu.

154
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,930
Isn't he here?

155
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,900
He's not here.

156
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,770
Didn't you call him?

157
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,630
What about the chairman?

158
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,000
I think he went to play chess in the park.

159
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,970
That's a lot.

160
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,930
Who are they for?

161
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,470
These?

162
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,470
The chairman is sending them

163
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,800
as gifts to Weiyu's girlfriend's family.

164
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,100
Girlfriend?

165
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,970
Yes,

166
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,970
didn't Weiyu tell you?

167
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,070
The chairman knows Jiang Zhilu?

168
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,870
They've already met.

169
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,130
I...

170
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,470
Weiyu is back.

171
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,000
I need to go now.

172
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,630
Weiyu.

173
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,470
Weiyu.

174
00:14:59,270 --> 00:14:59,930
I should find a chance

175
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,130
to have a meal with Zhilu.

176
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,070
Humiliating her once wasn't enough for you?

177
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,470
You want to do it again?

178
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,730
You call that humiliation?

179
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,730
Oh my goodness.

180
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,200
What kind of person do you think I am?

181
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,570
I'm actually really foolish.

182
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,900
All these years,

183
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,730
why do you think I never left your father?

184
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,200
I used to set deadlines for myself.

185
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,530
First it was two years.

186
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,200
After two years, if he still didn't accept me,

187
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,830
I would take you and leave.

188
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,570
But then,

189
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,870
after two years came another two years.

190
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,270
And then?

191
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,270
Many more two-year periods passed,

192
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,100
right up until now.

193
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,530
Only to realize I simply can't leave him.

194
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,070
The pain of unrequited love,

195
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,070
I understand it better than anyone.

196
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,170
Now,

197
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,630
I don't want to stand in the way of your love anymore.

198
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,830
As long as my son can be happier than I was,

199
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,100
I'll be happy.

200
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,570
Let's have a nice meal together.

201
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,530
Whatever you like,

202
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,700
Mom will accept it.

203
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,770
Cut!

204
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,600
Meizi, temporary assignment, San Francisco.

205
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,270
Every group has been shot.

206
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,970
Good, thank you.

207
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,530
No problem.

208
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,260
Good, we're done. Take a break.

209
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,400
The ratings are so good that sponsors want more.

210
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,630
They want each of you to shoot an additional take.

211
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,730
It's fine.

212
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,530
It's all in the contract anyway.

213
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,270
Well,

214
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,369
I need to go.

215
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,500
Good luck with your competition the day after tomorrow.

216
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,800
Junni.

217
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
You...

218
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,130
let me know about the next Open Mic

219
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,830
schedule.

220
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,530
I'm your number one fan.

221
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,630
I'll definitely be there.

222
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,500
No problem.

223
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,560
Next time, you'll be my ghostwriter.

224
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,730
Please enjoy your meal.

225
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,730
Thank you.

226
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,530
Don't be afraid.

227
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,630
My mother inviting us for dinner means

228
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,630
she has accepted our relationship.

229
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,130
And this time I'm here with you.

230
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,200
Zhilu.

231
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Hello, Mrs. Please sit down.

232
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,230
I'm so glad you came.

233
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,130
I'm sorry I went to find you without notice.

234
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,500
I was just too eager to meet you.

235
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,130
Please don't mind.

236
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,330
Not at all. I didn't take it personally.

237
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,870
That's good.

238
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,370
You're such a cheerful girl.

239
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,400
That's wonderful.

240
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,730
I was worried

241
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,730
that your mother's death

242
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,130
would affect your relationship.

243
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,590
I'm glad it's not an issue.

244
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,070
You didn't tell her?

245
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,200
You should talk about these things.

246
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,130
What if it leaves her traumatized?

247
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,700
You really don't know?

248
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,470
The day your mother died,

249
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,770
I was there.

250
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,930
Hello. Would you like to get your hair done?

251
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,830
My mom might be out.

252
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,130
That's okay.

253
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,800
If you want to wash your hair,

254
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
I can help you.

255
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,630
Sit here. Come.

256
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,570
No need.

257
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,770
I'm leaving.

258
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,400
When I ran into you that time,

259
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,130
if I had said something,

260
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,300
your mom might have been saved.

261
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,870
But how could I know?

262
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,030
She looked like she was just joking.

263
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,430
How could she just die like that?

264
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,470
Xiu-rong Lai had a hard life.

265
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,430
Zhilu.

266
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,230
Why are you treating me like this?

267
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,600
Zhilu Jiang, please listen to me.

268
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,630
Don't touch me.

269
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,530
Let me explain.

270
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,370
I said don't touch me.

271
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,330
I've been planning to tell you. I said-

272
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,800
Don't touch me!

273
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,500
Listen to my explanation, Zhilu.

274
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,530
Please hear me out.

275
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,400
Don't walk so fast. Be careful.

276
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,200
I was planning to tell you anyway.

277
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
I just didn't have the chance yet.

278
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,770
You... slow down a bit.

279
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,870
I... I just didn't have the opportunity.

280
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,770
Let me speak, please.

281
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,170
How could it be like this?

282
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,270
It's not what you think.

283
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,470
Give me some time to explain.

284
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,400
Zhilu.

285
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,530
I

286
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,600
When I first found out,

287
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
I was devastated too.

288
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,230
I kept telling myself

289
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,530
not to see you again.

290
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,170
But I

291
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,800
I really can't do it.

292
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I

293
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,600
I still miss you every day.

294
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,670
I still want to see you every day.

295
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,370
I really want

296
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,900
to continue being with you.

297
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,630
Zhilu.

298
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,330
I really can't lose you.

299
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,070
Even if I have to carry this guilt

300
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,330
for the rest of my life, I can do it.

301
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,400
Can you forgive me, Zhilu?

302
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,170
Talk to me.

303
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,430
Please don't ignore me.

304
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,130
How did this happen?

305
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,430
What's going on?

306
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,830
I was just having dinner with my mom

307
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,160
when I accidentally fell down the stairs.

308
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,500
How do you fall while having dinner?

309
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,960
What's wrong with you all?

310
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,170
Zhihao, could you ask him to leave?

311
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,870
I'm so tired

312
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,100
and need to rest.

313
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,630
We broke up.

314
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,630
It's okay.

315
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,160
Come in and rest for a while.

316
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,670
I often wonder

317
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,930
why Dad could be so heartless.

318
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,400
He always ignored you completely.

319
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,100
I always felt it was unfair to you.

320
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,130
I really hoped you could have

321
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,600
the life you wanted.

322
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,070
But now I finally understand

323
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,960
that you don't deserve to be loved at all.

324
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,670
I've told you before.

325
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,870
For you,

326
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,130
I would do anything.

327
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,600
I won't give up on her.

328
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,730
Deng Weiyu,

329
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,600
you'll thank me someday.

330
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,030
From today on,

331
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,270
my future life

332
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,770
has nothing to do with you.

333
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,430
Don't you dare interfere with my life again.

334
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm just like you.

335
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,230
I'm capable of anything.

336
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,130
What?

337
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,130
You've been to Paris

338
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,030
but never visited the Louvre?

339
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,400
I was always there on business trips.

340
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,770
I even took some time off

341
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,330
hoping to stay a few extra days to look around.

342
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,270
But the company had an emergency,

343
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,300
so I changed my flight

344
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,770
and came back right away.

345
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,230
No luck with leisure time.

346
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,430
It's okay.

347
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,830
I'll take you next time.

348
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,830
Yes.

349
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,970
Are you interested in going to Scotland?

350
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,730
I want to find

351
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,530
a new whisky

352
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,270
for my bread.

353
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,430
Scotland.

354
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,630
I'm not sure if I can get time off,

355
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,670
or how many days I could take.

356
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,470
Okay, we'll see then.

357
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,770
Sure.

358
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,330
Excuse me, delivery's here.

359
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,100
You...

360
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,770
I'll handle it.

361
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,970
These purchase prices are too high.

362
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,770
Are you sure there's no mistake?

363
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,500
Are you afraid of being alone?

364
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,470
But I'm quite capable of being on my own.

365
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,560
When I think of something, I just do it right away.

366
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
It's more efficient that way.

367
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,800
What kind of bird is this?

368
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,930
What bird?

369
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
What bird do you think it looks like?

370
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,570
An eagle, I guess.

371
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,870
An eagle?

372
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,470
Oh, right.

373
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,100
I forgot to tell you,

374
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,930
look,

375
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
this order of yours.

376
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,370
I made some adjustments for you.

377
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,000
I think these items

378
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,330
don't need to be such top-tier quality.

379
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,230
And after my changes,

380
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,060
the price is actually half of what it was.

381
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,400
Thanks.

382
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,770
But these are all ingredients I've tested

383
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,870
and decided to use.

384
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,900
I don't want to change them.

385
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,070
Just give it a try.

386
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,130
I've already arranged it with them.

387
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,670
They'll deliver the new items tomorrow.

388
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,670
Why didn't you tell me first

389
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,400
before making decisions on your own?

390
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,100
When there's a problem, we need to solve it quickly.

391
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,170
At the current rate,

392
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,470
you're losing money every day.

393
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,000
You could at least have asked me first,

394
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,770
to hear what I think.

395
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,370
I know you mean well,

396
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,300
but once you open a shop,

397
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,000
you're not just a baker anymore.

398
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,270
You're also the boss.

399
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,730
Cost control is important.

400
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,060
You can't run a business that loses money.

401
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,600
And I didn't just randomly choose these for you.

402
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,900
I had our company's head chef verify them.

403
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,630
They're all good ingredients.

404
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,530
The final product won't be much different from the original,

405
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,130
and consumers won't even be able to tell the difference.

406
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,670
What do you mean 'can't tell the difference'?

407
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,270
What gives you the right to say that?

408
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,030
Because I've been in this market long enough.

409
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,000
I understand business management.

410
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,170
Then you handle your business management

411
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,530
and take care of your market.

412
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,000
But this is my shop.

413
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,570
You scared me!

414
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,130
I brought a few

415
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,400
of our bestselling products.

416
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,870
See if there's anything you can use.

417
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,930
Thank you.

418
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,700
Is your sister back yet?

419
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,400
My sister?

420
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Not yet.

421
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,900
How is she doing?

422
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,630
She still doesn't talk much.

423
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,030
Try this one.

424
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,630
This one

425
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,470
is our best-seller.

426
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,260
Both men and women with a youthful spirit really love it.

427
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,870
Pink is quite rare.

428
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,530
Why is your expression so strange?

429
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,300
I just suddenly remembered

430
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,700
my mom is also someone with a youthful spirit.

431
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,730
She loves anything pink.

432
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,330
Pink bags,

433
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,370
pink shoes,

434
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,330
pink lipstick,

435
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,570
and even pink girls.

436
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,870
Everything is pink.

437
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,330
Lin Liying.

438
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,870
I know what I need to do now.

439
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,900
You said it yourself.

440
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,030
We should talk about everything.

441
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,800
We're family,

442
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,930
have you forgotten?

443
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,170
Fine.

444
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,730
From now on,

445
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,700
you'll be the last to know about my business.

446
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,130
I won't be with Deng Weiyu anymore.

447
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,870
Did Deng Weiyu bully you?

448
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,200
Or is it because of me?

449
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,470
Zhilu.

450
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,570
Please don't break up with Deng Weiyu

451
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,230
because of me.

452
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,630
It's not because of you.

453
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,130
Then...

454
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,630
What is it then?

455
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,170
It's Mom.

456
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,200
Mom?

457
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,770
What does Mom have to do with this?

458
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,270
Mom already knew

459
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,630
that you're Deng Yongkuan's son.

460
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,430
And then...

461
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,770
And...

462
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,870
Weiyu's mother was afraid you two would recognize each other,

463
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,230
so she just watched as our mom died.

464
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,570
Breakfast with the World.

465
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,770
Round Three:

466
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,830
Theme: Bread.

467
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,330
Today, three contestants

468
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,500
will advance to the finals.

469
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,230
In other words,

470
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,900
half of the participants

471
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,630
will be leaving this competition.

472
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,530
They will never obtain

473
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,929
the title of Ultimate Breakfast Champion.

474
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,130
There can be

475
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,400
only one winner.

476
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,400
Let the competition begin.

477
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,570
Chairman, what brings you here?

478
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,430
Let me arrange a seat for you.

479
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,690
It's about to start. I just came to watch.

480
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,900
I'm not here as the chairman today.

481
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,430
I won't make the same mistake again.

482
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,500
Alright, the judges have now decided

483
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,670
which three contestants will advance

484
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,030
to our final round.

485
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,730
Please welcome Mana.

486
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,170
It was really difficult to judge.

487
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,570
I announce that the first finalist is

488
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,030
Meiko.

489
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,070
Congratulations, Meiko.

490
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,670
So cute.

491
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,500
The second finalist is

492
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,830
Lin Shicha.

493
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,700
The handsome chef, Lin Shicha.

494
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,330
Congratulations.

495
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,770
And the last finalist is

496
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,770
Chen Lili's Kitchen.

497
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,070
Chen Lili's Kitchen, congratulations.

498
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,130
Congratulations to all three of you

499
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,530
for successfully advancing to our finals.

500
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,170
Jiang Zhihao.

501
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,970
You've been popular throughout the competition

502
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,930
and your dishes have been impressive.

503
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,030
But just now,

504
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,330
you had a little accident, didn't you?

505
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,700
Can you tell us about it?

506
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,800
Actually, the inspiration for my dish today

507
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,470
comes from my mother.

508
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,070
My mother's name is Lai Xiurong.

509
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,130
She loves the color pink.

510
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,130
She believes pink

511
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,330
is a color that brings happiness.

512
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,600
But as you can see, my dish

513
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,100
isn't pink at all.

514
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,670
Yesterday,

515
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,430
I looked around my home.

516
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,330
I realized that my house

517
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,030
doesn't have a single pink item.

518
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,670
So I started wondering,

519
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,100
what does my mother really like?

520
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,130
Is my mother happy?

521
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,400
My mother is also someone

522
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
who loves to save money.

523
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,530
When she goes to the market,

524
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,100
even when buying three pieces of clothing for 500 yuan,

525
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,560
she still tries to bargain for a lower price.

526
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,670
Finding 10 yuan can make her happy for the entire day.

527
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,190
She loves buy-one-get-one-free deals.

528
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,270
Every time she buys

529
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,830
those buy-one-get-one-free items,

530
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,890
she still tries to get more freebies.

531
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,430
When her skincare products run out

532
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,830
and I offer to buy her more, she always says,

533
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,700
'At my age, nobody's looking at me anyway.'

534
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,700
So I wonder,

535
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,900
from the moment she became a mother,

536
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,900
she put away her own preferences.

537
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,430
Our interests became her interests.

538
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,830
Our happiness became her happiness.

539
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,170
But is she truly happy?

540
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,730
I really wish she could taste this dish

541
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,870
and find herself again.

542
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,330
She could rediscover Lai Xiurong.

543
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,430
But there's no chance now.

544
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,430
I think it's probably because of me.

545
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,170
If I didn't exist,

546
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,890
my mother would surely be the happiest person in the world.

547
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,670
Mom.

548
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,630
Are you happy?

549
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,500
Of course I'm happy.

550
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,870
Having you all makes me very happy.

551
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,400
Let me squeeze it for you.

552
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,570
Yes, look.

553
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,370
Isn't there still some inside?

554
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,030
Can we dig it out? Is there any?

555
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,170
What happened at the competition just now?

556
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,500
The most cursed people in this world

557
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
are the two of us.

558
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,700
Do you know that?

559
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,970
If neither of us existed,

560
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,770
then all this misfortune wouldn't have happened.

561
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:02,830
My mother wouldn't have died at the hands of Deng Weiyu's mother.

562
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,770
What do you mean by that?

563
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,830
What do I mean?

564
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,130
Isn't it true that anyone

565
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,200
who gets involved with us

566
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,000
never ends up well?

567
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,970
I'm begging you to stay away from my life, okay?

568
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,470
If you're still human,

569
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,330
if you're still human,

570
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,630
you should suffer more,

571
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,360
the more miserable the better.

572
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,370
Zhihao and Zhilu both said

573
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,630
they've dreamed about you.

574
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,400
Jiang Zhihao.

575
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,600
What are you doing?

576
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,230
Are you a spy sent from

577
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,930
that beauty salon on the main road?

578
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,330
Are you trying to ruin my business?

579
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,330
Those who are alive

580
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,800
need to move forward

581
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,930
and look ahead.

582
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,330
Did you hear that?

583
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,770
I'm single.

584
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,800
Have you been in touch with Zhihao recently?

585
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,970
Haven't seen you for so long.

586
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,370
I'm so happy.

587
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,130
I can't pretend.

588
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,830
My mother's death has nothing to do with you.

589
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,500
My mom is my mom. I am me.

590
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,070
What does that have to do with me?

591
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,430
You just think you're responsible for your mother's death, don't you?

592
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,230
Jiang Zhihao, you don't say anything,

593
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,800
not a word.

594
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,430
How am I supposed to tell you

595
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,770
it wasn't your fault?
