1
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,299
Senior.

2
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,130
Lin Liying.

3
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,470
I have something to tell you.

4
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,530
What?

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,170
I like you.

6
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,700
We took that general education class together last semester.

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,170
Do you remember? And then...

8
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,430
During the final exam,

9
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,000
I forgot to bring my 2B pencil,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,130
and you lent me yours.

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,370
Remember?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,630
This is Lin Liying's first romance.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,070
How could I possibly remember that?

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,770
You've borrowed it before.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,600
I haven't cleaned this part yet.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,900
Let me help you then.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,470
And here too.

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,870
Isn't this too expensive?

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,400
Maybe we should think about it more.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,230
Not at all.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,730
Or do you not like it?

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,370
This should

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,470
count as the second romance.

24
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,570
I like it.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,130
Lin Liying.

26
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,460
I'm getting to know you better and better.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,770
So you're such an M.

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,500
If you're laughing, it's fine.

29
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,770
I'm going to buy fish now.

30
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,170
This is

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,800
the third romance that hasn't happened yet.

32
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,170
Stop pushing me!

33
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,829
Hey, Sister Shanru...

34
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,730
Hello, miss.

35
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,600
Are you single?

36
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,130
This is a dating event.

37
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,130
You're the one who's single.

38
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,730
Your whole family is single.

39
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,170
Who's single?

40
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,130
Are you talking about us?

41
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,330
It's just a scam call.

42
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,230
Are there many male colleagues at your company?

43
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,330
Let me tell you.

44
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,570
We can be single, but you can't.

45
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,529
That's right.

46
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,829
If you meet someone with good conditions,

47
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,800
it's okay for a girl to be a bit proactive.

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,370
Grandma was quite forward when she was young too.

49
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,700
I... our company only has women.

50
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,900
Dead end.

51
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,230
Who is it?

52
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,370
Who's that?

53
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,100
Gao Bohan.

54
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,430
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,630
Asking you out for dinner.

56
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,600
My mom wants to have dinner with you.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,770
Your mom?

58
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,670
I don't want to.

59
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,900
Why are you being like this?

60
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,700
My mom's turning 60 next week.

61
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,270
She specifically asked to have dinner with you.

62
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,100
Look, it's your mom's 60th birthday.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,570
You should just have dinner with her.

64
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,570
I...

65
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,900
Why do I need to be there?

66
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,270
You're my

67
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,500
girlfriend.

68
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,300
Gao Baihan.

69
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,730
You're really pushing your luck.

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,630
Let's go.

71
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,230
Just make the elderly lady happy.

72
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,770
Besides, she made a reservation

73
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,770
at a Michelin restaurant just to have dinner with you.

74
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,100
How about that?

75
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,500
Michelin is nice, I admit.

76
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,100
So you agree?

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,070
Let's go then.

78
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,300
I'll take you to buy a new outfit.

79
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,470
My treat.

80
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,400
What's wrong?

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,200
You think I'm not pretty enough?

82
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,760
Maybe just a little bit.

83
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,370
Alright, hurry up. I'll wait for you.

84
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,900
So annoying. Wait a minute.

85
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,370
Who's that guy?

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,770
A client.

87
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,400
A client.

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,830
No male colleagues? No problem.

89
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,000
Male clients are good too.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,970
Grandma, you're smiling too much.

91
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm happy.

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,700
So you admit it.

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,400
Hello.

94
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,230
Hello. Hello, auntie. Hello, grandma.

95
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,030
Come in and have a seat.

96
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes. No need.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,870
We're leaving soon.

98
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,900
Come in and wait.

99
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,500
It's fine.

100
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,470
Have some tea.

101
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,070
Come in and sit down. Come on.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,430
Let me be clear.

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,890
Last time's blind date was hard to get out of.

104
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,270
This birthday thing is out of necessity.

105
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,600
This is the last time.

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,630
Thanks.

107
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,470
No need to thank me.

108
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,170
I understand how parents want

109
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,530
their children to settle down quickly.

110
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,630
You understand?

111
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,030
What? Is your family in the same situation?

112
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,970
Or should we just keep pretending?

113
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,530
This way, both of us

114
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,900
will avoid the trouble.

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,170
Tell your mom

116
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,730
we'll break up in a month.

117
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,130
Okay.

118
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,260
Couldn't you find someone else to act?

119
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,470
What are you two doing?

120
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,030
Aren't you done with the act?

121
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,200
When did you two get so close?

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,100
About that blind date last time,

123
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,160
I told him about it.

124
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,070
About Lin Liying,

125
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,630
I know everything.

126
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,430
She told me. Good.

127
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,070
Let me see.

128
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,700
She's drinking my milk tea.

129
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,430
I saw that.

130
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,370
Where are you going?

131
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,270
We're going to buy something.

132
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,170
Do you need to buy anything?

133
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,430
I'll just go with you. Let's go together.

134
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,570
Wait for me a moment.

135
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,900
I need to check the address we're going to.

136
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,000
Hey kiddo,

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,230
you always forget to fasten your seatbelt.

138
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,730
Weren't you two acting before?

139
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,500
Why act in the car?

140
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,170
There's no camera here.

141
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,330
Who are you showing off your affection to?

142
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,530
Zhihao, what's wrong with you?

143
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,330
You guys haven't changed at all.

144
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,500
So noisy.

145
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,130
Yeah,

146
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,300
Bohan,

147
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,830
I sincerely advise you to find someone else.

148
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,270
You two aren't suitable to pretend to be a couple.

149
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,830
Liying is fierce and lacks grace, right?

150
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,430
You're just not compatible.

151
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,070
You said the same thing in college,

152
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,670
yet I still confessed to her.

153
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,800
Well,

154
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,300
you two broke up in the end, didn't you?

155
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,500
That proves you weren't compatible.

156
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,770
Zhihao,

157
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,670
get my jacket from the trunk.

158
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,230
I'll get it.

159
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,500
I'll go.

160
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
I'll drive.

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,700
Senior, your trunk isn't open.

162
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,700
The trunk?

163
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,430
You guys are like a scam operation.

164
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,100
My bubble tea!

165
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,070
The grand opening of Linshi Cha.

166
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,630
Seems our regular customers aren't buying it.

167
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,300
Customer complaints in the North District have reached a historic high.

168
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,960
Almost to the point of calling a review meeting.

169
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,370
The main complaints are focused on

170
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,700
the service quality of Linlin Breakfast.

171
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,170
Daniel.

172
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,200
Ask the North District manager to come in. North Dist-

173
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,530
Daniel.

174
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,800
The best employees from the North District

175
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,370
have all been reassigned to support Linshi Cha.

176
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,630
The North District manager is overwhelmed

177
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,570
trying to fill those positions.

178
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,200
Can you really blame him?

179
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,370
Or maybe someone is completely out of touch,

180
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,900
because he's too busy promoting himself.

181
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,360
He wouldn't even notice these small issues.

182
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,770
Abby.

183
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,370
Overall sales are declining at this point.

184
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,830
I'm not trying to undermine your VP,

185
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,030
I'm just pointing out

186
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,670
the warning signs that shouldn't be ignored

187
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,170
as a reminder to all of you.

188
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,370
The biggest failure this quarter

189
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,570
isn't it your proposed Nuo series,

190
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,930
Marketing Director?

191
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,130
Abby.

192
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,030
Then let's terminate the contract early,

193
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,670
following the VP's usual way of solving problems

194
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,700
to handle it.

195
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,570
Fine. I'll handle it.

196
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,970
Here's this quarter's complaint report.

197
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,230
Please sign it if everything looks good.

198
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,030
You don't need to bring these yourself in the future.

199
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,430
Just have your subordinates deliver them.

200
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,930
The VP position isn't easy to handle.

201
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,100
Didn't you hold it before?

202
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,930
I have the right temperament for it,

203
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,830
sat there with a clear conscience.

204
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,490
That's why I'm worried you can't handle it well.

205
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,060
Not satisfied? Bring it up again.

206
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,030
Off work!

207
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,400
Why are you here?

208
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,130
Waiting for you. You think this is a coincidence?

209
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,430
Why didn't you call first?

210
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,670
Thought you might be busy.

211
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,870
Let's go eat.

212
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,730
I'm not hungry.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Come on.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,030
Stop making excuses.

215
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,870
Want to order something else?

216
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,230
What's this 'Virgin's Tears' dish?

217
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,400
The American beef ribs are ready.

218
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,830
Beef ribs are good for you. They build blood.

219
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,600
Excuse me!

220
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,330
Another order of American beef ribs, please.

221
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,630
Okay, just a moment. Thank you.

222
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,070
Coming right up.

223
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,230
Eat up.

224
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,670
Just tell me.

225
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,400
Why did you want to see me?

226
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,100
To have dinner together.

227
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,430
What else would I want?

228
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Come on.

229
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,700
How's your temporary assignment going?

230
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,430
Is everything going smoothly?

231
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,570
Fine.

232
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,230
What about your father?

233
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,490
How is the chairman doing lately?

234
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,900
You've already left the company.

235
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,100
Why do you still care so much about my family's business?

236
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,870
Who cares about them?

237
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,170
I care about you.

238
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,130
I'm worried that now you've taken the VP position,

239
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,000
you might run into some trouble.

240
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,100
So you also think

241
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,300
I'm not suitable for this position?

242
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,800
Deng Weiyu,

243
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,630
what's going on with you today?

244
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,170
I can't drink with you.

245
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,430
I'm a lightweight.

246
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,090
I don't want to drink with you.

247
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,400
Why are you still here?

248
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,200
Every one of you covets my position.

249
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,770
Everyone wants to bring me down.

250
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,130
Everyone looks down on me.

251
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,930
The VP position.

252
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,800
Do you know how much pressure I'm under? Everyone

253
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,030
treats my efforts like nothing.

254
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,970
Go away!

255
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,170
Jiang Zhihao.

256
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,500
I really hate you.

257
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,870
Hello everyone.

258
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,570
I'd like to introduce our partner...

259
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,130
Next, I'm going to talk about

260
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,970
our company Notoast

261
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,300
and our collaboration briefing with Mr. Baimu.

262
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,370
Before I start my presentation,

263
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,400
I'd like to briefly introduce to Mr. Baimu

264
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,900
the current situation of Notoast.

265
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,300
Notoast

266
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,670
was created by our CEO

267
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,400
and Fang Nuo

268
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,170
as a joint brand.

269
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,530
Someone once described that

270
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,830
Notoast is like love.

271
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,700
Our food has warmth,

272
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,970
giving a sense of happiness when eaten.

273
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,700
But since Fang Nuo left Notoast,

274
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,770
some people say

275
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,800
Notoast has lost its soul.

276
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
But does losing love

277
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,770
mean losing your soul?

278
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,830
The soul of our company is our CEO!

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,030
Next,

280
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,500
my

281
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,130
page 17.

282
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,070
This one

283
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,700
is Mr. Baimu's

284
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,400
first artwork

285
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,130
from his college years.

286
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,100
He drew a girl

287
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,800
walking in heavy rain.

288
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,270
Her expression is calm and confident.

289
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,100
Even with mud everywhere,

290
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,970
she still strides forward.

291
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,830
I believe

292
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,430
what our Notoast needs now

293
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,430
is exactly this kind of

294
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,370
fresh start and direction.

295
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,170
In terms of market sales,

296
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,900
I think our target age group

297
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,400
would range from 17 to 45.

298
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,700
Why such a wide range?

299
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,800
Because when we're young,

300
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,170
we look at illustrations and imagine our own stories.

301
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,600
And when we reach 45,

302
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,330
looking at these paintings...

303
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,430
Liying, congratulations!

304
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,670
Liying No.1!

305
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,970
You're amazing! You did so well!

306
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,730
You successfully got the deal!

307
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,500
Thanks.

308
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,930
Let's go singing tonight.

309
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,400
Great! No time like the present.

310
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,530
I'll make the reservation.

311
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,430
I can't today.

312
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,300
I have plans tonight.

313
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,600
Don't be such a killjoy.

314
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,770
Next time. Next time together.

315
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,770
Next time again?

316
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,930
Fine, we'll make plans ourselves.

317
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,100
Okay, we'll go by ourselves.

318
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,930
Without you.

319
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,670
Next time then.

320
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,300
Next time.

321
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,170
Okay.

322
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,030
Tongtong, book a table quickly.

323
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,300
Okay, how many? Let me count.

324
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,130
Where should we go to eat then?

325
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,030
These two young people shouldn't have done this.

326
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,090
How could they keep it from everyone?

327
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,500
Actually, when it comes to relationships,

328
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,830
I don't have any objections.

329
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,270
As long as they love each other, that's what matters.

330
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,400
That's right.

331
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,930
You're back.

332
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,170
Come join us for afternoon tea.

333
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,300
Mom, why are you at someone else's house?

334
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,570
Come in.

335
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,730
Lin Liying.

336
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,000
You really are something.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,800
If it weren't for Sister Lan,

338
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I wouldn't have known about you and Bohan.

339
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,670
And your little love story.

340
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,930
Last time I heard Liying talking at the restaurant.

341
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,100
Your mom moves fast. I just remembered.

342
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,370
Why is my mom at your place? A box was delivered to my home.

343
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,730
And your mom even knows our address.

344
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,870
Why? Fortunately, I didn't throw it away.

345
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,170
I don't know. I didn't tell her.

346
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,470
After going in circles for over a decade,

347
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,170
Now you two

348
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,000
Go handle this situation. You've still ended up together.

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,100
Bohan.

350
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,400
I put that box in your room.

351
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,230
Pull up a chair and join us.

352
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,270
Look how abundant this is.

353
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,200
Come, eat.

354
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,170
Go ahead.

355
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,200
Mom.

356
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,730
Weren't we supposed to eat at a restaurant today?

357
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,600
Why are you bothering them?

358
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,030
Just have something to eat.

359
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,600
Our Liying is getting shy.

360
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,500
Liying.

361
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,960
Take Bohan to wash his hands. We'll eat soon.

362
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,430
Oh, that's right.

363
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,470
I've already ordered a cake and takeout.

364
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,970
For birthdays,

365
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,000
it's more fun to celebrate together.

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,730
Yes.

367
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,270
I'm really sorry.

368
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,870
I was planning

369
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,730
to invite you all to a restaurant.

370
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,030
But now you're treating us instead.

371
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,900
We're all family now.

372
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,730
Why be so formal?

373
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,100
That's right, no need to be polite.

374
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,570
Don't be shy.

375
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,670
Texting with Bohan?

376
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,900
I know when it comes to relationships

377
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,870
you're still afraid.

378
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,900
I can tell from how you two interact.

379
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,670
Because of what happened with Xiao Qian,

380
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,870
your heart hasn't opened up yet.

381
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,530
Grandma.

382
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,200
Actually,

383
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,570
I didn't really like Xiao Qian either,

384
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,270
especially his parents.

385
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,930
They always looked down on everyone.

386
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,500
If we had become in-laws with them,

387
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,560
they would have driven me to my grave.

388
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,630
But

389
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,770
this Gao Bohan is different.

390
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,570
I think he's quite suitable for you.

391
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,700
His mother is easy to get along with too.

392
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,130
If you marry into their family,

393
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,870
I'll be at ease.

394
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,170
It's not like that between me and Gao Bohan.

395
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,600
I...

396
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,300
Alright, I know.

397
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,370
I know you're filial,

398
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,800
but I don't want you to spend your whole life

399
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
taking care of us at home.

400
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,170
Grandma is getting old.

401
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,530
I want to, while I'm still healthy,

402
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,670
be able to see you

403
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,370
try on a wedding dress

404
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,870
and walk you down the red carpet.

405
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,530
I hope you cherish this relationship.

406
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,870
My greatest wish right now

407
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,430
is to see you happy and content.

408
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,930
You're emotionally blackmailing me.

409
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,700
Don't keep Grandma waiting too long.

410
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,030
Good night.

411
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Alright, good night.

412
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,100
Remember what Grandma said.

413
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,170
Okay.

414
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,200
If there are no other issues,

415
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
today's meeting is almost over.

416
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,000
Have you all watched

417
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,630
the feature report on Linshi Cha?

418
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,300
Tell me what you saw.

419
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,000
Although the video introduced many stores,

420
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,870
I think Linshi Cha

421
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,430
is still the most memorable one.

422
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,530
Linshi Cha targets a different demographic than other stores.

423
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,400
I think it's competitive.

424
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,300
What about you?

425
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,100
The video has indeed shown good results.

426
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,230
I think we should continue promoting it on social media.

427
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,330
So you all only noticed Linshi Cha?

428
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,530
They interviewed so many stores.

429
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,400
Didn't any of you notice?

430
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,300
San Francisco Beauty Salon -

431
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,770
though it's just an affordable breakfast place,

432
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,630
it has a distinctive brunch style.

433
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,670
Customers can pay an affordable price

434
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,930
and enjoy the atmosphere.

435
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,190
Haven't you learned anything from that?

436
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
San Francisco Beauty Salon

437
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,570
was originally just a hair salon.

438
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,230
Using that environment to sell breakfast directly -

439
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,030
I don't think it can sustain long-term.

440
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,070
Am I talking about business operations right now?

441
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,970
I'm talking about uniqueness.

442
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,270
If money was all it took to open a good restaurant,

443
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,900
then I could open a hundred places

444
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,100
better than your Linshi Cha.

445
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,400
You can't blindly think you're the best

446
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
or that you have all the advantages.

447
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,570
All the seats inside are taken now.

448
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,400
Would you like to order takeout?

449
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,270
It would be more convenient and faster.

450
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,330
I've been waiting in line for so long

451
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,900
just to dine in and take photos

452
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,530
and enjoy a delicious breakfast.

453
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,800
You're asking me to take out? But...

454
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,970
It's completely full inside.

455
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,800
So many tables in there,

456
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,400
and they're just sitting there with tea.

457
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,130
Should we ask them to finish quickly? No.

458
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,970
Okay. We've waited so long.

459
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,430
Let me handle this, okay?

460
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay.

461
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,900
Wait, let me take care of this.

462
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,630
Do we really have to wait this long for breakfast?

463
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,770
Excuse me, you two. I see

464
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,870
you finished your breakfast a while ago

465
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,670
and only have two cups of tea left.

466
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,930
How about I get you a bag

467
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,430
so you can take the tea to go?

468
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,500
Your restaurant doesn't have a time limit for customers.

469
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,130
Why should we have to leave?

470
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,070
That's right. We paid for our meal.

471
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,970
We're customers too.

472
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,230
How can you talk to us like that? What gives you the right?

473
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,730
But... I have many customers outside who can't come in.

474
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,070
I don't want to! No!

475
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,300
Fine.

476
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,070
Mind your own business! Who are you talking to?

477
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,800
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

478
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,970
Stop trying to grab my phone!

479
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,000
You're already heading back to the office...

480
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,730
Could you please be a little quieter?

481
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,830
You're disturbing the other customers.

482
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,430
Is there a rule that couples can't argue in this restaurant?

483
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,670
There's no rule against couples arguing.

484
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,600
But you're being too loud.

485
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,630
You're already disturbing other customers.

486
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,670
I'm so scared of your loud voice.

487
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,200
You're the one being loud.

488
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
You were louder than me just now. Alright.

489
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,300
Can you please calm down?

490
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,230
Dad, watch out!

491
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,970
Are you okay?

492
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,430
It's fine.

493
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,230
Sir, why did you trip my father?

494
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,570
Why are you being so aggressive?

495
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,030
Let's be reasonable. Why did you stick your foot out?

496
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,400
And trip someone.

497
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,070
He stepped on his foot! My father is elderly.

498
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,130
You're in this kind of place

499
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,730
thinking you're filming a movie?

500
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,030
What kind of business is this?

501
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,890
Talking so loudly. Jiang Zhihao!

502
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,030
No, look at this situation.

503
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,000
Stop filming.

504
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,670
Don't film.

505
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,300
What happened?

506
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,230
They were arguing very loudly.

507
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,270
Disturbing other customers.

508
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,200
Then this person stuck his foot out

509
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,070
and tripped Dad.

510
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,230
And that person, I told him to stop filming.

511
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,400
Dad, are you okay? He's still filming.

512
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,970
I told you not to film. Don't you understand?

513
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,700
If you want to argue, go outside.

514
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm talking to you! If you want to argue, go outside.

515
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,630
Wait a minute!

516
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,000
Stop filming already!

517
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,770
Didn't I tell you to stop filming?

518
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,870
If you want to argue, go outside. Stop filming.

519
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,330
You finished eating ages ago. How long are you going to keep drinking?

520
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,300
Please stop arguing.

521
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,170
If you want to argue, go outside.

522
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,570
You're not welcome to eat here. Just leave!

523
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,670
Why was it uploaded so quickly?

524
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,370
And so many people are watching it. It's so annoying.

525
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,670
Zhihao, look.

526
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,500
Working at the hotel is exhausting enough.

527
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,070
I get up every morning to make you breakfast.

528
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,330
Now I have to deal with angry customers.

529
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,230
With all those nasty comments online,

530
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,470
nobody's going to come anyway.

531
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,830
I quit.

532
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,600
Don't wake me up starting tomorrow.

533
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,900
Come on, you're quitting?

534
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,700
The supplier just sent a message.

535
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
They said they're short on stock and won't supply us anymore.

536
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,870
How can we run our business without supplies?

537
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,470
Zhihao,

538
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,900
other people's businesses run so smoothly,

539
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,730
why do you have so many setbacks?

540
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,230
So unlucky.

541
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,430
Good things come to those who persevere, understand?

542
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,130
It's okay.

543
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,570
A new business

544
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,900
will always face challenges.

545
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,200
Take it slow.

546
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,030
You two take your time arguing.

547
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,230
Fighting is exhausting.

548
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,890
I'm going to catch up on sleep.

549
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,570
Don't call me.

550
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,870
Look.

551
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,870
Everyone has a phone.

552
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,270
Everyone's a paparazzi.

553
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,570
That was uploaded so quickly.

554
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,800
Zhilu's voice is so loud.

555
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,970
The video shows the recently viral breakfast shop.

556
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,070
San Francisco Beauty Salon.

557
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,070
Due to a physical conflict with customers.

558
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,370
It's been heavily criticized online.

559
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,800
We interviewed one of their neighbors.

560
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,500
I've been putting up with them for a long time.

561
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,830
Every morning before dawn.

562
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,970
They start making all kinds of noise.

563
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,470
It's impossible for me to sleep.

564
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,600
Such terrible neighbors.

565
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,370
Should be ordered to shut down.

566
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,170
Has this situation been going on for long?

567
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,070
For a long time. Never improved.

568
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,430
Have they always been this arrogant?

569
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,170
Always like this.

570
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,830
They've always been this way.

571
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,330
No, none of these units will work.

572
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,130
This one doesn't even have a balcony.

573
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,130
This layout is way too small.

574
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,830
I want a high floor with large square footage.

575
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,870
Our company just yesterday.

576
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,600
Got a new property listing.

577
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,730
The condition is excellent.

578
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,870
It meets all your requirements, Ms. Wang.

579
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,800
It's just a bit pricey.

580
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,300
Money is not an issue.

581
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,400
Let's prepare all the relevant documents tomorrow.

582
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,300
And assist you then.

583
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,630
Fine. I'll come back tomorrow.

584
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,230
Don't waste my time.

585
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,470
We'll be leaving now.

586
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,530
Deng Weiyu, come with me to see the house tomorrow.

587
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,030
I'm not available tomorrow.

588
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,230
Not available?

589
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,230
What's more important than helping me buy a house?

590
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,530
I didn't say you couldn't buy it.

591
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,200
I just can't make it tomorrow.

592
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,330
What are you going to do?

593
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,030
Go on a date.

594
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,330
With Jiang Zhilu.

595
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,070
Didn't I tell you to break up with her?

596
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,670
Or are you too scared and want me to do it?

597
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,770
I'm going to break up with her tomorrow.

598
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,170
Is that good enough?

599
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,470
Good.

600
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,600
Breaking up is for your sake, not mine.

601
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,030
I'll go see the house myself.

602
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,270
You know what?

603
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,970
Last night I actually

604
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,500
felt like a kid before a school trip.

605
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,830
I couldn't sleep at all.

606
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,200
Let me tell you.

607
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,230
I found a great B&B.

608
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,530
I heard the view is amazing.

609
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,030
We can see stars at night.

610
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,000
What's wrong with you?

611
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,370
Are you too focused on work or what?

612
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,730
You seem distracted.

613
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,400
No, it's just.

614
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,060
I'm not good with this thread.

615
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,400
Deng Weiyu.

616
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,500
Are you tired from work?

617
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,470
Or did something happen at the company?

618
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,830
No, it's just.

619
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,100
I might be tired from the traffic jam.

620
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,700
I'll be fine after some rest.

621
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,370
You need to take photos for me, Weiyu.

622
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,900
You need to capture the front. Its front side.

623
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,530
So cute.

624
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,770
What's that sound?

625
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,760
Don't you know how to tie it?

626
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,030
How do I...

627
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,300
Look, there are wishing tablets here.

628
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,400
Let's make a wish.

629
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,200
What?

630
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,930
This is my mom's favorite song.

631
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,130
Sign it.

632
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,500
Hang it here.

633
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,570
With all my heart.

634
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,670
Done.

635
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,200
If I don't tell you certain things now,

636
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,890
I'm afraid I won't have the chance later.

637
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,270
What things?

638
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,470
I know I've never been

639
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,300
a good enough boyfriend.

640
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,870
I often fail to keep my promises to you.

641
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,670
I haven't protected you well.

642
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,730
I haven't taken good care of you.

643
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,870
Being with someone like me

644
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,230
must be really hard.

645
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,830
Deng Weiyu,

646
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,930
why are you saying all this now?

647
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,400
What if...

648
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
One day...

649
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,670
you realize I'm actually

650
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,270
not as good as you thought?

651
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,100
Deng Weiyu,

652
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,770
what are you trying to say?

653
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,970
Nothing.

654
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,830
I just suddenly feel

655
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,230
useless, that's all.

656
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,430
You're great.

657
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,470
You need to believe in yourself.

658
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,800
Besides,

659
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,170
I'll always be by your side.

660
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,670
Zhilu.

661
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,700
Zhilu.

662
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,900
Jiang Zhilu.

663
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,000
Break up with Zhilu immediately.

664
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,700
Don't push me.

665
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,170
You know for your sake,

666
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,400
I'm capable of anything.

667
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,330
Breaking up is for your benefit, not mine.

668
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,930
Or are you too afraid to say it? Want me to help you?

669
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,330
Jiang Zhilu.

670
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,070
Where did you go?

671
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,100
You left without saying anything. Where's your phone?

672
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,430
I forgot to bring it.

673
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,970
It's so late.

674
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,330
There are many bad people out there, you know?

675
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,200
And there are stray dogs around here.

676
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,630
What if you get bitten?

677
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,270
I was going to buy some fried chicken.

678
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,600
There's a famous place nearby.

679
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,730
Thought it might cheer you up.

680
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,699
Why are you so harsh?

681
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,670
Such a foodie.

682
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,830
I was buying it for you.

683
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,500
So I'm that important to you.

684
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,600
Very important.

685
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,570
Very important.

686
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,930
Chairman.

687
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,730
What brings you here?

688
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,570
We're not open today.

689
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,800
We are open today.

690
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,630
Are you alone in the shop?

691
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,300
My dad is here too.

692
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,570
But...

693
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,930
We haven't had many customers lately,

694
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,930
so I let him go play chess in the park.

695
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,670
Chairman, would you like something to eat?

696
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,730
I heard you have

697
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,660
blood cake with egg crepes, right?

698
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,990
Yes. Do you add peanut powder?

699
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,400
Yes.

700
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,370
I'll have one.

701
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,670
Okay.

702
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,470
Please go in and have a seat.

703
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll prepare it right away.

704
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,200
Chairman, it's ready.

705
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,570
Who's this person in the photo?

706
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,030
That's my mom's friend.

707
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,870
They opened this shop together.

708
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,630
Your mother's friend?

709
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,200
What's her name?

710
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,470
Where is she now?

711
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,600
Chairman, you know her?

712
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,900
She's an old friend of mine.

713
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,870
That auntie left when I was little.

714
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,000
So I don't remember her name.

715
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,230
Blood cake with peanut powder.

716
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,900
You like it the same way she did.

717
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,800
My mom taught me this habit.

718
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,830
I grew to like it over time.

719
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,270
Here, have some water.

720
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,630
By the way,

721
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,630
she's holding a child in the photo.

722
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,330
Was she married?

723
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,600
You mean in the photo?

724
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,730
That's me.

725
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,630
Auntie adored me since I was little.

726
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,900
She held me every day.

727
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,230
It's quite incredible when I think about it.

728
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,070
You used to work under Weikang,

729
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,900
and I always thought you were talented.

730
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,430
Later you became friends with Weiyu,

731
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,830
and even worked as my assistant for a while.

732
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,400
Now I discover

733
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,470
your family knows my friend.

734
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,230
Jiang Zhihao.

735
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,130
Do you think

736
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,030
this is coincidence or fate?

737
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,600
Maybe both. I'm not sure.

738
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,870
Boss, are you still serving?

739
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,070
Chairman, please eat while it's hot.

740
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,870
I'll go attend to the customers.

741
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,500
Jiang Zhihao.

742
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,570
I'm feeding mosquitoes here,

743
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,370
almost dying from blood loss,

744
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,100
are you going to talk or not?

745
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,700
If you discovered

746
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,900
that half the blood

747
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,530
in your body came from someone you hate,

748
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,030
you wouldn't care about being drained dry.

749
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,330
I really don't understand your logic.

750
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,400
I'm going home.

751
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,870
I have work tomorrow.

752
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,300
If you're acting weird here

753
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,130
because of Gao Baihan,

754
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:46,770
let me tell you,

755
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,230
I don't go back to my exes.

756
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,130
What's wrong?

757
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,270
I'm really in a bad mood right now.

758
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,160
Could you stay with me a bit longer?

759
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,600
What's the matter?

760
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,230
I found out who my father is.

761
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,270
Your father is Jiang...

762
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,500
You know who your biological father is?

763
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,230
Who?

764
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,300
Deng Yongkuan.

765
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,370
Why are you more shocked than I am?

766
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,990
While sorting through my mother's belongings,

767
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,170
I found a notebook

768
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,230
written by my birth mother.

769
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,000
So the accuracy of this

770
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
should be higher than

771
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,270
a DNA test.

772
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,330
Why does this sound like a movie script?

773
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,230
What should I be doing

774
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,430
to seem normal right now?

775
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,200
So,

776
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,800
do you plan to tell your father

777
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,970
and Zhilu about this?

778
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,370
I've only told you.

779
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,900
Because I feel like

780
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,030
if I don't tell someone,

781
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,690
my head will explode from overthinking.

782
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,430
Yes, it's good to tell me.

783
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,930
Just tell me alone,

784
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,500
so only the two of us know.

785
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,100
As long as we don't tell anyone,

786
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,630
nobody else will know.

787
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,630
But he came to the restaurant today.

788
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,770
He already saw the photo on the wall.

789
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,030
It has a picture of me with my birth mother.

790
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,400
I think he might be suspicious now.

791
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,700
No way.

792
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,070
You've gained so much weight,

793
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,700
who could recognize you?

794
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,470
Really?

795
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,000
This kind of negative energy needs to be expressed.

796
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,270
Once you say it out loud, you'll feel better.

797
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,130
What do you want to eat?

798
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,060
I'll treat you to instant noodles.

799
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,570
Lin Liying

800
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,570
I want dry noodles.

801
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,730
Got it.

802
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:06,930
Zhihao.

803
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,130
Linlin, there's still your portion for breakfast after all.

804
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,830
How do you plan to divide the inheritance later...

805
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,830
What did you say?

806
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,170
Being friends or brothers is fine.

807
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,400
But if you're doing better than him,

808
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,530
that's a different story.

809
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,670
How is it after all these years,

810
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,500
you still make the same mistake?

811
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,400
It's just a way of imagining the future.

812
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,370
I also think our future

813
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,670
could be like this.

814
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,270
Do you like me then?

815
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,770
I can be very serious.

816
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,630
I can also become like Gao Bohan.

817
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,500
Don't think that in front of my father,

818
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,400
showing off with words

819
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,260
will make him think highly of you.

820
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,830
Aren't we brothers?

821
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,230
I'm not your brother.
