1
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,100
Our family runs a manufacturing business

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,870
sewing Barbie dresses.

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,630
Back then, he seemed to really enjoy

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,900
seeing those little dresses and gowns.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,430
His eyes would light up

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,000
and he'd hold them up in front of the mirror,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,330
comparing them like this.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,770
Could it be?

9
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,270
Back then,

10
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,600
before he left home,

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,200
he never touched me.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,370
I always thought

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,900
it was because I'd lost my charm,

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,830
that I wasn't attractive anymore.

15
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,970
I never imagined

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,970
it was his issue,

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,570
all his problem.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,300
I shouldn't say this.

19
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,070
But I think my dad

20
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,360
had been suppressing himself for a long time.

21
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,430
It's like the desire in his heart

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,370
suddenly

23
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,170
burst out.

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,230
When I walked into the store that day...

25
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,970
He goes by Mengmeng.

26
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:32,970
Come on, drink up!

27
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,770
Yesterday we only drank until after 5.

28
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,829
Cheers! Cheers!

29
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,030
So happy!

30
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,670
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

31
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,630
Mengmeng, over here, Mengmeng!

32
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,100
Mengmeng, this way!

33
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,730
I know.

34
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,130
I...

35
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,670
Mengmeng.

36
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,930
Mengmeng dancing

37
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,200
looks truly happy.

38
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,700
Why are these all spread out here?

39
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,000
Listen to me.

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,030
These are

41
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,970
from our store.

42
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,570
Every week...

43
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,470
they're used for special events.

44
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,000
Wearing women's clothes

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
gets you an extra 1,000.

46
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,700
On one hand...

47
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,930
I can earn more money,

48
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,600
and on the other hand,

49
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,200
it's kind of like

50
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,870
supporting our performance art.

51
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,130
Right.

52
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,200
Your life is performance art,

53
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,630
while my life is just a joke.

54
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,270
No,

55
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,230
what I mean is

56
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,200
I don't actually like wearing women's clothes,

57
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
and I'm not attracted to men either.

58
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,900
Okay,

59
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,170
you don't like it.

60
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,730
Mom,

61
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,430
I just want you to know

62
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,730
if one day you feel that you are,

63
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,730
I'll definitely support you.

64
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,570
Xueqing,

65
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,500
I want to apologize first.

66
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,070
Our family has wronged you.

67
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,330
Enough, Mom.

68
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,970
It's not what you think.

69
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,000
I just wanted to earn some extra money.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,730
Fine,

71
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,970
I won't go to work anymore. Dad,

72
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,270
I don't want these anymore. I don't want any of it.

73
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,930
Alright, okay.

74
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,070
Throw it all away.

75
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,400
Liying, help your father take these

76
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,570
and throw them all away.

77
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,630
Okay, I'll help you.

78
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll keep them for you for now.

79
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,900
I'm afraid you might want to wear them again someday.

80
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,770
Okay.

81
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,170
Dad, what are you doing?

82
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,670
Come here quickly.

83
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,230
Help me turn this off.

84
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,500
Turn it off?

85
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,870
It's off. Good.

86
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,100
I was just trying to dry a few clothes.

87
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,670
Why are they still so wet?

88
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,070
Oh my goodness! Dad, I'm here.

89
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,730
No.

90
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,300
The instructions here...

91
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Doesn't it have a drying function?

92
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,830
Yes, let me do it.

93
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,070
Go sit over there.

94
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,270
Is my bedsheet in there?

95
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,930
No, I'll handle it.

96
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,200
Okay. What's this?

97
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,000
We got it in last year's raffle.

98
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,000
When you were home,

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,060
it wasn't this one.

100
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

101
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,230
I'm not used to it.

102
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,930
Especially not used to

103
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,230
hearing you say

104
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,200
Dad.

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,870
I'll help you with this.

106
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,200
I'll help you with that.

107
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
It used to be

108
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,500
Dad,

109
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
can you help me with this?

110
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,270
Can you help me with that?

111
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,600
Did I?

112
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,430
Did I really talk like that before?

113
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,330
Liying.

114
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,970
These past few days,

115
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,430
you've all been working so hard.

116
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,300
Can you do me a favor?

117
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,830
Sure.

118
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,100
Dad, please don't sneak away again.

119
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,500
Hey.

120
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,430
Got it!

121
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, boss.

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,870
I'll be

123
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,530
done soon. Just wait a moment.

124
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,370
Boss.

125
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,970
Pink Girls,

126
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,500
Forever in Love.

127
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,130
Here.

128
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,000
What?

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,370
You can thank me.

130
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,170
You're lucky.

131
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,100
This one's worth collecting.

132
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,570
Someone just brought it in to sell.

133
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,270
I heard there's some kind of

134
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,200
farewell concert next week.

135
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,500
Concert?

136
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,700
The TV station is hosting it specially for them.

137
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,970
So...

138
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,430
are there any tickets left?

139
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,960
They're impossible to get.

140
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,100
Come on, boss.

141
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,570
Why did you have to tell me?

142
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,670
Couldn't you just let me be

143
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,230
a fan who knew nothing about it?

144
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,100
Why did you tell me?

145
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,170
This is...

146
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,800
What if I can't get tickets?

147
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,970
Alright.

148
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,300
Here's the event information.

149
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,170
I heard they're giving away tickets now.

150
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,500
So there's still a chance?

151
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,570
Maybe you'll get lucky.

152
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,770
Let's give it a try.

153
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,130
Pink Girls Memories Collection.

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,130
Boss, can I take a photo of this?

155
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,930
Don't peek.

156
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,870
Sister Peng cooked lighter food today.

157
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,070
That's good.

158
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,470
Less oil and salt is healthier these days.

159
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,430
Here, Dad.

160
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,600
Have some soup.

161
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,500
Dad,

162
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,730
can you go to that Singapore meeting for me?

163
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,200
You'll leave tomorrow.

164
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,800
Take good care of the elders there.

165
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,530
They'll be helpful to you in the future.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Whatever Dad asks me to do,

167
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,070
I'll handle it perfectly.

168
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,100
No, that...

169
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,130
that chicken processing plant.

170
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,860
How could I know they were using tainted chicken?

171
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,100
Dad, you know me.

172
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,400
I grew up in the food industry.

173
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,100
How could I possibly tamper with ingredients?

174
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,570
If I really did that,

175
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,670
how could I face Mom in heaven?

176
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,070
I'm full.

177
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,930
You can eat without me.

178
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,870
Dad's full from anger.

179
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,470
I bet you're

180
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,500
taking kickbacks from more than just the chicken factory.

181
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,300
Not tampering with food.

182
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,270
So taking kickbacks doesn't matter?

183
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,570
How clean are you?

184
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,300
You're behind what happened to Li Peizhen, aren't you?

185
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,030
You want to see me humiliated?

186
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,800
I'm at least cleaner than you.

187
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,270
Do you dare say that since joining the company

188
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,130
you haven't done anything shady?

189
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,500
Do you want me to help you

190
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,070
set up a kickback department?

191
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,070
No need.

192
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,030
I'm clean.

193
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,330
No need to set up a kickback department.

194
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,100
You're clean?

195
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,270
Yes.

196
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,430
That's funny.

197
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,630
What's so funny?

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I heard Lequan came by this morning.

199
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,070
Yes.

200
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
They're not satisfied with

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,530
the price Weikang negotiated

202
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,630
and want to raise the purchase price.

203
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,770
Lequan didn't follow

204
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,500
the company's normal procedure of signing contracts before supplying.

205
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,370
I'm a bit worried about this,

206
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,700
since we're the ones who need the chicken.

207
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,000
But I can understand their dissatisfaction.

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,770
Lequan stepped in to fill

209
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,270
our broken chicken supply chain,

210
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,470
yet Small Farm gets all the credit.

211
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,700
Now customer complaints about Small Farm

212
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,170
are getting out of control.

213
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,430
If we lose Lequan

214
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,100
at this point,

215
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,470
it would be worse than

216
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,000
when the tainted chicken scandal broke out,

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,530
much worse.

218
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,400
You're saying all this to remind me of

219
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Weikang's poor decision-making.

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,130
I approved everything he proposed.

221
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,230
Why don't you criticize me too?

222
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,570
Dad, that's not what I meant.

223
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,570
I just... Instead of trying to please me,

224
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,970
you should spend time solving the problem.

225
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,670
At least your brother was trying to help in an emergency.

226
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,770
All you know is how to kick someone

227
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,270
when they're down.

228
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,970
I... Fine. Go back to work.

229
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,830
The girl who likes you

230
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,370
Only I have the courage

231
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,130
Some say dating

232
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,400
and then falling in love

233
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,430
is all about timing

234
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,500
True love might not be you

235
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,200
But I want to be with you anyway

236
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,100
All evidence proves my heart is racing

237
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,900
Forever in love, loving endlessly

238
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,270
You like me too, right?

239
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,100
I'm Jinshan's biggest fan

240
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,970
I'm Jinshan's little fan

241
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,430
Applause and screams!

242
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,570
Forever in love

243
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,370
Forever in love

244
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,970
It doesn't have to be with you

245
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,770
Forever in love

246
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,530
Forever in love

247
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,830
It doesn't have to be with you

248
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,470
Timing is the most important

249
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,970
True love might not be you

250
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,030
But I want to be with you anyway

251
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,000
Jiang Zhihao, please!

252
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,300
Stop singing!

253
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,569
That's terrible. Come out here!

254
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,569
Who is it?

255
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,500
It's your mother, who else?

256
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,329
Your singing is awful. Come out now!

257
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,800
The neighbors will wonder what's happening

258
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,030
in our house.

259
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,670
Mom, I'm just practicing singing.

260
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,600
'Forever in Love,' you know?

261
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
You're not a fan,

262
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,330
so you can't recognize it.

263
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm begging you to stop singing.

264
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,970
You're insulting my idol like this.

265
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,900
Please come out now.

266
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,470
You didn't hit a single note correctly.

267
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,670
Hurry up!

268
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,470
Is it really that bad?

269
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,830
Let me tell you,

270
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,400
heaven is fair.

271
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,470
You

272
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,100
are already good-looking enough.

273
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,330
Don't be so greedy

274
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,070
wanting a good singing voice too.

275
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,170
Come out!

276
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,500
Go get the meat from the refrigerator.

277
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,700
Mom, this one?

278
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,130
Dad hasn't come back yet.

279
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,830
He said he's having dinner with friends.

280
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,700
Dad has friends?

281
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,270
He's probably gambling.

282
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,770
I think he's gambling too.

283
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,470
Want a drink?

284
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,500
I quit.

285
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,130
I can't believe this noodle shop is still open.

286
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,200
And

287
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,300
it still tastes just as good.

288
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,470
Some things

289
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,030
never change,

290
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,700
and they

291
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,230
never will.

292
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,270
I...

293
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,770
Listen, Lao Jiang.

294
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,170
I'm really sorry.

295
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,970
Shut up.

296
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,030
Hurry up and eat.

297
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,230
Eat more. Fill yourself up.

298
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,470
We're old friends.

299
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,970
How's Zhihao and the others doing?

300
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,600
They're fine.

301
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,670
I see.

302
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,570
What about you?

303
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,500
Are you doing okay?

304
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,000
Good, yeah.

305
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,930
Great.

306
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,900
Except I haven't gotten rich,

307
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
everything else is fine.

308
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,900
Thanks for bringing me back.

309
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,400
I hope I've been helpful.

310
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,230
If you need any help in Japan,

311
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,670
feel free to call me.

312
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,470
I still have some friends there.

313
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,770
I've always been curious about

314
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,430
the recording between me and Xiao Qian.

315
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,230
Where did it come from?

316
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,700
Maybe

317
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,800
some people just don't like my brother.

318
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,530
Help me follow this woman.

319
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,130
I need to know all her recent activities.

320
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,970
Brother Kang said

321
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,700
as long as you handle this well,

322
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,570
you'll get what you deserve.

323
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,070
Tomorrow is the only chance to replace the coating.

324
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,600
I'll take care of it for you.

325
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,460
He's ordered cheap materials before anyway.

326
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,400
When it's discovered, he'll just think he was cheated by the supplier.

327
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,330
He won't suspect someone set him up.

328
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Deputy Director Gao.

329
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,130
I believe in this

330
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,870
newly drafted contract

331
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,170
you can see Linlin's sincerity.

332
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,500
All relevant managers are here today

333
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,730
hoping that we can

334
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,930
finalize this contract

335
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,230
at this meeting.

336
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,800
Your sincerity

337
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,570
has moved our chairman.

338
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,170
He personally told me

339
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,130
that Linlin Breakfast is lucky to have talent like you.

340
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,730
How fortunate.

341
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,800
Vice President Gao.

342
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,170
Chairman. Chairman Deng.

343
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,670
Please sit.

344
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm just here to listen.

345
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,830
Please continue.

346
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,400
I'll sit here.

347
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,470
Alright.

348
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,970
Let's continue discussing

349
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,570
the procurement details.

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,630
Our procurement items

351
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,030
will remain the same

352
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,130
as before.

353
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,100
Hello everyone, I'm Paul.

354
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,030
This Linlin Breakfast shop near my home

355
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,170
I've heard their farm-to-table burger

356
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,270
is very famous.

357
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,070
It's now

358
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,270
6:45 in the morning

359
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,700
and people are already lining up.

360
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm afraid they'll be sold out by my turn.

361
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,330
Let's go check it out.

362
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,430
Excuse me,

363
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,870
do you still have the farm-to-table chicken burger?

364
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,700
Yes, I'll prepare it for you right away.

365
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,630
I'm so lucky! They still have some.

366
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
It's so juicy!

367
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,670
Not dry at all.

368
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,600
It's super delicious.

369
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,270
Everyone should come early.

370
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,500
This chicken burger is really tasty.

371
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,400
The ingredients are very fresh.

372
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,170
You should hurry and get one

373
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,230
okay?

374
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
It really is!

375
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,300
On a scale of one to ten,

376
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,500
how would you rate this chicken burger?

377
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,370
Ten is too low.

378
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,070
A hundred!

379
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,670
A hundred points!

380
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,400
A hundred, right? How did you know?

381
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,330
Of course. What about you?

382
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,070
I usually only fill up with 95,

383
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,930
but this is super delicious.

384
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,170
I would wake up early just for this burger.

385
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,530
Mainly because it's limited edition.

386
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,730
Everyone really needs to come early.

387
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,000
Thank you.

388
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,470
Here we go.

389
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,670
This is Doubidon.

390
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,570
Today I'm showing you this insanely popular chicken burger

391
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,200
that sells out before 8 AM.

392
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,470
This is the last one.

393
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,770
That's crazy! Let's try it quickly.

394
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,670
I'd like to take this opportunity

395
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,230
to apologize to everyone.

396
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,130
We've carefully selected

397
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,630
a premium chicken supplier.

398
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,870
Due to our strict quality control,

399
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,370
as you can imagine,

400
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,030
the quantity is truly limited.

401
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,670
We will extend the promotion period

402
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,800
with the hope

403
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,100
that every customer who loves Linlin Breakfast

404
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,330
can enjoy our delicious breakfast.

405
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,130
Come to my office.

406
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,570
I need to talk to you.

407
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,370
Now.

408
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,900
Or should we do it tomorrow?

409
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,370
You came up with the free-range chicken plan.

410
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,870
From what I know about you and Weikang,

411
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,300
Deng Weikang only does things

412
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,530
that Dad can see on the surface.

413
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,900
The Sunrise Store

414
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,170
wasn't it created the same way?

415
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,130
Don't worry.

416
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,000
I'll clean up this mess.

417
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,700
Unless you think Deng Weikang

418
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,730
is more qualified to be your boss.

419
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,430
Then go to him

420
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,170
and ask for his help.

421
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,670
No,

422
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,000
what I mean is,

423
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,230
go take the fall for him.

424
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,930
I'm different from Deng Weikang.

425
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,300
If you have the ability, I'll let you do it.

426
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,400
If something goes wrong with what I ask you to do,

427
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,570
I'll take responsibility for it.

428
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,270
Don't misunderstand me.

429
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,170
I'm not saying I'll protect you.

430
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm reminding you

431
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,800
it's important to follow the right person.

432
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,030
I've said what I needed to say.

433
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,830
You can go back to work now.

434
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,870
Hello everyone,

435
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,070
my name is Jiang Zhihao.

436
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,430
Today I'm here to submit an entry.

437
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,300
Pink Girl is a memory I share with my mom.

438
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,630
My moms all loved

439
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,800
the song 'Forever in Love.'

440
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,300
So today I want to perform

441
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,100
'Forever in Love.'

442
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,330
But since it's in a female key,

443
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,130
I can't reach those notes.

444
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,730
I've changed it to a male key.

445
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,770
Okay, thank you.

446
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,930
I'll start now.

447
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,770
Forever in love,

448
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,570
forever in love,

449
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,370
don't have to be with you.

450
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,170
Forever in love,

451
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,230
forever in love.

452
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,360
He's been tone-deaf since childhood.

453
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,660
He doesn't take after either of his moms.

454
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,270
You heard right,

455
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,830
he has two mothers.

456
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,070
They were once known as the Jinshan Pink Girls.

457
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,170
When he was two years old,

458
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,030
his birth mother passed away.

459
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,830
He was adopted by his mother's best friend

460
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,830
and lived a happy life.

461
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,630
But

462
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
there was inevitably some regret.

463
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,230
Fortunately, there's a videotape

464
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,700
that recorded his two mothers

465
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,600
performing 'Forever in Love.'

466
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,870
I think this isn't just Pink Girls'

467
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,330
precious memory,

468
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,730
but also the most precious memory

469
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,590
between him and his birth mother.

470
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,430
Here you go,

471
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,230
answer within three rings.

472
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,670
Some say love is just luck.

473
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,200
This acupressure point on the shoulder

474
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,830
can help you relax

475
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,570
and prevent headaches and stiff neck.

476
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,100
Don't you sometimes wake up with a stiff neck?

477
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,830
Mom,

478
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,670
what's wrong?

479
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,000
What happened?

480
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,900
Most people are silly when they're young

481
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,130
and then become normal as they grow up.

482
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:50,970
You're the opposite.

483
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,500
You were so well-behaved as a child.

484
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,230
Why did you turn out like this?

485
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,930
Pink Girl Concert

486
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,370
Mom,

487
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,730
dress up nicely this Saturday.

488
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,230
I'm taking you on a date.

489
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,570
Like mother, like son.

490
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,600
Good thing I take after you.

491
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,430
Do you like me too?

492
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,030
I like you.

493
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,370
Dad, get up.

494
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,830
Let me massage this acupressure point on your neck.

495
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,930
Press it when you're startled.

496
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,770
It prevents your neck from getting too stiff.

497
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,000
On Saturday, you'll need to

498
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,230
press it yourself too.

499
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,270
Really? I should dress nicely too.

500
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,800
Wear something pink.

501
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,700
Yeah.

502
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,770
Dad's been really busy lately.

503
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,830
His appetite doesn't seem very good.

504
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,870
I'm a bit worried about him.

505
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,790
You mean that chicken porridge from the market?

506
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,670
Okay, I'll go buy some tomorrow.

507
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,630
I've almost found a place.

508
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,430
Should be moving next week.

509
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,830
No need, I...

510
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,500
I don't have much luggage.

511
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,170
I can move by myself.

512
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,670
Alright, you...

513
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,200
Go ahead and have your meal.

514
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Okay.

515
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,070
Bye.

516
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,230
Food's almost ready.

517
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,700
We can eat soon.

518
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,000
Okay.

519
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,070
Zhang, Wang.

520
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,370
Boss, what brings you all here?

521
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,230
Boss,

522
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,530
we heard you were back.

523
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,600
So we thought we'd come by to see you.

524
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,370
Thank you.

525
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,000
Come in. Should we take off our shoes?

526
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,630
Come in and have a seat.

527
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,730
No, the floor's dirty.

528
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,930
It's fine, don't worry.

529
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,400
Please, sit down.

530
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,900
I guess none of you have eaten yet?

531
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,500
In that case,

532
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,670
stay for lunch.

533
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,470
We can all eat together.

534
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,700
That's too kind of you.

535
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,800
Lin Liying,

536
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,270
we'll have guests eating with us.

537
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,170
Boss, I can't believe you're really back!

538
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,530
It's wonderful to see your family reunited.

539
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,070
That's really great, ma'am.

540
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,270
We all just wanted to

541
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,630
come see you when we heard

542
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,830
the good news.

543
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,930
That's right.

544
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,430
With this news,

545
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,670
we should get together more often.

546
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,830
Right? Yes.

547
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,100
Have a meal,

548
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,870
drink a little...

549
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,270
Xueqing,

550
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,800
please bring out a bottle of kaoliang liquor.

551
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,290
Sister-in-law, long time no see.

552
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,070
Long time no see.

553
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,700
Sister-in-law,

554
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,930
it's been a while.

555
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,800
I didn't know you were coming for lunch.

556
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,870
Sorry for the trouble. We don't have enough food.

557
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,600
In that case,

558
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,070
I'll go make a few more dishes.

559
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,500
Please chat. Excuse me.

560
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,870
Thank you.

561
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,200
Sorry for the trouble.

562
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,000
So many people showing up at once.

563
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,230
Why couldn't you just tell them

564
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,270
there's no food in the fridge

565
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,800
and ask them to make an appointment next time?

566
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,670
Even if the fridge is empty and there's no food left,

567
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,100
we can't turn those visitors away.

568
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,030
We can't let them think

569
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,670
your father is avoiding them

570
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,130
and deliberately withholding their wages and severance pay.

571
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,700
We used to have Xiao Qian around.

572
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,200
Now he's in jail.

573
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,800
And your father is back.

574
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,270
You think those people really came here to eat?

575
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,570
What should we do then?

576
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't know what to do either.

577
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,770
Every debt has its debtor.

578
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,030
Your father owes them money.

579
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,300
That's the fact.

580
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,870
You can't escape from it.

581
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,400
Every debt has its debtor.

582
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,970
We can also demand back

583
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,670
what's rightfully ours.

584
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,100
Who is this person?

585
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,300
Why is she in our home?

586
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,600
Is she a fairy?

587
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,830
That's enough.

588
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,030
Mom, you look so beautiful today.

589
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,730
What do you mean? Am I not beautiful usually?

590
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,230
That's not what I meant.

591
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,930
You're more beautiful today than the Pink Sisters.

592
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,460
You're such a sweet talker.

593
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,400
Do you know when the weekend comes,

594
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,500
which day I like the most?

595
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,230
Which day?

596
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,900
Every day I'm with you.

597
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,670
That's so cheesy.

598
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,400
Have you seen my keys?

599
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,670
Your keys?

600
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,130
No, they're not here.

601
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,800
I love you to death.

602
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,570
You're so good at flirting.

603
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,230
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

604
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,690
Because I want to stay by your side every day.

605
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,000
Mom.

606
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,770
Have you ever been to a concert together?

607
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,700
How could we?

608
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,100
We were so busy back then.

609
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,070
And the beauty salon was in Jinshan,

610
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,430
so far away.

611
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,230
And we were so poor back then.

612
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,600
That's impossible.

613
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,560
It doesn't matter.

614
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,500
Today your son will take you.

615
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,170
Yes, my son is so good.

616
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,100
How can he be so nice?

617
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,600
Am I better than your daughter?

618
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,860
What are you... what's your problem?

619
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,370
You should love me more.

620
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,170
Don't I love you enough?

621
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,469
You...

622
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,870
Have you no conscience?

623
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,000
Hello, welcome.

624
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,570
Please come in.

625
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,100
Hello, this way please.

626
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,170
Thank you.

627
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,630
Hello. Hi.

628
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,199
Hello.

629
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,699
You're the one who sent in the submission, right?

630
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,730
And this is?

631
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,000
This is my mom.

632
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,730
Hello.

633
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,570
Hello.

634
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,630
The Pink Girl from Jinshan, right?

635
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,130
It's really touching.

636
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
It was many years ago.

637
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,730
I looked more like it back then.

638
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,370
Here, this letter is for you.

639
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,070
It's really well written.

640
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,530
Welcome.

641
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,860
Your seats are this way.

642
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,100
Mom, let's go.

643
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,530
This way please.

644
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,970
The Pink Sisters.

645
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,230
Pink Girl.

646
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,170
Actually, when we were working before

647
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,830
there was a no-dating policy.

648
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,770
So

649
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,430
I

650
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,230
accidentally had

651
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,300
a secret little romance.

652
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,400
One day, the boss called us to the office

653
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,170
and was about to scold me.

654
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,630
That's when she came out

655
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,100
and to save me,

656
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,430
she deliberately made a phone call in front of the boss.

657
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,830
Remember?

658
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,600
Of course I remember.

659
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,300
The boss angrily said to her,

660
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,500
'I'm trying to discipline someone here.

661
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,300
Why are you making a call?'

662
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,600
Then I immediately jumped in and said,

663
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,100
'She's obviously calling her boyfriend!'

664
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,770
When I think back to that moment now,

665
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,300
I still feel

666
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,370
it's so unforgettable.

667
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,230
Because our hit song was about dating,

668
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,600
so we definitely had to be in relationships!

669
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,770
That's right.

670
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,730
We have to keep dating, right?

671
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,930
Yes.

672
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,370
Now let's listen to

673
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,530
what once dominated the music charts:

674
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,370
'Forever in Love.'

675
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,200
Calling you,

676
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,900
you pick up within three rings.

677
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,830
A chance meeting at the coffee shop,

678
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,270
they say love is all about luck.

679
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,070
The late night radio

680
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,370
plays our special song.

681
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,570
All the evidence proves my heart is racing.

682
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,230
Forever in love, loving non-stop.

683
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,530
You like me too, don't you?

684
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,030
I like you.

685
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,700
Don't suppress the secrets in your heart.

686
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,630
It's not too late to say it now.

687
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,170
Please don't turn this story into a sad one.

688
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,000
Forever in love,

689
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,830
forever in love,

690
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,470
it doesn't have to be with you.

691
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,270
Forever in love,

692
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,100
forever in love,

693
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,070
it doesn't have to be with you.

694
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,470
The girl who likes you,

695
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,230
only I have the courage to say it.

696
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,630
Some say the most important thing in love

697
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,400
is timing.

698
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,330
True love might not be you,

699
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,800
but when dating, I just want to be with you.

700
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,730
All the evidence proves my heart is racing.

701
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,400
Forever in love, loving non-stop.

702
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,600
Do you like me too?

703
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,100
I like you.

704
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,470
You like me too, right?

705
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,270
Forever in love,

706
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,070
forever in love,

707
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,670
forever in love,

708
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,530
forever in love,

709
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,330
forever in love,

710
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,630
forever in love.

711
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,900
I can't believe this is our last performance together.

712
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,270
Thank you,

713
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,470
my best friend.

714
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,170
I'm also very grateful for your companionship during this time.

715
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,630
When did you find the apartment?

716
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,800
I've been looking for a while.

717
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,430
Just thought it might be nice

718
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,670
to try living on my own.

719
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,070
The chicken congee tastes pretty good.

720
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,400
I'll buy more tomorrow.

721
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,170
The room at home is just sitting empty anyway.

722
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,370
Living outside is too far from the office.

723
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,030
You might as well stay at home.

724
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,070
I'm heading out first.

725
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,630
Where are you going? Weren't you going to order food?

726
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:26,970
Excuse me,

727
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,430
I'd like to order

728
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,470
a Linlin signature egg toast.

729
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,530
Linlin signature egg toast.

730
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
The chicken for the Farm Chicken Burger

731
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,370
can't be kept overnight. We need to sell it first.

732
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,300
Don't you understand Chinese?

733
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,870
Would you like to try it?

734
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,200
It's limited edition.

735
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:45,930
Sure.

736
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,570
I can give it a try.

737
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,730
Can't you make your own decisions?

738
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,930
You just order whatever he tells you to.

739
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,330
Are you yelling at customers?

740
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,190
What's wrong if he wants to try it?

741
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,300
He can order whatever he wants.

742
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,900
Forcing people to order your unsold items?

743
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,630
And it tastes terrible anyway.

744
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,630
I've put up with you for too long.

745
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,670
You're just a student worker acting like you own the place.

746
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,500
What's going on?

747
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,370
What's the problem here?

748
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,470
What?

749
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,400
Have you decided what to eat?

750
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,970
Time is precious. I'll start making it for you.

751
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,970
I...

752
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,970
I'm not eating anymore.

753
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,170
Go ahead, try something.

754
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,070
Get lost!

755
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,170
Can I quit? Is that okay?

756
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,270
Sure.

757
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,170
Xiaojun,

758
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,170
help him get his bag.

759
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,070
So you're quitting?

760
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,730
Get out of here!

761
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,630
If you and this girl

762
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,000
have your own little world together,

763
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,530
then she probably likes you.

764
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,170
Haven't you ever thought about

765
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,470
that you, Deng Weiyu,

766
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,470
could lead the entire Linlin Group?

767
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,870
I must seem ridiculous in your eyes.

768
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,430
I know very well

769
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,000
which friends I should keep

770
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,370
and which I shouldn't.

771
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,570
I'm sending you something to look at.

772
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,770
At fifteen, hanging around street markets,

773
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,230
claiming he could crush the universe with his left hand.

774
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,070
The mastermind is Deng Weikang.

775
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:51,770
He's not dead.

776
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,400
So it has no news value, is that it?

777
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,800
Don't spread rumors without evidence.
