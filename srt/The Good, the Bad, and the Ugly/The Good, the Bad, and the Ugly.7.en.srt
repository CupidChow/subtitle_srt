1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,400
Mango.

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,770
30 yuan.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,600
Put it on my tab.

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,900
Thanks, but I can't.

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,090
Lin Liying.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,700
Thanks.

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,730
I took my mom to Pink Girls' concert.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,100
She was so happy.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,170
Is it that obvious?

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,700
Just come to my place.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,070
Look at the homework you did for me.

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,270
Then I knew.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
I have a friend.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,270
He's been tone-deaf since childhood.

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,900
He really loves 'Forever in Love'...

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,100
Alright, enough.

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,170
My writing is pretty good.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,770
Anyway,

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,000
you mind my business,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,800
I mind yours.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,700
OK?

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,330
But I still think

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,270
I mind your business more often.

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,130
Wait a second.

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,730
There's something on your face.

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,500
What?

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,370
Liying.

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,170
Excuse me.

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:20,870
I forgot to tell you.

30
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,200
Your dad is back, right?

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,970
That's nice. Family reunion.

32
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,030
Carry on.

33
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,970
Hello.

34
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,400
Hello. Do you have an appointment?

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,329
No. I'm looking for Mr. Deng Weiyu.

36
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,329
Mr. Deng Weiyu.

37
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,100
You might need to wait a moment.

38
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,770
Hey, Amy.

39
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,900
Has my package arrived?

40
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,300
This is Mr. Deng.

41
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,900
Um, senior.

42
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,200
I... we've met before.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,570
I'm Lin Liying.

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,370
So you want my brother to take responsibility for what happened to your family?

45
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,070
Why does he bully people like this?

46
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,330
Just because Linlin Breakfast Shop is rich and powerful?

47
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,770
Of course not.

48
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,930
You're Jiang Zhihao's friend.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,670
I believe you must have a sense of justice too.

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,370
Perhaps

51
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,230
you can tell me what to do.

52
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,730
Isn't that good?

53
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,530
But coming to me won't help.

54
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,670
Why?

55
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,600
Are you on Deng Weikang's side?

56
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,470
I'll arrange for you

57
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,330
to meet someone who can solve the problem.

58
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,430
I just wanted to develop a regular basketball routine.

59
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,170
Yet it gave someone an opportunity to take advantage.

60
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,700
Looks like I need to change my practice court.

61
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,370
Let her in.

62
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,430
The toxic toy incident.

63
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,570
The culprit was an inside thief from your toy factory.

64
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,070
Linlin Breakfast was also a victim.

65
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,330
I heard you want me to take responsibility.

66
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,270
Because Deng Weikang is behind it all.

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
Don't make accusations without evidence.

68
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,870
I deeply sympathize with your family's situation.

69
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,300
After all, I also started from nothing.

70
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
Working hard to get where I am today.

71
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,100
How about this.

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,170
In my personal capacity,

73
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,970
I'll sponsor your family with funds to start over.

74
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,500
How much?

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,370
Just tell my assistant.

76
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,770
Isn't that enough?

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,100
An apology.

78
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,430
What I want is an apology.

79
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,600
Money is fine.

80
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,700
An apology is impossible.

81
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,730
Is it so hard to apologize?

82
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,060
Shouldn't you apologize when you've done something wrong?

83
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,670
There's no right or wrong in this matter.

84
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,200
But if I apologize,

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,100
it means I'm wrong.

86
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,830
I'm done playing.

87
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,270
Zijing, pack up.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,330
After working with Deng Weikang for so many years

89
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,100
we've actually grown more distant over time.

90
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,830
He doesn't care how much our costs have increased.

91
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,200
Thanks to you this time,

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,530
we can take advantage of his troubles

93
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,670
to adjust our contract.

94
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,200
Contracts should evolve with the times anyway.

95
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,570
Being able to maintain a healthy partnership

96
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,500
with your company Lequan

97
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,100
is the right path, isn't it?

98
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,570
As business people,

99
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,470
we need to have a long-term vision.

100
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,470
Here's to you.

101
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,200
To a successful partnership.

102
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,860
To a successful partnership.

103
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,700
Deputy Director, your car is here.

104
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,300
You know I just threw up in the bathroom,

105
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,400
but I cleaned up thoroughly.

106
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,230
How is it your alcohol tolerance hasn't improved at all?

107
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,900
With such poor tolerance, you still dare to ask me for another round.

108
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,500
Because you asked me to come.

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
Actually,

110
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,500
you've known about

111
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
my relationship with Weikang all along, haven't you?

112
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,570
So,

113
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,800
every time I chatted with you,

114
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,530
you knew I was trying to get information from you.

115
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,130
I must have seemed ridiculous to you.

116
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,700
You were blinded by love.

117
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,230
You're too emotional.

118
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,570
Unlike me.

119
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,670
I prioritize benefits.

120
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,270
Benefits.

121
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,570
Money.

122
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,700
Just throw money at me.

123
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,930
Buy this business

124
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,700
and we can turn the page on all this.

125
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,730
Do you really need more money?

126
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,630
I do. The more the better.

127
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,500
That's alcohol.

128
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,570
Stop drinking.

129
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,570
Drink water.

130
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,300
You don't know that everyone calls me 'Clear-headed Deng.'

131
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,700
I know exactly which friends

132
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,570
I should and shouldn't make,

133
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,900
I'm very clear about that.

134
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,570
Let me tell you,

135
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,300
I resigned today.

136
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm going back to work at my mother's company.

137
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,430
In the future,

138
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,830
we should still go out drinking like this.

139
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,470
I need a drinking buddy.

140
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,500
Of course.

141
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,870
Where's my glass?

142
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,800
No, are you sure?

143
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,630
I'm sure. Are you sure?

144
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,370
Fill it up for me.

145
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,800
You asked for it.

146
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,200
Here.

147
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,470
Keep drinking.

148
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,000
Drink it all.

149
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,000
Besides successfully retaining Lequan.

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,970
The Farm Chicken Burger

151
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,600
has also cleared the stigma of hunger marketing,

152
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,300
and even boosted the entire March performance,

153
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,430
making last month's revenue reach a historic high.

154
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,200
Thank you all for working hard with me,

155
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
turning crisis into opportunity.

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,870
Yes!

157
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,770
Amazing results!

158
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,630
Very good.

159
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,100
Weijie.

160
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,770
Yes,

161
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,230
all the progress and reports

162
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,960
need to be properly organized.

163
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,600
When the Deputy General Manager returns,

164
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,460
we'll give him a thorough report.

165
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,630
Alright,

166
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,970
thank you all for your hard work.

167
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,830
Tonight,

168
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,800
everyone pick a nice restaurant,

169
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,130
the company's treat.

170
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,830
Thank you, Chairman.

171
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,930
It's on the Deputy GM.

172
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,170
Thank you, Deputy GM. Thanks to our absent Deputy GM.

173
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,530
Thank you, Deputy GM.

174
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,530
Dad, Weiyu.

175
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,700
Sit down.

176
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,200
Since returning from Japan,

177
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
you've been at the company for quite a while.

178
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
Do you have any thoughts about your future?

179
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,930
I might continue working with the Deputy GM and Director

180
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,000
to gain more experience

181
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,500
and see how I can help in the future.

182
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,890
Is that really what you think?

183
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,970
Haven't you ever thought

184
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,600
that one day

185
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,400
you, Deng Weiyu,

186
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,570
might lead the entire Linlin Group?

187
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,570
People with ambition

188
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,800
are the ones who build successful careers.

189
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,900
Those who seek comfort

190
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,960
will never rise above their station.

191
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,900
If I give you an opportunity to prove yourself

192
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,400
by managing...

193
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,930
the Linlin flagship store,

194
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,730
do you think you're up to the task?

195
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,170
What should I do? Should I answer it?

196
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,500
If you don't answer,

197
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,630
he'll think you're incompetent.

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,530
Fine, I'll answer it.

199
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,400
If you answer,

200
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,430
you'll be just another Deng Weijie.

201
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,430
So what should I do?

202
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,630
He wants you to show ambition.

203
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,100
So show him your ambition.

204
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
But don't follow his script.

205
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,730
Because he already knows the plot.

206
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,330
No matter how well you act,

207
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,900
to him it's just icing on the cake.

208
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
You need to play a character

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,370
that he can't figure out,

210
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,130
yet can't help but admire.

211
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,070
Keep talking.

212
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,470
That's not playing fair.

213
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,730
Answer it.

214
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,270
But it's not the flagship store.

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,170
Excuse me,

216
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,200
don't you open at six?

217
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,530
No matter what you order, you have to wait.

218
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,030
Write it yourself.

219
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,330
Don't you have digital ordering now?

220
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,800
I don't know how to use it.

221
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,430
Thank you.

222
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,730
Um...

223
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,970
I'm sorry,

224
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,030
I ordered black tea.

225
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,500
The black tea is over there.

226
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,670
It'll take an hour to brew a new pot.

227
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,800
Do you want to wait?

228
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,800
Yes or no?

229
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,200
I'll pass for now. Thanks.

230
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,230
Morning.

231
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,600
Morning.

232
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,100
You're late again.

233
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,329
Heroes always arrive fashionably late.

234
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,829
Besides, I'm not the last one.

235
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,270
Fatty isn't here yet.

236
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,500
What's this?

237
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,930
Mind your own business.

238
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,329
Is he drinking soy milk?

239
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,130
It's not expired, so I can drink it. What's the problem?

240
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,700
If it's not expired, we should recycle it.

241
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,400
Otherwise what are we going to drink?

242
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,730
Couldn't you have said that earlier?

243
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,900
All muscles, no brains.

244
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,830
You chicken-brain.

245
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,570
Go wipe it clean.

246
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,500
Make sure it's clean.

247
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,100
Or Ah Fei will scold us later.

248
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,670
I'd like a

249
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,000
peanut ham and egg sandwich.

250
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,230
Okay, coming right up.

251
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,300
With a black tea.

252
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,500
Okay.

253
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,030
What's 'dragon and phoenix'?

254
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,470
Ham and egg.

255
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,500
It's a combo.

256
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,230
How many times do I have to tell you? Why are you so stupid?

257
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,800
Jiang Zhihao, let me tell you.

258
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,570
If this happens again tomorrow,

259
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,970
I'm done with this job.

260
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,930
Don't worry,

261
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,430
there won't be a tomorrow.

262
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,700
What do you mean?

263
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,530
Hello, dear friends.

264
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,670
I'll be taking a few months off.

265
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,970
Thank you all for your support.

266
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,000
Today I've prepared 10 different dishes

267
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,270
for you to choose from.

268
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,130
No discount for bulk purchases.

269
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,100
Ma'am, yours is ready.

270
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,170
Two of them.

271
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,200
Thank you.

272
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,030
It's a thank-you sale.

273
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,230
50 each.

274
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,100
Take your pick.

275
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,170
Okay.

276
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,200
Jiang Zhihao,

277
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,600
what do you mean?

278
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,830
You're quitting?

279
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,900
Without discussing it with me first?

280
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,270
Thank-you sale!

281
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,270
50 dollars each.

282
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,970
Take a look.

283
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,570
Lots of options today.

284
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,930
Aren't you going to explain?

285
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,930
Did you see Mrs. Chen's expression?

286
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,270
She was so sad.

287
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,530
I'm telling you, I'm going to sell frozen food packages.

288
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll make a fortune.

289
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Don't worry,

290
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,570
you'll still get your red envelope.

291
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,600
It's only 200 every year.

292
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
You think I care?

293
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,730
Fine, don't take it then.

294
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,930
I'll save some money.

295
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,970
Jiang Zhihao,

296
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
you're not going to be like five years ago,

297
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,200
being a useless freeloader,

298
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,270
a zombie, are you?

299
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,270
I'm begging you, don't do this to me.

300
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,930
If Mom and Dad find out,

301
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,600
Mom will go crazy.

302
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,930
She'll ask me every day,

303
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,100
'What should we do about Zhihao?'

304
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,500
'Can you help figure something out?'

305
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,400
And Dad will say,

306
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,530
'Zhihao can't go on like this.'

307
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,570
Those two will drive me crazy.

308
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,600
I'm already exhausted every day.

309
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,370
I work at a hotel

310
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,270
and help you with your job too.

311
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,230
Stop nagging.

312
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,160
I've put up with you for a long time.

313
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,200
A talented young man like me

314
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,370
needs to move up in society, I'm telling you.

315
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,330
What exactly do you want?

316
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,530
Just tell me.

317
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,000
Jiang Zhilu,

318
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,600
did you call me here just to watch you two fight?

319
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,230
He's closing the breakfast shop.

320
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,690
Help me get severance pay.

321
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,270
I'll take 20 percent.

322
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,330
Deal.

323
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,130
Why are you closing?

324
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,170
Of course I have my plans.

325
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,330
What about you?

326
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,330
Didn't you go to see Deng Yongkuan?

327
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,500
What happened?

328
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,000
He just wanted to solve it with money.

329
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,300
He didn't even apologize once.

330
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,870
That's too much.

331
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,370
When I first found out

332
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,130
that Deng Weikang was behind it all,

333
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,300
I also thought about making a big deal out of it,

334
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,930
blowing it up even more.

335
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,900
But I quickly abandoned that idea.

336
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,800
Do you know why?

337
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,230
Because I thought when we meet again,

338
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,560
it would definitely be very interesting.

339
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,830
So,

340
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,670
don't be so boring anymore.

341
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,770
I'm boring?

342
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,770
Yes.

343
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,230
Let me tell you,

344
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,800
the way rich people think

345
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,900
is something ordinary people like us don't understand.

346
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,430
If you want to fight against him,

347
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,900
you need to be creative.

348
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,900
Do you understand what unique means?

349
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,370
You understand unique?

350
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,770
I'm the definition of unique.

351
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,100
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

352
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,170
I won't let him get away with this so easily.

353
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,370
Let me send you something.

354
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,630
Check it.

355
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,970
Did you get it?

356
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,370
Girls do this when they like you.

357
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,570
If you and this girl

358
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,630
have your own little world,

359
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,170
maybe a boring park or department store.

360
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,730
Or the aquarium.

361
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,330
Then she probably likes you.

362
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,100
Hello everyone.

363
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm your dating coach... Oops, wrong file.

364
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
That was what Niu Yifei was watching.

365
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,570
Not mine.

366
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,230
I'll send you another one.

367
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,370
I've sent it to you again.

368
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,930
Take a look.

369
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,930
Remember, be unique.

370
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,870
It was my mistake when I helped Deng Weikang

371
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,870
and Linlin's breakfast shop.

372
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,600
Because of my ignorance,

373
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,870
I caused a toy factory to go bankrupt.

374
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,700
I know time cannot be reversed.

375
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,930
But I still hope to bring justice

376
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,970
to those who were hurt.

377
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,730
Dad's not home.

378
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,730
He said a friend recommended a job to him,

379
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,670
so he went to meet the boss.

380
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,570
He might start working tonight.

381
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,130
What job is so urgent?

382
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,700
He's getting old.

383
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,570
I hope it's not some physically demanding job.

384
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,130
I think it's something in logistics,

385
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,370
produce or something,

386
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,170
working the night shift.

387
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:12,770
I don't really know.

388
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,500
Anyway, he understands

389
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,070
that he's getting older

390
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,670
and finding a job is difficult,

391
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,430
so he took it as soon as he could.

392
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,430
He just got back.

393
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,630
He should rest for a week or two.

394
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,270
Why such a hurry?

395
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,730
What else can we do?

396
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,070
Creditors are already at our door.

397
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,200
In today's society,

398
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,930
people who've made mistakes don't get a chance to rest.

399
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,130
Excuse me.

400
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,190
Excuse me, just checking something.

401
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,770
I told you to hold it properly.

402
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,930
Why are you leaning on it?

403
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,170
Hold it properly. Don't be lazy. Okay.

404
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,270
What the hell?

405
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,930
Hold this.

406
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,390
I'm going to the bathroom.

407
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,370
Hold it properly.

408
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,470
Okay.

409
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,730
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,330
Are you even sleeping at all?

411
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,200
You still have to work the night shift at the produce logistics center

412
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,130
and hand out flyers in the morning.

413
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,070
I did sleep a little,

414
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,630
but I have no choice.

415
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,900
Do you think I want to be like this?

416
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,160
Then don't work the night shift anymore.

417
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,430
Is there anything else you'd like to do?

418
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,290
I can help you look for something.

419
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,400
I do.

420
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,600
I still want to be a boss.

421
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,170
Are you being serious?

422
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,700
Look at your situation now.

423
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,600
Although I occasionally

424
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,300
cut corners at the company.

425
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,130
Saving wherever possible.

426
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,270
But when it came to employee benefits,

427
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,770
holiday bonuses,

428
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,600
year-end bonuses,

429
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,670
maternity leave,

430
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,800
and overtime pay, I provided them all.

431
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,470
I never

432
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,300
pulled rank as a boss

433
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,230
to make employees buy me drinks.

434
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,930
I...

435
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,970
I may not be a good businessman,

436
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,430
but I think I was a decent boss.

437
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,970
Whether you can get the toy factory back,

438
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,370
I don't know.

439
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,930
But the money they owe you,

440
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,590
I will definitely get it back.

441
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,730
I'll make the Deng family apologize.

442
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,000
Let everyone know you were a good boss.

443
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,330
Just focus on being a good boss, that's all.

444
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,200
By the way.

445
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,170
Don't you have cleaning work this afternoon?

446
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,170
You should go now.

447
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm leaving.

448
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,130
Don't get scolded again.

449
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,570
I know.

450
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,230
Take care of yourself.

451
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,700
Senior.

452
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,430
Did you receive

453
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,900
what I sent you?

454
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,130
Yes, I did.

455
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,230
But this really doesn't have any news value.

456
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,170
Deng Weikang and that woman called what's her name...

457
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,500
Li Peizhen.

458
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,100
My supervisor says

459
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,730
they're not newsworthy people.

460
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,130
Nobody knows who they are.

461
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,070
Besides, that toxic toy

462
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,170
was never even on the market.

463
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,430
If someone had been hospitalized because of it,

464
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,930
then it might have some appeal.

465
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,070
We might be more interested then.

466
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,300
My dad's factory went bankrupt!

467
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,170
He's been hiding

468
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,470
for years because of this.

469
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,500
What is it? Is...

470
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,700
So if nobody died,

471
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,930
there's no news value, is that it?

472
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,930
Liying, I know what happened to your family,

473
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,800
but I really have some things...

474
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,030
How can you still be

475
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,490
so calm when talking to me?

476
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,470
Senior, I'm sorry.

477
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,300
I didn't mean...

478
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,700
I wasn't targeting you.

479
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,300
I suggest you help yourself.

480
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,200
There are some methods

481
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,670
that might be more useful than traditional media like us.

482
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,070
If you're interested,

483
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,470
I can tell you about them.

484
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,600
How am I supposed to help myself?

485
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,530
Weikang, come on!

486
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,570
I'll do it!

487
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,470
This is very hot.

488
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,570
Dangerous, Sister Peng.

489
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,570
It's okay, I'll handle this.

490
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,930
What if you get burned?

491
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,530
It's hot!

492
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,600
Careful!

493
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,930
This soup smells amazing.

494
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,000
Sister Peng, I brought

495
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,130
you a gift from Singapore.

496
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,700
You've been wearing this apron for a long time.

497
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,070
I bought you a new one.

498
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,730
You didn't have to.

499
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You take care of this home and Dad.

500
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,400
You work so hard.

501
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,100
Don't worry about getting it dirty.

502
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,070
Okay, thank you.

503
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,700
I'll fold it for you.

504
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Dad.

505
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,570
Dad.

506
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,770
No way.

507
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,270
What's going on with Deng Weiyu?

508
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,930
Didn't we agree to have dinner?

509
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,790
Have some sense of time, will you?

510
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,270
Sorry.

511
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,270
You're early!

512
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,100
I was working overtime.

513
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,370
Come, let's eat.

514
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,470
Weiyu will be transferred to be the manager of the Richu store.

515
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,500
The Richu store.

516
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,370
That branch with only a two-star rating.

517
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,670
That's the one.

518
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,600
The image store that gives ex-convicts a second chance at employment.

519
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,830
Dad, we previously let ex-convicts work at Richu

520
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,900
just to improve our social image.

521
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,200
I won't even mention those thugs

522
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,830
and what they've done to the store.

523
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,830
We've been doing this for years.

524
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,670
Now the lease is expiring.

525
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,500
After we close the store,

526
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,630
how will we reassign those employees?

527
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,400
Those who should leave will leave.

528
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,200
Those who should stay will stay.

529
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,400
About the follow-up with Lequan and Xiaonong,

530
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,900
let Weikang know,

531
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,130
he'll follow up on it.

532
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,330
No rush.

533
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,830
I've been keeping track of the company's progress while in Singapore.

534
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,430
Thank you for your hard work.

535
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,270
What are you working on?

536
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,030
Just looking through some documents.

537
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,630
Richu Store,

538
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,270
need any help with it?

539
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,670
I don't think so.

540
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,230
I wanted to tell you that

541
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,600
whether someone gets fired by me, transferred to another department,

542
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,130
or leaves voluntarily,

543
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,860
I always organize a farewell party for everyone.

544
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,630
Do you know why?

545
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,170
Because maybe

546
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,770
they're just not suitable for their current position,

547
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,770
but could shine somewhere else.

548
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,070
The farewell party is just an early congratulation

549
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,530
for them becoming more valuable elsewhere.

550
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,200
Then I won't organize one for you.

551
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,230
You're only going for a few months anyway,

552
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,370
so let's just call it a vacation.

553
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,130
You'll come back to the company someday, right?

554
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,870
By the way.

555
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,670
Remember,

556
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,730
it's important to follow the right person.

557
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,270
You know?

558
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,800
Hello.

559
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,130
Hi,

560
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,530
there's a 30-minute wait. Are you staying?

561
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,800
Thirty...

562
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,770
Is the meat still edible?

563
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,130
You think a two-star rating is too high, don't you?

564
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,730
Why can't it be eaten?

565
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,330
I'm the assistant manager. Don't I know better?

566
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,170
Just pour the sauce on it and it'll taste good.

567
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,070
You weren't at the grill just now,

568
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,930
that's why I thought I'd help out.

569
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,530
You won't restock when the boxes run out?

570
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,690
Just say if you were sneaking a smoke.

571
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,030
Half of them are sugar-free.

572
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,230
Did you even check properly?

573
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,570
I've packed them all.

574
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,970
It doesn't matter.

575
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,900
They'll drink whatever they get. I'm...

576
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,130
Ms. Lin who ordered ten meals.

577
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,930
Wait a moment.

578
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,330
Can't you see we're busy?

579
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,600
You just told me

580
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,730
I'd definitely get it before 9:30...

581
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,770
We just had a power outage in this area.

582
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,270
If you can't handle orders, don't take them!

583
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,300
I have a meeting right now.

584
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,470
My boss is waiting.

585
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,130
I told you to wait.

586
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,500
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

587
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,730
What kind of attitude is this?

588
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,130
Fine! Anyone can shout!

589
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,900
Ms. Lin, I'm sorry.

590
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,400
Don't worry, I'll have it ready before 10:30...

591
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,770
before 9:30, I promise.

592
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,700
Okay?

593
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,330
Dayong,

594
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,730
please be at the grill station on time.

595
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,730
Don't worry. Whatever you need, just call out.

596
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,830
Feel free to shout.

597
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,570
Afei!

598
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,370
Please count how many drinks we still need,

599
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,370
separate the sweetened and unsweetened ones.

600
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,030
Thank you.

601
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,170
Xiaojun, come here.

602
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,230
Help me assemble these meals.

603
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,600
Let's finish this order first.

604
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,670
Who are you?

605
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,530
I'm sent by headquarters.

606
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,830
Four farm chicken burgers,

607
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,870
three cheese thick beef burgers,

608
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,970
three pork loin egg toasts,

609
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,900
five half-sugar and five sugar-free teas.

610
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,870
OK,

611
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,170
let's get moving!

612
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,200
Xiaojun, are you good?

613
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,970
Yes.

614
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,170
Dayong, I need bacon over here.

615
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,900
Alright.

616
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,400
Bacon?

617
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,530
Yes, two slices.

618
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,000
Is this bread still good?

619
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,930
It's fine to use.

620
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,230
Dayong, we need eggs over here.

621
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,330
Okay.

622
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,470
Do we have enough drinks?

623
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,470
Yes, enough.

624
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,100
Ms. Lin,

625
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,130
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

626
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,400
Here are your ten breakfast meals.

627
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,600
I've put all the drinks at the bottom.

628
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,730
And I'm giving you three orders of fries and chicken nuggets on the house.

629
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,260
Remember to give us five...

630
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,230
five stars, okay?

631
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,170
Bye-bye.

632
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,170
Hey, young man from headquarters.

633
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,000
Thanks!

634
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Let me treat you to breakfast later.

635
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,230
No need.

636
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,370
Were you just passing by?

637
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,030
Yeah.

638
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,290
I saw you were quite impressive just now.

639
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,300
Actually...

640
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,230
Actually, I'm the new store manager.

641
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,000
My name is Deng Weiyu.

642
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,130
Nice to meet you all.

643
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,530
Manager.

644
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,429
Next,

645
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,360
are we going to have the cliché self-introductions?

646
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,770
Sure.

647
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,900
Manager,

648
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,030
you know that people who can work at Richu Store

649
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,560
all need to have some special talents, right?

650
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,890
You just said your name is Deng Weiyu.

651
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,370
Yes,

652
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,500
hello everyone.

653
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,570
Aren't you the chairman's son?

654
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,900
What are you doing here?

655
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,800
What's your deal?

656
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,200
Just got out of prison?

657
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,270
You don't look like it.

658
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,730
Quite handsome actually.

659
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,300
Didn't we just say we'd do self-introductions?

660
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,700
I have some information about you all here.

661
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,900
So,

662
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,670
let's take a look.

663
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,330
Zhao Dongcheng - Afei

664
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,700
Fraud. 2 years and 6 months.

665
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,130
College graduate.

666
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,170
You worked as a male model at a club.

667
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,800
That's him!

668
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,500
He scammed me out of 5 million

669
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,000
and used it to support other women.

670
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Stop right there!

671
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,300
Catch him!

672
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,370
Don't run!

673
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,630
I told you not to run!

674
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,470
Scammer!

675
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,500
Don't run!

676
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,530
I said don't run!

677
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,000
Let me go!

678
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,500
Sun Jun.

679
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:19,800
Jun.

680
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,430
You have a lot of food service experience.

681
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,530
BBQ, convenience store,

682
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,200
noodle shop, restaurant,

683
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,670
beverage shop.

684
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,000
You were even an idol trainee.

685
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,170
Sir!

686
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,330
Sir!

687
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,130
I was just borrowing it, sir!

688
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,330
I'll pay you back later! That's robbery!

689
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,970
Don't run! Sir!

690
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,800
Luo Dayong.

691
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,300
Born in 1995.

692
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,700
You're the same age as me.

693
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,260
Anyone who dares to touch my people...

694
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,470
I'll break your arms and legs!

695
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,170
What's going on?

696
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,030
Nothing, just...

697
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,030
Later...

698
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,170
Don't be so fierce.

699
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,100
Anyway,

700
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,930
nice to meet you all.

701
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,570
As the assistant manager, I hope

702
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,530
I can learn from all of you.

703
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,300
Deng Weiyu,

704
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,100
I'll be right there to help you.

705
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,930
[Transform]

706
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,030
I am the great hero,

707
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,470
Jiang Zhihao.

708
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,470
I've been a hero since I was little.

709
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,570
You're not seeing things.

710
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,130
After growing up,

711
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,370
I haven't changed at all.

712
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,630
Did you see that?

713
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,700
Have you ever thought about what would happen

714
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,630
if you faced a situation like this?

715
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,430
Who else?

716
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,000
Bring ten more!

717
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,770
I'm not afraid.

718
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,400
Come on!

719
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,500
Bring it!

720
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,530
Call me brother once,

721
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,230
I'm your brother for life.

722
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,430
Call you brother once,

723
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,960
you're my brother for life.

724
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,530
Don't you think writing apology letters

725
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,330
is the biggest waste of time in the world?

726
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,270
Why?

727
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,370
Why?

728
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,270
My hand gets sore.

729
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,600
Writing is exhausting.

730
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,430
Is that so?

731
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,690
And you know what the point is?

732
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,500
The point is

733
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,330
they only want to see me write

734
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,970
'I won't do it again.'

735
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,030
They don't care about anything else.

736
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,170
Here,

737
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,430
this one.

738
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,360
They won't teach you this in apology letters.

739
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
Ah Fei.

740
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,230
Ah Fei isn't actually fat.

741
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,870
The money he scammed from that rich lady

742
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,200
was for his grandmother's medical bills.

743
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,170
And this one,

744
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,300
Da Yong.

745
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,370
His underling

746
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,500
had his leg broken

747
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,670
by another gang.

748
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,100
So he planned to break both legs in return.

749
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,200
Really?

750
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,730
And this one.

751
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,370
This guy who looks a bit clueless,

752
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,400
his name is Xiao Jun, right?

753
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,570
He's been with his girlfriend for seven years,

754
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,800
but her parents don't like him.

755
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,300
So he got this crazy idea

756
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,470
that a diamond ring would let him marry her,

757
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,470
and then he got caught.

758
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,170
So he stole something?

759
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:57,830
Here you go.

760
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,670
You're really good at giving reports.

761
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,070
Of course.

762
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,670
Is this his girlfriend?

763
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,470
Yes.

764
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,270
She's pretty cute.

765
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,370
She is cute.

766
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,900
Why does she look familiar?

767
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,800
I don't know either.

768
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,230
She does look familiar.

769
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,870
The good days are over.

770
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,070
Someone with connections has arrived.

771
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,930
Ah Fei,

772
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,500
you've been assistant manager for so long.

773
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,630
I always thought after we got rid of the manager,

774
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,100
you would take over.

775
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,470
Just don't cause trouble.

776
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't care whose son he is.

777
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,930
How long do you think this newcomer will last?

778
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,330
I bet one month.

779
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,770
3,000

780
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,730
10,000

781
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,930
Don't worry. It won't take a month.

782
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,100
I'll make him leave.

783
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,070
So tough, huh?

784
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,330
Being a manager is exhausting.

785
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,730
Especially working with people who have

786
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,170
committed crimes before.

787
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,330
Learned to steal and cheat since childhood,

788
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,970
raised by a gang boss,

789
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,300
smuggling drugs,

790
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,870
even evading the Beagle drug lords.

791
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,570
Taking a knife for the boss,

792
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,870
the legendary second-in-command who saved the whole organization.

793
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,630
Hustling at street stalls at 15,

794
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,070
by 18,

795
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,900
made a name with his Iron Left Hand,

796
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,930
became famous

797
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,660
rumored to crush the universe with his left hand.

798
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,500
After I took that knife for Mr. Tian,

799
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,600
no one dared to question who I was anymore.

800
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,430
Loser.

801
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,670
You like him, don't you?

802
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,130
I just admire him, okay?

803
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,530
Maybe I've always lived too cautiously.

804
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,230
Don't you care about Liying?

805
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,900
What will people think of her?

806
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,870
I hope meteors destroy all Linlin breakfast shops.

807
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,000
That would kill me, you know.

808
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,930
So you have no friends?

809
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,130
I won't take a single penny.

810
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,400
I've already accepted it.

811
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,770
Then we have nothing more to talk about.

812
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:10,900
Let's get divorced.

813
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,630
Today's earnings are all gone.

814
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,370
Police!

815
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,430
Everyone come to the police station now.
