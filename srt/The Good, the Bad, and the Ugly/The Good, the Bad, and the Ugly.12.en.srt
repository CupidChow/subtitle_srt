1
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,830
Miss Zhou,

2
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,670
would you like to try

3
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,170
our new hair dye next time?

4
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,300
Sure.

5
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,000
Miss Cai said last time

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,430
she looked much younger after dyeing her hair.

7
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,930
Really?

8
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,030
That color is super beautiful.

9
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,500
Not at all. I'm glad you like it.

10
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,300
See you next time.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,230
Okay, let's schedule again.

12
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,030
Bye-bye.

13
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,630
Bye-bye.

14
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,300
Thank you.

15
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,870
Zhang,

16
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,700
you look 10 years younger today.

17
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,030
Thanks.

18
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,130
Lunch is ready.

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,270
Shide,

20
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,470
where's my braised pork rice?

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,870
I don't want to talk about it.

22
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,670
I had such bad luck today.

23
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,230
Met someone who was totally clueless.

24
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,200
I had already driven away

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,170
and then he told me

26
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,570
there was still one box of goods not loaded.

27
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,370
So I had to go back

28
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,530
and with all that driving around,

29
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,670
by the time I got to the lunch box shop,

30
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,470
the braised pork was sold out.

31
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,100
Wait.

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,030
Didn't you tell them it was for your wife?

33
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,970
I did, but they were just sold out.

34
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,470
I'm about to leave.

35
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,930
I won't be joining you for lunch.

36
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,870
But I bought yours.

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,800
No need.

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,170
Meixia,

39
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,200
you're being so mysterious.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
When are you going to introduce

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,070
your 'breakfast gentleman' to us?

42
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,870
He's just very busy with work.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,770
He barely has time to meet with me.

44
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,970
Maybe when his career is more stable,

45
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,200
I'll bring him to have dinner with you.

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,660
You just don't want me interrupting your little world for two.

47
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,200
At least tell us something about him.

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,930
How's his physique?

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,500
Is he more handsome than Andy Lau?

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Xiurong,

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,829
I need to remind you

52
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,600
I have feelings too.

53
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,570
I didn't mean to...

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,670
I should get going now.

55
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,470
Bye-bye.

56
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,200
Take care.

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,030
Okay.

58
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,000
Hurry up and wash your hands. Lunch is ready.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,170
So what did you buy?

60
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,329
Pork ribs.

61
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,470
Pork ribs again?

62
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,530
You're here.

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,200
Late.

64
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,600
I saw it was about to rain outside,

65
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,630
so I went back to get my car.

66
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,170
Don't you already have all these?

67
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,900
These are different.

68
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,070
These are for collecting.

69
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,930
The previous ones were for listening.

70
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,600
And I also got the latest ones.

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,830
No matter how many cabinets you have at home,

72
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,800
will it be enough to store everything?

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,700
Enough excuses.

74
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,570
You're late.

75
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,970
What's your punishment?

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll treat you to food.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
You're supposed to treat me to food anyway.

78
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,370
Then

79
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,370
you pay the bill.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,270
Boss, I want more noodles.

81
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,870
Okay. Do you want it spicy?

82
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,470
No.

83
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,070
Alright. Is cilantro okay?

84
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,770
Yes.

85
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,630
Good.

86
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,700
How is it?

87
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
It's delicious!

88
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,200
Try mine.

89
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,470
What do you think?

90
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,330
Is this blood cake or peanut powder?

91
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,860
It's almost like a dessert.

92
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,600
Sweetness can cover up a lot of life's bitterness.

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,400
I can't believe you're in the food business and don't understand this.

94
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,730
I don't understand.

95
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,870
You know best.

96
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,830
Really?

97
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,530
Someone wants to invest in Linlin Breakfast.

98
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,830
That's right.

99
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,290
Maybe we can open the first branch this year.

100
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,900
Are you going to open it in Jinshan?

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,970
Will you come help me?

102
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,130
You make it sound like I've never helped you before.

103
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,030
Every time I have a day off,

104
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,470
I travel all the way here to help you.

105
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,400
What I mean is...

106
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,270
Would you like to move in with me?

107
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,130
If I leave,

108
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,170
Xiurong won't be able to handle the beauty salon alone.

109
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,670
Besides,

110
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,900
Weijie and Weikang are still young.

111
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
They still need some time

112
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,960
to adjust to their mother's absence.

113
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,300
If suddenly now

114
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,500
their father's girlfriend appears,

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,400
it would be too cruel for them.

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,630
Come on, let's clean up.

117
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,570
Aren't we going to see a movie?

118
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,570
Okay.

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,930
Mr. Deng,

120
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,430
Miss Wang is here.

121
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,000
Weijie,

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,070
what are you drawing?

123
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm drawing flowers.

124
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,900
You're back early today.

125
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Is there an issue with the insurance policy?

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,370
No,

127
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,400
when I was on a business trip,

128
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,530
I saw some gifts suitable for the children,

129
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,130
so I brought them over today.

130
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,330
Thank you.

131
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,460
But please don't go to such expense in the future.

132
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,770
Let me help you.

133
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,930
It's fine.

134
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,200
Deng Yongkuan,

135
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,930
I've always liked you.

136
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,000
I know you must have noticed.

137
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,570
Maybe you don't have those feelings for me now,

138
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,270
but we can develop our relationship slowly.

139
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,970
I think the two of us

140
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,830
get along very well.

141
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,370
I also really like Weijie and Weikang.

142
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,300
I already have a woman I care about.

143
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,770
That's impossible.

144
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,570
She's a very lovely girl.

145
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,570
She always gives me many surprises.

146
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,470
I'm serious about her.

147
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,300
But before Linlin left,

148
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,000
I already knew you.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,930
Then you should understand better

150
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,630
that you and I will never be possible.

151
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,730
I'm going to rest now.

152
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,130
Are you okay?

153
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,900
Quick, flush it.

154
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:04,870
It's alright.

155
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,130
I can do it myself.

156
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,530
Afu, what are you doing?

157
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,500
She's hurt.

158
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Don't you see all these people here?

159
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,330
Egg pancakes are ready!

160
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,600
Come and get it!

161
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
What do I need you for?

162
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,770
How can you be so careless?

163
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,630
It happens when we're busy.

164
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,730
I get burned all the time at the beauty salon too.

165
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,970
You dare say that?

166
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,900
Come on. Get back to work.

167
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,360
There are many customers.

168
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,430
I think you should stay out of the kitchen from now on.

169
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,360
Go find something else outside...

170
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,630
How is it? Tasty?

171
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,000
Even ants are afraid of you.

172
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,830
Just don't use the oven anymore.

173
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,299
Let Afu use it. Alright.

174
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,429
Just help organize these vegetables.

175
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,270
Miss, your hair is beautiful.

176
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,970
So thick and smooth.

177
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,770
I'm really envious.

178
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,770
Thank you.

179
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,270
Xiurong.

180
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,330
Help me out.

181
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,570
Not again.

182
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,130
I can't stand it.

183
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,130
What did Breakfast Guy send you this time?

184
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,570
Is it 53770?

185
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,300
Or 53880?

186
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,700
He's not frivolous like you.

187
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,900
I've never even met him.

188
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,870
How would I know if he's decent or not?

189
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,130
Besides, if he were decent,

190
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,570
would he keep you out all night?

191
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,100
Lai Xiurong, that's enough!

192
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,170
I'm here!

193
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,700
Miss.

194
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,470
20184, get it? Go away.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,770
Love you forever.

196
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,700
Miss, is this okay?

197
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,330
Let's use pink today.

198
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,700
It's beautiful.

199
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,630
Impossible.

200
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,570
When I first found out

201
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,700
that Yongkuan was involved with you,

202
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,570
I couldn't believe it either.

203
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,590
But after I calmed down and thought about it,

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,830
I can't let this mistake

205
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,300
continue any longer.

206
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,930
We're getting married.

207
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,070
How do I know you're telling the truth?

208
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,800
Do you know where he lives?

209
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,670
Have you met his two precious children?

210
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,200
He asked me

211
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,870
to move in with him.

212
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,630
I was the one who refused.

213
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,730
If we could believe everything men say,

214
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,500
wouldn't that be wonderful?

215
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,400
Then he would love only me forever.

216
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,160
We've known each other for a long time.

217
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,730
I understand him.

218
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,970
I know which of his feelings are serious

219
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,500
and which are just for fun.

220
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,030
He will eventually come back to me.

221
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,900
Miss He,

222
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,630
could I ask you

223
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,270
before we all become more miserable,

224
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,630
to please leave?

225
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,800
If you still don't believe me,

226
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,500
this address -

227
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,160
you can come see for yourself.

228
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,900
Not at all. This is what I should do.

229
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,800
Good girl.

230
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,460
We're here. Daddy will put you down. We're home.

231
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,170
Are you okay?

232
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,600
Are you still feeling unwell?

233
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,670
Let's go home.

234
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,770
Come on. Let's go.

235
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
Meixia.

236
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,200
The last bus to Jinshan

237
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,500
has already left.

238
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,130
I have nowhere to go.

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,400
I thought I'd come to the shop to wait for Yongkuan.

240
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,100
Can I stay inside for a while?

241
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,200
Of course you can.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,900
Put this on.

243
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,670
Here's a towel.

244
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,100
The shop's water pipe is broken.

245
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,530
I was planning to get someone to fix it tomorrow,

246
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,930
but I thought I'd try to fix it myself first.

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Are you drinking alone?

248
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,170
I don't usually drink.

249
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,030
It's just that I... Can I join you?

250
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,830
I'll get you a glass.

251
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,530
Are you alright?

252
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,800
Did you know your boss is getting married?

253
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,230
So you two are getting married?

254
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,890
He's the one getting married,

255
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,330
but I'm not the bride.

256
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,630
I only found out today

257
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,770
that he's had a girlfriend all along.

258
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,430
I've always been

259
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,530
the third party destroying someone else's relationship.

260
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,730
How could that be?

261
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,070
Every time you come to the shop,

262
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,130
the boss is always so happy.

263
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,130
I believe the boss must like you.

264
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,200
But I saw everything.

265
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
He and his girlfriend look good together.

266
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,900
Standing beside them,

267
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,230
I felt like a thief.

268
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,870
Boss.

269
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,030
Why are you guys here?

270
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,800
Stayed the whole night?

271
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,070
Meixia and I were just chatting and drinking.

272
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,970
The weather was bad yesterday.

273
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,730
Meixia didn't have a ride home.

274
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,730
And she seemed to be in a bad mood yesterday.

275
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,700
I stayed at the shop to fix the pipes.

276
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,070
So I thought I'd keep her company.

277
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,330
That's why we accidentally fell asleep.

278
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,930
It was raining last night.

279
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,300
There were no more buses home.

280
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,370
I thought I'd wait for you at the shop.

281
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,170
And Afu happened to be there too.

282
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,300
I was feeling down

283
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,230
so I had drinks with him and talked.

284
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,270
Just drinks and conversation.

285
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,630
You want me to believe

286
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,130
that a man and woman spent the night alone together

287
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,570
and nothing happened?

288
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,330
Do you think I'm an idiot?

289
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,530
I told you,

290
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,770
nothing happened.

291
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,670
Why won't you believe me?

292
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,130
In your mind, am I the type

293
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,130
who would betray our relationship?

294
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,130
Or is it because you're that kind of person,

295
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,930
so you think everyone

296
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,430
in the world is just like you?

297
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,930
What do you mean?

298
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,800
You're the one who did something wrong,

299
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,170
and now you're blaming me?

300
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,970
I went to see you last night.

301
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,430
I saw everything.

302
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,700
You were with your official girlfriend.

303
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,400
You're even getting married!

304
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,170
And I thought I was the happiest person in the world.

305
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,900
Wang Rouyi?

306
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,400
What did she tell you?

307
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,630
Why do you have to make me

308
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,630
feel so humiliated?

309
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,370
Why do you believe everything she says?

310
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,670
Don't you trust me at all?

311
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,370
Don't you also not believe

312
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,330
that there's nothing between me and Afu?

313
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,700
I want to believe you.

314
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
That's why I went to your place yesterday.

315
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
I waited all night for your pager call.

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,530
I hoped you would come find me after hearing my message.

317
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,900
But you completely ignored me. Last night,

318
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,670
Weikang had a high fever.

319
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,400
I was up all night taking care of him after returning from the hospital.

320
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,300
Then I came to work early in the morning.

321
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,830
I'm really exhausted.

322
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,600
I don't know why I'm still here

323
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,870
listening to your unreasonable accusations.

324
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,970
Unreasonable?

325
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,030
I just want an answer.

326
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,830
And you call that unreasonable?

327
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,530
Fine.

328
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,329
Whatever relationship you have with Wang Rouyi

329
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,030
doesn't matter to me anymore.

330
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,700
I can't stay with someone like you any longer.

331
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,030
Do you think there's still a chance for us?

332
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,090
Finally stopped throwing up.

333
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,490
This child has been vomiting all day.

334
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,770
And the fever wouldn't break.

335
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,600
I was terrified.

336
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,070
Seeing the little one suffer like this

337
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,970
broke my heart.

338
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,700
Thankfully, after the IV and medicine,

339
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,870
the fever went down.

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,770
Peng, you've had a long day.

341
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,000
Why don't you go home and rest?

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Okay.

343
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,230
I'll take care of things here.

344
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,830
It's fine. I'll head out now.

345
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,430
Where's Peng?

346
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,930
I asked her to go home.

347
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,930
The food is ready.

348
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,270
You must be hungry.

349
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,730
Eat while it's hot.

350
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,430
Have some vegetables.

351
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,170
This one is very nutritious.

352
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,930
Try it first.

353
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,030
Is it too salty?

354
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,970
It should be fine.

355
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,600
Here,

356
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,030
have a piece of meat.

357
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,100
You didn't sleep all night

358
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,770
and worked all day today.

359
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,130
You must be exhausted.

360
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,770
Why don't you take a shower and rest?

361
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,970
No matter what happens,

362
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,670
I'll always be by your side.

363
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,630
You can rely on me.

364
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,470
Things have gone this far,

365
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,070
and you still won't tell me who that bastard is?

366
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,430
He Meixia,

367
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,800
do you even consider me a friend?

368
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,700
One question.

369
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,530
Do you want this baby or not?

370
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,930
Xiurong.

371
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,100
No matter what,

372
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,030
this is my child.

373
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,430
Fine.

374
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,430
So that's how you want it?

375
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,430
Let me tell you,

376
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,970
I, Lai Xiurong, will definitely take care of this child.

377
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,370
I will never let anyone bully him.

378
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,630
Jiang Shide says

379
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,470
he's going to Taipei to find work.

380
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,400
I think that's good.

381
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,800
A change of environment.

382
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,670
We'll go there and start over.

383
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,800
Forget all this mess.

384
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,130
You're back.

385
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm choosing a date for our wedding.

386
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,770
Would it be better to have the reception

387
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,070
after I give birth?

388
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,170
It takes time to get back in shape after delivery.

389
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,370
That way I'll look better in the wedding dress.

390
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,170
I've been looking at some options.

391
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,100
What do you think about having

392
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,500
our wedding on May 20th next year?

393
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,900
How does that sound? Don't waste your time.

394
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,700
I won't marry you.

395
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,270
What are you saying?

396
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,300
Look,

397
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,960
we're having a baby together.

398
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,500
You've schemed so hard

399
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,100
just to stay here, right?

400
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,370
Well, you've succeeded.

401
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm letting you stay.

402
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
I'll raise the child too.

403
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,230
But Zhou Linlin is my only wife.

404
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,360
What do you mean Zhou Linlin is your only wife?

405
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,230
Then may I ask,

406
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,300
what am I to you?

407
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,800
You will never be He Meixia.

408
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,430
Do you understand?

409
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,600
Your hair will look good whether you wear it forward

410
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
or back.

411
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,770
Let me show you with a mirror.

412
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,730
Is this pressure okay?

413
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,500
Yes, it's fine.

414
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,000
Are you satisfied?

415
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,970
It looks great!

416
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,370
Come, this way please.

417
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,630
Okay, this way.

418
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,670
What's your name?

419
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,070
Shide, get the bill.

420
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,730
Here.

421
00:24:59,130 --> 00:24:59,900
We've just opened.

422
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,670
Please come visit us again.

423
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,800
This is San Francisco Beauty Salon.

424
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,770
Sure, no problem.

425
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,370
Next time you come, I'll give you a free hair treatment.

426
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,330
Please take some candy.

427
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,330
Okay, bye-bye.

428
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,790
Come again soon! Bye-bye.

429
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,330
It's actually a reopening,

430
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,900
why use that word?

431
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,270
It makes the salon seem more fashionable.

432
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,500
We might even get foreign customers.

433
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,600
Look at this one.

434
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,970
Let me tell you.

435
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,730
In the future,

436
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,100
my goal is to cover this entire wall

437
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,230
with photos.

438
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,530
That way, everyone who comes will know

439
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,070
the history of our San Francisco Beauty Salon.

440
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,100
When this wall is completely covered,

441
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,870
I wonder what it will look like.

442
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,700
Come on,

443
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,900
smile more!

444
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,970
It'll look better in the photo.

445
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,270
Ready, three,

446
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,670
two,

447
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,930
one!

448
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,870
Let's do it again. Come on.

449
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,100
Deng Weiyu, what are you doing?

450
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,430
What are you looking at?

451
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,900
Looking at you.

452
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,800
What about me?

453
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,600
I never noticed before,

454
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,400
but you actually looked quite dorky when you were little.

455
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,130
I'm much better looking in person.

456
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,400
Handsome.

457
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,930
Let's eat.

458
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,330
Here's your soft-boiled egg.

459
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,770
Thanks. Do you want some?

460
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,300
You two are acting strange.

461
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,630
Strange? How?

462
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,170
What's wrong?

463
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,300
Can't you all see?

464
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,370
These two are dating!

465
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,200
Jiang Zhihao!

466
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Come on!

467
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,600
You two are showing off your relationship in public

468
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
so obviously,

469
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,870
it's like you're saying,

470
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,800
'Mom, Dad, please ask about us!'

471
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,460
Isn't that what it feels like?

472
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, that's how it is.

473
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,000
No wonder I was thinking,

474
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,670
how did you know

475
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,530
he doesn't like fully cooked egg yolks?

476
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,400
So you two have been sneaking around!

477
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,030
There's nothing to hide.

478
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,700
If it's Weiyu, I feel much better.

479
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,400
Unlike your previous... Mom!

480
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,900
Jiang Zhihao!

481
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,970
All you do is eat! What?

482
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,230
Look at Weiyu, such a talented young man.

483
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,270
Aren't you two the same age?

484
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,400
How can there be such a big difference?

485
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,300
Mom!

486
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,570
If I were the heir to Linlin Breakfast,

487
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,970
with my intelligence and talent,

488
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,930
I would've opened branches on Mars by now!

489
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,870
Yeah, right!

490
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,230
You're the best at talking nonsense.

491
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,870
Right! You're so good at dating now,

492
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,300
taking their side instead of your family's!

493
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,430
Deng Weiyu,

494
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,170
now that it's official,

495
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,400
you should treat us to a meal!

496
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,300
You're so pushy!

497
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,530
Sure, why not?

498
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,070
I heard a new Thai restaurant is opening next week.

499
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,670
I want to go!

500
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,670
Great!

501
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
Not next Friday though.

502
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,460
Xueqing and I have plans to go hiking.

503
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,970
You two women are really strange.

504
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,000
How can you fight so fiercely over nothing,

505
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,700
then wake up the next day like nothing happened?

506
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,470
We're like that

507
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,770
because of you and Lin Guangsheng!

508
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,600
Enough! Stop talking about it.

509
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,900
Can you two please stop?

510
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,730
What?

511
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,530
This is disgusting.

512
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,600
What do you think we three are?

513
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,230
What's wrong? Missing someone to serve you food?

514
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,430
I'll serve you. Here you go.

515
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,200
Here, you poor thing.

516
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,170
All for you. Eat more.

517
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,130
Let's start over.

518
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,870
Alright, let's thank Director Deng and Director Jiang

519
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,530
for their performance.

520
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,530
Let's give them a round of applause.

521
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,070
Mom, let me tell you.

522
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,530
Director Deng and Director Jiang's new breakfast shop

523
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,230
Linshicha is about to reopen.

524
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,430
Shouldn't you take this opportunity to promote it?

525
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,290
Mom, you have such a wide network.

526
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,970
Mom.

527
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,530
I hope in the future

528
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,770
Linshicha can become

529
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,030
a place that everyone visiting Taipei

530
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,200
must visit,

531
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,500
a landmark restaurant.

532
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,570
Whenever you think of breakfast,

533
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,770
you'll think of Linshicha.

534
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,830
And then step by step,

535
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,100
expand worldwide.

536
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,730
Becoming a globally influential breakfast brand.

537
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,330
Mom will definitely come support on opening day.

538
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,070
Great.

539
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,270
I probably don't need a reservation, right?

540
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,230
No need.

541
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,490
What's wrong with you?

542
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,130
Something seems off.

543
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,630
Really?

544
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,500
No?

545
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,070
If

546
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,670
one day Linlin lets you take the lead,

547
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,670
what would you do?

548
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,230
Why?

549
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,070
You want to copy my answers again?

550
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,900
Who wants to copy your answers?

551
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,330
What if my ideas are too brilliant?

552
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,190
Won't he notice you're cheating?

553
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,730
Just tell me.

554
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,770
Actually, I have many more ideas in my head.

555
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,730
Linshicha is just my first step.

556
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,130
I'm thinking later I could

557
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,870
create some local fusion.

558
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,630
Like Chinese, French,

559
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,670
Vietnamese, Thai, American,

560
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,970
even Indian cuisine.

561
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,600
Lie down, Dad.

562
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,530
You're only feeling a little better.

563
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,930
You need more rest.

564
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,970
Why does it seem like your cough is getting worse?

565
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,830
It's not.

566
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,670
The doctor said it's just a lingering cough.

567
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,400
After one more lung check, you can be discharged.

568
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,730
Okay.

569
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,470
Dad.

570
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,030
I've been thinking a lot while lying here.

571
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,730
I truly know I was wrong.

572
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,530
I'm different from before.

573
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,600
Can you give me another chance?

574
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,770
Here.

575
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,830
This is soup that Sister Peng made.

576
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,300
Try to drink some.

577
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,270
You are my son.

578
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,270
I won't abandon you.

579
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,970
But some things are non-negotiable.

580
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,430
You can't cross that line.

581
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,300
After you're discharged,

582
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,600
go to a new place

583
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,870
and work on your temper.

584
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,900
I remember you're working until the end of this month, right?

585
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,400
Yes, Chairman.

586
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,070
Going home is good.

587
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,170
Parents always want their children by their side.

588
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,730
Thank you, Chairman.

589
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,730
Chairman, what brings you here?

590
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,130
I'm adjusting the flavor.

591
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,730
And I have a bit of

592
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,430
decision paralysis.

593
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,030
May I try it?

594
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,370
Of course.

595
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,970
Chairman, water.

596
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,330
Is this blood cake or peanut powder?

597
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,860
It's almost like a dessert.

598
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,630
Sweetness can cover up many of life's bitterness.

599
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,090
You're a chef and you don't understand that?

600
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,400
I don't understand.

601
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,730
You understand it best.

602
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,000
Do you feel that life is too bitter?

603
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,699
Is that why you made this dish

604
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,300
so sweet?

605
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,400
Chairman,

606
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,860
you really understand me.

607
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,630
Everyone says this is a bizarre dish.

608
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,570
Blood cake itself doesn't have much flavor.

609
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,370
So this combination isn't actually that strange.

610
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,030
Chairman,

611
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,230
is there anything else?

612
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,929
Nothing.

613
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,860
I just happened to remember someone.

614
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,000
It must be a woman.

615
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,400
Isn't that how TV dramas always go?

616
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,200
The male and female leads

617
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,730
don't see each other for years because of misunderstandings,

618
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,400
then because of a song or a familiar scent,

619
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,670
they run into their first love again.

620
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,230
Why first love?

621
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,370
Don't all you men

622
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,900
cherish your first love forever?

623
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,170
Not really.

624
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,900
You only cherish someone if you truly liked them.

625
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,600
From what you're saying,

626
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
you have someone you can't forget?

627
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,400
I do.

628
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,170
Really?

629
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,870
Who is it?

630
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,370
You've never mentioned anyone before.

631
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,400
Is it that beauty queen from your class?

632
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,570
Beauty queen?

633
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,970
You know, Luo Shuqi.

634
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,100
Weren't you crazy about her back then?

635
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,770
Luo Shuqi?

636
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,030
That Luo Shuqi you mentioned,

637
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,800
is she doing okay?

638
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,130
You're a hundred times prettier than her.

639
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,670
I'm here to help you.

640
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,570
I'm here to teach you.

641
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,100
Why am I the only one sweeping?

642
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,470
I am watching.

643
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,170
Why aren't you at work yet today?

644
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,130
Mr. Fang said there's a power outage in his building.

645
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,730
He told me to come in later.

646
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,530
Hand.

647
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,570
What about his wife?

648
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,100
How would I know?

649
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,770
I'm going to be late.

650
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,070
I'll give you a ride.

651
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,470
Consider it my thanks.

652
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,400
You carry such heavy things every day.

653
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,330
So who was your first love?

654
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,330
If not Luo Shuqi, then who?

655
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,670
Lin Liying

656
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,330
Good thing I drove you here.

657
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,030
Look.

658
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,730
Otherwise you'd be soaked to the bone, I'm telling you.

659
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,270
Oh, great.

660
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,170
How nice of you.

661
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,500
Alright, I'm going now.

662
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,870
That looks like Mr. Fang.

663
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,870
Who's that woman?

664
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,500
She looks familiar.

665
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,030
Lin Liying.

666
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,500
That's Deng Weijie.

667
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,870
Deng Weijie.

668
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,100
Deng Weijie.

669
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,570
Honestly, Japan is my territory.

670
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,670
Just tell me where you want to go,

671
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,770
I can arrange everything.

672
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,430
That's awesome!

673
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,830
No problem at all.

674
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,600
The one you like

675
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
will arrive in Japan next month.

676
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
I'll have them air ship it to you.

677
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,170
You're too kind.

678
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,300
Not at all.

679
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,270
Here comes our concierge.

680
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:49,170
Come, take these gifts. Hello, long time no see.

681
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,100
You're getting more handsome.

682
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,500
I bought what you picked out

683
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,370
downstairs.

684
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,400
So thoughtful.

685
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,700
So considerate.

686
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,630
Weiyu heard we were gathering here

687
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,930
and insisted on coming by

688
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,200
to surprise his favorite sisters.

689
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,330
How sweet.

690
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,900
Here. Thank you. So thoughtful.

691
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,430
Windy.

692
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,400
Thank you.

693
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,370
These ladies are something else.

694
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,570
They take the bags,

695
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,830
get desserts to go,

696
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,160
and even want to drag me to get my hair done.

697
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,070
Mom, I don't like you putting yourself out like this.

698
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,670
It's nothing.

699
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,900
Haven't I endured enough these past few years?

700
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,070
As long as it helps you,

701
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,670
whether it's dining with them, shopping,

702
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,000
spending money or putting up with nonsense,

703
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,570
I'm willing to do it all.

704
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,630
I came back from Japan to help you.

705
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,400
You know your father's personality.

706
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,100
These years,

707
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,270
he only listens to his old comrades and shareholders.

708
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,870
He'll at least hear them out.

709
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,270
But can these board members' wives really help?

710
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,100
Don't underestimate female connections.

711
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,500
Things men can't handle

712
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,700
are basically managed by your mother.

713
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,300
Deng Weikang has fallen.

714
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,430
The wives will have to choose sides.

715
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,870
Since they have to choose,

716
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,300
why not choose us?

717
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,830
You're more handsome,

718
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,270
and I'm more sincere.

719
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,590
Director Zhang, long time no see.

720
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,470
The case Linlin Breakfast handled this time

721
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,500
was excellent.

722
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,400
Your performance is getting better. Still driving yourself?

723
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,770
Not getting enough exercise?

724
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,770
Old Zhang

725
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,160
has changed a lot these years.

726
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,600
Fortunately, I still have you old comrades

727
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,970
who can join me for a meal like this.

728
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,070
People have changed.

729
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,770
Who would have thought Wang Jinxin and Weikang

730
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,730
would set up shell companies?

731
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,730
I've given him many chances.

732
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,770
He brought this on himself.

733
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,630
We're all getting older.

734
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,100
We can't manage the company forever.

735
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,330
Some things

736
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,700
should gradually be handed over to the young people to learn.

737
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,100
We'll be their support from the sidelines.

738
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,730
Yes.

739
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,670
Weijie and Weiyu

740
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,100
are both kids we've watched grow up.

741
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,770
Weijie has always been steady.

742
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,870
As for Weiyu,

743
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,470
he's been giving us some big surprises lately.

744
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,900
Not only did he revive the Richu store,

745
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,030
but he also brought the failed Linshicha

746
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,400
back to life beautifully.

747
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,070
The company should let young people show their talents more.

748
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,070
That's how we keep up with the times.

749
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,770
I actually think

750
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,600
Weijie is more than just reliable.

751
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,730
With more training,

752
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,530
she'll have greater potential.

753
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,000
Here, have a drink.

754
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,330
Where did I put it?

755
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,970
It can't be here.

756
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,030
It can't be in the usual place either.

757
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,300
I was just using it last time.

758
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
Where on earth is it?

759
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,200
It can't be up there, can it?

760
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,500
Mom, what are you doing?

761
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,930
Let me help you.

762
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,930
I'll help you.

763
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,930
It's a bit heavy. Be careful.

764
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,830
Don't hurt your back

765
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,900
before you even start climbing the mountain.

766
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,470
I just realized how tall you've grown.

767
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,930
I've been this height for ten years already.

768
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,230
What are you looking for?

769
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,070
The knee pads.

770
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,500
I'm going hiking with Xueqing.

771
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,430
I remember I just

772
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,830
put the knee pads right here.

773
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,730
Mom, I think I know where they are.

774
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,200
Wait a second. Really?

775
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,830
So this box was here all along.

776
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,400
He Meixia.

777
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,700
You were quite trendy back then.

778
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,700
What's this?

779
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,500
What is this?

780
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,030
February 1994.

781
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,670
Mom, I found them!

782
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,770
Found them!

783
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,430
You left them in my room

784
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,090
when you took inline skating lessons last year.

785
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,270
Mom, what's wrong?

786
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,800
Yongkuan.

787
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,930
If one day you found out

788
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,870
that Zhihao is your son,

789
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,270
would you love him?

790
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,070
From now on,

791
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,870
Zhihao is my child.

792
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,430
I could have destroyed He Meixia back then.

793
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,670
I can destroy Jiang Zhihao anytime.

794
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,000
Partnering with Linlin Breakfast.

795
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,900
Is it to make things easier for you and Deng Weijie?

796
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,530
My successor.

797
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,470
I hope everyone will pay attention.

798
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,200
I used to believe

799
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,330
that hard work would definitely change the outcome.

800
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,930
But some people are born with a head start.

801
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,000
Mom.

802
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,200
What happened?

803
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,700
What's going on?
