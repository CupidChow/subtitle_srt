1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,400
Um.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,330
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,470
Sorry for what?

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,070
Actually, my initial purpose for coming to you

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,200
was to deal with Deng Weikang.

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,170
Just to deal with him?

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,030
And I want to get Linlin Breakfast.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,330
If that's what it takes

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,370
to not be looked down upon,

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,130
then I'll crawl there if I have to.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,600
Awesome!

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,470
Do you know how long I've been waiting

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,930
for you to say that?

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,730
Please.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,730
If you work overtime until you drop dead

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,770
killing yourself

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,030
just to make money for Deng Weikang,

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,360
then I'd think you have a hole in your head.

19
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't worry,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,870
I'll definitely help you.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,000
After all, I'm your hero.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,030
Relax,

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,630
I'll help you.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Clean your beard yourself.

25
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,730
Eat more.

26
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,000
Coming. That's good.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,730
That's enough.

28
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,100
Thank you. Okay.

29
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,130
You're welcome.

30
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,000
Mom,

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,030
did you take your blood pressure medicine?

32
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,829
Today,

33
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,930
yes, I took it.

34
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,970
I didn't forget.

35
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,970
I forgot yesterday.

36
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,270
I'm still fine.

37
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,370
Missing one day won't hurt, okay?

38
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,329
The doctor said

39
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,230
you need to take medicine on time.

40
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,500
It's better for your health. Right.

41
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,370
Alright.

42
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,030
And your hand too.

43
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,930
Okay.

44
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,329
You can't stop taking your allergy medicine either.

45
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,070
Fine.

46
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,430
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,000
Take care of yourself, okay? Okay, thanks.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,030
Weiyu.

49
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,270
Weiyu, right?

50
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,230
I'm sorry. They love nagging me.

51
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,370
Weiyu.

52
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,500
It's rare to have you as a guest at our home today.

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,470
Having this home-cooked meal.

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,200
It's very abundant. Most importantly, I want to thank you

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,830
for taking care of

56
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,930
our Zhihao.

57
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,470
If it weren't for you,

58
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,830
he would still be unemployed

59
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,370
and wandering around.

60
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,800
What do you mean unemployed?

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,870
He sought me out three times to be his strategist.

62
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,170
I'm like Zhuge Liang!

63
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,329
Is that so? Here.

64
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,430
Today this chicken leg is for you.

65
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
Thank you.

66
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,230
Don't mention it.

67
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,100
It's delicious.

68
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,570
Would you like a chicken leg?

69
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,200
Sorry, I already mentioned

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,000
that I want to eat the chicken leg today.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,800
What are you eating?

72
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,670
He's our guest!

73
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,000
Right, guests come first.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,500
And he's your boss too.

75
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,870
You can just eat vegetables.

76
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,970
Aren't you constipated?

77
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,770
Dad, don't talk about constipation during meals!

78
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,170
Here, have some braised eggs.

79
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,270
I made them myself. They're very tasty.

80
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,100
Thank you.

81
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,070
Give me your egg.

82
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,570
Why are you taking his egg?

83
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,430
He can't eat fully cooked egg yolks.

84
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,730
Bloating.

85
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll fry you a sunny-side up egg.

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,370
It'll be ready soon.

87
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,100
No need.

88
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,270
There's plenty of food already.

89
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,870
Don't bother.

90
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,900
Mom.

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,330
He doesn't want it, but I do.

92
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,600
Add some soy sauce paste for me. How shameless of you.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,300
You're overthinking.

94
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Just eat your braised egg.

95
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,700
Right.

96
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,870
So this is how you treat someone who's not your biological child?

97
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,900
Keep complaining and you'll see.

98
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,730
One more word.

99
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,590
Give me back that egg. I'll eat it.

100
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,970
Take it.

101
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,770
Fine, here you go.

102
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,030
Here's one for you. That's right, let her have it.

103
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,330
Smart move.

104
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,170
What a big chicken leg.

105
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,170
Why do you keep staring at me?

106
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,030
I'm watching you put on makeup

107
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,560
and text at the same time. That's impressive.

108
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Um,

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,170
your brother just said he's not biological.

110
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,470
What did he mean?

111
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,630
He didn't tell you?

112
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,390
It means exactly what it sounds like.

113
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,800
Jiang Zhihao,

114
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,070
he's not my parents' biological child.

115
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,100
His birth mother

116
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,030
was my mom's best friend

117
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,130
when she ran a beauty salon.

118
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,630
But later she got sick and passed away,

119
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,070
so my parents

120
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,200
raised him together.

121
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,900
But when we're together,

122
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,830
we're really like a family.

123
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,030
Sometimes I even forget

124
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,270
he's not biological.

125
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,530
I see.

126
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
What about his father,

127
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,830
his biological father?

128
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,670
I don't know.

129
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,900
I heard that back then,

130
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,830
he abandoned Jiang Zhihao's birth mother.

131
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,670
And after all these years,

132
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,000
he never contacted them

133
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,800
or came looking for his son.

134
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,700
I think he must be dead by now.

135
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
What a jerk.

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,170
Yeah, a jerk.

137
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,800
You're not that kind of guy, are you?

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,700
I... I'm not a jerk.

139
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,730
So you're really going to drive me home?

140
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,670
Of course. It's on my way.

141
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,770
I'm ready.

142
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,600
Let's go.

143
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,470
Mom, I'm sorry.

144
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,500
Lulu.

145
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,990
Director Hong has been waiting for you all evening.

146
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,270
No problem.

147
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,770
Also,

148
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,230
although he's a regular at our place,

149
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,770
he never used to come this often

150
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,000
until he met you.

151
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,270
Since his wife passed away,

152
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,170
I've never seen him like this.

153
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,100
Mom,

154
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,730
don't worry. I won't get seasick.

155
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,030
I'm not worried about you.

156
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm worried about him.

157
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,430
He even boasted

158
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,560
that he'll support you at the anniversary celebration.

159
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,730
Just be careful how you handle it.

160
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,570
I understand.

161
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,970
I'll go in first.

162
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,470
Director Hong,

163
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

164
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,100
I'll be right with you.

165
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,900
Okay.

166
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,570
Dad.

167
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,330
Weiyu.

168
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Sit down.

169
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,770
I heard that Richu store's performance

170
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,970
is about to surpass the flagship store.

171
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,800
Well done.

172
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,500
I was just lucky

173
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,930
to meet such reliable partners.

174
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,570
Being able to unite your employees

175
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,370
is also your achievement.

176
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,500
But

177
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,030
according to the company's plan,

178
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,830
Richu store will close at the end of this month.

179
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,299
If you could give me a little more time,

180
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,400
I can definitely create more value.

181
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,770
Then keep going.

182
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,630
After all, you chose this branch

183
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,900
just to show me what you could achieve, right?

184
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,530
Right?

185
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,100
Come.

186
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,400
Thank you, Dad.

187
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,530
Thank you for coming.

188
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,570
Manager.

189
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,430
Why hasn't Ah Fei arrived yet?

190
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,900
He told me he'd be half an hour late,

191
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,760
but it's almost closing time now.

192
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,600
Ah Fei's absence

193
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,630
must be because of his grandmother.

194
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,000
What's going on?

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,630
His grandmother

196
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,600
is basically a ticking time bomb.

197
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,470
What do you mean?

198
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,530
Da Yong,

199
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,190
do you know where Ah Fei lives?

200
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes, why?

201
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,270
I remember Ah Fei lives here.

202
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,470
Ah Fei.

203
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,830
My grandmother is missing. I need to find her first

204
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,700
and I'll explain later.

205
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,600
Let's split up.

206
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,630
Have you seen Guowei?

207
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,000
No, sorry.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,930
No.

209
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,830
Grandma.

210
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,430
What are you looking for?

211
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,030
Have you seen Guowei?

212
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,200
Guowei? I don't know him.

213
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,660
Where are you trying to go?

214
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,300
Richu store.

215
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,430
Linlin Breakfast Richu Store.

216
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,370
I'll take you there.

217
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,600
Okay.

218
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,570
Who are you looking for?

219
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,570
Guowei.

220
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,700
Guowei.

221
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,400
How many times have I told you

222
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,530
not to wander off?

223
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,100
Before coming to find me,

224
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,400
you could call me first.

225
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,500
Zhao Guowei,

226
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,070
why are you only coming now?

227
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,000
It's late!

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
It's time to open the store!

229
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,730
Grandma, look carefully.

230
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,400
I'm not Guowei.

231
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,370
I'm Ah Fei.

232
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,300
Ah Fei?

233
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,830
Aren't you selling breakfast?

234
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,930
If you don't sell breakfast,

235
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,730
how will we earn enough

236
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,670
for the children's tuition?

237
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,470
Do you think money falls from the sky?

238
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,570
Okay,

239
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,630
I'm Guowei.

240
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,300
Chunhong, let's go home and talk, alright?

241
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,930
Hurry up!

242
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,530
Don't be like this.

243
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,670
Grandma,

244
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,370
grandma, it's okay.

245
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,630
This will do.

246
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,170
Alright.

247
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,770
We...

248
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,600
Chunhong.

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,370
Ah Fei's grandma used to run a breakfast shop.

250
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,170
For decades.

251
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,970
She got sick a few years ago.

252
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,700
That's why she closed it. I still worry every day.

253
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,670
That we don't have enough money.

254
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,930
You say you won't work.

255
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,770
You just decide not to work.

256
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,970
Not working. Fine.

257
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,600
Chunhong.

258
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not refusing to work.

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,070
I'll come to work tomorrow.

260
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,700
Okay?

261
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,630
I'll come to work tomorrow.

262
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,600
Let's talk about this at home, okay?

263
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,330
We... well...

264
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,570
Let's go home... Well, hurry up and open the shop!

265
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,570
They've already closed.

266
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't be like this.

267
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,470
What do you mean closed?

268
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,570
They've already closed.

269
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,330
Hurry up! The staff are all here.

270
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,670
Stop eating.

271
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,300
That's enough, Grandma.

272
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,230
Grandma, please don't be like this.

273
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,130
I want to open the shop.

274
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,070
Careful!

275
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,870
Don't be like this.

276
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,970
I want to open the shop.

277
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,000
Don't block the way.

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,730
Hurry up!

279
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,870
Quickly get those chairs.

280
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,370
Turn on all the lights.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,300
Grandma, look.

282
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,500
Is this okay?

283
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,300
It's great!

284
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,930
Is it good?

285
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,330
Wrap it up quickly. Good.

286
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,530
The customer will be here to pick it up soon.

287
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,870
Okay.

288
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,770
Don't slack off here.

289
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,070
Okay. How long has the black tea been brewing?

290
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,470
Go prepare the lettuce quickly. Good.

291
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,130
Grandma, I'll do it.

292
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,730
This... this employee...

293
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,670
No... this...

294
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,370
He's new. I'll teach him.

295
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,170
I'll teach him properly.

296
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,130
Teach him well!

297
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,930
Okay.

298
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,700
This one and this one.

299
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,630
These two handsome guys have been waiting for a while.

300
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,730
They haven't ordered yet.

301
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,100
Hurry up and order. It's delicious.

302
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,970
Ma'am, I want that... okay.

303
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,470
Thick Beef Chicago Burger.

304
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,600
Thick...

305
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,970
Grandma, we have new items. Here.

306
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,270
It's called Thick Beef Chicago Burger.

307
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,670
I'll write it down for you.

308
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,630
Yes, we have this item.

309
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,230
Thick Beef Chicago Burger.

310
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,570
Thick Beef Chicago Burger. Good.

311
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,700
Thick Beef Chicago Burger.

312
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
I'll order that.

313
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,770
I'll have the Sukiyaki Beef Egg Pancake.

314
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,770
Sukiyaki...

315
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,470
We have another item.

316
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,830
Called Sukiyaki Beef Egg Pancake.

317
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,400
Sukiyaki... yes, Sukiyaki.

318
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,130
Yes, we have Sukiyaki Beef Egg Pancake.

319
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,730
Okay? We have this product.

320
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,200
Then make it quickly.

321
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,570
Grandma, I'll make it. Let's hurry.

322
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,500
How much is all this?

323
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,800
How much for this?

324
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,230
Grandma, it's 130 yuan.

325
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,270
130. Keep the change.

326
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:57,970
No.

327
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,030
We need the change. No need.

328
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,670
Let's get more milk tea.

329
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,470
Okay, then let's

330
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,700
add two more large iced milk teas.

331
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,430
Two more large iced milk teas.

332
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,200
Yes, that makes it exactly 200.

333
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,030
That's perfect, Grandma. Perfect.

334
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,530
Thank you, handsome boys.

335
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,800
Please have a seat over there.

336
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,130
We're still preparing.

337
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,870
We'll just wait nearby.

338
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,670
How about giving us the drinks first?

339
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,070
Sure, no problem.

340
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,330
After Ah Fei's grandfather passed away,

341
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,930
his grandmother immediately developed dementia.

342
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,130
He's been taking care of her ever since.

343
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,630
His grandmother has wandered off before,

344
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,570
but this is the first time she's ended up at our shop.

345
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,670
She probably came to the shop looking for Ah Fei,

346
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,070
but got confused.

347
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,130
My grandmother is already asleep.

348
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,570
Today really...

349
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,800
thank you all so much.

350
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,430
It's been a long time since

351
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,170
I've seen my grandmother this happy.

352
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,170
Thank you.

353
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,030
Don't just say thank you with your mouth.

354
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,470
Show it with actions.

355
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,670
Like...

356
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,400
Anything is fine.

357
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,730
Whatever you want to eat. It's your treat.

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,130
Wagyu beef!

359
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,230
Let's go to the amusement park!

360
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,670
Amusement park!

361
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,330
Elsa.

362
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,570
Amusement park.

363
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,830
The amusement park is for the staff trip, right?

364
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,430
Why should I care?

365
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,530
What are you afraid of?

366
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,430
The manager's got this.

367
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,030
Right? Yes, manager.

368
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,070
Staff trips should be at amusement parks.

369
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,930
Amusement park? We don't have the budget for that.

370
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,770
But it's okay if we all go out together.

371
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,970
I'll try to negotiate with the company.

372
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,930
Awesome!

373
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,270
So where do you want to go? Feel free to say.

374
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,200
The manager will handle it anyway.

375
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,230
Alright.

376
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,070
Take good care of your grandma.

377
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,330
We're heading out now.

378
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,500
Bye.

379
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,070
It's quite beautiful.

380
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,200
Let's take a photo to mark our visit.

381
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah.

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,530
Hurry up.

383
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,700
Go up there and take a photo.

384
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,370
Don't go up there.

385
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,870
It's dangerous up there. It's too high.

386
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,870
What are you coming up for?

387
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,030
To take photos. It's my first time.

388
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,200
Hurry up.

389
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,970
Check if you can see yourself in the photo.

390
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,030
Make sure your blonde hair shows.

391
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,700
One.

392
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,330
Two.

393
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,500
Three.

394
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,069
Good thing we didn't go back to Big Tail's place.

395
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,829
You're only feeling this way now?

396
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,000
Was your determination fake before?

397
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,570
There are still different levels.

398
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,770
If 60 is a perfect score,

399
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,230
then I'd say about 70.

400
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,670
Actually,

401
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,100
I never thought

402
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,470
that a staff trip

403
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,030
would have anything to do with me.

404
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,600
Since getting out of prison,

405
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,900
I often wonder

406
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,170
what someone like me can do.

407
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,930
If Linlin abandons me,

408
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,030
it would be just as well.

409
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,170
But since

410
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,670
the manager and Jiang Zhihao arrived,

411
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,630
everything seems different.

412
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,900
I really want to work with you all now.

413
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,030
I want to prepare drinks.

414
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,200
I want to work at the grill.

415
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,130
I want to fry radish cakes.

416
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,070
I want to make cheese omelets.

417
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,200
You want to work but still come late three days a week?

418
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,600
What if I don't want to work?

419
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,700
Yeah.

420
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,970
Manager,

421
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,230
excuse me.

422
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,700
Actually, I want to thank everyone too.

423
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,600
Thanks to all of you and Richu store.

424
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,370
I now feel

425
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,770
there's still a lot I can do at Linlin.

426
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,330
Then show them what you can do.

427
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,570
Let's find a goal together.

428
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,170
Take down the flagship store.

429
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,630
That's too easy.

430
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,300
We're going to take down all our competitors' flagship stores.

431
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,170
Yeah, bring it on.

432
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,800
Who's afraid of whom?

433
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,730
Come on.

434
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,500
Richu's Five Tigers.

435
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,870
Hurry up.

436
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,200
Feeling shy?

437
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,960
Music video lead actor.

438
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,500
What are you doing?

439
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,370
Hello.

440
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,130
Hurry up.

441
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,870
Let's go.

442
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,470
Come on, one... wait a second.

443
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,370
Wait.

444
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,470
I'll be San Jingshou.

445
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,200
Liu Chuanfeng.

446
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,030
Richu.

447
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,030
Let's go!

448
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,330
Nuo Toast.

449
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,770
Gold Medal Nuo Toast.

450
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,400
Your phone is ringing.

451
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,300
Answer it?

452
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,130
Don't answer.

453
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,000
Answer it.

454
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,870
I won't answer.

455
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,000
No, wait.

456
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
I'll go.

457
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,000
Should I answer it or not?

458
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,600
Um.

459
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,070
About what just happened,

460
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,570
you don't need to take it too seriously.

461
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,670
Just...

462
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,830
If we run into each other at home in the future,

463
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,770
when we meet again,

464
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,500
you can just

465
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,600
greet me casually, that's all.

466
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,430
I don't usually clean this late.

467
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,170
It's because I just noticed

468
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,130
there were some

469
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,470
visible scratches on the wooden table.

470
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,070
That's why I stayed.

471
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,230
No.

472
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,290
That needs to be fixed too.

473
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,970
You left a note saying you'd fix it.

474
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,330
Shanru, right?

475
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,400
I really didn't see anything just now.

476
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,300
When someone files a complaint, we have to come.

477
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,600
Your business is doing so well.

478
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,700
You're making all the money.

479
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,430
But...

480
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,730
Your business is causing trouble for the neighbors.

481
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,300
How can a business have absolutely no cooking fumes?

482
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,430
Besides, the data from the last inspection was normal.

483
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,600
We haven't changed anything since then.

484
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,530
Why? Why do we need to...

485
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,130
You need to be socially responsible when making money, okay?

486
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,800
Is it wrong for us to work honestly to make a living?

487
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,630
I get it now.

488
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,800
You must be colluding with equipment suppliers.

489
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
Forcing us to spend big money on new equipment.

490
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,470
So you can take a commission, right?

491
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,030
Let me tell you,

492
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,370
this is robbery.

493
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,700
I'm sorry. We'll definitely make improvements within the deadline.

494
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,430
What do you mean?

495
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,170
What do you mean by 'what do you mean'?

496
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,830
I'm warning you. How dare you?

497
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,470
Watch your words.

498
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,200
Be polite. Watch what?

499
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,930
What should I be careful about?

500
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,500
You're obstructing official duties now.

501
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,430
I'm sorry. We'll definitely make improvements by the deadline.

502
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,830
I've seen people like you many times.

503
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,130
If you've got the guts, say it outside.

504
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,130
You're just looking for bribes, aren't you?

505
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,270
It's robbery! I'm sorry.

506
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,030
What are you implying now?

507
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,090
What do you mean by 'what do you mean'?

508
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,970
Let's go, Mom.

509
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,770
Wait.

510
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,670
Mr. Wang forgot his bag.

511
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,970
I just checked his business card.

512
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,570
It's near your home.

513
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,190
Please deliver it tomorrow morning.

514
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,990
Here's your delivery fee.

515
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,030
Okay.

516
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,770
Get home safely.

517
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,260
You're still awake?

518
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,630
Eat.

519
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,290
You'll eat yourself to death.

520
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,560
I caught it myself.

521
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,860
I need to ask you something.

522
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,330
Is there a Guangnian Trading Company

523
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,930
near our home?

524
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,990
I don't remember having that nearby.

525
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,070
Wang Jinxin...

526
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,900
That name sounds familiar.

527
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,000
You know him?

528
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,600
With so much 'gold' in his name,

529
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,030
it's hard to forget.

530
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,260
I think I've heard of him at headquarters.

531
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,170
That's great.

532
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,070
Please return it to him for me.

533
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,200
Eat slowly.

534
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,370
Watch your health.

535
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,230
Am I your servant?

536
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,700
I wake up earlier than you.

537
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,130
Good night, Zhilu.

538
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,900
OK.

539
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,970
Alright, I'll be right there.

540
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,970
OK.

541
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,430
Kiki, I need to step out for a moment.

542
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,290
Could you take care of this for me?

543
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,130
Yes.

544
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,100
Right away. If I drive,

545
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,300
it's very close. That distance, yes.

546
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,630
Good.

547
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,370
Don't worry, there's no need to rush.

548
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,330
Yes, OK, the timing works.

549
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,790
Great, it's settled then.

550
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,330
Hello.

551
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,100
Can I help you?

552
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,970
Is this Mr. Wang Jinxin's office?

553
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,270
He left this bag at Chun Hotel yesterday.

554
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,170
Don't you have work today?

555
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,700
Why are you the only one here?

556
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,070
None of your business.

557
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,770
Excuse me.

558
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,470
May I use your bathroom?

559
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,400
The bathroom is not for public use.

560
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,870
You came to deliver it personally

561
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,000
but won't even let me use the bathroom.

562
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,770
Stingy.

563
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,000
Yes, I want to report a rat.

564
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,860
The location is Richu Store next to Linlin Breakfast Shop.

565
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,370
That's right. The Richu Store next to Linlin Breakfast Shop.

566
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,370
When I went there for breakfast the other day,

567
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,400
I saw a huge rat.

568
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,130
Okay.

569
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,090
Alright, thank you for your help.

570
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,160
What are you staring at?

571
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,330
What's wrong with your eyes?

572
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,990
Haven't you seen someone with insomnia before?

573
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,200
When will Director Wang arrive?

574
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,370
I've prepared a lot of reference materials

575
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,530
to report to him.

576
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,730
Just leave them there.

577
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,660
He'll look at them when he returns.

578
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,770
What work can I do now?

579
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,670
Get out.

580
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,270
The further away the better.

581
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,570
Take the chair away.

582
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,730
The further the better.

583
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,870
He's sick.

584
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,500
Just a minor cold.

585
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,930
The company has been too busy lately.

586
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,570
My immune system is weak.

587
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,370
Some unimportant matters

588
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,130
can be left to Weiyu.

589
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,070
How can I trust him with anything?

590
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,170
He can't even handle the kitchen smoke issue.

591
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,300
He only knows how to get publicity with beefcake photos.

592
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,170
Brother.

593
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,430
We initially wanted to close the Richu store

594
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,300
because of poor performance.

595
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,870
Now sales have multiplied several times.

596
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,670
Isn't performance what matters most?

597
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,000
But is it worth sacrificing

598
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,370
our company's image like this?

599
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,070
People might think

600
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,230
we're running a host club.

601
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,500
But if they've found confidence through this

602
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,130
and can reintegrate into society,

603
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,430
isn't that our original intention?

604
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,300
To gain acceptance for rehabilitated people

605
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,430
at the cost of ruining our reputation?

606
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,800
Do you know how many complaints about smoke and rats

607
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,600
we've received lately?

608
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,730
You've got your priorities all wrong.

609
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,600
Weiyu, sit down.

610
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,070
Come.

611
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,700
Today's tea is good.

612
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,870
Try some.

613
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,200
Weikang.

614
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,270
As a vice president,

615
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,370
these trivial matters

616
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,130
shouldn't concern you.

617
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,230
Here.

618
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,430
Checkmate.

619
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,230
Weiyu, come.

620
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,260
Let's play another round.

621
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,260
I'm going to the bathroom.

622
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,770
Come, sit down.

623
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,130
What brings you here?

624
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,930
I've been a bit short on cash lately,

625
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,900
so I took on an extra job.

626
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,670
Linlin never said we can't have a side job.

627
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,500
I only did it during my days off

628
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,030
or after work hours.

629
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,400
Working part-time as a traitor?

630
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,000
I never thought it would be you.

631
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,000
What are you doing?

632
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,170
I'm struggling too.

633
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,300
But how long can this shop last?

634
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,200
Once the trend is over,

635
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,570
things will go back to how they were.

636
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,630
We'll still be those forgotten people,

637
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,900
won't we?

638
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,230
I need to look out for myself.

639
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,600
Didn't we say we'd work hard together?

640
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,800
Why don't you believe in us?

641
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,600
This is the first time someone has recognized my abilities.

642
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,870
They want me to work in an office.

643
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,900
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this day?

644
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,170
How long I've waited?

645
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,800
I've always wanted to have

646
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,470
my own desk.

647
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,330
And business cards with my name on them.

648
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,330
I don't want to be like my grandparents,

649
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,670
getting up early every day,

650
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,230
only to earn that little bit of hard-earned money.

651
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,270
I just want to be

652
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,070
accepted by society,

653
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,670
an ordinary office worker.

654
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,270
Is the person who recognized you Deng Weikang?

655
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,200
Did he ask you to cause trouble for Richu Shop?

656
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,900
In exchange,

657
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,130
he gave you this job, right?

658
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Ah Fei.

659
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,700
You've been here for a while now.

660
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Haven't you felt something was off?

661
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,270
We'll give you another chance.

662
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,830
Want to take another bet?

663
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,330
Bird.

664
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,200
Pong.

665
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,900
Pong Bird.

666
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,030
You seem to have a connection with birds lately.

667
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,900
Here's another bird for you.

668
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,530
So how's Mr. Fang?

669
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,900
What do you mean?

670
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,570
He has so many bakeries,

671
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,230
and he's so muscular.

672
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,600
His cardboard cutouts are everywhere.

673
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,030
Ever since you told me about that thing,

674
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,470
I blush every time I see a cardboard cutout.

675
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,870
So,

676
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,730
did you

677
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,230
get a good look?

678
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,430
Mom!

679
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,970
I haven't seen a naked man in a long time.

680
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,730
Xiurong,

681
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,970
haven't you seen your husband's in a while?

682
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,100
Don't say it.

683
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't want to see it at all.

684
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,630
Here you go. Don't talk, please.

685
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,170
I don't want to imagine it.

686
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,400
So what's it like?

687
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,370
What?

688
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:06,870
How is

689
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,570
Fang Nuo's body? Really,

690
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,600
tell me,

691
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,699
is it... good-looking? Muscular?

692
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,830
Is he strong? Does he have muscles?

693
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,929
What about his abs?

694
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,330
I saw what I needed to see.

695
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,730
Did you see what you shouldn't have?

696
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,699
You must have.

697
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,730
No, I didn't.

698
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,070
Was he... energetic? How could you not?

699
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,929
More energetic than you.

700
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,270
Very energetic.

701
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,800
See?

702
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,300
What are you doing sneaking around over there?

703
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,530
What were you guys discussing over there

704
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,570
about Mr. Fang's naked body?

705
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,730
You heard us?

706
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,030
It's nothing really.

707
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,969
When I was cleaning Mr. Fang's place,

708
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,600
I accidentally saw him naked in the shower.

709
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,030
How's his body?

710
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,270
Compared to yours?

711
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,130
Yes.

712
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,800
Impressive.

713
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,530
Didn't you say he was difficult

714
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,230
and had too many demands?

715
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,200
Yeah.

716
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,100
But after getting to know him, he's actually quite nice.

717
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,100
He's sophisticated and polite,

718
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,770
and he has six-pack abs.

719
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,800
Enough.

720
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,830
You can't judge a book by its cover.

721
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,200
You're still too naive.

722
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,200
Lucy, tell me.

723
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,730
I got fired.

724
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,630
I really didn't see anything.

725
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,470
I mean...

726
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,370
I only saw a lot of skin,

727
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,630
but I did all the work I was supposed to do.

728
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,500
Do you need something?

729
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,200
I understand the pain of insomnia.

730
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,530
Do you feel like you've aged five years overnight?

731
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,170
Waxy skin,

732
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,500
dry hair with no shine?

733
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,270
You have insomnia too?

734
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,500
I used to be like that.

735
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,770
But look at me now,

736
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,930
aren't I full of energy?

737
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,500
So what exactly should I do?

738
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,470
Actually, I have another identity.

739
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,730
I don't usually tell people

740
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,460
unless I know them well enough.

741
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,500
What identity?

742
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,730
Good. Let's sway from side to side first.

743
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,130
Smooth out the fabric.

744
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,570
After smoothing the fabric, we turn around.

745
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,230
Fold it back six times.

746
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,070
Can you do that?

747
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,370
Good.

748
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,030
After folding,

749
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,570
position yourself directly under the fabric,

750
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,570
bring the fabric close to your buttocks,

751
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,400
and slowly sit into it.

752
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,370
Good. Next,

753
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,830
grip the left fabric curtain with both hands.

754
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,330
We're going to step over with our left foot.

755
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,500
Ready to step over,

756
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,530
like this.

757
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,170
Very good. Everyone is doing great.

758
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,030
If possible,

759
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,370
bring your knees together,

760
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,130
and we'll create a meditation pose.

761
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,330
Like this.

762
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,230
Very good.

763
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,530
Now, listen to my instructions.

764
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,230
Take a deep breath.

765
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,470
Exhale.

766
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,170
What we're going to do now is

767
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,330
the most popular digital therapy from abroad.

768
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,430
Let me introduce you to

769
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,770
my students here beside me.

770
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,630
Since this is your first time, you might not be familiar with it.

771
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,700
That's okay.

772
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
Don't be nervous.

773
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,430
I'll ask a senior student to demonstrate for you.

774
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,330
In this age of information overload,

775
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,630
we've all been hijacked by numbers.

776
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,730
This therapy

777
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,470
is about finding

778
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,230
the numbers that have been controlling your thoughts,

779
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,400
and then

780
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,700
letting them go.

781
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,330
Good.

782
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,830
Now say out loud

783
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,290
the four numbers you feel most connected to.

784
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,230
0988.

785
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,300
Very good.

786
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,130
7941.

787
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,470
7941.

788
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,230
0408.

789
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,400
0408. Very good.

790
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,370
And your numbers are...

791
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,930
they're...

792
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,400
0320.

793
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,300
0320.

794
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,330
0320.

795
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,770
0320 is wrong!

796
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,870
I don't seem to feel a connection to these numbers.

797
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,300
Is this

798
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,870
your birthday?

799
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,070
It's my ex-boyfriend's birthday.

800
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,030
Ex-boyfriends

801
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,470
are in the past, let them go.

802
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,500
We should focus more

803
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,430
on ourselves.

804
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,900
For example,

805
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,230
your family,

806
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,870
your favorite celebrities,

807
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,270
or the lottery numbers you last won with.

808
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,730
Can you cut the crap?

809
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,200
Hurry up!

810
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,630
You must trust the teacher.

811
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,430
I'm a professional.

812
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,000
0857.

813
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,470
0857.

814
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,800
0857

815
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,970
It's really 0857.

816
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,630
What kind of wordplay is this?

817
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,800
There's an entry in the financial report

818
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,830
for goods from Guangnian Trading Company,

819
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,630
and it's quite a substantial amount.

820
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,600
I've never heard of this company.

821
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,130
What did we order from them?

822
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,870
It's

823
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,630
a company that supplies tableware and packaging materials.

824
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,230
Since our previous box supplier

825
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,000
has been increasing prices year after year,

826
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,600
I thought we could try a different supplier.

827
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,170
So some of our branches have switched to their boxes.

828
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,270
Why wasn't I informed

829
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,270
about the results after using them?

830
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,800
Wang Jinxin is the owner of Guangnian Trading Company.

831
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,500
Did you know that?

832
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,170
Uncle Wang left Linlin earlier

833
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,330
because he wasn't feeling well,

834
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,770
so I lost contact with him.

835
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,500
I only recently found out

836
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,830
that he's the owner of Guangnian Trading.

837
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,400
I remember when he was at the company,

838
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,230
you two got along well.

839
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,570
No,

840
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,570
Dad, after he had that falling out with you,

841
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,130
I kept my distance from him.

842
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,170
I gave you a chance.

843
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,570
As a vice president,

844
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,570
you set up a shell company with others

845
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,200
and misappropriated company funds.

846
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Do you have any respect for me at all?

847
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,070
Dad, I'm sorry.

848
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,470
I won't do anything like this again.

849
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,600
This company will be yours sooner or later.

850
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,370
What's your hurry?

851
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,600
Now, whether you want to go to

852
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,800
Guangnian Trading

853
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,170
or work at some shell company I don't know about,

854
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,670
it's up to you.

855
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,270
From now on,

856
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,130
Linlin doesn't need you anymore.

857
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,070
Brother Kang,

858
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,000
remember when we used to have lunch together?

859
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,730
You would take me to your favorite noodle shop.

860
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,330
When you ate noodles, you never added any seasoning

861
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,230
or ordered any side dishes.

862
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,100
Once I asked you out of curiosity,

863
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,500
and you said you liked eating them that way.

864
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,500
But later we never had the chance

865
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,030
to eat together again.

866
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,770
Because I was at rock bottom,

867
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,530
while you kept climbing higher and higher.

868
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,630
Later I found out that the person who kicked me down

869
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,830
was actually you.

870
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,500
I was going to let it go,

871
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,900
since I was tired anyway.

872
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,630
Besides,

873
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,830
a small shrimp fighting against a big whale

874
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,670
is the kind of thing that only happens on TV,

875
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,470
something I never believed in.

876
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,800
But that's life.

877
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,300
Often, at the most unexpected moments,

878
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,170
miracles happen.

879
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:12,670
I always feel that

880
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,400
miracles are heaven's way of giving people like us,

881
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,200
who work so hard, one last chance.

882
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,930
If that's the case,

883
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,530
then I can't go against fate.

884
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,330
I must fight back

885
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,070
and claim victory.

886
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,930
I'm writing this letter to you

887
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,430
to let you know

888
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,500
that later I would also go with my partners

889
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,170
to your favorite noodle shop.

890
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:39,270
I also don't add seasoning or order side dishes.

891
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,000
I eat them exactly the way you like.

892
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,930
This way I can always

893
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,770
keep everything you've said and done

894
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,470
in my heart.

895
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,830
Jiang Zhihao

896
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,670
Wait.

897
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,200
If we look back on this later,

898
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,600
our first kiss was at the bathroom door.

899
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,270
That's gross.

900
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,800
Fang Nuo is easily persuaded.

901
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,000
I want you to know

902
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,470
I'm the real boss of Nuo Toast.

903
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,930
Deng Weiyu, what are you doing here?

904
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,730
Mom.

905
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,900
Jiang Zhihao,

906
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,670
why are you listening to this old song?

907
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,170
This guy Jiang Zhihao

908
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,400
is just like his mother, always networking,

909
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,570
who knows what he's really up to.

910
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,370
Aunt Xiurong isn't that kind of person, is she?

911
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,500
I'm talking about

912
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,170
his biological mother.
