1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,730
Of course.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,370
Lucy,

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,270
I'll take any part-time job now, okay?

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,270
Since I no longer have that

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,830
that person's case.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,530
Why are you here?

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,370
Just finished work. Lucy,

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,270
I can't chat now.

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,200
Come in, I'll treat you to some bread.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,630
I just ran into my enemy.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,700
This is our signature item.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,170
You can try it later.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,370
It's fine not to hire me,

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,370
but why pretend to be nice?

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,500
You're just full of surprises.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,870
I think that was Shanru's decision.

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,700
Who?

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,530
Shanru, my wife.

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,900
I did casually mention to her at home

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,670
that I ran into you.

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,370
But don't take it too personally.

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,530
It's just that

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,660
she doesn't like people breaking her rules.

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,200
To be honest,

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
I really didn't expect her to do this.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll put in a good word for you later.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,830
So one word from you and I can work again?

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,230
Maybe after I leave,

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,470
you'll put on a different face

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,800
with a completely different expression.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,270
Aren't you allergic to shrimp?

32
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,300
You saw the note

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,400
on our refrigerator, right?

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
My wife is the one allergic to shrimp,

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,670
not me.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,330
The wife is allergic to shrimp,

37
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,130
the husband isn't.

38
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,230
Is what you're saying true?

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,330
I got my job back.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,830
Thank you, Lucy.

41
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,530
So, Mr. Fang,

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,930
are there any other special requirements?

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,630
They're offering you work

44
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,690
and you're asking so many questions?

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,170
Okay,

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,100
I'll definitely be on time.

47
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,470
Thank you, Lucy.

48
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,970
The job is back.

49
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,230
So you got your job back?

50
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,070
Yes.

51
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,700
Are we still letting them film at our place?

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,630
We should. It's extra income.

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,270
When I was young, they asked me to be in movies.

54
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,530
I should have accepted.

55
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,170
I could be a leading actress now

56
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,329
and wouldn't need to rent out my house for filming.

57
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,770
Money is so hard to earn.

58
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,430
So in life... [Cut]

59
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,130
'Leading actress,' hurry up and finish the goods.

60
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,660
Wang is coming to pick them up this afternoon.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,100
You're playing Cinderella now.

62
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,770
Hello?

63
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,430
Why are you still up so late?

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,900
I've booked my return ticket.

65
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,500
I'll send it to you later.

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,270
You're finally coming back!

67
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,800
Yes,

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,530
can you spare more time for me this time?

69
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,570
Last time you came to Japan,

70
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,970
you only gave me thirty minutes.

71
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,600
Thirty minutes!

72
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,200
I couldn't even have a meal with my son.

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,030
Then stay for six months this time.

74
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,000
If you stay for six months,

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,770
I'll accompany you every day.

76
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,170
You promise?

77
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,300
Alright, I'll stop nagging.

78
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,070
Get some rest. Good night.

79
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,800
Okay, you get some rest too.

80
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,470
Good night.

81
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,800
All these proposals

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
revolve around Linshicha's brand core,

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,470
which is to create

84
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,770
a more upscale and fashionable brand image.

85
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,870
That concludes my report. Thank you.

86
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,730
The pace of store expansion

87
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,500
has gradually stabilized after the pandemic.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,130
Launching a sub-brand now

89
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,500
is a good idea.

90
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,100
If anyone has any suggestions,

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,560
please feel free to share.

92
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,300
I think the Linshicha concept is great,

93
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,000
and Weiyu has been trained well enough.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,630
Putting him in charge of this

95
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,159
should yield good results.

96
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,430
They're born from the same mother.

97
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,300
Why on earth does the chairman

98
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,870
dislike her so much?

99
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,870
What era are we living in?

100
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,470
Don't tell me he still favors sons over daughters.

101
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,670
Everyone knows

102
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,770
that Linlin Breakfast

103
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,730
was eventually given to the VP.

104
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,370
Our director still works so hard and diligently,

105
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,300
she's even sacrificed time for romance.

106
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,330
I really

107
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,330
feel sorry for her.

108
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,100
She could at least spend money on a young hottie.

109
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,830
Anyway, let's drop this topic.

110
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,530
Are we still short one person tonight?

111
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,400
I heard Jessica isn't coming.

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,900
That's really too much.

113
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,030
Are we supposed to invite the princess to join us?

114
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,170
She wouldn't deign to attend our little gathering.

115
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,830
Why would you say that?

116
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,130
That's impossible.

117
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,530
Busy person,

118
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,470
it's your loss if you don't come.

119
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,570
I ordered wild squid today.

120
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,430
I'm sorry, my friend isn't coming.

121
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,830
Okay, I understand.

122
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,900
Miss.

123
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,030
Miss.

124
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,030
Excuse me.

125
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
Thank you.

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,470
Haven't we met somewhere before?

127
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,470
Probably

128
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,870
not.

129
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,330
I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.

130
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,330
I just feel like

131
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,570
we've really met somewhere before.

132
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,830
I have a common face.

133
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,830
My friend stood me up today.

134
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,000
She's not coming.

135
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,900
I can't finish all this alcohol by myself.

136
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,330
Well.

137
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,770
Let's drink together.

138
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,600
Sure.

139
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,200
Thanks.

140
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,500
I know this sake.

141
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,030
It should be made with rice from Hyogo Prefecture.

142
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,570
And then brewed in Hokkaido.

143
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,830
You know your alcohol.

144
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,200
Life is too depressing.

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,430
Finding interests that let you waste time can be therapeutic.

146
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,770
Like drinking.

147
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,070
But I'm not really that knowledgeable.

148
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,530
I just occasionally take wine tasting classes.

149
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,600
If you're interested.

150
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,260
I can take you there next time.

151
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,230
Sure, that's fine.

152
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,300
Hello.

153
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,430
Hello. We have an appointment with your marketing director.

154
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,700
Alright, please come this way.

155
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,770
Thank you.

156
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,930
Please come in.

157
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,030
Thank you.

158
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,230
Our vision is

159
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,900
that all bread for Linlin Breakfast

160
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,400
will be supplied by your brand, Nuo Toast.

161
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,930
I hope my customers

162
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,370
can enjoy five-star quality

163
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,300
at the most affordable prices.

164
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,630
Meanwhile,

165
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,700
Nuo Toast can also expand

166
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,560
to different customer segments.

167
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,900
To supply bread

168
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,130
for hundreds of Linlin Breakfast shops across Taiwan

169
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,700
might be difficult in terms of production capacity.

170
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
No.

171
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,800
I'd say it's completely impossible.

172
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,730
I've already thought about this issue.

173
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,770
Initially,

174
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,970
we'll offer limited supply to selected stores

175
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,000
to test market response.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,230
Once the supply becomes stable,

177
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,270
we'll expand to all locations.

178
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,600
What do you think?

179
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,670
It seems Director Deng has prepared a hundred

180
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,330
responses to my concerns.

181
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,330
Indeed.

182
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,870
Because I believe

183
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
Linlin Breakfast

184
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,370
will definitely become the exclusive

185
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,170
food service partner with Nuo Toast.

186
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,730
You're the experts in marketing and management.

187
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm just a baker

188
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,900
who only cares about each piece of dough rising in my hands

189
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,900
and how it becomes a satisfying loaf in the customer's hands.

190
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
This is also why Nuo Toast

191
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,270
doesn't easily expand into new markets,

192
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,200
because I need to personally supervise the quality.

193
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,030
Director Deng,

194
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,430
thank you for thinking so highly of Nuo Toast,

195
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,230
but this is truly a major collaboration.

196
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,070
I may need to go back

197
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,200
and discuss this with my team.

198
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,300
Alright.

199
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,930
You listen to this song every day,

200
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,800
aren't you tired of it? Do you like me too?

201
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Forever in love,

202
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,730
forever supporting you.

203
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,730
Do I like you too?

204
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,170
I like you.

205
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,800
I like you.

206
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,830
Chairman,

207
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,130
we're just preparing supplies before opening.

208
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,370
I'll turn it off when we open.

209
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,300
Why are you listening to this old song?

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,630
Because my mom loves this song.

211
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,730
I was forced to listen to it,

212
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,300
but whenever I hear this song,

213
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,370
I feel like

214
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,900
I'm transported back to when my mom was young.

215
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,730
Time flies.

216
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,830
Young people who appreciate old songs

217
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,030
are rare these days.

218
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,900
Chairman, you're here to see Weiyu, right?

219
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,130
I'll call him for you.

220
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,130
Manager!

221
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,370
Jiang Zhihao.

222
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,230
You used to work with Weikang, right?

223
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,930
Didn't you once corner me in the basement?

224
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,630
Chairman, you actually remember.

225
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,260
You proposed many interesting projects back then.

226
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,230
But why are you working here now?

227
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,370
Have you been to prison?

228
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,870
No, I haven't.

229
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm here because... What's wrong?

230
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,200
What's up?

231
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,470
Dad, good morning.

232
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,400
So Jiang Zhihao works here?

233
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,300
Yes. You two will work together.

234
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,200
For temporary assignments,

235
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Zhihao will help you too.

236
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,530
So you've already returned to our Linlin Breakfast.

237
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,670
Good.

238
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,670
Keep it up.

239
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,870
Thank you, Chairman.

240
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,230
I'll work hard.

241
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,500
Why are you stealing my boyfriend?

242
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,970
He loves me.

243
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,870
When will you let him go?

244
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,930
You hit me!

245
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,200
How was that?

246
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,570
I acted better than those actors, right?

247
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,400
Excuse me.

248
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Ladies in front,

249
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,530
you can't be in the frame.

250
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,330
We're filming.

251
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,470
Please move away from there.

252
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,330
Take care of it. Thanks.

253
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,330
Sorry.

254
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
Good. Step back a bit more, please.

255
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,800
Just a moment. We need to touch up.

256
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,170
Sorry. We'll be ready soon.

257
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,030
Come on, hurry! We're losing light.

258
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,560
Okay, sorry. One more time.

259
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,530
Okay.

260
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,330
They're about to start.

261
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,170
Miss,

262
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,330
excuse me, we're filming.

263
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,370
There's another one here. Handle it.

264
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,330
Hurry up!

265
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,530
Sorry, Liying.

266
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,170
Come over here!

267
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,330
Come here!

268
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,130
They're filming. Don't block them!

269
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,730
They're shooting a film.

270
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,000
They're filming, you know.

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,030
Don't talk.

272
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,170
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,300
I didn't know.

274
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Okay. Sound!

275
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,500
Who's coming? Speed!

276
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,270
I heard it's Liu Pinyan.

277
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,770
I want to get her autograph.

278
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,830
I heard she's fat.

279
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,400
Really fat.

280
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,670
No way. She's beautiful.

281
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,070
That's right.

282
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,030
Is she here?

283
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,800
Remember to eat the late-night snack.

284
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,230
Come on.

285
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,300
We're doing a shift change today.

286
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,770
Please wait a moment.

287
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,200
What change?

288
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't understand.

289
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,770
Why don't you ask her to hurry up?

290
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,570
Didn't you enjoy watching them film?

291
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,600
I already paid them.

292
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,000
She just mentioned a shift change.

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,330
What does that mean?

294
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,170
No idea.

295
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,970
Why is it taking so long?

296
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,770
The late-night snack is pretty good.

297
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,970
I can't eat anymore.

298
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,630
What are you all doing?

299
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,600
We lent our place for filming.

300
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,700
Really? Who's in it?

301
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,100
I think Liu Pinyan and Fang Zhiyou are in it.

302
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,830
You haven't taken a shower yet, have you?

303
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,200
Not yet.

304
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,170
It's so dark.

305
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,770
Why is it so dark?

306
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,770
You should turn on some lights. Be careful.

307
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,770
Okay, walk slowly.

308
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,570
Careful, be careful.

309
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,600
Watch out, it's very dark.

310
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,470
I'll go get towels for you.

311
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,070
You'll take turns showering.

312
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,430
Wait here, okay?

313
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,130
Mom, let's go sit in the living room.

314
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,270
There are sofas in the living room.

315
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,130
Don't wander around. Come on.

316
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,170
Just wait here.

317
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,800
It's more comfortable to sit in the front.

318
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,900
Hurry up, let's go.

319
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,700
Mom!

320
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,200
A ghost!

321
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,030
Ghost!

322
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,030
What's wrong?

323
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,500
Jiang Zhihao, why are you sleeping here? Jiang Zhihao?

324
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,960
Screaming like ghosts this late at night...

325
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,230
Woke you up, didn't we?

326
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,300
No.

327
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,030
Why are you all at our house?

328
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,500
To take showers.

329
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,300
It's freezing!

330
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,900
What? What's wrong?

331
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,070
What is it?

332
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,630
It's freezing cold!

333
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,500
Don't you remember?

334
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,070
The hot and cold water labels in my house are reversed.

335
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,130
I forgot after all these years.

336
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,230
Okay, I'll help you.

337
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,270
Don't come in! I'm not dressed!

338
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,900
It's not a big deal.

339
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
What are you looking at?

340
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,730
Just checking if the temperature is right.

341
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,130
Lai Xiurong, get out!

342
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,400
Fine.

343
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,000
You...

344
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,430
Your gray hair is showing.

345
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,930
I've been busy lately.

346
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,600
No time to touch up the color.

347
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,330
Do you remember that time?

348
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,770
Because your scalp was so sensitive,

349
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,870
I ordered that special dye from abroad,

350
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,000
that ridiculously expensive hair dye,

351
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,600
but you only used it once and then disappeared.

352
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,670
Come on,

353
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,230
it's been 5 years.

354
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,000
It must have expired by now.

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,100
I threw it away last week.

356
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,770
Every time I saw that bottle,

357
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,670
it really bothered me.

358
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,970
But I kept thinking,

359
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,830
maybe I might need it someday,

360
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,630
so I just left it there.

361
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,530
Actually, I don't even know

362
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,470
why we kept fighting.

363
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,970
I know that thing wasn't your fault,

364
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,800
but

365
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,200
I just needed someone to take it out on.

366
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,070
So you finally admit it.

367
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,730
You're just so unreasonable.

368
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,270
Lai Xiurong,

369
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,070
are you looking for a fight?

370
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,130
Truce.

371
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,900
I'm tired.

372
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,630
I have clients early tomorrow.

373
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,130
Come by in a few days for a touch-up.

374
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,370
I'll order you a new bottle.

375
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,770
Alright, hurry up.

376
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,700
I'm exhausted. I need to sleep.

377
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,770
Come on, sleep with me.

378
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,200
Jiang Shide is sleeping with Jiang Zhihao today.

379
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Come on.

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Hurry up. Okay.

381
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,530
So nagging.

382
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,170
The last time we slept together... come on.

383
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,870
How long ago was that?

384
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,800
I forgot.

385
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,100
Over here! Where are you going?

386
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,400
Why are you sleeping here?

387
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,700
Why not sleep in Zhilu's room?

388
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,730
I couldn't sleep.

389
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,300
I'm not used to new beds.

390
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,600
What about you?

391
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,100
Why are you here?

392
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,730
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

393
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,400
Xiaojun,

394
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,500
cover for me. I'll be late.

395
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,530
How can you work without energy?

396
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,990
Would you like breakfast?

397
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,830
Breakfast will give you energy.

398
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,300
Brush teeth, wash face, eat breakfast.

399
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,170
You don't look energetic either.

400
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,930
I need coffee.

401
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,970
Alright.

402
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,600
Here.

403
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,600
This is a special breakfast platter for insomniacs.

404
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,670
Our LinLin Breakfast is launching

405
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,700
a new brunch brand

406
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,970
called Jet Lag.

407
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,870
I'm still testing the menu.

408
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,130
Careful, it's hot.

409
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,900
Try it for me.

410
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,830
How is it?

411
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,730
I was touched for three seconds,

412
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,100
but turns out I'm just a guinea pig.

413
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,870
Not at all.

414
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,630
These aren't mutually exclusive.

415
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,200
Besides,

416
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
the first taster is the most important.

417
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,100
I want to incorporate

418
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,870
some local specialty dishes,

419
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,630
like

420
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,900
red and white rice balls, egg pancakes,

421
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,430
things like that.

422
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,430
What do you think?

423
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,630
They're okay eaten separately,

424
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,470
but it's boring.

425
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,930
Boring?

426
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,900
Maybe try mixing them together.

427
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,730
Do you want to try?

428
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,070
They already mixed in my mouth.

429
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,700
Well then,

430
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,870
what else would be suitable?

431
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,300
What's suitable?

432
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,270
Yeah,

433
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,770
condensed milk doesn't work.

434
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,200
Turnip cake?

435
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,630
No turnip cake.

436
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,500
You have a lot of opinions.

437
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,670
What about blood cake?

438
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,230
Blood cake?

439
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,300
What do you think?

440
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,430
That might work!

441
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,000
Hello. Welcome.

442
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,370
Hello.

443
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,900
We're from Linlin Breakfast Shop.

444
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,170
Mr. Fang Nuo asked us to meet here.

445
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,600
Okay.

446
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,170
The owner is over there.

447
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,600
Director Deng, hello.

448
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm the one who invited you.

449
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,670
I'm Fang Nuo's wife.

450
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,230
Hello.

451
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,100
First, I want to thank you

452
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,300
for thinking so highly of our Nuo Toast.

453
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,630
Fang Nuo is easily persuaded.

454
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,930
As his wife,

455
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,970
I must protect

456
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,270
the bakery business he loves.

457
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,230
Of course,

458
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,630
I want you to know that

459
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,030
I am the real boss of Nuo Toast.

460
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,230
In the market,

461
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,030
there are many cross-industry collaborations like this.

462
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,530
With just one careless mistake,

463
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,670
if something goes wrong,

464
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,870
if there's any issue,

465
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,930
for Nuo Toast,

466
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,700
we don't know if it will help or harm us.

467
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,100
Moreover,

468
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,270
our Nuo Toast has always

469
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,570
been positioned as premium, not mass-market.

470
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,930
If our bread becomes available everywhere,

471
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,470
will people still think it has value?

472
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,400
Mrs. Fang,

473
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,230
High-priced bread

474
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,530
isn't exclusive to Nuo Toast.

475
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,330
As long as there's a market opportunity,

476
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,900
people will keep investing in it.

477
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Value comes in many forms.

478
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,530
Creating scarcity through marketing is one way,

479
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,570
but making products widely available

480
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,800
and integrating them into daily life

481
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,300
is another.

482
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,930
It's up to you to choose.

483
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,500
The collaboration with Linlin Breakfast has been finalized.

484
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,370
You need to put more effort

485
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,500
into discussing with their team.

486
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,330
That Deng Weijie is quite shrewd.

487
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,130
You need to be more careful.

488
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,100
All contracts and details

489
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,470
must be approved by me.

490
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,430
Don't make decisions on your own.

491
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,800
Nuo Toast has come this far

492
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,730
because you've been managing everything behind the scenes.

493
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,670
When have I ever not needed your approval?

494
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,770
When have I ever messed up?

495
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,900
I want to adjust the recipe for the co-branded products.

496
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,430
What do you mean?

497
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,670
Someone will handle this matter.

498
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,270
I'm just letting you know.

499
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,470
I've already told you

500
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,930
not to touch my products.

501
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,100
Which word, which sentence

502
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,360
don't you understand?

503
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,900
We can't let consumers think

504
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,070
they can get the same taste of Nuo Toast

505
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,370
at a lower co-branded price.

506
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,030
Then what's the point

507
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,400
of this collaboration?

508
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,370
This is about management and marketing.

509
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,570
This is my business.

510
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,400
Your job is to

511
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
take care of the products in Nuo Toast.

512
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,730
Don't meddle in things you don't understand.

513
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,900
Thank you all for coming to Chunjiu Hotel's anniversary celebration today.

514
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,600
As usual,

515
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
we will be hosting

516
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,930
everyone's favorite Red Shoe guessing game.

517
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,770
If you guess correctly,

518
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,270
you'll be treated to our exclusive limited edition wine.

519
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,500
Starting with the first person on my right,

520
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
who do you all think it is?

521
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,030
Yumi.

522
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,330
And the second one?

523
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,730
How about the third one?

524
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,770
And finally, the fourth one?

525
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,600
This one's easy,

526
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,400
it's Lulu.

527
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,670
Mr. Hong says it's Lulu?

528
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,530
I've heard everyone's answers.

529
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,300
Now I'll reveal

530
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,770
the correct answer.

531
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,530
Our anniversary celebration officially begins now.

532
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,700
Please enjoy yourselves and drink up.

533
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,330
Mr. Hong, how did you guess so well?

534
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,370
Mr. Hong has a keen eye for Lulu.

535
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,530
Lulu toasts to you.

536
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,270
I could definitely tell it was you.

537
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,570
Thank you, Mr. Hong.

538
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,430
Since my wife passed away,

539
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,830
I've been fortunate to have Lulu's company.

540
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,500
My feelings for her are genuine.

541
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,570
You've seen it all, haven't you?

542
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,170
Of course.

543
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,100
We're all grateful for how much Mr. Hong supports Lulu.

544
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,270
Today, I want you to be a witness

545
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,770
as I tell her something.

546
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,200
I love you.

547
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,200
Mr. Hong,

548
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,530
you haven't had enough to drink.

549
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,970
Let me toast you again.

550
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,170
Will you be with me?

551
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,430
Or just quit your job,

552
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,730
I'll take care of you.

553
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,970
Mr. Hong,

554
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,730
don't joke...

555
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,600
Hello, Mr. Hong.

556
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
I'm Lulu's boyfriend.

557
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,630
If anyone's taking care of her,

558
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,890
it'll be me, no need to trouble yourself.

559
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,870
Let me toast you on her behalf.

560
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,600
Thank you for

561
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,730
taking such good care of her.

562
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,370
Mr. Hong, this is Mr. Deng,

563
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,800
our promising young man. Let me introduce you.

564
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,070
Let's all have a toast. Hello.

565
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,400
Xiao Hai, help our guest request a song.

566
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,470
Sure,

567
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,770
thank you.

568
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,330
I'll drink first as a sign of respect.

569
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,730
Are you okay?

570
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,170
You seem to be drinking quite a lot today.

571
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,500
This is my first anniversary celebration since I started working here.

572
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,330
Of course I need to drink more.

573
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,330
What do you think about what I just said?

574
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,830
Which part?

575
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,030
The part about

576
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,670
taking care of you.

577
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,100
What do you mean?

578
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,530
Wait.

579
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,730
What? Hold on.

580
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,100
If we remember this later,

581
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,630
our first kiss was at the bathroom door.

582
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,370
It smells terrible.

583
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,870
But you smell nice.

584
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,400
Weiyu.

585
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,730
You're off work, Ms. Peng.

586
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,600
Why isn't Dad back yet?

587
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Weren't we supposed to have dinner?

588
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,500
Your dad went to the hospital to see your brother.

589
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,570
Weikang wasn't feeling well and went to the hospital.

590
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,300
The chairman had just finished work.

591
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,070
He received a call from the hospital.

592
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,970
Then he left immediately.

593
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,800
I don't know what happened.

594
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,830
Dad.

595
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,130
Dad.

596
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,900
Wasn't Weikang just having a cold?

597
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,530
How did it get serious enough for hospitalization?

598
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,930
The doctor said it's type A flu.

599
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,430
With pneumonia complications.

600
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,170
How did this happen?

601
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:53,830
Not long ago,

602
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,770
I reminded everyone at the company

603
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,870
to be especially careful.

604
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,700
Type A flu is spreading widely recently.

605
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,130
What was he thinking?

606
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,670
The company has so many projects running now.

607
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,700
I don't know if he had contact with

608
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,100
other managers.

609
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,800
I think my brother had a meeting at the Zhongxiao store this morning.

610
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,060
I'll notify the colleagues there first.

611
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,670
Dad.

612
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,070
Go home and rest first.

613
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,030
Don't stay here.

614
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,230
I'll ask Sister Peng to take care of him.

615
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,370
Every word you just said,

616
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,600
do you truly care about Weikang?

617
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,670
Even though he did something wrong,

618
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,730
he's still your family.

619
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,900
Haven't you thought about that?

620
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,830
Thank you.

621
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,470
Deng Weiyu, why are you here?

622
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,630
Mom,

623
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,470
welcome home.

624
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,200
Weren't you supposed to be in a meeting?

625
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,870
What meeting could be more important than picking you up?

626
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,170
And flowers too.

627
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,070
Are you tired?

628
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,070
No. I'll run you a hot bath.

629
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,870
Okay.

630
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,130
Is this room alright?

631
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,700
It's great.

632
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,300
It's great. I'm completely satisfied.

633
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,170
But having you here is what matters most.

634
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,830
Was there traffic on your way back?

635
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,270
No.

636
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,400
Coming back from Japan

637
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
and having to stay in a hotel

638
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,030
feels a bit lonely.

639
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,800
Why can't I go home after all?

640
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,430
Even though Deng Weikang did that thing with Uncle Wang,

641
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,100
Dad still cares about him.

642
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,970
He's in a really bad mood now.

643
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,860
He lost his temper again a few days ago.

644
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,370
Your father is just making excuses

645
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,370
to be angry with you.

646
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,270
But...

647
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,970
Isn't Weikang usually in good health?

648
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,930
How did he get sick so suddenly?

649
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,500
I don't know either.

650
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,070
Could he be faking it?

651
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,970
I don't think he would go that far.

652
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,070
That Deng Weikang...

653
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,300
After causing this scandal

654
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,470
and being ignored,

655
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,030
now he's playing the sympathy card.

656
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,100
That's just like him.

657
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,530
Alright, don't overthink it.

658
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,470
Just get some rest first,

659
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,470
and we'll find a good time to go home.

660
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,530
It's fine.

661
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm back now.

662
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,630
I brought you some gifts

663
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,700
for your PR work.

664
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,570
I told you there's no need.

665
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,100
The gifts your mom bought are special.

666
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,370
Let me tell you.

667
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,530
This big bag is for the Richu store.

668
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:45,030
The black bag is for you and Zhihao.

669
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,800
When are you two meeting up?

670
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,670
In a few days.

671
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,070
We'll have a meal in a few days.

672
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,870
What's

673
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,600
this?

674
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,000
Didn't you say you two like similar things?

675
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,430
The fourth character.

676
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,730
It's cold.

677
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,870
Very cold.

678
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,530
Ball. Hug.

679
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,630
Embrace.

680
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,800
Ice.

681
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,699
Corn egg pancake.

682
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,730
You can guess even like this.

683
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,800
Your chemistry is amazing.

684
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,100
I know every hair on his head.

685
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,800
Zhihao.

686
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,730
Thank you for helping Weiyu so much before.

687
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,370
He always talks about you.

688
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,130
I finally have the chance to have a meal with you today.

689
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,000
It's nothing.

690
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,830
Actually, he's the one who takes care of me, auntie.

691
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,900
Okay, last question.

692
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,530
Your turn.

693
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,100
- Still playing?
- More?

694
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,030
But I don't want to use breakfast.

695
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,770
Anything is fine. Whatever you want.

696
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,969
How many characters?

697
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,170
Chopsticks.

698
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,469
Edge. Gold.

699
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,699
Metal.

700
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,170
Tongue.

701
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,330
Lick.

702
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,500
Day.

703
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,070
Today.

704
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,800
You. Me. I.

705
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,030
Today I...

706
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,630
Shumai.

707
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,170
Today I sell...

708
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,170
Not sell.

709
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:54,900
Buy.

710
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,770
Today I'll pay.

711
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,400
Today I'm treating.

712
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,500
No need.

713
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,900
- Weiyu, we'll pay. Let's go.
- No need.

714
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,430
No need. I have a coupon.

715
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,370
What are you talking about?

716
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,870
- I have a coupon.
- What coupon?

717
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,730
Wait, I have a coupon. It's already so cheap and you still want to pay?

718
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,200
Sit down.

719
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,860
Getting another free meal from you guys.

720
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,470
Zhihao.

721
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,800
Who's that in the photo in your wallet?

722
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,500
In my wallet?

723
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,570
My mom.

724
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,800
Your mom?

725
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,100
But she left when I was

726
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,770
almost two years old.

727
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,170
I don't really have any memories of her.

728
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,270
So I keep her photo in my wallet

729
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,870
to remember what she looks like.

730
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,200
You're so sweet.

731
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,530
Thank you, auntie.

732
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,000
Now let's gently pick up our glasses.

733
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,270
Swirl it a bit.

734
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,400
And take a sniff.

735
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,100
Now let's take a sip.

736
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,830
Would anyone like to share

737
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,570
what they taste?

738
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,300
It tastes very light.

739
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,270
There's a citrusy acidity

740
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,170
that spreads across the palate.

741
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,400
Citrus.

742
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,870
I think this wine would pair perfectly with...

743
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,470
Having a five-star chef grill seafood right here.

744
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,930
Seafood.

745
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,200
It's your first time here, right?

746
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,330
Would you like to share your thoughts?

747
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,370
Its finish...

748
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,300
Like a car with no brakes

749
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,230
plunging straight into a valley

750
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,970
coming to a quick end.

751
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,900
Let's try the next wine.

752
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,300
For this wine,

753
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,830
we can examine its color.

754
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,690
Excuse me, let me swirl it as well.

755
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,100
Your description was quite interesting.

756
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,330
When did you come in?

757
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,230
Just arrived.

758
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,200
I hope I didn't miss much.

759
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,230
Not really,

760
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,490
but I didn't expect you'd actually come.

761
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,800
Last time at the izakaya,

762
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,130
I thought what you said made a lot of sense.

763
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,130
Finding a hobby where you can just waste time is therapeutic,

764
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,530
so here I am.

765
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,570
Do you know that after drinking,

766
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,500
your eyes can see the most stars?

767
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,070
If you look carefully,

768
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,130
you'll notice

769
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,830
one star becomes three,

770
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,570
and three become nine.

771
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,900
Wow,

772
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,400
there are 13 of them!

773
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,970
You can count 13 stars in broad daylight.

774
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,470
You must be really drunk.

775
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,470
You're just trying to mock me.

776
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,200
To be honest,

777
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,370
I've always thought

778
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,270
people who have time to stargaze

779
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,700
are all fools.

780
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,100
You're calling me a fool?

781
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,030
I didn't say that about you.

782
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:01,530
It's because I'm chased by numbers every day.

783
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,030
I don't have the mood

784
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,470
or time to look up at the sky properly.

785
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,530
Thanks to you,

786
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,830
I've discovered

787
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,700
what it feels like to slow down.

788
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,830
Not bad.

789
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,870
No spray needed.

790
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,130
Good.

791
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,460
Come, let me take a look.

792
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,230
That works.

793
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,270
Good.

794
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,500
Okay.

795
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,030
Thank you.

796
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,970
Old neighbor, 150 is fine.

797
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,930
Good, thank you.

798
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,630
Bye-bye.

799
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,490
Beautiful lady, first time here?

800
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,670
This isn't my first time.

801
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,470
Really?

802
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,500
I usually never forget a customer's face.

803
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,760
Sorry, please have a seat. Just a moment.

804
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,130
I used to be a customer at Jinshan Beauty Salon.

805
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,530
I've been in Japan for several years.

806
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,200
When I came back and wanted to get my hair done, I thought of you.

807
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,330
I didn't expect you'd changed your name.

808
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,200
And moved here.

809
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,070
Thank you.

810
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,370
You know about Jinshan Beauty Salon.

811
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,200
You really are an old customer.

812
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,600
And you came all the way here.

813
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,000
I'm truly honored.

814
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,530
I remember you used to have

815
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,800
another owner, didn't you?

816
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,470
You mean Meixia?

817
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,900
She passed away.

818
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,870
I'm so sorry.

819
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,070
It's okay.

820
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,370
Actually, in my heart,

821
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,200
she has never really left.

822
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,470
Especially when it gets crowded and busy,

823
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,900
I secretly scold her

824
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,560
for leaving before me and making me work so hard.

825
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,370
She must have felt very secure having you as a friend,

826
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,170
to entrust everything to you.

827
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,300
But I remember she was pregnant back then.

828
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,030
What about her child?

829
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,730
Well, she

830
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,700
trusted her good friend too much.

831
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,070
Not only did she leave me the salon,

832
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,200
she even left her child for me to raise.

833
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,870
Is a wash okay?

834
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,570
Yes.

835
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,570
Alright.

836
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,000
Miss, your hair is so beautiful.

837
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,970
Thank you. Good.

838
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,000
Wait a moment.

839
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,570
I'll get you a glass of water.

840
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,730
How is it? Pretty good, right?

841
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,500
After taking over the equipment and decor here,

842
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,370
Linshicha can use them directly.

843
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,130
Actually, it has everything we need.

844
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,000
Deng Weiyu.

845
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,930
This will be our

846
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,270
first shop.

847
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,900
That's great!

848
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,370
We can do this.

849
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,770
Let me take another look.

850
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,500
This place is really great.

851
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,630
With my skills,

852
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,090
we'll definitely do well.

853
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,530
That storefront we just saw was really nice.

854
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,730
The location and layout are beautiful.

855
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,900
Linshicha's progress has been so smooth,

856
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,770
thanks to Zhihao's help.

857
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:34,900
For your future work,

858
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,900
don't let him get involved anymore.

859
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,870
Why?

860
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,130
That Jiang Zhihao

861
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,530
is just like his mother, networking everywhere.

862
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,030
Who knows what he's plotting behind our backs.

863
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,600
Aunt Xiurong isn't that kind of person, is she?

864
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,700
I'm talking about

865
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,800
his biological mother.

866
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,830
How do you know about this?

867
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,570
If it weren't for Yongkuan

868
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,430
driving away that annoying woman,

869
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,830
you and I

870
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,960
probably wouldn't have even set foot in the Deng family.

871
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,900
Zhihao is quite pitiful,

872
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,070
an unwanted illegitimate child.

873
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,430
He still doesn't know anything.

874
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,800
What do you mean?

875
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,570
It means

876
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,200
We finally got rid of Deng Weikang.

877
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,960
You're not thinking of going after another one, are you?

878
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,600
If one day Linlin lets you take the lead,

879
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,700
what would you do?

880
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,600
Who is that woman?

881
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,800
That's Deng Weijie.

882
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,430
Deng Weijie.

883
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:41,570
Haven't I suffered enough these past few years?

884
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,530
You will never become He Meixia.

885
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,570
I just happened to remember someone.

886
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,700
Tell me who that bastard is.

887
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,870
He Meixia.

888
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,930
Do you even consider me a friend?

889
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,430
No matter what happens,

890
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,230
I'll always be by your side.

891
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,200
I just want an answer.

892
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,530
This is called making a fuss over nothing.

893
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,900
Deng Weiyu, what are you looking at?

894
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,570
Looking at you.
