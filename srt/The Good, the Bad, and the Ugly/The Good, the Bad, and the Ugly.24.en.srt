1
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,030
I used to wish

2
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,569
this bus could go a little faster.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,770
So I could see

4
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,300
beautiful scenery sooner.

5
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,400
Meet interesting people.

6
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,030
Arrive at my destination earlier.

7
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,070
But I later realized.

8
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,400
The faster the bus goes,

9
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,770
the sooner

10
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,400
I'll have to get off.

11
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,530
Passengers come and go.

12
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,130
I can't predict

13
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,669
who will get on next.

14
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,530
Nor can I stop them from leaving.

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,600
But at least

16
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,360
there will always be someone on this bus.

17
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,930
So you knew about the metal box all along.

18
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,830
Yes.

19
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Then why did you pretend not to know?

20
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,830
Although I didn't know what was inside,

21
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,800
I knew it was your way of showing you care.

22
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,370
But I just had this feeling

23
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,500
that I couldn't recover so quickly.

24
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
I needed to grieve more.

25
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,270
Maybe that would help me cope better.

26
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,730
I've been thinking a lot lately,

27
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,070
why did my mom go hiking?

28
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,670
Why did she need knee pads?

29
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,770
If I had found the knee pads earlier,

30
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,570
would she have never found that notebook?

31
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,430
She wouldn't have known Deng Yongkuan was my father.

32
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,470
So I feel like all of this

33
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,370
is my fault.

34
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,000
If I hadn't come back to Linlin,

35
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,000
if I hadn't been so nosy helping Deng Weiyu,

36
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,970
then wouldn't I wake up now

37
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,830
and still see my mom?

38
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,100
She'd still be nagging me every day.

39
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,670
Jiang Zhihao,

40
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,400
your singing is terrible.

41
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,970
Don't insult my idol.

42
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,300
My mom was such a good person

43
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,600
who worked hard her whole life.

44
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,430
She did nothing wrong.

45
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,100
It still hurts so much thinking about it.

46
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,670
What about now?

47
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,070
My mom once told me

48
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,900
what kind of hero makes her worry?

49
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,100
So I still want to be

50
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,270
her hero.

51
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,200
Hero,

52
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,700
you need to shave.

53
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,900
Hurry up, hero.

54
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Dad,

55
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
you wanted to see me?

56
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,960
I heard you requested a long vacation.

57
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,370
Yes.

58
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
I want to give myself some time

59
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,500
to travel

60
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,630
and reflect.

61
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,170
Once people get too comfortable,

62
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,630
it becomes difficult to push forward again.

63
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,830
In the end, you can only watch

64
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,270
as the things you want

65
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,730
are taken by others.

66
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,500
Just say what you want to say.

67
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,970
Now that Linshicha is on track,

68
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,270
I want to develop

69
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,570
a night breakfast sub-brand.

70
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,730
This project

71
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,130
will be led by you.

72
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,600
You should give it to someone

73
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,900
more suitable.

74
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,230
I always thought

75
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,370
you weren't the type

76
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,000
who would be defeated

77
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,470
by one failure.

78
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,800
Are you giving me this important project

79
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,500
because you truly want to develop me

80
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,030
or to use me as a counterbalance to Deng Weiyu?

81
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,570
I think we all know the answer deep down.

82
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Weijie.

83
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,200
So what?

84
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,300
An opportunity right in front of us is still an opportunity.

85
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,300
Is your ambition

86
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,470
really this limited?

87
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,130
So you've always seen through my ambition,

88
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,130
haven't you?

89
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,100
Then why no matter how hard I try,

90
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,830
in your heart,

91
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,930
I'm never your first choice?

92
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,770
It's not that I lack ability.

93
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,830
You know what?

94
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,730
Even now,

95
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,670
I still believe I'm more capable than Deng Weikang and Deng Weiyu.

96
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,930
Much more capable.

97
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,030
But no matter what I do,

98
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,600
I can never meet your expectations.

99
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,070
I used to think

100
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,670
that I wasn't trying hard enough.

101
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,100
So whenever you gave me just a little hope,

102
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,800
I would work desperately,

103
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,900
trying to prove to you

104
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,300
that I was the best.

105
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,470
Now I finally understand.

106
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,070
This is a race

107
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,200
I can never win.

108
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,700
I've decided to let myself go.

109
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,330
I won't be your pawn anymore.

110
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,370
I've said before,

111
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,960
Linlin Breakfast doesn't keep useless people.

112
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,500
Fine.

113
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,370
I'll leave.

114
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,100
Chairman.

115
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,660
Thank you for your guidance all these years.

116
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,600
Dad.

117
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,930
Take care.

118
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,470
Congratulations.

119
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,130
We should now call you

120
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,700
Director Deng, right?

121
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,470
Before long,

122
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,800
we should change it to

123
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,030
Deputy CEO Deng.

124
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,900
Everyone, fill your glasses. Deputy CEO,

125
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,300
let's celebrate our safe landing.

126
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,630
This meal today... Thank you, Deputy CEO.

127
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,900
It's on me.

128
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,000
Come on.

129
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,930
Are you going to give us a nickname?

130
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,570
What will it be?

131
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,930
The Five Tigers.

132
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,900
Cheers to prosperity!

133
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,130
Eat this.

134
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,330
I don't want it.

135
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,400
Eat it.

136
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,470
I don't want to eat.

137
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,630
I said eat it.

138
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,030
I said I don't want to.

139
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,100
Wait.

140
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
What is my mom doing?

141
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,200
God, they're being so lovey-dovey.

142
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm watching from the side

143
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
and I'm about to faint.

144
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,870
Oh my god.

145
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,800
Yeah, seriously.

146
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,130
Aren't they embarrassed?

147
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,530
Exactly.

148
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,130
Come on, her son is already grown up.

149
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,270
Right? Aren't you embarrassed?

150
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,030
Yeah.

151
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,830
So how many boxes should we buy?

152
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,700
Are two packages enough?

153
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,370
The way they're feeding each other,

154
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,630
Let's get three boxes.

155
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,930
Here, try this.

156
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,330
Pork grilled by Bohan.

157
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,430
Everyone, eat up.

158
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,530
It smells so good.

159
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,300
Smells delicious.

160
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,970
Try this.

161
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,670
Give it a try. Come on, eat.

162
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,600
Here, eat.

163
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,470
Okay.

164
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,330
Lin Liying.

165
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,100
Jiang Zhihao.

166
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,130
Why are you here?

167
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,570
Have you eaten yet?

168
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,030
Come, sit down and join us.

169
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,400
It's so lively here.

170
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,530
Hey.

171
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,600
What's with the potted plant?

172
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,770
Snake plant.

173
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,770
In my family, we have a tradition.

174
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,300
Whenever someone gets a girlfriend,

175
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,070
they bring a snake plant to her family.

176
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,270
Snake plant?

177
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,570
Since when does your family have that tradition?

178
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,030
Why haven't I heard your mother mention it?

179
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,300
Wait a minute.

180
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,400
Jiang Zhihao,

181
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Lin Liying,

182
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,200
are you two really...

183
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,430
Yes.

184
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,270
Jiang Zhihao and I are together now.

185
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,760
When did you two get together?

186
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,970
You haven't been secretly dating for decades, have you?

187
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,430
No.

188
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,430
We... we just got together recently.

189
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,000
We just couldn't find the right time

190
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,300
to properly tell everyone.

191
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,360
I've liked Lin Liying for a long time,

192
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,570
but I was afraid to take that step.

193
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,100
I was afraid we couldn't even remain friends.

194
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,070
I recently gathered my courage,

195
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,860
and fortunately, it turned out well.

196
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,730
Give it to me.

197
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,600
Yes.

198
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,970
Grandma Hongzhu,

199
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,170
Aunt Xueqing,

200
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,290
you've watched me grow up since I was little.

201
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,870
My strengths and weaknesses

202
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,470
you all know better than I do.

203
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,730
I promise you all.

204
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,470
I'll treat Liying well.

205
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,430
This looks nice.

206
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,630
You two make such a perfect couple.

207
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,930
I knew it.

208
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,230
You two would end up together.

209
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,770
That's why I've already

210
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,870
thought of names for your children.

211
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,870
Xueqing, don't you agree?

212
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,100
Jiang Zhihao,

213
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,830
remember

214
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,330
every word you've said today.

215
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,000
You must treat our Liying well.

216
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,330
I'll definitely ask your mother in heaven

217
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,100
to watch over you with me.

218
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,900
Okay.

219
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,930
Lin Liying.

220
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,530
This is my first time coming to your room

221
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,830
as your boyfriend.

222
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,030
It's not any different.

223
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,270
The closet is over there.

224
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,200
The vanity is here.

225
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,030
The cactus is here.

226
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,870
So you always give your girlfriends

227
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,070
snake plants?

228
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,630
No,

229
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,730
it's my first time.

230
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,460
You're sitting in Grandma's spot.

231
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,970
I thought this was your family tradition.

232
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,170
No,

233
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,300
I made that up.

234
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,870
Because I just saw you with Gao Bohan

235
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,270
in front of the grocery store,

236
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,700
being all lovey-dovey.

237
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,270
So I found an excuse to come over

238
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,800
to make him give up on you.

239
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,500
I...

240
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I wasn't doing anything with him.

241
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,300
Why a snake plant?

242
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,330
I brought it from my backyard.

243
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,330
You were just with Gao Bohan in front of the store.

244
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,060
Need me to refresh your memory?

245
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,600
I wasn't doing anything.

246
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,330
Nothing happened?

247
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,130
No.

248
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,870
Did he put his arm around your shoulder?

249
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,830
I don't think so.

250
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,870
He also touched you here.

251
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,670
He wouldn't touch me there.

252
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,130
He touched you here... He wouldn't touch...

253
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,869
Oh!

254
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,900
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
I'll...

257
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,099
I'll come back later.

258
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,670
What are they doing in there?

259
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,270
We're going to have grandchildren!

260
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,400
That's impossible.

261
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
We're still at home.

262
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,270
Really?

263
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,329
Let me see.

264
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,700
Mom!

265
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,630
Hello, Mrs. Lin.

266
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,500
It's fine.

267
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,930
Carry on, carry on.

268
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,230
I'll close the door for you.

269
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,930
Continue. Don't mind me.

270
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,830
Continue.

271
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,230
They're right outside!

272
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,630
Then let's go to my place.

273
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,270
This is from your favorite wheel cake shop.

274
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,230
When I went to buy it,

275
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,230
the owner suddenly started chatting with me.

276
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,500
She talked forever.

277
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,070
She told me about all

278
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,070
her breakups since childhood.

279
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,670
She even started crying.

280
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,200
I was trying so hard not to laugh.

281
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,130
Yeah, I wanted to say,

282
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,300
are we that close?

283
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,030
Why are you telling me all this?

284
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,670
- Dad.
- Bro.

285
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,900
Good morning.

286
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,230
Being VP isn't easy,

287
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,560
having to go to headquarters on weekends.

288
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,330
I just discussed with Dad.

289
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,730
That Night Breakfast brand

290
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,170
will be my responsibility.

291
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,430
So you can focus on the Jet Lag project.

292
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,130
I have more good news.

293
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,700
I'm planning to take over as Marketing Director again.

294
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,030
That position shouldn't be left vacant.

295
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,200
As for the marketing department,

296
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,930
it's better to have family in charge.

297
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,470
I can help you then,

298
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,030
so you won't be so busy.

299
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,500
Should I thank you properly then?

300
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,670
No need to thank family.

301
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,800
Silly.

302
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,170
Dad,

303
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:53,900
isn't your birthday coming up?

304
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,500
How do you want to celebrate?

305
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Just a simple dinner with everyone is fine.

306
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,760
No way. Birthdays need to be special.

307
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,070
Weiyu,

308
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,800
Weijie is abroad.

309
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,870
So it's just me and Weiyu.

310
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,170
We'll celebrate your birthday properly.

311
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,970
Make some time to celebrate Dad's birthday, okay?

312
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,270
After all, it's her and her grandmother's room.

313
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,470
What can I do about it?

314
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,170
Why don't you just come back home then?

315
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,900
Your place is so close to there.

316
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,100
What's going on in your head?

317
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,070
What to do when you crave breakfast late at night?

318
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,330
A well-known breakfast chain,

319
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,030
Linlin Breakfast has come up with a bold move.

320
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,130
They've announced the upcoming launch of

321
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,600
a sub-brand selling breakfast at night,

322
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,970
targeting young people who enjoy nightlife.

323
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,430
Let's take a look.

324
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,470
Look,

325
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,130
since Deng Weiyu won the competition,

326
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,000
Linlin Breakfast in Taiwan

327
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,870
has been absolutely dominating.

328
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,130
Linshicha has been open for less than a year,

329
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,730
and they're already launching another brand.

330
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,260
Alright, let's start another round.

331
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,270
OK.

332
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,760
Looks like it's going to rain.

333
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,200
I'll go get the laundry. Wait for me.

334
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,070
OK.

335
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,870
Jiang Zhilu is such an idiot.

336
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,400
I told her to bring an umbrella but she forgot.

337
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,560
Hey, excuse me. I'm looking for Lulu.

338
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,000
Not here.

339
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,600
Went to Mama-san's place.

340
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,100
Okay.

341
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,870
Around what time was that?

342
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
No, I just happened to be running some errands here.

343
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,830
I thought since it's raining,

344
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,770
you might not have an umbrella,

345
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,200
so I came to pick you up.

346
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,270
Super Girl.

347
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,530
This is the umbrella I brought from her place.

348
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,830
No, no.

349
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,730
Jiang Zhihao asked me to come.

350
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,190
He was worried you'd catch a cold in the rain.

351
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,470
That doesn't sound right either.

352
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,230
How should I put it?

353
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,000
What a coincidence.

354
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,300
You're crazy.

355
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,630
No, no.

356
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,900
I just came here to buy something,

357
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,230
so I thought I'd pick you up while I'm here.

358
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,330
Why are you here?

359
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,300
Mom had acute gastroenteritis.

360
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,600
I just took her to the hospital and came back.

361
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,730
The rain is so heavy.

362
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,030
So you didn't see Niu Yifei?

363
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,830
Why would I see Niu Yifei?

364
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,430
When it started raining,

365
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,370
he grabbed an umbrella and rushed out.

366
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,100
I guess he went looking for you.

367
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,870
He's not standing outside the hotel,

368
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,870
waiting foolishly, is he?

369
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,930
It's possible.

370
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,730
This idiot.

371
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,670
Really is an idiot.

372
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,870
I saw

373
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,300
Niu Yifei.

374
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,670
When did you leave?

375
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,970
How come I didn't see you?

376
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,470
Are you an idiot?

377
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,030
Why didn't you bring your phone?

378
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,830
You made me come back to find you.

379
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,730
Do you know how expensive taxis are?

380
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,500
And the rain is so heavy.

381
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,930
Can't you find shelter?

382
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,970
It's strange. You have a mouth.

383
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,730
Don't you know how to use it?

384
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,130
Did I ask you to pick me up?

385
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,270
What?

386
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,500
I didn't think that much.

387
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,960
This makes me feel touched.

389
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,330
Don't do this next time.

390
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,730
Come here.

391
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,530
Unless you remember to bring an umbrella from now on,

392
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,330
otherwise I'll keep doing this.

393
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,400
Hello.

394
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,300
Do you have an appointment?

395
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,230
We're looking for Mr. Deng Weikang.

396
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,470
Which department are you from?

397
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,800
Investigation Bureau.

398
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,400
Mr. Deng?

399
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,800
Mr. Deng Weikang,

400
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,970
you're suspected of violating securities law through insider trading.

401
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,470
We will legally seize evidence

402
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,330
and ask for your cooperation in our investigation.

403
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,330
Mr. Deng,

404
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,770
please come with us for questioning.

405
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,770
This way, please.

406
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,330
Deng Weikang, heir to a famous chain breakfast restaurant,

407
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,070
is suspected in an insider trading scandal

408
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,030
and has been summoned by prosecutors.

409
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,630
Lin Shiwei, CEO of Baiwu Biotech,

410
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,770
and Vice President Chen Ziyang

411
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,400
allegedly leaked information before the company's listing

412
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,070
to their friends.

413
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,570
Deng Weikang and others purchased large amounts of stock,

414
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,500
with illegal transactions worth nearly 10 million Taiwan dollars.

415
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,930
They were recently arrested by police

416
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,060
and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

417
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,530
Boss, give me another egg pancake.

418
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,700
Another egg pancake, right?

419
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,600
With bacon?

420
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,400
With bacon. Got it.

421
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,330
Chairman.

422
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,230
Did you do it?

423
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,930
You've already hit me,

424
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,430
how can I say it wasn't me?

425
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,500
Deng Weikang is your brother.

426
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,760
Do you really want to see him go to prison?

427
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,030
Deng Weikang was stupid enough to trade stocks using the company computer.

428
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,630
Even if it wasn't me, someone else would have discovered it.

429
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,000
For Linlin's future,

430
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,700
this is my only choice.

431
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,900
To take over this company,

432
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,870
you've lost your humanity.

433
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,530
Each of us

434
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,860
must be responsible for our own mistakes.

435
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,130
The person sending him to jail isn't me,

436
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,470
but himself.

437
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,130
The only pawn you have left now

438
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,770
is me.

439
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,200
Or if you want to give Linlin to someone else,

440
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,000
I have no objection.

441
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,930
Please make your own decision, Chairman.

442
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,000
Go away.

443
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,300
Zhilu.

444
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,130
The food here is so expensive.

445
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,790
Didn't you say you wanted to eat something nice?

446
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,800
It's fine.

447
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,030
Today is a special day.

448
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,070
Let's eat.

449
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,960
It's quite delicious.

450
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,830
Mr. Shide.

451
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,070
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

452
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,370
We're together now.

453
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,100
We just never found the right time to tell you.

454
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,530
It doesn't matter whether you told me or not.

455
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,430
I figured it out long ago.

456
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,800
When Zhihao locked himself in his room,

457
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,830
you were more worried

458
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,970
than any of us.

459
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,600
That's when I knew

460
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
you'd make a good daughter-in-law.

461
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,700
I...

462
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,670
Daughter-in-law? That's too sudden. We...

463
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,730
We haven't been together that long.

464
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,970
But you've known each other for a long time.

465
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,870
I was thinking of talking to Xueqing today,

466
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,770
and Mrs. Hongzhu,

467
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,200
to discuss with them

468
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,560
about setting your wedding date this year. How about that?

469
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,900
No way! You're all so crazy.

470
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,570
Grandma even said

471
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,730
she's already picked names for the children.

472
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,700
Are you pregnant?

473
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,200
No.

474
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,930
What? Where are you going?

475
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,100
Are you embarrassed?

476
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,530
Going to the bathroom.

477
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,770
Why am I left here alone?

478
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,370
He's embarrassed. He's shy.

479
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,170
Chairman, your cake is ready.

480
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,770
What a coincidence.

481
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,400
Having dinner with friends?

482
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,130
I'm having dinner with my girlfriend and my father.

483
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,330
How is his health?

484
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,600
Everything's fine.

485
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,100
That's good.

486
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,130
I won't disturb your cake cutting then.

487
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,570
I wish you good health.

488
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,200
You shouldn't say that. He'll...

489
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,130
You're back.

490
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,930
Why were you gone so long?

491
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,230
Did you fall into the toilet?

492
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,200
No, I didn't.

493
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,730
What are you talking about?

494
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,130
If you hadn't come back,

495
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,300
they would have named

496
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,530
your second child too.

497
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,600
The first one is called Jiang Jiang,

498
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
the second one Jiang Jiang,

499
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
and together that makes

500
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,330
Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang.

501
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,300
[Laughs]

502
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,970
Why haven't you eaten anything?

503
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,600
I want to eat fish.

504
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,800
Mrs. Jiang.

505
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,469
Mrs. Jiang has to go to work now.

506
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,100
I have a meeting today.

507
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,159
You just got registered today and already have to work?

508
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,600
I can't help it.

509
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Sister Shanru won't let me off.

510
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,530
And I have a business trip to San Francisco next week.

511
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,030
Take this to Shanru.

512
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,600
Show it off to her.

513
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,630
If Shanru and I

514
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,199
both fell into the sea,

515
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,469
who would you save?

516
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,600
I'd save...

517
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,830
my husband.

518
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,070
Let's go.

519
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,270
Don't be late today.

520
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,830
Goodbye, boss.

521
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,770
Boss lady!

522
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,130
Cheer up!

523
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,600
I love you.

524
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,630
Congratulations.

525
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,170
Thank you all for coming today

526
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,170
to our first party after getting registered.

527
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,500
Congratulations to us!

528
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,600
May we have children soon.

529
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,300
Happiness and joy to all.

530
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,200
Here, this bottle of spring wine is on the house today.

531
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,170
Congratulations on your marriage.

532
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,670
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.

533
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,670
Thank you, Mom.

534
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,770
Thanks.

535
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Good wine.

536
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,330
Of course. It's necessary.

537
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,670
I'll request a song for you.

538
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,070
Thanks.

539
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,600
Lin Liying

540
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,800
just wearing that outfit this morning for registration.

541
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,570
Find some time

542
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,230
to take wedding photos.

543
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,830
Grandma, don't worry.

544
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,700
Grandma, we'll definitely find time

545
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
to take nice photos.

546
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,970
Really? Really?

547
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,300
As long as the young people are happy.

548
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,830
Make sure they're beautiful.

549
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,470
Isn't she beautiful enough?

550
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,500
She looks like a fairy.

551
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,430
Thanks, Dad. I'll be responsible.

552
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,270
Congratulations.

553
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,970
Your song. The song's on.

554
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,700
Sing well. I like you.

555
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,270
Don't go off-key.

556
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,330
When I call you

557
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,200
pick up within three rings.

558
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,070
A chance meeting at the coffee shop

559
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,400
they say love is luck.

560
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,200
The late night radio

561
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,570
plays our love song.

562
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,730
All evidence proves my heart is moved.

563
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,470
Forever in love, loving endlessly.

564
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,000
You like me too, don't you?

565
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,570
Don't suppress the secret in your heart.

566
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,530
It's not too late to say it now.

567
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,530
Please don't turn this story into a sad one.

568
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,230
Forever in love

569
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,200
though it doesn't have to be with you.

570
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,870
Mom.

571
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,170
I promised I would practice this song well.

572
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,430
When I got married

573
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,100
I would sing it for you.

574
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,370
Today I got married.

575
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,100
Did you hear me?

576
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,400
I was listening carefully.

577
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,070
You still missed a few notes.

578
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,030
After you were gone

579
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,030
Zhilu and I

580
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,170
and Dad

581
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,800
we've all been living well.

582
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,170
I know.

583
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,530
You'll always be Mom's big hero.

584
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,530
Mom.

585
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,700
I miss you so much.

586
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,230
Forever in love

587
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,530
though it doesn't have to be with you.

588
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,200
You've improved.

589
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,730
Singing. Drinking.

590
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,500
My brother got married.

591
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,900
You saw it.

592
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,970
Jiang Zhihao.

593
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,000
The company car is almost here.

594
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Where are you?

595
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,830
Didn't you promise to take me?

596
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,200
It's about to rain.

597
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,100
Hurry up! I need to go to the airport.

598
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,130
Bye-bye.

599
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,630
Thank you.

600
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,600
You're welcome.

601
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,670
Welcome.

602
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,600
Have I been upgraded to business class?

603
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,130
Let me check for you.

604
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:38,800
Yes,

605
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,130
your seat is up front.

606
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,130
This way.

607
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,200
Thank you.

608
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,170
I'll prepare a drink for you.

609
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,070
Okay.

610
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,030
Honey, you're taking too long.

611
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,570
Why are you here?

612
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,770
To accompany you on your business trip.

613
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,330
So,

614
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,100
you arranged all this?

615
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,070
We can't stay in a San Francisco beauty salon for 30 years.

616
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,730
You've never even been to San Francisco, right?

617
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,400
Let me be clear.

618
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,730
Apart from work,

619
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,600
all your time belongs to me.

620
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
So domineering.

621
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,130
Otherwise it's too difficult to get you to go on a honeymoon.

622
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,170
A honeymoon sounds so nice.

623
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,930
Here's your champagne.

624
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,230
Thank you. Enjoy.

625
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,970
Cheers.

626
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,230
I want to see the Golden Gate Bridge.

627
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,170
Golden Gate Bridge?

628
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,200
Sure.

629
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,030
Then I want to see the Warriors.

630
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,430
I've already bought tickets. Come with me?

631
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,500
Okay.

632
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,530
Who is it?

633
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,830
It's Shanru.

634
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,630
Miss,

635
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,690
you can't use your phone on the plane.

636
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,060
Where else do you want to go?

637
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,470
I don't know.

638
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,800
You can decide how we spend our honeymoon.

639
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,000
Then don't go to work.

640
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,630
That's not possible.

641
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,000
How could I do that?

642
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,070
Our San Francisco journey begins here.

643
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,800
After that journey,

644
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,170
we both got new identities.

645
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,770
I became a father.

646
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,400
Liying became a mother.

647
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,170
Life's journey is still long,

648
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,130
just like that bus

649
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,030
that keeps moving forward.

650
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,370
And my family's story

651
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,800
continues on.

652
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,070
Where are we going today?

653
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,330
Where do you want to go?

654
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,900
I want to go camping.

655
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,770
Sure, we can start from here.

656
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,560
Turn around, I'll take a photo for you.

657
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,200
Let me take a picture for you.

658
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,900
Good.

659
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,400
Look at uncle.

660
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,000
Ask uncle to take our photo. Look here. Come on.

661
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,800
So cute. So cute.
