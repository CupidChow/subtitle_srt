1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,070
It's all because you love showing off.

2
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,370
Serves you right.

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,800
I never expected to run into you here, senior.

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,000
Did that buffet across from school close down?

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,600
No.

6
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
I heard their business is doing so well

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,730
they're expanding.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,460
That's also your senior from Qi University.

9
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,770
I don't know him.

10
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,130
Auntie Ali.

11
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,470
I've finished.

12
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
What is this?

13
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,729
Looks good, right?

14
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,229
Ali, it looks great.

15
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,300
Why did you style my hair like this?

16
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,830
It's very stylish.

17
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,900
You really have talent.

18
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,700
Let's take a photo as a memento, okay?

19
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,870
Include me in the photo too.

20
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,830
I'll post it online later, Jiang Zhihao.

21
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,030
What are you doing? Promoting this dry noodle place?

22
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,970
Doing some advertising.

23
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,870
Get away.

24
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,230
Stop messing around.

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,430
Go away! Look at this.

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,130
Ali, I'm sorry. Look at this.

27
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll fix it for you.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,270
Wait for me a moment.

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,930
You're dead.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,900
What are you doing? Really.

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,830
Auntie, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,829
Look what you did to my eyes.

33
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,130
They're burning.

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,370
Auntie Xiang, it's okay.

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,329
I was just... Xiang.

36
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,730
I just made a mistake here. Let me.

37
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,600
It's fine. I'll do it.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,930
I don't want you to style me anymore. Auntie Xiang.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,570
I'm sorry, Xiang.

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,730
Auntie Xiang, that one hasn't been removed yet.

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,329
Auntie Xiang.

42
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,470
Don't worry, I'll give you a box of dry noodles.

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,400
Stop it. Xiang.

44
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,630
Mom, I know I made a mistake. It's just this...

45
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,230
Are you a spy from that beauty salon on the main road

46
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,930
sent here as a spy?

47
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,500
Are you trying to ruin my business?

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,070
It's not that serious.

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,400
He just lost his job

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,470
and he's feeling down.

51
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,030
It's normal to make mistakes.

52
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,970
I promise you

53
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,370
once my dry noodle business makes money,

54
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,829
he can come work for me.

55
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,630
You're the troublemaker here.

56
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,230
Just try mentioning dry noodles one more time.

57
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,270
Mom, I've always styled hair this way.

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,330
It's just a breakfast shop.

59
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,730
What's the big deal?

60
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,500
Why are you so devastated?

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
Worst case, we can open our own place.

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,829
It's not that simple.

63
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,030
I don't have any money.

64
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,130
Who needs money?

65
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,900
When I opened my beauty salon,

66
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,930
I just put down a chair

67
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,370
and it became a salon.

68
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,800
Don't we have a mahjong table at home?

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,329
Just set it up and you've got a breakfast shop.

70
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,870
That'll be 35 yuan.

71
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,300
Okay, got it.

72
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,070
Welcome back to

73
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,870
Breakfast with the World

74
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,070
championship finals

75
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,100
Join us to witness

76
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,700
the birth of a champion.

77
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,100
Now,

78
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,070
who will be the champion

79
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,600
is right here in my hands.

80
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,800
Breakfast with the World's

82
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,770
champion this season is...

83
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,500
Linshicha, Deng Weiyu!

84
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,300
Congratulations!

85
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,530
Congratulations! That's truly amazing.

86
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,030
Let's welcome Ms. Mana to present the award.

87
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,200
Congratulations!

88
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,600
Chef, please look to your right.

89
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,200
All those over there are

90
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,970
prizes you can take home.

91
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,100
Congratulations!

92
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,630
Chef, you've worked so hard.

93
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,230
Is there anything you'd like

94
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,670
to say to our audience?

95
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,500
Although we've already achieved this,

96
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,730
this award

97
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,700
allows us to speak louder

98
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,670
and more confidently tell everyone that

99
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,800
Linshicha

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
is the best brunch restaurant.

101
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,100
But finally,

102
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,000
there is one restaurant

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,270
that was previously eliminated,

104
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,730
but with 72.52%

105
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,930
overwhelming votes,

106
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,430
it won our Audience Choice Award.

107
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,430
That is

108
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,900
San Francisco Beauty Salon.

109
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,200
Congratulations!

110
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,370
Chef Jiang Zhihao.

111
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,830
He's not here today.

112
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,370
This is his acceptance speech... There isn't one.

113
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,770
Chef Jiang Zhihao couldn't come

114
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,600
due to other commitments, but

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,400
his acceptance speech has arrived.

116
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,770
Let's see what he wrote.

117
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,230
He says:

118
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,100
Thank you.

119
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,000
Very concise and powerful.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,770
We hope all his fans will understand.

121
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,700
Remember to visit his store

122
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,170
and show your support.

123
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,430
And here I'd like to thank our champion

124
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,370
and all our contestants.

125
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,200
Also our judges,

126
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,270
and most importantly,

127
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,100
our lovely and enthusiastic audience.

128
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,930
Thank you all.

129
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,030
We'll meet again.

130
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,600
Goodbye.

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,830
Bye-bye.

132
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,570
The winner of the Most Popular Award in the hit show,

133
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,200
the head chef of San Francisco Beauty Salon,

134
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,500
did not participate in the final episode recording

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,230
and there are even rumors of closure,

136
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,970
causing many people to visit

137
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,030
only to find it closed, creating an awkward situation.

138
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,970
Did you just watch the TV news?

139
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,330
Zhihao's restaurant

140
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,000
has been closed for a week.

141
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,870
Yes,

142
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,370
I saw that too.

143
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,669
How did it come to this?

144
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,630
I finally saw him

145
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,270
come so far,

146
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,170
and now he's back to square one.

147
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,100
It's really sad.

148
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,530
I'm home.

149
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,770
Welcome back.

150
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,170
Need any help?

151
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,730
No, I've got it.

152
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,030
Why do you look so tired?

153
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,670
Work has been busy.

154
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,870
It'll get better once the event is over.

155
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,170
Lin Liying.

156
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,790
Have you been in touch with Zhihao recently?

157
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,830
It's all over the news.

158
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,470
His restaurant has been closed for a while.

159
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,300
Is he okay?

160
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,200
Yes,

161
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,170
we've been texting.

162
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,470
Don't worry,

163
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,870
he's like a cockroach that can't be killed.

164
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,170
I'll make you some soup

165
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,830
to help with your complexion.

166
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,370
Mom, I'll come with you.

167
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,770
I'll help you.

168
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,300
You're both going downstairs. What about me?

169
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,200
Is that okay?

170
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,030
I really look like a crazy woman, don't I?

171
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,000
Something is definitely wrong.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,700
Fine,

173
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,130
I'll send you one last message.

174
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,070
Hurry up!

175
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,300
Mom, slow down a bit.

176
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,730
Come on. You're still carrying things.

177
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,070
Alright.

178
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,530
Careful.

179
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,200
Grandma Hongzhu, Aunt Xueqing,

180
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,400
come in quickly.

181
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, you're here.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
Acting like you're hiding from debt collectors.

183
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,600
Customers who miss breakfast

184
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,830
are scarier than debt collectors.

185
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,470
So frightening.

186
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,870
Aunt Xueqing,

187
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,970
is that food?

188
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,230
Yes,

189
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,100
lots of it.

190
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,830
Pork, chicken, and fish.

191
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,770
You're eating already?

192
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,670
Yes,

193
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,400
we haven't stopped.

194
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Breakfast, lunch, dinner,

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,830
snacks, midnight meals.

196
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm starting to miss the feeling of being hungry.

197
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,870
We have no choice.

198
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,270
There are so many supplies

199
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,130
that will expire if we don't eat them.

200
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,430
It's okay.

201
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,230
Even though we can't help much,

202
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,130
we can help by eating.

203
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,630
Here. Thank you.

204
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,670
Eat more.

205
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,630
Help eat. Come on. Quick. Good.

206
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,470
Okay, I'll do it myself.

207
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,830
Eat more. Okay.

208
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,330
Where are we going?

209
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,430
To the convenience store up ahead.

210
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,330
So that day, Zhilu's boyfriend's mother

211
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,000
just left on her own,

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
didn't ask anyone for help,

213
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,260
and didn't call an ambulance.

214
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,360
How could someone be so cruel?

215
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,130
But they said

216
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,170
they thought Xiurong was joking.

217
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,170
Do you believe that?

218
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,100
Do you all believe it?

219
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Do you really not believe

220
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,730
there are such evil people

221
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,530
who deserve to die in this world?

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,870
Grandma Hongzhu is right.

223
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,700
People like that

224
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,270
should be taught a lesson.

225
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,170
No, no.

226
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,430
This kind of person,

227
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,200
we should just ignore them.

228
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,530
Evil deeds will be punished.

229
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,300
Heaven will punish them.

230
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,000
Those who are alive

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,970
need to move forward

232
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,400
and look ahead.

233
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,630
Are you hungry?

234
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,270
We could go get something to eat

235
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,900
or watch a movie.

236
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,770
Deng Weiyu.

237
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,000
I have something to tell you.

238
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,330
I've made up my mind.

239
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
Do you have to be in such a hurry?

240
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,970
Let's

241
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,300
break up.

242
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,570
I don't want to.

243
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,170
Why is this something

244
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,130
you can decide on your own?

245
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,400
Shouldn't we discuss it?

246
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,070
Don't I even get a chance

247
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,500
to explain myself?

248
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,470
Haven't you also thought many times

249
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,930
about breaking up with me?

250
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,130
For example,

251
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,490
when you found out Jiang Zhihao is your brother.

252
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,000
So this matter

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,930
we've both considered it.

254
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,000
If today someone has to

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,530
make a decision,

256
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,200
then I'll do it.

257
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,200
I admit I've struggled,

258
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,970
but now I've made up my mind.

259
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,100
I want us to be together.

260
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,330
But when I look at your face,

261
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,230
I can't pretend.

262
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,070
I can't pretend

263
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,600
that your mother had nothing to do with my mother's death.

264
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,400
My mother is my mother, and I am me.

265
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,230
What does that have to do with me?

266
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,630
Don't you love me anymore?

267
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,330
I'm only now realizing

268
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,460
there are problems that love can't solve.

269
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,670
This is the last payment.

270
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,330
Interest is included.

271
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,770
Don't do this.

272
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,599
It's fine.

273
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,630
Thank you.

274
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,870
Handsome.

275
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,100
Mom told me you've been to Japan before.

276
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,000
Have you been to hotels in Ginza?

277
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,970
I haven't been there.

278
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,600
Actually, this is my first time at this place in Taiwan.

279
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,470
Really? I have a client today

280
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,730
who's meeting me here.

281
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,770
Since your client hasn't arrived yet,

282
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,300
Lulu will keep you company.

283
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,430
Thank you.

284
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,270
Do you know

285
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,830
around here,

286
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,570
how we say 'I like you'?

287
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,670
How?

288
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I'd like a bottle of Black Label.

289
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,370
It's on Lulu.

290
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,530
Excuse me,

291
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,570
this is complimentary from our bar.

292
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,230
Hello.

293
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,400
Lulu,

294
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,170
Weiyu just called.

295
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:45,970
He said he wants to treat

296
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,600
everyone to drinks from the bar.

297
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,130
Did something good happen?

298
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,300
Did he win a bonus?

299
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,930
We should celebrate.

300
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,070
What's wrong?

301
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,130
Mom,

302
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,570
around here...

303
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,430
How do we say 'breaking up'?

304
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,830
You broke up?

305
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,000
Are you okay?

306
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
It's nothing,

307
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
really.

308
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,000
Did you hear that?

309
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,130
I'm single now.

310
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,100
I forgot to ask your name.

311
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,630
I'm Ding Zhiming.

312
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,900
Hello. And...

313
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,430
actually, I have a girlfriend.

314
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,470
She's in Japan.

315
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,100
She just got pregnant.

316
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,870
You sang really well just now.

317
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,900
Thank you.

318
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,930
Well, to celebrate your girlfriend's pregnancy,

319
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,970
let's drink all the alcohol

320
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,300
here today, shall we?

321
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,130
You mean

322
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,030
these three bottles?

323
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,900
Sure.

324
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,230
Can't hold your liquor?

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,200
It's okay.

326
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,570
I can drink more.

327
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,000
Weiyu.

328
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,470
Stop drinking.

329
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,430
Here.

330
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,060
Have some hot soup.

331
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,170
You'll feel better.

332
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,700
Why are you making this so late?

333
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,430
You like drinking it.

334
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,770
I know you've been working hard and are tired lately.

335
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,030
So today

336
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,770
I'll cook for you.

337
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,230
When you feel bloated, press the Neiguan acupoint.

338
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,970
Sincerely.

339
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,900
Is your hand bothering you again?

340
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,070
It's nothing. Just an old problem.

341
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,600
Drink up.

342
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,900
You'll feel better.

343
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,900
Is it good?

344
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,430
If drinking something delicious

345
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,730
can improve your mood,

346
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,330
then life doesn't seem so difficult after all.

347
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,530
Weiyu.

348
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,330
Is there something bothering you lately?

349
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,730
You can tell me.

350
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,600
It's fine.

351
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,600
Jiang Zhihao

352
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,800
Jiang Zhihao,

353
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,530
if you don't open the door, I'll call a locksmith.

354
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,830
Jiang Zhihao!

355
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,100
I haven't seen you for so long.

356
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,070
I'm so happy.

357
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,900
Why are you talking like that?

358
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
Like what?

359
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,330
I'm working from home today.

360
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,870
So I can stay here all day.

361
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,400
I'll work here.

362
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,670
Is that okay?

363
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,700
Lin Liying.

364
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,030
I'm really fine.

365
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,700
I know.

366
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,900
You're fine, I'm fine too.

367
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,670
But look at you.

368
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,370
Haven't seen you for days.

369
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,930
How are you still so handsome?

370
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,170
Look.

371
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,700
This stylish slicked-back hair.

372
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,470
And this scruffy little mustache.

373
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,100
Such an adorable mess.

374
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,630
Hello.

375
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,660
Yes, I've already received those files.

376
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,230
Right.

377
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,870
But the timing for the lighting and sound setup

378
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,270
needs to be adjusted.

379
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,570
That time is extremely busy.

380
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,870
Okay.

381
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,070
Want some fruit?

382
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,370
Have some fruit!

383
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,300
I cut some apples for you.

384
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,500
Very sweet.

385
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,230
Sweet like me.

386
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,430
Hello.

387
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,370
Yes, Amy has already confirmed the files.

388
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,200
So please arrange for a courier now

389
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,860
to deliver it to that address.

390
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,300
What?

391
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Something was delivered to my home?

392
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,230
I'll be back in a bit.

393
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,730
Yes.

394
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,830
No, bring it here

395
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,090
to my current address.

396
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,970
Right, I'll go get it now.

397
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,530
Are you okay?

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,500
Am I trying to kill my own husband here?

399
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,330
Are you alright?

400
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,270
Let me see.

401
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm fine. Good that you're okay.

402
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
Poor thing.

403
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,170
I'll come back to comfort you later.

404
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,800
This is way too small.

405
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,770
Hello.

406
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,770
I just received this card.

407
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,970
Look.

408
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,300
The size isn't right.

409
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,830
It's too small.

410
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,970
And it doesn't even cover my face.

411
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,000
And that...

412
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,070
Exactly.

413
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,770
But it covers his face.

414
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,170
I'll call you back later.

415
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,130
Okay.

416
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,970
I've been really busy lately.

417
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,100
That's why I wanted

418
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,200
to come here and spend time with you.

419
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,230
Lin Liying.

420
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,830
Thank you.

421
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,490
Thank you for staying with me,

422
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,230
but you really don't have to do this.

423
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,830
It's so nice having you with me.

424
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,430
Thank you.

425
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,430
Jiang Zhihao.

426
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,470
Jiang Zhihao, put me down!

427
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,030
Jiang Zhihao!

428
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,530
Go to work now.

429
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,300
Jiang Zhi...

430
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,270
Jiang Zhihao.

431
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,700
Jiang Zhihao.

432
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,270
Jiang Zhihao.

433
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,430
I'm already working from home today.

434
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,500
So I can stay here

435
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,670
all day long.

436
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,230
Be careful on your way.

437
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,900
Xiurong.

438
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,130
In this regard,

439
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,400
you're so much better than me.

440
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,430
I really can't handle it.

441
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,630
I don't know why Zhihao

442
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,890
keeps himself locked in his room all day.

443
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,500
And Zhilu?

444
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,900
I don't know how to comfort her either.

445
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,470
But you need to tell me

446
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,370
what I should do.

447
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,670
Zhihao and Zhilu both say

448
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,130
they've dreamed about you.

449
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,730
But me?

450
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,800
Not even once.

451
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Are you that confident in me?

452
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,000
But look at me,

453
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,690
I'm making a complete mess of things.

454
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,300
I haven't even taken good care of the children.

455
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm asking you,

456
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,400
will we really be able to get through this?

457
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,930
Thank you all.

458
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,470
Welcome to Notus Toast,

459
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,500
dear friends who joined us today.

460
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,130
I believe you're eager to experience

461
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,330
our DIY hot-pressed toast activity.

462
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,830
Those who complete the activity

463
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,370
will receive stickers designed by Mr. Baimu.

464
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,900
Bestie stickers! Oh, you're here.

465
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,400
There are so many people! Friends outside.

466
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,130
Yes, you're really popular now.

467
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,170
After that pink toast appeared on the show,

468
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,800
your fans increased dramatically.

469
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,900
Oh my!

470
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,930
I'm coming down.

471
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,070
Liying, were you looking for me?

472
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,030
Yes, I wanted to...

473
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,170
You go ahead. Okay.

474
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,630
I wanted to tell you about

475
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,770
that bestie challenge.

476
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,200
Don't ask this question.

477
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,060
These two questions at the end...

478
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,000
Big star!

479
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,530
I didn't have time to greet you earlier.

480
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,300
Here you go.

481
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,500
For this reason,

482
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I forgive you.

483
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,130
You look like you've been tired all day

484
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,400
and haven't eaten anything.

485
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,170
I've been working overtime.

486
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,570
How is Jiang Zhihao doing?

487
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,670
You've heard about his mother, right?

488
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,330
Right now, he's

489
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,530
not opening his shop,

490
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,200
not going out,

491
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,030
he's like a completely broken person.

492
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,800
It's been a huge blow to him.

493
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,400
This time, his depression

494
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,730
feels very different.

495
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,670
I've been trying to comfort him

496
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,730
and cheer him up.

497
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,530
But I don't know if he's overthinking things

498
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,170
or what's going on.

499
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,700
Or maybe it's me,

500
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,870
my comforting is terrible,

501
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,330
too much like a buddy.

502
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,200
Yes, Lin Liying,

503
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,600
that's exactly the point.

504
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,800
What?

505
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,630
You're not his buddy,

506
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,670
you're his

507
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,600
girlfriend.

508
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Have you seen how you look every day?

509
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,430
You're too haggard.

510
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,070
Your hair is a mess.

511
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,130
You can't wear the same

512
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,500
T-shirt and jeans every day.

513
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,030
Those dark circles!

514
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,230
How can you give Jiang Zhihao strength like this?

515
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,000
Bring out your charm as a girlfriend,

516
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,200
okay?

517
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,200
What exactly should a girlfriend do?

518
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,460
I've done everything I'm supposed to do.

519
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,690
You're Jiang Zhihao's only strength right now.

520
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,870
When facing this kind of situation,

521
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,070
no one can bear it alone.

522
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,470
Just be there for him

523
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,730
as his girlfriend.

524
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,600
That's enough.

525
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,900
Really?

526
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,570
I never thought I'd be discussing

527
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,570
my relationship problems with you.

528
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,460
I never expected it either.

529
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,470
According to the data,

530
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,070
the number of breakfast shops in Taiwan

531
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,070
has far exceeded that of convenience stores.

532
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,400
That's right. The market has changed.

533
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
So the upcoming comprehensive digital transformation

534
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,270
is a crucial direction for our group.

535
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,970
With all these changes,

536
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,730
won't there inevitably be

537
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,060
different opinions within your company?

538
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,200
There will certainly be some doubts,

539
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,400
but I believe a leader

540
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,630
must have the determination and courage

541
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,500
to take on this responsibility.

542
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,700
Of course, I also trust my own judgment.

543
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,130
It's not easy indeed.

544
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,270
I'm very pleased to interview

545
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,930
our Linlin Vice President, Deng Weiyu.

546
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,630
I believe

547
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,730
that under

548
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,600
Linlin's new leadership,

549
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,230
he will definitely lead everyone

550
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,600
to see a different Linlin Breakfast.

551
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,400
Business at Linshi Cha has been great lately.

552
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,800
Reservations take two months.

553
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,330
That's insane.

554
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,800
Come on, we're brothers. Help me out.

555
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,900
My girlfriend is begging to eat there.

556
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,230
Two months?

557
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,500
Let's see if they can even survive this month.

558
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,530
All those gimmicks.

559
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,330
All show and no substance.

560
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,100
What's the point?

561
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,230
Don't be so grumpy.

562
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,230
Come on, have a drink.

563
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,430
Drink up!

564
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,900
That's the spirit.

565
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,030
Cheers!

566
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,730
You called me for this trivial matter?

567
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,800
Why did I hire you then?

568
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,870
Should I take half your salary?

569
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,070
Long time no see.

570
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,770
You haven't changed at all.

571
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,430
Still beautiful.

572
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,070
If that's all, let's talk another time.

573
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,570
Wait.

574
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,530
Um.

575
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,800
My friend has a sake bar nearby.

576
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,770
If you're free later.

577
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,800
Would you like to have a drink?

578
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,330
You still remember I like sake?

579
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,370
I haven't forgotten anything about us.

580
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,730
If you remember everything,

581
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,000
then why until now

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,670
not even a single apology?

583
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,100
Don't you have any?

584
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,630
Add a bit more.

585
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,300
It tastes pretty good.

586
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,600
Not happy about Deng Weiyu taking the temp job?

587
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,700
You're not that rigid, are you?

588
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,430
Business is only successful when you make money.

589
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,170
What do you mean?

590
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,800
Brother.

591
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,200
If you want to build something, build your own business.

592
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,730
You don't have to make money from Linlin.

593
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:11,900
Next time,

594
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
I'll introduce some friends to you.

595
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,429
Play Jolin Tsai's 'Play'.

596
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,699
What's going on?

597
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,130
Deng Weijie, let me tell you something.

598
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:38,969
When you're in a relationship,

599
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,699
always remember

600
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,929
that the other person has feelings and thoughts too.

601
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,429
They're not your pet.

602
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't make someone who loves you

603
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,730
feel worthless.

604
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,870
[Interruption]

605
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,930
Are you going out?

606
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,230
Going to get some water.

607
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,330
I'm thirsty.

608
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,400
This new look of yours...

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,170
I just want to create

610
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,530
a wanderer vibe.

611
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,970
How do I look today?

612
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,670
You look beautiful.

613
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,530
I have one here too.

614
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,870
Just like this?

615
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,970
Yes,

616
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,570
you're Lin Liying after all.

617
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,670
Wait a second.

618
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,830
Help me.

619
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,530
Careful.

620
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,900
Do I look good?

621
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,900
You look beautiful no matter what.

622
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,100
Look,

623
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,000
I found this today.

624
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,100
Do you remember?

625
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,770
Of course I remember.

626
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,200
I drew this for you.

627
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,370
So,

628
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,630
do you remember what this means?

629
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,900
I like you.

630
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,800
That's right.

631
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,470
I'm the person you like.

632
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,630
But you never said it before,

633
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,360
and you don't say it now either.

634
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,530
I think we should frame it.

635
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,530
Don't worry.

636
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,370
Are you free?

637
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,230
I'm not free today.

638
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,600
What are you busy with?

639
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,170
I haven't cleaned upstairs yet.

640
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,230
Come on. I need you. Hurry up.

641
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,070
What problems

642
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,470
can't be solved with a good game of pool?

643
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,270
What if there really are some?

644
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,970
Having fun.

645
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,100
It means

646
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,730
having a good time

647
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,530
and speaking up.

648
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,470
Not like you,

649
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,630
so listless.

650
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,500
Show me.

651
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,730
How to hold this.

652
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,600
Like this?

653
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,730
The cue stick and your eyes

654
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,230
should form a straight line with your target

655
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,000
and push it out like this.

656
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,330
Is this okay?

657
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,930
Holding you like this feels so secure.

658
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,200
Someone who feels secure

659
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,130
can say anything, right?

660
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,430
Try what I just taught you again.

661
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,030
I'm so happy today.

662
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,860
I haven't been this happy for a long time.

663
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,600
Give it a try.

664
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,230
We're at your place.

665
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,930
Let me walk you home.

666
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,470
No need.

667
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,700
Okay, take the umbrella.

668
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,570
Get home safely.

669
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,300
Lin Liying.

670
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,200
Today was really fun.

671
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,230
Just give me a little more time.

672
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,470
I'll be fine.

673
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,530
Liar.

674
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,370
If you've really figured things out,

675
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,270
why don't you just say

676
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,570
what's really on your mind?

677
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,730
You just think you hurt your mom, don't you?

678
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,470
That's ridiculous.

679
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,430
Jiang Zhihao, you don't say anything.

680
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,300
Nothing at all.

681
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,070
How am I supposed to tell you?

682
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,000
Jiang Zhihao, it's not your fault.

683
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,630
It's not your fault.

684
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,130
It's not your fault!

685
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,100
And you,

686
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,230
if you're going to act, at least be convincing.

687
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,700
Your acting is terrible.

688
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,000
My makeup and my hair,

689
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,330
and this dress that cost 13,800,

690
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,800
are you blind?

691
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,300
Lin Liying!

692
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,530
Lin Liying!

693
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,570
Lin Liying!

694
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,570
Lin Liying!

695
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,930
I'm going inside now.

696
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,700
Be careful on your way home.

697
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,900
Jiang Zhihao.

698
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,970
We'll keep going forward together,

699
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,030
right?

700
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,370
Have you imagined our future?

701
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,500
The kind with

702
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,070
a family and children.

703
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,130
I have.

704
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,630
I'll stay with you and keep going.

705
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,570
In the end, everyone has to

706
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:08,900
face their problems on their own.

707
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,170
What can you do for Jiang Zhihao?

708
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,870
Linlin's new owner.

709
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,400
You really think the company is yours now?

710
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,070
Don't tell me

711
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,800
you don't know what your mother did.

712
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,900
Why, after getting everything,

713
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,330
are you still so unhappy?

714
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,800
Could it be that what you're pursuing now

715
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,470
isn't what you really want at all?

716
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,300
I understand your feelings.

717
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,770
Thank you for liking me.

718
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:25,630
I'm not going anywhere. Do you want me to

719
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,730
reveal everything we've done?

720
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,030
Should we die together?

721
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,930
Deng Weiyu

722
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,770
You can't give up on me.

723
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,870
Great hero Jiang Zhihao,

724
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,600
please save my son.
