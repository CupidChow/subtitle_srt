1
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,570
What are you writing?

2
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,490
What are you doing?

3
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,970
Why are you drawing me?

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,230
Are you really clueless or just pretending?

5
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,530
I like you.

6
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,730
I liked you before Gao Baihan did.

7
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,470
Why are you only telling me now?

8
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,130
Because we've known each other for too long.

9
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,330
I was afraid it would be awkward

10
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,700
and weird.

11
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,330
I've liked you for a long time.

12
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,090
The biggest difference between dreams and reality

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,829
is that in dreams, you're not afraid of anything.

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,930
But in reality,

15
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,930
you don't dare to do anything.

16
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,270
Lin Liying.

17
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,070
Why are you drawing me?

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
What do you mean?

19
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,930
I've just been learning illustration recently.

20
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,270
And I think your face

21
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,900
has quite a unique character.

22
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,530
It's suitable for a drawing model.

23
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,770
Although...

24
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,170
you look okay, I guess.

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,230
I just went through a breakup.

26
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,070
Do you have to be so harsh?

27
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,770
So you prefer sweet talk?

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,030
Even Du Zhengzhe speaks better than you.

29
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,570
Du Zhengzhe?

30
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,400
We got together six hours ago.

31
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,530
Du Zhengzhe, huh?

32
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,200
And also...

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,870
And also...

34
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,829
Zeng Xianzhong.

35
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,730
Zeng Xianzhong?

36
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,700
You mean that Zeng Xianzhong who graduated from Jiangzhong?

37
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,630
Yes.

38
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,670
Since when do you like academic achievers?

39
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,600
I want to experience

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,700
what it's like to date multiple people.

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,770
To quickly gather five boyfriends

42
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,900
to help me get through

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,370
the pain

44
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,500
of heartbreak.

45
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,630
Ciao.

46
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,830
Aunt Xiurong.

47
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,300
Morning.

48
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,100
Jiang Zhihao isn't selling breakfast today?

49
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,000
Right. Don't know what's gotten into him.

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,330
He said he's in a bad mood

51
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,930
so he's not setting up today.

52
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,600
Do you think my life isn't ridiculous enough?

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,970
I don't think that.

54
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,800
Lin Liying.

55
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,630
I need to go to work,

56
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,430
that's why I came to see if breakfast was being sold.

57
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,030
You found a job?

58
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,070
Congratulations!

59
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,230
First day.

60
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,970
Good luck. You'll be fine.

61
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,830
Xiurong.

62
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,930
Morning.

63
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,570
Auntie, please go ahead with your work.

64
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,500
Okay.

65
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,730
Bye. Good luck.

66
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,370
How have you been feeling lately?

67
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,530
I can eat and sleep well, what could be wrong?

68
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,030
Do you want a wash or a cut today?

69
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,730
Just a cut.

70
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,530
Okay.

71
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,270
Oh no!

72
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,970
What?

73
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,500
I forgot to buy those rice cakes from Jinshan.

74
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,000
Never mind. It's too late now.

75
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,170
Where's your dad?

76
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't see him.

77
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,730
Didn't you say it's too late?

78
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,170
Let's not worry about him. Okay.

79
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,430
I'll go get the car ready.

80
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,630
Okay.

81
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,700
Alright, let's go.

82
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,870
Meixia.

83
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,400
We're here.

84
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,070
Those rice cakes you love from the shop at the alley entrance.

85
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,700
I'll bring you some next time I go back home.

86
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,000
We're all doing well.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,170
As for Zhihao,

88
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,700
he's now a manager at a company.

89
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,930
He's not even 30 yet,

90
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,460
and already supervising several employees.

91
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,670
And then,

92
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,270
He has a wonderful girlfriend now.

93
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,570
I've met her.

94
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,300
Although they argue all the time,

95
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,430
but,

96
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,970
she's a kind person.

97
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Kindness is what matters most, right?

98
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
So you can rest easy.

99
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,730
Mom,

100
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,970
you can't be that gullible, can you?

101
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,299
Your mom is very gullible,

102
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,070
and she loves to trick people even more.

103
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,400
She's actually very skilled,

104
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,200
but those older ladies

105
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,370
were all afraid to let her do their hair.

106
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,370
She'd always claim she could give them

107
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,100
some movie star's new hairstyle,

108
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,500
but actually,

109
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,770
she was just using them as guinea pigs.

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,030
One time,

111
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,730
Aunt Hongzhu was going to perform at the neighborhood meeting,

112
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,770
and your mom, for some crazy reason,

113
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,230
dyed her hair blonde.

114
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,300
You've never seen Aunt Hongzhu with blonde hair, have you?

115
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,330
She was so angry

116
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,330
she almost burned our salon down.

117
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,270
Originally,

118
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,800
we had a shop over in Jinshan,

119
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,470
called Jinshan Beauty Salon.

120
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,200
Later we moved to Taipei,

121
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
and your mom said

122
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,700
we had to make sure our old customers

123
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,170
could still find us.

124
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,670
So she

125
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,700
added the word 'Old' in front of the name,

126
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,300
Old Jinshan Beauty Salon.

127
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,930
It immediately sounded so fancy.

128
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,800
San Francisco Beauty Salon.

129
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,970
Doesn't it sound

130
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,800
really impressive?

131
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,100
Mom,

132
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,530
I already know this story by heart.

133
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,200
It could even be made into a TV series by now.

134
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,030
Right, I guess I've told it too many times.

135
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,770
Anyway, that's how it strangely turned out.

136
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,500
Back then,

137
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,030
I was terrified that lots of foreigners would come to our shop,

138
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,670
and I couldn't understand English.

139
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,570
What if someone wanted a perm

140
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,600
and I cut their hair instead?

141
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,370
I'd be doomed.

142
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,370
Meixia,

143
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,800
working together back then

144
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,630
was really wonderful.

145
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,600
What was heaven thinking?

146
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,930
Let me tell you,

147
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,700
they were definitely cheating.

148
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,670
I caught them red-handed.

149
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,500
Dad,

150
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,170
you lost money and refused to pay,

151
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,700
so you accused them of cheating, right?

152
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,930
I didn't lose!

153
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,870
I grew up at the card table.

154
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,830
These people,

155
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,270
whatever cards they had in their hands,

156
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,230
I could tell just by looking at their faces.

157
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,030
I could see everything clearly.

158
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,400
- Gently.

159
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
- Okay.

160
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,490
If you're going to gamble in the future, bet bigger.

161
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,200
It's just a game of mahjong.

162
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm still dreaming about becoming a rich heir.

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,430
Sure.

164
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,000
Buy me a ticket to Las Vegas,

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,330
and I promise your son will be third-generation rich.

166
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,200
Fine.

167
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,430
I'll find a place tomorrow

168
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,670
to sell my kidney.

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,660
Remember to sell both of them.

170
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,830
Buttons.

171
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,130
Right? Okay, that's good.

172
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,200
That's fine.

173
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,470
How was it?

174
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,030
Did you visit the grave today?

175
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,470
Is your mother doing well?

176
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,230
As long as you're not around,

177
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,930
Mom is doing just fine.

178
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,930
Your mother didn't raise you for nothing.

179
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,630
This way?

180
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,700
Dad.

181
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,130
I heard that after Zhilu was born,

182
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,230
you argued with Mom for years

183
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,300
about sending me to an orphanage.

184
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,800
Back then, our family wasn't very wealthy.

185
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,830
It was already hard enough raising one child,

186
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,430
let alone two.

187
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,270
Besides, you're not my biological son.

188
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,100
I've been thinking,

189
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,400
if I had sent you to an orphanage then,

190
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,930
you might be living better than you are now.

191
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,730
So why didn't you send me away in the end?

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,130
Do you remember when you were little,

193
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,670
you always liked to take old newspapers

194
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,170
and crumple them into balls,

195
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,930
then throw them into a basket,

196
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,800
like you were shooting hoops?

197
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,470
After you finished throwing,

198
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,700
I would count

199
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,930
how many balls there were.

200
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,800
Then I would use that number

201
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,630
to buy lottery tickets.

202
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,100
And I always won.

203
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,700
That's why

204
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,270
I didn't send you away.

205
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,100
Because I thought

206
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,070
you were my lucky star.

207
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,500
No wonder

208
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,100
I was wondering

209
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,270
why you were so nice to me,

210
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,130
making me basketball hoops and teaching me to play.

211
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,370
So that's why soccer, swimming,

212
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,770
all of these things,

213
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,500
and even math,

214
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,000
were all because of that?

215
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Good thing I didn't send you away.

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,870
With you around,

217
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,670
playing video games with me,

218
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,730
playing basketball,

219
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,330
I think it's pretty nice too.

220
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,100
Only when I'm with you

221
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,400
do I feel like a father.

222
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
I won't gamble anymore.

223
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,630
I'll never play with them again.

224
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,000
They cheat.

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,670
Bet bigger.

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,730
Bigger.

227
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,200
Zhilu, don't go back to sleep again.

228
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,370
Go cut some fruit.

229
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,900
Shide, where did you go?

230
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,670
Have you been gambling again?

231
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,830
I... Dad went to buy grass cakes.

232
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,700
Grass...

233
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,000
Right.

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
So where are the grass cakes?

235
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,930
No, listen to me.

236
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,930
I went to buy kueh.

237
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,130
But I had bad luck.

238
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,900
When it was my turn,

239
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,870
they were sold out.

240
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,170
Yeah, right.

241
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,030
Everything is always sold out when it's your turn.

242
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,930
The braised pork rice too.

243
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,230
And now the kueh as well.

244
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,230
Then why didn't you marry me before

245
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,570
someone else did?

246
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,030
Good choice... I...

247
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,970
Right, Dad?

248
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,630
Yes.

249
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,470
By the way, what's that chess move called?

250
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,770
Is it the 'General's Chariot'?

251
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,170
Teach me. I don't believe you.

252
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,070
Zhihao.

253
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,000
Go cut some fruit

254
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,300
and wake your sister up.

255
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,200
Okay.

256
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Don't go back to sleep. Zhilu, get up!

257
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,670
I can't stand you people.

258
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,100
So annoying.

259
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
Our company's philosophy

260
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,770
is to clean with the elegance of a British butler.

261
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,100
This is reflected in our product ingredients.

262
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,970
They're very gentle

263
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,070
and make cleaning effortless.

264
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,570
These products

265
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,000
are for different types of dirt,

266
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,130
so each one serves a specific purpose.

267
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,270
For silicone strips or bathroom mold,

268
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,500
remember to use the Mold Eliminator.

269
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,200
Just spray it on,

270
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,670
leave it, don't worry about it.

271
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,300
When you have time, check back and

272
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,330
all the mold will be gone.

273
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,130
For all kitchen grease,

274
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,000
remember to use this bottle,

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
the Grease Sweeper.

276
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,900
When you spray this Grease Sweeper,

277
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,300
it will soften all heavy grease.

278
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,100
For bathroom soap scum and toilet stains,

279
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,930
remember to use this Bathroom Cleaner.

280
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,930
Just spray it. Don't scrub.

281
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,370
Then rinse it with water.

282
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,030
Use a dry cloth

283
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,370
to gently wipe it,

284
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,030
and the whole showerhead will be clean.

285
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,700
Remember.

286
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
Let me remind you of something.

287
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,270
All clients

288
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,200
might have cameras in their homes,

289
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,730
baby monitors or pet cameras.

290
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,500
Everything we do

291
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,930
they can see clearly.

292
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,030
You're welcome.

293
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,700
Take care. We're leaving now.

294
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,200
Lin Liying.

295
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
If you're here about what happened last time,

296
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,300
I'm telling you, there's nothing I can do.

297
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,630
I don't care about the wedding anymore.

298
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,600
Now it's time for you to serve the community,

299
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,530
Mr. Ding, the neighborhood chief.

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,430
Is it true that every alley entrance

301
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,890
has security cameras to protect residents?

302
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,369
Does every resident

304
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,970
have the right to access surveillance footage?

305
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,730
It depends on the situation.

306
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,569
I am a resident

307
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,970
and I want to check the surveillance footage.

308
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,270
Okay.

309
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,000
No, wait.

310
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,130
What are you trying to do now?

311
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,730
You just agreed to it.

312
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,970
I...

313
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,070
If you still don't have an answer,

314
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,770
let's end this here.

315
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,100
We just got back from our trip.

316
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,600
Can we not fight?

317
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,870
There's just no way around it.

318
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,470
When we first got together,

319
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,100
you knew the situation.

320
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,430
Is this what you call being together?

321
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,900
Sneaking around, being secretive,

322
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,170
making me feel like the other woman.

323
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,370
Fine, let's go public with our relationship.

324
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,030
Do you think you and Deng Weijie

325
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,270
could still be friends?

326
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,770
Would she ever tell you what she's thinking?

327
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,370
We agreed on this from the beginning.

328
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,400
What are you even arguing about?

329
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,130
But we've been like this for three years already.

330
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,900
How long do you want me to keep pretending?

331
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,970
I don't care about you and your sister.

332
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,100
I'm not afraid to confront her.

333
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,470
If you can't

334
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,430
make our relationship public,

335
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,300
then we should take a break

336
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,770
and think things through.

337
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,830
Jiang Zhihao

338
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,630
I bought you a late-night snack.

339
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,130
I knew you'd still be awake.

340
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,670
What did you get?

341
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,670
Noodles.

342
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,600
If you can't handle alcohol, don't work at the hotel.

343
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,430
You never ask me

344
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,830
the real reason why I work at the hotel.

345
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,770
Besides loving to drink,

346
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,470
I really can't think of any other reason.

347
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,930
Money.

348
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,630
I owe someone a lot of money.

349
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,970
Who do you owe?

350
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,230
My former boss.

351
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,430
Why don't you just ask me directly

352
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,830
why I owe them 500,000? Is that so hard?

353
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,730
Are you willing to tell me?

354
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,200
It's all because Dad...

355
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,900
lost so much money on the dry noodle business.

356
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,270
And you don't have a proper job.

357
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,930
Seeing Mom so worried every day

358
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,830
isn't a solution either.

359
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,370
So I thought

360
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,130
I'd borrow money from my boss.

361
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,770
Who knew that his

362
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,900
deputy manager's wife would find out.

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,270
She went around the company saying

364
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,470
I was having an affair with her husband.

365
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,030
I couldn't stand all those gossips

366
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,500
chattering every day,

367
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,000
so I quit.

368
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,100
Jiang Zhilu,

369
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,500
let me ask you something.

370
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,830
So you really didn't have anything

371
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,030
with your boss?

372
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,870
He's fat and ugly.

373
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,770
I'd rather be single forever

374
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,770
than have an affair with him.

375
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,430
I can't eat anymore.

376
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,030
Go ahead and eat. Leave it there, I'll clean up.

377
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,230
So it's Deng Weiyu, right?

378
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,600
I know he saw it that day.

379
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,930
Jiang Zhihao.

380
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,970
So that 500,000 was also from Deng Weiyu.

381
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,970
Go to bed now.

382
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,070
I need to prepare ingredients.

383
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,230
You have no idea how exhausting it is

384
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,700
and how much responsibility it takes to run a breakfast stand alone.

385
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,100
Don't overthink things.

386
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,570
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

387
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,100
I'd like to order one today as well.

388
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,330
OK, sure.

389
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,230
Do you have drinks?

390
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,630
Didn't sleep last night?

391
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,530
You said it's tiring, so I'm helping you.

392
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,430
Black tea.

393
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,370
Miss.

394
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:58,830
65 dollars.

395
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,730
Thank you.

396
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,130
Thanks.

397
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,700
Just stay at the tea station.

398
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,230
Don't touch anything else.

399
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,400
Where's your mask?

400
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,130
Go put on your mask.

401
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,700
Wait for me.

402
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,200
What would you like?

403
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,770
I've taken their order.

404
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,670
Got it. Good.

405
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,570
You're helping out today too?

406
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,570
Yes.

407
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,370
Just a moment.

408
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,400
Dad.

409
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,100
What do you want?

410
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,970
What's going on here?

411
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,470
We've actually been together for 3 years.

412
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
Weikang.

413
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,900
Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,430
I thought since we work in the same office,

415
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,830
it wouldn't be good to be so public about it.

416
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,630
Jinghan.

417
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,330
When will your mother be available?

418
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,730
Our families should have dinner together.

419
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,030
I approve of your relationship.

420
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,330
So there's no need to send me these photos.

421
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,500
I've wanted to work with your mother for a long time.

422
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,570
As long as you two are good together,

423
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,630
I have no objections.

424
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,730
Thank you, Chairman.

425
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,170
So,

426
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,630
you did this?

427
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,470
I didn't plant those photos.

428
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,500
It wasn't you?

429
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,630
Right, it wasn't me.

430
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,000
Though I'm quite satisfied with the result.

431
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
If I had really done it,

432
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,330
the photos wouldn't just appear

433
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,670
on your father's desk,

434
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,470
but on my family's TV station.

435
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,330
It seems our relationship

436
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,170
has been discovered.

437
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,670
I never thought

438
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,500
you two would be together.

439
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,230
When did it start?

440
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Some things just happen naturally.

441
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,400
You won't blame me for not telling you

442
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,730
and stop inviting me for drinks, will you?

443
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,470
Of course not.

444
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,530
What are you talking about?

445
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,130
Talking behind your back.

446
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,570
Do you want some?

447
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,870
There's no extra.

448
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,630
Jinghan's mother.

449
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,070
Since our children have decided to date seriously,

450
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,770
don't you think we should also

451
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,300
work together?

452
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,600
I was just about to mention this to Director Deng.

453
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,400
I have a new show

454
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,630
and I was thinking

455
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,360
of having Linlin Breakfast as the title sponsor.

456
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,500
Great, come on.

457
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,430
Try this, Dad.

458
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,000
If you could go on a show to promote Linlin,

459
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,530
that would be really great.

460
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,300
Hello. Weiyu is back.

461
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,430
Auntie.

462
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,470
Been traveling abroad?

463
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,770
Yes, just traveling.

464
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,800
Let's have dinner together later.

465
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,870
Sure.

466
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,030
I'll go in first.

467
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,970
Come, have some tea.

468
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,970
Mr. Kang,

469
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,600
developing apps is the trend now.

470
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,900
Everyone is doing it.

471
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,130
Technology has always been our weak point.

472
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,570
Development would take years.

473
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,970
I need an immediately effective solution.

474
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,630
Look, every rainy day,

475
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,100
the breakfast shop next door is packed.

476
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,330
Do you know why?

477
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,830
Because they have an app.

478
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,170
You can know exactly when your order will be ready.

479
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:52,770
Once you arrive,

480
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,300
someone will bring it right to you.

481
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,370
You don't even need to get out of your car or take off your raincoat.

482
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,630
You'll just spoil the customers this way.

483
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,330
Customers will always complain you're not doing enough.

484
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,530
Mr. Kang,

485
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,970
the chairman wants to meet you in five minutes

486
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,330
to discuss next week's event.

487
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,100
We need to prepare first.

488
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,160
Think about it more carefully.

489
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,900
Do you think he's being unreasonable?

490
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,230
Actually, getting your proposal approved is easy.

491
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,230
If you see him today

492
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,530
making coffee,

493
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,600
it means today is not the right time.

494
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,430
Whatever you say,

495
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,370
he won't agree.

496
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,170
On the contrary,

497
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,100
if he's holding orange juice today,

498
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,800
it means he's in a good mood.

499
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,130
So hurry up and go.

500
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,500
Even if you propose opening a Linlin Breakfast on the moon,

501
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,300
he might agree.

502
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,500
Really? Is that true?

503
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,770
I'm probably the person

504
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,230
who knows Mr. Kang best in the whole company.

505
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,070
Thanks.

506
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,030
Our company will collapse sooner or later.

507
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,900
So,

508
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,830
isn't it important to understand your boss's moods?

509
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,230
Forgot my lunch box.

510
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,330
This is my mom.

511
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,330
She insisted on bringing me lunch. Hello, ma'am.

512
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,130
Hello.

513
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,470
What do you mean 'insisted'?

514
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,600
If you hadn't forgotten it,

515
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,370
I wouldn't have had to make this trip.

516
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,630
A colleague?

517
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,300
I didn't know you'd be eating with a colleague.

519
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,330
Otherwise I would have brought another lunch box.

520
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,370
Yes, ma'am. That's not right.

521
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,970
Mom, he's joking.

522
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,200
He has his own lunch.

523
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,170
Thank you all.

524
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,900
For taking care of our Peizhen.

525
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,900
Is it really okay?

526
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,570
Can I have another bite?

527
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,370
Wipe it again.

528
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,100
Your mom is really amazing.

529
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,330
Look at my mom, she's so lazy.

530
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,230
I don't want my mom to work so hard.

531
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,800
Being a good daughter to a good mother

532
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,130
is the most exhausting thing in the world,

533
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,100
even more tiring than work.

534
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,630
Kang, I'm taking a day off tomorrow.

535
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,500
And those files,

536
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,300
I've already sent them to your inbox.

537
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Good. Thanks.

538
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,870
I'll head out now.

539
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,230
Tomorrow's event.

540
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,000
Tomorrow is the only day we can replace the coating.

541
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
I'll take care of it for you.

542
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,170
Make sure that bucket of coating is used.

543
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,800
Let us know when it's been used.

544
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,060
After that, it's no longer your concern.

545
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,730
Zhihao, don't you know how to knock?

546
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,530
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,200
I didn't see anything.

548
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,770
Why doesn't Zhihao fix the door?

549
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,469
Why won't he fix it?

550
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,830
Wait for me a moment.

551
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,030
Take your time.

552
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,199
I'll go in later.

553
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,500
Why are you here?

554
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,200
We talked too late.

555
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,930
Your brother asked me to stay over.

556
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,030
To sleep.

557
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,000
You must have seen everything just now.

558
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,700
No, I didn't...

559
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,870
I'm emotionally traumatized.

560
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,430
So that money will be my emotional compensation.

561
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,370
OK?

562
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Money.

563
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,830
Well, that...

564
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,360
The emotional compensation seems a bit high.

565
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,970
How about...

566
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,870
I treat you to breakfast

567
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,970
at San Francisco Beauty Salon

568
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,300
as compensation?

569
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,270
You're quite funny.

570
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,400
Looking at this scenario,

571
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,430
we meet in the bathroom,

572
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,600
and now we're chatting here.

573
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,970
By Korean drama standards,

574
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,400
this would be episode 8,

575
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,670
and we'd be kissing in the next moment.

576
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,600
That works. I just brushed my...

577
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,830
Stop, stop right there.

578
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,530
Learning all sorts of nonsense from Zhihao.

579
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,030
He's corrupting you.

580
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,200
You can go use the bathroom now.

581
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,630
I'll pay you back.

582
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,530
Zhilu.

583
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,130
I believe in you.

584
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,800
I believe in your judgment.

585
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,770
It will definitely get better.

586
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,000
Why do we need so many people for a breakfast shop?

587
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,530
I've been practicing making rice balls.

588
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,700
Don't dock my pay.

589
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,360
I'm drinking something here.

590
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,700
There's not a single customer.

591
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,970
I can't afford so many wage thieves.

592
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,230
What do you mean there aren't any?

593
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,500
Liying.

594
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,600
Senior.

595
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,300
Come here.

596
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,370
What would you like to eat today?

597
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,630
What do you have today?

598
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,330
What's on the menu today?

599
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,600
Pesto basil rice ball.

600
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,800
Pesto basil rice ball,

601
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
I'll have one.

602
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,870
What are you guys doing?

603
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,030
Fighting?

604
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,270
New employee?

605
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,600
My brother's friend.

606
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,570
Neighbor.

607
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,630
Hello.

608
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,090
I haven't finished making it yet.

609
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,430
Hold this for me.

610
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,500
Where are you going?

611
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,670
We're not fighting.

612
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,530
Hello.

613
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,300
Is this your car?

614
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,030
Yes, it's my car.

615
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,200
I lent it to that tenant

616
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,900
who left everything in such a mess.

617
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,170
Unbelievable.

618
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,130
Is the tenant Lin Guangsheng?

619
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,230
That Lin Guangsheng

620
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,430
suddenly said he was moving out a few days ago.

621
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,030
Do you know him?

622
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,070
I'm his daughter.

623
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,800
Perfect timing.

624
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,430
I rented him the basement at a very low price,

625
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,230
but he still owes me several months of rent

626
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,070
that he never paid.

627
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,700
Also,

628
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,770
all his belongings inside,

629
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,030
I've been wondering whether to throw them away

630
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,400
or keep them.

631
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,730
You should take care of it.

632
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,730
So... over there?

633
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,300
Yes, down to the basement.

634
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,230
I'll go.

635
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,100
Okay.

636
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,370
Lin Liying.

637
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,730
Why are you here?

638
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,830
Well,

639
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,930
you didn't even take your breakfast

640
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,500
and then ran off.

641
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,960
I was worried something might happen, so...

642
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,870
I came to check on you.

643
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,530
Where's Uncle Guang?

644
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,870
I don't know.

645
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,930
Wait.

646
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,700
Hold on tight.

647
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,230
Dogs go woof.

648
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,170
Cats go meow.

649
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,430
What do chickens say?

650
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,230
Opportunity favors the prepared.

651
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,500
A white balloon

652
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,030
punched a black balloon.

653
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,230
Do you know

654
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,830
what the black balloon did?

655
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,630
It confessed to the white balloon.

656
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,900
And you know,

657
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,830
there was a little black cat and a little white cat

658
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,070
playing together.

659
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,230
Then the black cat threw the white cat into the lake.

660
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,890
Do you know what the white cat said when it got up?

661
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,200
It said,

662
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,900
meow.

663
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,400
Why is it best to order

664
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,430
only 9 dishes at a restaurant?

665
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,500
Because of acid reflux.

666
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,930
So what do you want to eat?

667
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,130
I'll take you there.

668
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,770
How about shaved ice,

669
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,030
stinky tofu,

670
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,270
and

671
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,230
hot pot?

672
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,470
What do you think?

673
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,170
Those are all things you like to eat.

674
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,270
Hold on tight,

675
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,470
or the police will come.

676
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,770
Hold tight.

677
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,700
Do you think my brother will be punished this time?

678
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,870
We can only take a chance.

679
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,830
Since you're already here,

680
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,730
you might as well go all the way with your kindness.

681
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,130
Let her go! Wait a minute.

682
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,470
Who would have thought that jerk

683
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,570
got married to someone else this morning.

684
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,400
I've wanted a divorce for a long time.

685
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,530
I've waited for Lin Guangsheng for five years.

686
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,670
I've done everything I could for him.

687
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,430
I've always wanted to find my father.

688
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,600
There was hope,

689
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,230
but in the end, it's just disappointment again.

690
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,300
And I don't know what to do when I see him.

691
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,870
There's one... suitable for honeymoon.

692
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,730
Deng Weikang, long time no see.
