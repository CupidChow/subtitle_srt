1
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:11,870
Bro.

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,830
Are you done yet?

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,130
Almost. Just one soup left.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,500
You're so slow.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,770
There's one more person. You should cook extra.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,270
Do you have enough for five?

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,270
Hurry up.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,200
Here.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,300
Cheers.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,130
Zhihao.

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,730
We can discuss breakfast like we used to.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,600
Talk about flavors.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,570
There will always be a place for you at Linlin Breakfast.

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,400
And I trust you to take the VP position.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm confident in you.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,300
I thought you had more backbone.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,700
But here you are, coming back to the fold.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,800
His San Francisco beauty salon is nearly bankrupt.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,830
And you're still letting him take this position at Linlin Breakfast.

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,069
Jiang Zhihao hasn't been at Linlin Breakfast for long.

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,900
If he's supposed to resolve conflicts between departments,

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,430
I don't think he's capable of that.

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,000
The current VP

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,470
hasn't even spoken yet.

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,830
Why are you two in such a hurry?

26
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,330
Dad has already made his decision.

27
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,200
Who am I to say anything?

28
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,070
I'm just curious.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,270
About Dad's inheritance

30
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,930
how do you plan to distribute it?

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,330
Are you wishing me dead now?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,330
I just want to know if

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,700
my name is in the will.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,930
What did you say?

35
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,900
Jiang Zhihao.

36
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,100
You're so lucky.

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,870
You don't have to do anything,

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,900
Dad just gives you everything.

39
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,570
I really wish you would disappear from this world.

40
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,729
I've already told you,

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,660
I'm not trying to compete with you.

42
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,030
Zhihao.

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,700
Zhihao, what's wrong?

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,000
Deng Weiyu. Dad.

45
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,400
I told you so.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,130
This way we can solve everything once and for all.

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,630
Linlin Breakfast is ours now.

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,570
You...

49
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,200
How could this happen?

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,670
They're all dead.

51
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,600
When was the poison administered?

52
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,370
It's infuriating.

53
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,970
That illegitimate child

54
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,800
didn't even want to claim his heritage,

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,329
yet he was killed too.

56
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,570
It's all his fault.

57
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,329
Sharing photo albums with others for no reason.

58
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,000
Someone saw the photos,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,260
and that's how his identity was exposed.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,030
Grandma, where's your photo album?

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,970
In your mother's room.

62
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,930
I really don't want to look at it anymore.

63
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,600
Jiang Zhihao.

64
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,170
Pick some photos.

65
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,170
What for?

66
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,400
Just pick some first.

67
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,230
So chubby.

68
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,470
Who?

69
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,200
Me.

70
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,130
This one shows your profile.

71
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,030
This one.

72
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,100
Pomelo.

73
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,800
Very cute.

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Okay.

75
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,300
Lin Liying,

76
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,830
what are you doing exactly?

77
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,600
What about you?

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,130
I'm going to take this photo

79
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,170
and keep it safe.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,330
Nice, right?

81
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,330
I'm going to work now.

82
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,130
Lin Liying.

83
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,670
Deng Yongkuan has already seen everything.

84
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,570
Aren't we just

85
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,170
drawing attention to what we're trying to hide?

86
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,770
I'm trying to save you, okay?

87
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,030
Everyone knows you're adopted if you keep asking around.

88
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,800
People can be cruel.

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,900
Bye.

90
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,970
Thanks.

91
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,070
Corner Food was originally just

92
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,370
a small breakfast shop in Melbourne.

93
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,270
After they participated

94
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,970
in the first season of 'Breakfast Around the World'

95
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,430
and won the championship,

96
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,330
they expanded from just one location

97
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,370
to fifty locations now.

98
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,670
This is indeed a way

99
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,830
to help Linlin Breakfast

100
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,170
go international.

101
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,900
But Corner Food

102
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,600
has an impressive head chef.

103
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,270
Who should we send?

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
Come again next time. Thank you.

105
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,770
Little one, your smoked chicken sandwich.

106
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,070
There's a cockroach.

107
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,200
Here's your smoked chicken sandwich.

108
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,870
I'm on a diet.

109
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,670
Diet?

110
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,900
I don't care.

111
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,400
You called to order it.

112
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,170
What's wrong with kids these days?

113
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,330
So unreliable.

114
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,570
Adults are the ones who break promises.

115
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,830
Adults are all bad people.

116
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,900
Go sit over there first.

117
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,970
We're close.

118
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,370
Very close.

119
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,170
Don't cry.

120
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,700
Tell me what happened.

121
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,500
Everyone lied to me.

122
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,530
They said I could make three wishes,

123
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,270
but not even one came true.

124
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,770
Who?

125
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,700
But fulfilling your wishes

126
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,600
what does that have to do with-

127
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,400
What does that have to do with me?

128
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,530
Okay, stop crying.

129
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,570
It's just three wishes.

130
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,230
Only three wishes.

131
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,030
I'll make them come true.

132
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,900
I'll help you fulfill them.

133
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,630
Crying won't help.

134
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,330
Really?

135
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,230
Really.

136
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,200
Aren't you one of those

137
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,130
adults who break their promises?

138
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,530
Of course I'm not that kind of person.

139
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,730
If money can solve a problem,

140
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,190
it's not really a problem.

141
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,000
Talking about money is going too far.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,870
Too much.

143
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,070
Then I want to make my first wish.

144
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,400
F-first wish.

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,330
Hello everyone.

146
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,070
I'm Wang Miaoxin's

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
father.

148
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,130
I'm here today to share about my profession.

149
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,330
I run a breakfast shop

150
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,070
called San Francisco Beauty Salon,

151
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,870
and I usually make breakfast for everyone

152
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,600
and for Miaomiao.

153
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,870
I assume everyone knows

154
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,670
what a breakfast shop does.

155
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,400
We all know.

156
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,370
So that's my sharing.

157
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,200
Bye-bye.

158
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,230
Those who haven't had breakfast,

159
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,300
raise your hand.

160
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,030
This way, please. Good.

161
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,570
Teacher, I'm sorry.

162
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,070
I'm Wang Miaoxin's mother.

163
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,130
I... I mixed up today's schedule

164
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,930
with tomorrow's.

165
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,130
But I did go to the office

166
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,770
and rearranged my schedule.

167
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm here now.

168
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,530
Yes,

169
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,990
that's fine. But her father is already here.

170
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,170
Raise your hand if you haven't eaten.

171
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,500
I haven't eaten.

172
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,960
Okay, what would you like?

173
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,770
Corn.

174
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,300
How about you? An egg pancake?

175
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,370
Good.

176
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,400
What would you like?

177
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,000
Corn.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,770
Corn. And you?

179
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,600
I want corn too.

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,730
Corn.

181
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,870
Corn.

182
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,130
Ask him to help you thread it. Cut it once.

183
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,330
Come on,

184
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,500
say the password.

185
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,200
Dad, Mom,

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,530
I'll only eat breakfast from San Francisco Beauty Salon from now on.

187
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,530
Good girl.

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,930
What about you? What do you want?

189
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,770
But my parents can make breakfast.

190
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,730
Your parents can make breakfast?

191
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,170
Then you can just go to them.

192
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,500
No, no,

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,970
Miaomiao's dad.

194
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,970
That's right,

195
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,970
everyone.

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Starting from today,

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,830
you should be filial children.

198
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,530
Okay?

199
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,400
In the morning, you should turn off

200
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,330
your parents' alarm clocks.

201
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,870
Who should make breakfast?

202
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,600
San Francisco Beauty Salon.

203
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,970
Such thoughtful, adorable children,

204
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,370
the pillars of our future.

205
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,300
But you only have 3.8 stars.

206
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,930
My mom says anything less than 4.5 stars

207
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,470
is a terrible restaurant.

208
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,970
Little boy, what place did you get on your last test?

209
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,870
Fifth place.

210
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,900
Fifth place?

211
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,600
My mother says

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,700
anyone not in the top three is useless.

213
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,730
I'm going to tell the teacher

214
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
that Miaomiao's dad is just joking.

215
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,330
You ordered tuna just now, right?

216
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,500
The tuna one.

217
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,670
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

218
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,130
It really is troublesome.

219
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,570
Let me treat you to a meal.

220
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,070
The mental stress I've suffered

221
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,330
could qualify for government compensation.

222
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,790
And you're trying to pay me off with one meal?

223
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,730
Or would you prefer

224
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,170
I grant you three wishes?

225
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,670
I'll choose the restaurant.

226
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,630
I'll set the time.

227
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,370
Let's skip the three wishes.

228
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,730
Are you sure you don't want them?

229
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,200
No chance to regret later.

230
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,470
No.

231
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,730
Really, no.

232
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,930
Definitely no.

233
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,970
No.

234
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,270
It seems Linlin Breakfast Shop

235
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,070
has really terminated their cooperation with us.

236
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,130
Schedule a meeting with Linlin Breakfast.

237
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,330
I'll go personally.

238
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,500
Adjust the meeting agenda.

239
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,730
Find out why Linlin Breakfast

240
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,830
must continue working with us.

241
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,170
Shanru.

242
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,200
It's been 30 minutes already.

243
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,030
I'll go ask about it.

244
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,570
No need.

245
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,670
Wait.

246
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,470
Sorry, the meeting ran late.

247
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,270
It's fine, Director Deng.

248
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,670
Long time no see.

249
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,630
Really.

250
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,600
It's been a while.

251
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,000
Have a seat. Time is precious.

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,260
Let's get to the point.

253
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,130
Director Deng,

254
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,870
when we signed the contract,

255
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,270
the cooperation timeline was clearly stated.

256
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,570
And the quality of our Nuo Toast

257
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,900
hasn't changed at all.

258
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,160
There's really no reason to terminate the contract early.

259
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,900
Have you seen The Avengers?

260
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,330
If Endgame today

261
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,970
had completely different actors,

262
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,500
Iron Man wasn't Robert Downey Jr.,

263
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Captain America wasn't Chris Evans,

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,930
would you still enjoy it?

265
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,100
You still think

266
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,270
your products

267
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,600
taste the same?

268
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,330
So Director Deng, you're saying

269
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,730
if we bring Fang Nuo back,

270
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,660
you'll continue the cooperation?

271
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,330
Call Fang Nuo.

272
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,730
Tell him to come back.

273
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,670
Okay.

274
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,700
Mr. Fang,

275
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,170
Shanru wants you to come back.

276
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,030
She's forgiven you.

277
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,600
As long as you promise

278
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,130
you won't do that again...

279
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,630
Just a moment.

280
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,900
Lin Liying, are you stupid?

281
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,430
What are you talking about?

282
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,130
We had already prepared a new proposal.

283
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,600
A win-win solution

284
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,130
that has nothing to do with Fang Nuo.

285
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,270
But Director Deng, if you're so fixated on Fang Nuo,

286
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,670
then we won't play along.

287
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,700
A word of advice, Director Deng:

288
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,300
don't dwell on the past.

289
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,730
Or you'll lose even more.

290
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,960
Non-alcoholic drinks taste pretty good too.

291
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,390
You're really not being polite, are you?

292
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,830
Barbecue,

293
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,700
tofu pudding,

294
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,730
drinks,

295
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,400
and now a bar.

296
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,170
Do you really see me as your ATM?

297
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,830
Your daughter treats me like a wishing well too.

298
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,560
Why did you divorce your ex-husband?

299
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,300
Don't you think talking about this with someone you barely know

300
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,600
is a bit strange?

301
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,630
It's fine.

302
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,360
What else should we talk about?

303
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,970
We had different values.

304
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,630
He believed that at every stage of life,

305
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,400
you meet a soulmate,

306
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,700
and that not everything

307
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,430
needs to be shared with your partner.

308
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,700
But I'm different.

309
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,600
I want to share

310
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,230
everything with my partner.

311
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,430
From what you're saying, it doesn't sound like different values.

312
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,160
It sounds like he was cheating.

313
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,730
What about you?

314
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,230
If you found out that you and your partner

315
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,200
were incompatible in many ways,

316
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,330
what would you do?

317
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,800
I honestly can't imagine

318
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,460
what could be incompatible about being with me.

319
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,200
But I would wake her up at 6 AM every day.

320
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,270
Do you know what's the most romantic thing

321
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,570
about making breakfast?

322
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,100
It's that we see the sunrise.

323
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,130
While you see the sunset.

324
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,800
I think sunset just looks

325
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,770
beautiful, that's all.

326
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,970
But sunrise is different.

327
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,900
No matter how many times you see the sunrise,

328
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,330
you always feel

329
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,100
deeply moved.

330
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,270
Just for this feeling

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,369
you have to get up so early every day?

332
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,530
Without being moved, where would happiness come from in life?

333
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,500
Nonsense.

334
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,599
Liying, help me frame Mrs. Zhu's photo.

335
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,099
I don't know why my mom is looking for me.

336
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,369
Thanks.

337
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,630
It's dark. Watch your step.

338
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,230
Is it here? Be careful.

339
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,930
Yes.

340
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,670
Wait.

341
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,600
Okay.

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,470
Why is there nobody in this grocery store?

343
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,100
We're regulars here.

344
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,030
Just take what you need.

345
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,170
We'll pay later.

346
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,530
You're that familiar with them?

347
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,400
You really didn't wash your hair.

348
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,500
Hard to say.

349
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
I've been too busy with work.

350
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,570
Let me order breakfast from you.

351
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,970
Remember what I mentioned before?

352
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,470
That 'Breakfast Around the World' show?

353
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,570
Their team is coming to our company.

354
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,700
They'll be meeting for a week.

355
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,030
I need breakfast for 5 days.

356
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,870
Just to help boost your sales.

357
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,060
It's great having you.

358
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,130
I'll treat you to instant noodles.

359
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,070
Really?

360
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm hungry.

361
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,200
I'm starving too.

362
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,470
What do you want to eat?

363
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,300
Should we have this one?

364
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,770
Then I'll choose this one.

365
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,730
Sure.

366
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,230
Where can we cook these?

367
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,670
There's no water here.

368
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,270
Let's go to my place. I have water.

369
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,570
You've been there before. Let's go.

370
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,430
Okay.

371
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,530
Come on, you go first.

372
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,530
Alright.

373
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,170
Be careful.

374
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,970
Do you need help?

375
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,430
No need. It's really dark.

376
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,630
We all fear being replaced.

377
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,700
But sometimes replacement

378
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,870
means rebirth.

379
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,530
When you lose a pillar of support,

380
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,070
you need to find another key person.

381
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,970
Chen Zhenglin, 29 years old,

382
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,700
just won the bread competition championship.

383
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Many bakeries are trying to recruit him now.

384
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,200
I think if our Nuo Toast

385
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
can get ahead of others

386
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,030
and sign him,

387
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,300
we'll have a miracle of rebirth.

388
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,130
Thank you everyone.

389
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,530
Xiaoyuan,

390
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,070
what you just proposed,

391
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,030
other bakeries are already doing it.

392
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,830
Tong,

393
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,470
your idea is good,

394
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,870
but completely impossible to implement.

395
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,700
Amy,

396
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,900
I don't need to say anything,

397
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,530
same old problems.

398
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,600
Jimmy.

399
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Sorry.

400
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,630
Liying.

401
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,100
Aren't you supposed

402
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,900
to show Mr. Baimu around the store this afternoon?

403
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,400
Meeting adjourned.

404
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,930
We'll reconvene tomorrow.

405
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,770
Sister Shanru, I...

406
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,700
Should I rewrite it?

407
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Or should I just delete it?

408
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,270
Still thinking about your proposal?

409
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,800
I feel she doesn't like it.

410
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
She should just tell me directly.

411
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,330
Don't treat me like I'm invisible.

412
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,090
Otherwise I don't know if I should continue.

413
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,970
One Fangno just left,

414
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,700
and you're already helping your boss

415
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,570
find a new Fangno.

416
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,200
Have you considered that not exposing it

417
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,770
might be your boss's way of being kind?

418
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,530
Because revealing the truth would be cruel,

419
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,600
right?

420
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,530
What you said makes so much sense.

421
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,800
I'm here to inspire you.

422
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,930
You keep sneaking glances at girls.

423
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,470
I'm documenting the current situation for you.

424
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,630
Have you noticed your customers?

425
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,230
Have you noticed since we've been coming here

426
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,670
the customers who visit your shop

427
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,100
range from teenagers

428
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,870
to people in their thirties,

429
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,600
and they're mostly women.

430
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,470
Sir, your coffee is ready.

431
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,170
Great, thank you.

432
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,000
Is that your friend?

433
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,230
No.

434
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,490
I feel like I'm seeing us back in college.

435
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,970
Do you remember

436
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,270
how we just wanted to have one good meal?

437
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,300
We were so frugal back then.

438
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,530
How did we manage?

439
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,070
Yeah.

440
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,330
We even tried to save 10 dollars.

441
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,900
But did we ever eat at any good restaurants?

442
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,030
I only remember eating plain noodles.

443
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,200
That's not true.

444
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,430
We definitely had pasta too.

445
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,530
Occasionally.

446
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,800
Very occasionally.

447
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,330
We were so poor back then,

448
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,900
why on earth

449
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,700
did we insist on going to those fancy restaurants?

450
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,730
It was a way of imagining our future, I guess.

451
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,830
Every time we passed those restaurants,

452
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,130
everyone inside looked so happy.

453
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,470
I thought our future

454
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,000
could be like that too.

455
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,470
Why don't we go eat there now?

456
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,100
Go with your future girlfriend.

457
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm inviting her right now.

458
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,930
We have money now.

459
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,270
We can afford it.

460
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,270
We can eat whatever we want.

461
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,570
We don't have to

462
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,030
argue about saving 10 or 20 dollars anymore.

463
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,260
Happiness is right there.

464
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,000
Shall we go together?

465
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,430
Which one do you want?

466
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,430
This one. OK.

467
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,230
I've thought about it too.

468
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,230
I'll order Caesar dressing for my salad.

469
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,500
For soup, I want the puff pastry cream soup.

470
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,230
For the main course, steak medium.

471
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,900
You order seafood,

472
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,300
so we can share and taste each other's food.

473
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,670
Same with desserts.

474
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,500
One pudding, one tiramisu.

475
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,030
You can't have coffee.

476
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,960
You won't be able to sleep at night.

477
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,730
That sounds wonderful.

478
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,970
But it was college-me who wanted that,

479
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,430
not the current me.

480
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,370
So all of this for you

481
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,170
was just an act?

482
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,170
Yes.

483
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,600
Not even a little flutter.

484
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,870
Not even the slightest feeling. No.

485
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,130
None.

486
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,830
But I can go eat plain noodles with you.

487
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,370
I wish I hadn't confessed.

488
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,830
We're all adults now.

489
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,270
Are you okay?

490
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,900
For a moment there,

491
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,370
I thought I was being cool.

492
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,030
Now it feels a bit awkward.

493
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,630
You were cool.

494
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,900
The supporting actor kind of cool.

495
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,800
Let's go.

496
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,730
I'll go eat plain noodles with you.

497
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,800
Damn it.

498
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,830
Boss.

499
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,500
What are you doing here?

500
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,330
Boss.

501
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,800
Fu.

502
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,570
Boss, why are you here?

503
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,470
I'm looking for you because I want to know

504
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,070
where He Meixia is.

505
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,430
He Meixia?

506
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,530
I don't even know if she's alive or dead.

507
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,500
How could I possibly know where she is?

508
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,200
You don't believe me.

509
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,070
I have nothing to do with her.

510
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,430
You liked her back then, didn't you?

511
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,470
You were the only one in her heart.

512
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,400
I never had a chance.

513
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,700
A friend recommended this wine to me last time.

514
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,370
It's really good.

515
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,900
I ordered a whole case.

516
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,670
Dad.

517
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,300
How long have you been using these golf clubs?

518
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
They're so worn out.

519
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,730
Go pick out a new set. My treat.

520
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,400
Dad.

521
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,470
Weiyu.

522
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,030
Brother.

523
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,670
Stop focusing on things unrelated to work.

524
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,230
Perfecting yourself

525
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,560
is the best way to outdo your competitors.

526
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,800
If you end up damaging the company's reputation,

527
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,530
I won't stand by and do nothing.

528
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,700
Five milk teas,

529
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,030
five black teas,

530
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,900
OK, got it. These.

531
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Dad, can you manage by yourself?

532
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,270
No problem.

533
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,200
Are you sure?

534
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,300
Yes, trust me.

535
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,370
375.

536
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,230
Braised pork wrap,

537
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,890
radish cake, and egg pancake.

538
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,130
Kang.

539
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,630
Thought I'd check this place out before it goes under.

540
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,330
Not that impressive after all.

541
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,060
What's Deng Weiyu so afraid of?

542
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,870
This gift is for you.

543
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,630
These are the conversation records between Deng Weiyu and his assistant.

544
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,570
His assistant hired people to cause trouble here

545
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,300
and leave negative reviews.

546
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,730
He was behind it all.

547
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,330
He's fine as a friend or brother,

548
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,570
but if you're doing better than him,

549
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,030
that's a different story.

550
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,970
How is it that after all these years,

551
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,830
you still make the same mistakes?

552
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,870
I see now.

553
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,200
So it's because

554
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,500
Deng Weiyu is doing better than you

555
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,400
that you came here to sow discord.

556
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,900
That's all I can do to help you.

557
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,560
Good luck with your business.

558
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,670
Zhihao.

559
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,800
Who's that in the photo in your wallet?

560
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,730
My mom.

561
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,800
Your mom.

562
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Deng Weiyu, what are you looking at?

563
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,200
Looking at you.

564
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,930
I used to think

565
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,590
that hard work could always change the outcome.

566
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,100
But some people are born with a head start.

567
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,730
Go away.

568
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,570
Jiang Zhihao.

569
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,600
I really hate you.

570
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,930
Deputy Director.

571
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,330
These are the interview questions for tomorrow night's Time Creation Weekly.

572
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,230
I've already asked them to remove some questions.

573
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,470
Please review the remaining ones.

574
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,170
I'm here.

575
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,900
Go ahead.

576
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,600
We don't even have time for one game now.

577
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,900
I've been busy lately.

578
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,830
I need to go back for a meeting soon.

579
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,400
I can help you with your work.

580
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,770
Isn't that how it's always been?

581
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,730
I found out who my father is.

582
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,970
My biological father.

583
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,370
I never thought he'd be so rich.

584
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,900
I'm a rich kid too.

585
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,170
Aren't you curious who it is?

586
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,700
You look unhappy.

587
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,430
That makes me your brother, right?

588
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,970
Jiang Zhihao.

589
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,070
You know what I hate most about you?

590
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,300
You act like you don't care about anything.

591
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,700
But you still get everything you want.

592
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,500
Why do I work so hard?

593
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,260
Yet my father only cares about you.

594
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,570
Let me tell you.

595
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,600
San Francisco Beauty Salon is just a shabby shop.

596
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,530
Don't think that in front of my father,

597
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,400
just by talking smooth,

598
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,600
he'll think you're something special.

599
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,900
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

600
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,830
Fine.

601
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,830
I'll go claim him as my father right now.

602
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,100
Don't you dare.

603
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,430
Haven't you had enough?

604
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,770
Aren't we brothers?

605
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,570
I'm not your brother.

606
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,370
So many people love you anyway.

607
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,770
You don't need me at all.

608
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,100
Bastard.

609
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,800
Jiang Zhihao.

610
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,470
Did you get into a fight?

611
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,770
With my brother.

612
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,670
Who?

613
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,200
Wait, let's go to the hospital, okay?

614
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,070
Do you also find me annoying?

615
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,900
What?

616
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,070
All my life,

617
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,469
I've always told myself

618
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,530
that I'm not their biological child.

619
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,000
Jiang Zhihao.

620
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,730
Jiang Zhihao, what's wrong?

621
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,370
This way,

622
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,170
when I'm actually abandoned someday,

623
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,000
it might not hurt as much.

624
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,030
Liying.

625
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,800
It won't hurt so much.

626
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,270
Zhihao.

627
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,230
I'm really afraid of people

628
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,929
leaving me. You know?

629
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,659
Everyone probably thinks I have lots of friends,

630
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,700
but

631
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,530
I can't lose even one.

632
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,800
No one can replace my mother,

633
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,030
no one can replace Deng Weiyu,

634
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,230
and especially not you.

635
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,330
I feel like if my life

636
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,200
didn't have you in it,

637
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
I would be so bored.

638
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,370
Jiang Zhihao.

639
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,430
I'm here.

640
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,870
I've always been here.

641
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,530
Let's go to the hospital, okay?

642
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,730
I... let's go to the hospital now.

643
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,270
Do you like me?

644
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,130
So do you like me?

645
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,700
I can be serious.

646
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,000
I can be proper too.

647
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,470
I don't have to be so carefree all the time

648
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,270
if that's what you prefer.

649
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,430
I can be like Gao Bohan,

650
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,170
even though he's just a phony.

651
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,370
Jiang Zhihao.

652
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,430
Jiang Zhihao.

653
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,130
Jiang Zhihao, wake up.

654
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,770
I can't drag you anymore,

655
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,270
Jiang Zhihao.

656
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,900
Why are you drawing me?

657
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,600
What does that mean?

658
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,930
So you're really going to marry Xiao Qian?

659
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,230
What else?

660
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,100
Girls do this when they like you.

661
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,300
If you and this girl

662
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,200
have your own little world together,

663
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,670
then she probably likes you.

664
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,470
Lin Liying.

665
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,270
Corporate slave sandwich.

666
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,800
Thinking makes you hungry.

667
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,530
Meeting you here.

668
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,400
It's fate.

669
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,300
Here, have some ice cream.

670
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,670
What?

671
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,400
All the evidence proves my feelings.

672
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,300
Forever in love, talking endlessly.

673
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,600
Do you like me too?

674
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,470
I like you.

675
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,500
Shh.

676
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,500
You're awake.

677
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,430
Are you feeling better?

678
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,500
Who are you?

679
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,270
Who?

680
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,370
Lin Liying.

681
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,600
Then it's fine.

682
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,470
I'm a patient, you know.

683
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,170
Don't waste medical resources here

684
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,570
when you haven't even changed your clothes.

685
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,730
You're leaving?

686
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,530
Where's your dad?

687
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,930
I'll go find him outside.

688
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,260
You're really leaving?

689
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,330
I'm going now. Bye.

690
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,100
You're leaving?

691
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Yes.

692
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,570
What on earth happened

693
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,900
to make your face look like this?

694
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,470
Got bitten by a dog.

695
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,130
Dog bite?

696
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,870
That's ridiculous.

697
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,430
Did you provoke the dog?

698
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,170
Come, sit down.

699
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,470
Here.

700
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,930
Have a bowl of pork knuckle noodles.

701
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,100
This is what

702
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,630
prisoners eat.

703
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,600
It's to get rid of your bad luck.

704
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,000
Isn't being bitten by a dog unlucky enough?

705
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,560
Are you sure eating this won't make things worse?

706
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,570
You talk too much.

707
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,930
Are you eating it or not?

708
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,570
You eat it. I'm not hungry.

709
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,230
Are you sure you don't want it?

710
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,500
Yes.

711
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,770
Well, don't waste it then.

712
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,970
It's really delicious.

713
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,470
Eat more.

714
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,200
Seriously,

715
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,370
getting bitten by a dog

716
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,730
at your age.

717
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,830
Hey,

718
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,300
hello, Jiang Zhihao.

719
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,560
Are you open tomorrow?

720
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,400
Yes,

721
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,500
welcome.

722
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,630
Take it to the car. Be careful.

723
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,830
Careful.

724
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,930
Slowly.

725
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,070
That's good.

726
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,730
I'm so annoyed.

727
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,200
The whole team can't stop talking about your breakfast.

728
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,130
They keep asking for it.

729
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,570
No delivery today? Thanks.

730
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,600
I had to come get it myself.

731
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,870
It's just me today.

732
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,870
Sorry about that.

733
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,130
What happened to your face?

734
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,670
I was bitten by a dog.

735
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,800
Dog?

736
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,870
What kind of dog?

737
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,530
A very fierce dog.

738
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,530
Are you really not joining the competition?

739
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,830
Why do you want me to participate?

740
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,670
I figured it out.

741
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,330
Because the boss is handsome.

742
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,030
The first time I asked was because I thought he was handsome.

743
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,230
This time I'm asking because I think...

744
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,830
You seem a bit lost lately.

745
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,070
I want to help you.

746
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,870
Alright, think it through.

747
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,600
The whole team really loves your breakfast.

748
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,030
Besides,

749
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,270
I also need a

750
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,670
dark horse who can defeat Temporary Shift.

751
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,600
Let me be clear first.

752
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,570
We don't have a script.

753
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,300
I don't have any grudge against Temporary Shift.

754
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,370
But this predictable show

755
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,830
is not what I want to make.

756
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,400
Will there be free lunch boxes?

757
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,400
Not if you get eliminated.

758
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,630
Then I'll eat till the very end.

759
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,130
If you're going to keep treating me like an enemy,

760
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:20,800
okay,

761
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,500
I won't disappoint you, alright?

762
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,900
I won't break up with Weiyu.

763
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,470
Mom, don't treat me like an idiot.

764
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,230
I have my own life.

765
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,400
Can you please leave me alone?

766
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,930
We were never together.

767
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,870
She has someone better waiting for her.

768
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:31,730
Enough, Lin Liying.

769
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,570
I've been honest with myself,

770
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,230
you should face yourself honestly too.

771
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,100
Deng Weijie,

772
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,730
after you get married,

773
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,470
everyone will soon forget about your scandals.

774
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,730
Think about our Linlin Breakfast,

775
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,830
and the company's reputation, will you?

776
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:42,700
This son

777
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,130
is not my biological child.

778
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,430
Both mothers

779
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,400
are gone.
