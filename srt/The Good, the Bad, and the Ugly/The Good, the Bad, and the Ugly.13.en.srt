1
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,400
How's the test result?

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,730
What did the doctor say?

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,770
Colon cancer.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,130
Stage four.

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,200
Stage four.

6
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,470
Meixia.

7
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,330
Medicine is so advanced now.

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,090
Cancer isn't that scary anymore.

9
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,100
We'll do whatever the doctor says.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,130
We'll do chemotherapy if needed.

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,100
Take medicine as prescribed.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,670
You'll get better.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,470
You'll get better.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,430
Where's Mom?

15
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,400
Where's Mommy? Mom?

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,130
Mommy's here.

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,500
Sweetie.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,670
You're drooling.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,330
Drooling.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
Zhihao is such a good boy.

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,670
Look at that smile.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,730
Don't worry.

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,170
From now on,

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,970
Zhihao will be my child.

25
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,570
I'll take care of him like my own.

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,870
But if he's

27
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,370
naughty or mischievous

28
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,670
or disobedient,

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,900
I'll scold him and spank him

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,130
and discipline him.

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,130
If you have any concerns,

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,729
just come back to visit us often.

33
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,200
Okay.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,730
Alright.

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,630
Found it!

36
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,600
Your inline skates from last year

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,530
were left in my room.

38
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,230
Mom, what's wrong?

39
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,000
Just feeling a bit nostalgic

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,500
seeing these old things.

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,329
Knee pads.

42
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,100
Good.

43
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,300
Let's go find something to eat.

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,030
I'm starving. Come on.

45
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,130
You want to eat this late?

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,970
Yes.

47
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,370
Let's go. Okay, careful.

48
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Mom, did you take your blood pressure medicine today?

49
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
Yes, I did.

50
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,900
What's wrong?

51
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,800
Just a toothache.

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,170
It's an old problem. Don't worry.

53
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,770
I told you so.

54
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,230
Don't ignore chronic problems.

55
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,330
By the time you're 80,

56
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,700
all your teeth will fall out

57
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,600
and then you'll see how terrible it is.

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,270
It's not that. I'm afraid of going to the dentist.

59
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,770
He'll tell me to get dental implants again.

60
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,130
One implant costs 70,000 now.

61
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,600
That's terrifying!

62
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,930
What needs to be done must be done.

63
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,970
Besides, Mom,

64
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,130
your son's career is going well now.

65
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,470
Don't worry about money.

66
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,830
Leave it to me.

67
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,570
Just stay healthy and safe.

68
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,170
Okay.

69
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,330
I'll go see the dentist when I have time.

70
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,400
You'll really go?

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,770
When you were little,

72
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,870
you'd always whine at the dentist.

73
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,400
I remember

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,570
how you'd say it burns.

75
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,230
I can't believe you're saying these things now.

76
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,870
You mean that old dentist, right?

77
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,800
He was so mean,

78
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,170
and never gave any mental preparation

79
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,270
before pulling teeth out.

80
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,270
Cut it out.

81
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,570
Later we got a gentler one.

82
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,900
You still ended up lying on the floor.

83
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,800
Screaming like crazy.

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,130
I don't want to.

85
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,430
So embarrassing.

86
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,500
That must be Jiang Zhilu.

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,100
How could I possibly do something like that?

88
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,530
That's something only Jiang Zhilu would do.

89
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,460
How could I possibly act like that?

90
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,730
Do you know what time it is?

91
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,530
Still wanting a midnight snack?

92
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,200
You'll get fat.

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,130
Delicious.

94
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,530
I just asked if you wanted some.

95
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,600
But you're eating all of it.

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,200
Right, Mom?

97
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,000
That's right.

98
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,430
What do you mean I ate it all?

99
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,070
I only had two pieces.

100
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,330
It was full just now. You ate it all.

101
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,830
No.

102
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,430
Look at these chopsticks with teeth marks.

103
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,670
They're all chewed up.

104
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,470
Can we get new ones?

105
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,230
They look disgusting.

106
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,630
All the chopsticks at home are like this.

107
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,230
It's Jiang Zhilu who chews them.

108
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,100
She does this every time.

109
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,300
Always chewing on them.

110
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,600
Make her pay for new ones.

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,700
Can we buy new ones?

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
Don't get wooden ones.

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,500
Get metal chopsticks.

114
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,070
Let's see her try to chew those. She always does this...

115
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,430
While you're at it, can you buy me some of those...

116
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,670
Kitchen faucets.

117
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,930
The one we have won't shut off properly.

118
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,570
Faucet?

119
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,530
What? Are you going to fix it yourself?

120
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,330
Will you help me fix it?

121
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,000
Jiang Zhihao, that's your job.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,130
I really don't know how.

123
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,700
How could I possibly know how to fix a faucet?

124
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,830
Dad, you came after all.

125
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,170
What's the point of having you two men around?

126
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,270
Right, you can't do anything.

127
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,800
Stop eating.

128
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,530
Save this for Zhilu.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,370
Although I can't reveal too much at the moment,

130
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,870
it's my honor to collaborate

131
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,000
with Linlin Breakfast.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,700
Linlin Breakfast and Nuo Toast

133
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,670
are both leaders in their respective fields.

134
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,700
This powerful collaboration

135
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,970
has us all excited

136
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,230
about what sparks will fly next.

137
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,730
Isn't that your baker friend?

138
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,100
He's so handsome. He could be a star.

139
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,630
There's a lot.

140
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,000
What's going on?

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,170
Things you don't know about.

142
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,570
What's the deal?

143
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,530
Before collaborating with Nuo Toast,

144
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,400
they had already sparked public curiosity

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,370
through extensive media coverage.

146
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,130
So I've planned

147
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,530
to focus on showcasing the Nuo product line

148
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,130
at the 35th anniversary press conference,

149
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,130
emphasizing the concept of sophisticated elegance.

150
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,630
For this year's press conference,

151
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,190
you should give the speech instead of me.

152
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,530
Linlin Breakfast is turning 35 years old.

153
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,800
It's time to show everyone

154
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,660
our commitment to reaching younger demographics.

155
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,130
Thank you, Dad.

156
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,870
I'll prepare thoroughly.

157
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,200
Linlin Breakfast Customer Service. Hello.

158
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,100
About the New Orleans-style chicken burger,

159
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,900
our chicken

160
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,500
is seasoned uniformly at the factory before delivery to stores.

161
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,530
It's not possible for a single store

162
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,169
to make it too salty.

163
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,770
Yes.

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,570
Manager.

165
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,870
Manager.

166
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,800
Manager.

167
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,330
The customer insists on speaking with a supervisor.

168
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Hello.

169
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,800
Yes.

170
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,530
Excuse me.

171
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,530
Because...

172
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,900
How does it feel?

173
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,800
Did you ever think

174
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,400
this day would come?

175
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,200
Actually, I didn't.

176
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,230
Stop putting on an act.

177
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,800
All my life,

178
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,230
even though I've always tried hard

179
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,770
to beat you,

180
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,770
I knew deep down

181
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,530
no matter how much I did or how well I performed,

182
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,900
in the end,

183
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,800
Dad would still give everything to you.

184
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,730
You think you're so great?

185
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,930
If I hadn't been having such bad luck lately,

186
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,260
you wouldn't be sitting in this position.

187
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,100
You have no idea what I've sacrificed

188
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,600
to get here today.

189
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,170
Whatever the case,

190
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,870
I've won

191
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,970
this round.

192
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,100
Come on, cheers.

193
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
I'll skip the mushy stuff,

194
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,070
but thanks for your support during this time,

195
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,000
though I was the one taking care of you all.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,600
He joined later than us,

197
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,970
got promoted before us,

198
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,570
going to Temporary Shift,

199
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,330
everything about it is so much fancier.

200
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,600
Don't tell me you all wear suits as uniforms there?

201
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,930
You want to wear one?

202
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,800
You were wearing one those days when you betrayed us.

203
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
What are you arguing about?

204
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
You made me clean the toilets.

205
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,060
I haven't settled the score with you yet.

206
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,260
Actually, I wanted to ask you all something.

207
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,190
This will be Temporary Shift's first location.

208
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,700
If I had my old comrades who fought alongside me,

209
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
I'd be very confident.

210
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,130
Do you want to join me?

211
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,270
What about the Richu store?

212
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,870
It will continue, of course.

213
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,100
New rehabilitated people will come later.

214
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,370
But you might need to wait a bit longer.

215
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,200
After the handover is completed here,

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,170
you can all come to Temporary Shift together.

217
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,570
Because this is also a store we've put our heart and soul into.

218
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,370
Well...

219
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,830
I think

220
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,800
I need to think about it more.

221
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,600
Dayong, what about you?

222
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,530
I'll stay here.

223
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,830
Why are you looking at me?

224
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,670
I finally became the store manager after so much effort.

225
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,830
I'm staying here.

226
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,330
Alright.

227
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,030
I was just asking.

228
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,700
Right. No harm in asking.

229
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,630
What's wrong?

230
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,200
Why so sentimental?

231
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,670
Our group chat is still there. We can meet up anytime.

232
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,670
That's right.

233
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,600
By the way, where's the manager?

234
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,030
I called him in the group chat but he didn't respond.

235
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,830
Jiang Zhihao, aren't you close with him?

236
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,490
What's he doing? Yeah, right.

237
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,100
I don't know.

238
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,700
Let's see if he's read it.

239
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,200
This is my secret hideout.

240
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,090
Did you install a tracker on my phone?

241
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,570
It's our connection.

242
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,970
Actually, since I've known you,

243
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,570
I've changed quite a lot.

244
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,830
I've learned how to express myself,

245
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,130
protect myself,

246
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,530
and pursue the life I truly want.

247
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,970
In a way,

248
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,130
you could be considered my benefactor.

249
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,830
What kind of opening is this?

250
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,230
Are you confessing to me?

251
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,970
I used to think that as long as I worked hard,

252
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,170
I could definitely change the outcome.

253
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,400
But some people are born with a head start,

254
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,600
while others can give their all

255
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,900
and end up with nothing.

256
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,970
Deng Weiyu.

257
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,670
Deng Weijie becoming VP doesn't mean anything.

258
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,130
We still have a chance.

259
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,270
Don't you think your dad's attitude toward us

260
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,500
is completely different from before?

261
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,870
Right?

262
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't worry.

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,070
I'm here for you.

264
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,630
Cheer up!

265
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,700
Don't give up.

266
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,500
Or I'll punch you.

267
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,900
At the press conference,

268
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,770
we won't just be introducing Linshicha.

269
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,100
There will be other projects competing for attention.

270
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,230
So we need to make sure

271
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,330
everyone understands

272
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,130
how Linshicha differs from other brunch brands,

273
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,000
what makes us different

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,500
and what our unique features are.

275
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,300
Hello, Chairman.

276
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,100
Hello, Chairman.

277
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,830
Chairman.

278
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,960
It's fine. Everyone, please sit down.

279
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,100
Continue with your meeting.

280
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,970
Then I'll continue.

281
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,970
So what I want to say is

282
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,000
At the press conference,

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,400
we should highlight the source of our chicken.

284
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Previously at Linlin Breakfast...

285
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,300
Relax.

286
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,500
It's not your first time eating with me.

287
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,100
I guess you're right.

288
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
I'll make myself at home.

289
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,470
You just mentioned in the meeting

290
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,030
that Linshicha will use free-range chicken.

291
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,130
This idea certainly has appeal.

292
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,600
However,

293
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,570
have you considered the follow-up issues?

294
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,270
When we

295
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,700
launched our free-range burger series,

296
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,100
with just two items,

297
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
we already faced supply shortages.

298
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,630
I'm thinking

299
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,470
Linlin could bring these small farmers together

300
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,300
to operate our own chicken farm.

301
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,470
Rather than buying chicken from others

302
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,170
and worrying about insufficient supply

303
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,530
and inconsistent quality,

304
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,730
we might as well raise our own chickens.

305
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,430
I believe Linlin has the capability.

306
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,870
Once this system matures,

307
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,130
perhaps in the future we could become

308
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,500
our own supply chain

309
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,200
and provide this chicken

310
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,870
to some high-end restaurants.

311
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,270
But I'm just thinking out loud.

312
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,330
I think

313
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,030
you shouldn't stay at Linshicha.

314
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,570
I happen to need an assistant.

315
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,170
Though the work is more varied,

316
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,000
compared to Linshicha,

317
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,030
you'll have more room to develop.

318
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,369
What if I hope you won't go?

319
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,770
Why shouldn't I go?

320
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,500
Being by the Chairman's side,

321
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,230
I can learn so much.

322
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,470
And you know,

323
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,329
with a different perspective,

324
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,130
we might discover

325
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,230
issues we hadn't noticed before.

326
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,770
So I accepted.

327
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,500
I'm just worried that after I leave

328
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,530
I won't be able to handle everything alone.

329
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,630
Don't worry.

330
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,500
I've discussed this with the Chairman.

331
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,570
I'll still help develop

332
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,870
the menu for Linshicha,

333
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,070
and I'll still participate

334
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,370
in various meetings.

335
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,430
Brother,

336
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,770
I'm going to work for the Chairman

337
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,030
all to help you.

338
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,170
I'll be like Eunuch Su at the Emperor's side,

339
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,900
specifically to put in good words

340
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,230
for you, my Empress, to His Majesty.

341
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,470
Get out of here.

342
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,560
I never thought I'd come back here.

343
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,330
From now on I'll be working nine to five,

344
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,030
stuck in traffic,

345
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,330
and this area is a food desert.

346
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,870
Hello to all our media friends.

347
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,500
Welcome everyone to the event.

348
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,330
Please help yourselves to the refreshments.

349
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,400
Our chairman will be arriving shortly.

350
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,470
Thank you all.

351
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,300
Where should we put Deputy Director Deng's flower basket?

352
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,630
Follow me.

353
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,370
Just put it here.

354
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,430
Okay.

355
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,400
Deng Weijie and Fang Nuo...

356
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,200
Yes, we should leave.

357
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
Let's go now.

358
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,070
Photos of Fang Nuo's affair were captured.

359
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,700
Working with Linlin Breakfast...

360
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,260
Is it to make things convenient for you and Deng Weijie?

361
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,270
Was it you?

362
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,530
Chairman,

363
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,530
do we need to postpone the press conference by an hour?

364
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,330
No need.

365
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,700
Dad,

366
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,030
stay here.

367
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,830
Boss,

368
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,170
for the new project presentation later,

369
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,800
they've made some changes to the order.

370
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,570
They... All of you, get out.

371
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,600
I said everyone get out.

372
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,330
Let's welcome Linlin Breakfast's

373
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,600
Chairman, Deng Yongkuan.

374
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,170
Linlin has been through 35 years,

375
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,330
thanks to all our customers' support

376
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,570
and care.

377
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,630
In the future,

378
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,570
we will continue to explore new possibilities,

379
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,930
such as our

380
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,570
Linshicha Nuo series.

381
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,030
Happy 35th anniversary to Linlin,

382
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,370
happy birthday.

383
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,900
Chairman, may I ask

384
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,300
about your daughter and Fang Nuo's extramarital affair?

385
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,730
What are your thoughts on this matter?

386
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm sorry, the press conference is over.

387
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,070
We're not taking any questions.

388
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,230
Thank you everyone.

389
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,370
Thank you all.

390
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,270
Excuse me.

391
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,230
Chairman, let's go.

392
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,430
Chairman, this way.

393
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,700
Sorry, thank you everyone.

394
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,570
It's okay, no problem.

395
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,400
Alright.

396
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,000
As you can all see,

397
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,770
I'm still in good spirits.

398
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,400
In the future, I will continue to serve

399
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,000
as the commander-in-chief of Linlin Group.

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,170
As for my successor,

401
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,400
I hope everyone will pay attention to

402
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,070
the name Deng Weiyu.

403
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,970
He is my younger son.

404
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,370
Come, Weiyu.

405
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,530
My younger son, Deng Weiyu,

406
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,700
will be Linlin Group's

407
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,570
young driving force.

408
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,600
I hope everyone looks forward to

409
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,870
the fresh perspective this young man

410
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,400
will bring to Linlin Group.

411
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,330
Celebration banquet.

412
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,700
Tell me honestly,

413
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,230
did you set up that situation with Weijie?

414
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,630
No, I didn't.

415
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,530
It doesn't matter.

416
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,200
As long as we got the result we wanted.

417
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,300
She usually looks like an old maid,

418
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,760
yet she managed to get involved in an affair.

419
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,630
Do you think she also wants to help us?

420
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,600
I think Dad put me forward today

421
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,930
just to smooth over the press conference.

422
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,170
He probably doesn't sincerely

423
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,030
want me to take over the position.

424
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,870
Anyway,

425
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,770
he introduced you to the media today,

426
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,100
not someone else.

427
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,400
That's enough.

428
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,530
Now we just need to deal with

429
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,170
Jiang Zhihao.

430
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,230
So you're the chairman's special assistant now?

431
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,170
It's a bit annoying.

432
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,530
Don't worry.

433
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,230
I should go see Deng Yongkuan now.

434
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,270
Please, what are you doing?

435
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,800
You're making it more wrinkled.

436
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,930
Go away.

437
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,830
Look, it's all wrinkled now.

438
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,370
Mom.

439
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,670
Don't you think I should get a

440
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,530
more stylish haircut?

441
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,700
Let me see.

442
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,430
Wait until you lose some weight.

443
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,900
Then I'll cut it for you.

444
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,160
You don't look good like this.

445
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,330
Listen.

446
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,330
You'll be working with the big boss now.

447
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,130
You need to fix that habit of talking back.

448
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,800
Okay? Don't always try to argue with people.

449
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,330
He's the big boss.

450
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,030
He doesn't need your lessons, understand?

451
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,370
Maybe the boss actually wants to hear the truth.

452
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,630
Why else did ancient emperors have prime ministers, right?

453
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,230
That's why those ministers ended up banging their heads against pillars.

454
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm begging you not to be the kind

455
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
who needs to bang his head against pillars

456
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,070
to prove himself.

457
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,270
Just keep a low profile

458
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,600
and stay out of trouble.

459
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,570
Got it?

460
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,130
Mom.

461
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,430
Your son's talent

462
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,160
doesn't allow for mediocrity.

463
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,570
Here.

464
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,400
All right. Try it on.

465
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,200
So, what's your boss like?

466
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,170
Is he easy to get along with?

467
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,430
You mean the chairman?

468
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,630
I think he's a bit reserved,

469
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,000
but actually quite approachable.

470
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,430
And I feel like we're on the same wavelength.

471
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,370
Really?

472
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,630
Last time I mentioned that

473
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,670
chicken farm thing to him.

474
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,570
Then I just rambled on and on,

475
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,300
talking until I didn't even know what I was saying.

476
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,400
But he understood.

477
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,770
He actually understood!

478
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,070
Really? That's good.

479
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,030
That's great then.

480
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,430
Forgetting your phone on your first day.

481
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,630
Seriously.

482
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,130
Hello. Please have a seat.

483
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,230
Hot tea. Please enjoy.

484
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,000
Thank you.

485
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You're welcome.

486
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,900
Mom,

487
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,500
why weren't you answering my calls?

488
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,170
Thank goodness you're home.

489
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,700
I was so worried.

490
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,970
I went out of my way to bring this and you're still complaining.

491
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,130
Hurry up and check it.

492
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,230
Messages keep popping up.

493
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,100
Might be something important.

494
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,870
It's nothing.

495
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,270
Just those guys from the Richu store.

496
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,930
Not focusing on work

497
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,570
and playing with your phone instead.

498
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,230
Really now.

499
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,900
Thank you.

500
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,770
Are you feeling hot?

501
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,300
Yes, it's really hot today.

502
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,900
It's very hot outside today.

503
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,630
Enjoying the AC... Hello, Chairman.

504
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,670
Chairman.

505
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,960
What brings you to this floor?

506
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,330
I came to discuss something with the VP.

507
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,270
Carry on.

508
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,530
Who is this?

509
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,300
This is my mother.

510
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,770
She brought me something.

511
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,630
Nice to meet you.

512
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,130
You've raised your son well.

513
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,030
Thank you for taking care of Jiang Zhihao, Chairman.

514
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,170
Not at all.

515
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:16,970
Just get me a cup of tea.

516
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,070
Tea. Good.

517
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,630
Come, sit down.

518
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,670
Jiang Zhihao

519
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,670
is very energetic at work

520
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,830
and he has lots of ideas.

521
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,670
Yes, he's been like that since he was little.

522
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,730
Who knows what's going on in his head.

523
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,130
Really?

524
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,730
Looking at Zhihao's cooking skills,

525
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,300
did you teach him?

526
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,730
It's genetic.

527
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,700
He's always loved eating since he was a child. Look,

528
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,500
so much meat.

529
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,700
Yes, seems like he's put on some weight.

530
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,070
I wanted you to wash my hair.

531
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,730
There was no one downstairs, so I came up myself.

532
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,530
What's wrong?

533
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,330
You didn't act like this last time we met.

534
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,300
So you know everything now?

535
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,530
Good that you know.

536
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,130
I don't want to see you at all.

537
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,330
So what are you planning to do?

538
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,900
Will you tell Deng Yongkuan the truth?

539
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,370
He Meixia has been dead for so long.

540
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,800
Yongkuan has already forgotten about her.

541
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,300
Even if he hasn't forgotten,

542
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
how deep do you think their relationship was?

543
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,730
Yongkuan would never accept

544
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,470
a child of a woman who betrayed him.

545
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,630
If Deng Yongkuan doesn't acknowledge him.

546
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,170
Why are you so nervous?

547
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,030
Blood ties don't lie.

548
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,370
Meixia wouldn't tell me before she died

549
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,000
who Zhihao's father was.

550
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,230
But heaven has its eyes.

551
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,960
What we should know, we will eventually find out.

552
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,630
Zhihao isn't your biological son.

553
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,500
What if he returns to the Deng family

554
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,430
and doesn't want you anymore?

555
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,900
Let's do this.

556
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,770
I'll give you some money.

557
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,130
Take this secret to your grave,

558
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,400
and I promise nothing will change.

559
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,870
You raised Zhihao all by yourself.

560
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,000
It must have been tough all these years.

561
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,330
How much longer can you keep this old beauty salon running?

562
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,000
Think about yourself.

563
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Take some money and enjoy your retirement.

564
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,030
Do you think everyone is like you?

565
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,070
Yes, Zhihao isn't my biological son,

566
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,100
but our relationship

567
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,870
is even stronger than blood.

568
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,100
It's not something someone like you,

569
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,960
who only knows how to humiliate people with money, would understand.

570
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,600
Don't think I don't know anything.

571
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,730
It was you.

572
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,200
You told He Meixia

573
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,130
that you were Deng Yongkuan's girlfriend,

574
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,200
and that you were getting married,

575
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,100
calling her the mistress.

576
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,270
And what happened?

577
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,170
I've checked the news.

578
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,300
After all these years,

579
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,830
Deng Yongkuan still hasn't married you.

580
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,530
You've done so many things,

581
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,430
but what's the point?

582
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,170
In the end, you have nothing.

583
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,200
Deng Weiyu is my son,

584
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,970
he's about to take over the business.

585
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,300
I won't end up with nothing.

586
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,000
Fine.

587
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,530
If you don't take the money,

588
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,500
then consider this war.

589
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,270
I destroyed He Meixia on my own back then.

590
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,100
Now with one word from me and Weiyu,

591
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,600
we can destroy Jiang Zhihao anytime.

592
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,470
It's up to you.

593
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,900
What did you just say?

594
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,970
What's wrong?

595
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,530
Why are you pretending?

596
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,930
What's wrong with Mom?

597
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,670
Mom.

598
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't panic.

599
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,130
Did she forget to take her medicine again?

600
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,130
I don't know either.

601
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,200
Mom.

602
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,630
It's okay.

603
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,200
What should we do?

604
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,830
Don't worry.

605
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,130
Mom.

606
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,800
Ma'am.

607
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,500
It's alright.

608
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,570
Mom will get better. Don't worry.

609
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,870
Family of Lai Xiurong?

610
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,770
Here.

611
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,730
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,199
We did our best.

613
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,100
Please accept my condolences.

614
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,570
Dad.

615
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,400
What happened?

616
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,170
What exactly happened?

617
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,430
How could this happen?

618
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,960
How could this happen? Mom!

619
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,970
Mr. Jiang.

620
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,970
We'll be sending the body to the funeral home shortly.

621
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,400
Does your mother have any special religious beliefs? Mom?

622
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,570
Should we go help?

623
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,700
Okay.

624
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,030
Shide, I'll handle this.

625
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,030
Are you from the funeral service?

626
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,770
Yes.

627
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,330
Excuse me.

628
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,500
This happened so suddenly.

629
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,170
If you need anything,

630
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,330
just let me know.

631
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,300
Come.

632
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,530
What is it?

633
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,630
Let me know if you need anything else.

634
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,070
Okay, no problem.

635
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm here.

636
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,200
We're all here for you.

637
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,000
Dad.

638
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,630
Do you want something to eat?

639
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,130
Mom.

640
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,430
What do you think of this one?

641
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,600
Aunt Xiurong's friends won't recognize her.

642
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,330
Even I might not recognize her.

643
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,370
But...

644
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,500
Don't women like to reminisce

645
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,900
about how they looked when they were young?

646
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,470
Really not good?

647
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,530
No.

648
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,930
How about this one?

649
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,330
What do you think of this?

650
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,000
It's cute.

651
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,200
I once thought about

652
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,400
when I die,

653
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,700
I want to put a QR code

654
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,470
on my urn.

655
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,930
So people who miss me

656
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,370
can scan it and see

657
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,430
the beautiful memories of my life.

658
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,870
So what do you think?

659
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,570
If I include the video of my mom

660
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,430
at the Pink Girls concert

661
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,530
on there,

662
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,100
would she be happy?

663
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,970
Look.

664
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,700
There's Zhilu,

665
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,870
Uncle Shide,

666
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,970
and you.

667
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,730
These are the memories your mom would want most.

668
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,970
I don't know if my mom was happy when she was alive.

669
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,370
The three of us

670
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,030
took turns giving her trouble every day.

671
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,770
My dad loved gambling.

672
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,330
And I was often irresponsible.

673
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,900
Jiang Zhilu was like a wild horse.

674
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,930
But our family was quite united.

675
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,270
But was my mom really happy?

676
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,070
What's wrong?

677
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,170
You really don't understand women.

678
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Memories with all of you

679
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,270
are what made your mom happiest.

680
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,400
Alright, I get it.

681
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,030
Let's see if there's anything else.

682
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,670
I went to the hospital for a check-up today.

683
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,670
The doctor said my condition isn't good.

684
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,770
I might die soon.

685
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,800
Since we broke up,

686
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,870
I've never regretted it.

687
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,270
I don't regret falling in love with you

688
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,470
or breaking up with you.

689
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,670
But today I suddenly regret something.

690
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,030
I don't know if my decision

691
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,830
not to tell you about Zhihao was right.

692
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,070
After I die,

693
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,900
what will happen to Zhihao?

694
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,400
His father and mother won't be by his side.

695
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,000
Yongkuan.

696
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,200
If one day you find out

697
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,130
Zhihao is your son,

698
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,530
will you love him?

699
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:35,800
Are you really quitting?

700
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,670
I've already helped you become vice president.

701
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,070
How long are you going to keep

702
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,200
acting like brothers with him?

703
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,600
He's your biggest competitor.

704
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,970
After the funeral,

705
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,670
I felt a huge emptiness inside.

706
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,930
Many things you think about

707
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,230
and what you actually do

708
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,830
are two different things.

709
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,930
Lin Liying.

710
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,100
Gao Bohan.

711
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,830
Real life can be even more dramatic

712
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,470
than a soap opera.

713
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,100
It's the human heart that's truly tested.

714
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,470
I happen to know someone

715
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,300
who eats blood cake just like you do.

716
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,100
Chairman.

717
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,830
I want to submit my resignation.
