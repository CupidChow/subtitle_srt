1
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,900
Hello.

2
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,570
Welcome.

3
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,470
You really came.

4
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,700
And you speak French too.

5
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,330
Good.

6
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,230
Of course.

7
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,800
You don't have many friends of the opposite sex.

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400
So of course I'd come.

9
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,130
Do you know this is

10
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,870
a dating reality show?

11
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,270
Of course I know.

12
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,630
Dating shows always have handsome guys.

13
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,530
Such a good opportunity,

14
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,130
and you still thought of me.

15
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,930
That's really loyal of you.

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,400
This show doesn't say

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,270
you can only be with others.

18
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,570
Maybe in the end,

19
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,230
we'll be the ones dating.

20
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,230
We've known each other for over twenty years.

21
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,100
If we were meant to be together, we would've been together long ago.

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,700
That's because

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,130
you never saw me as dating material.

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,030
After the show starts,

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,830
we'll be living together every day,

26
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,630
spending all our time together.

27
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,200
Maybe you'll see a different side of me.

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,200
Why are you talking

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,600
like you have a secret crush on me?

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
It's weird.

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,630
Lin Liying.

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,270
What if I told you I asked you to come

33
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,230
because I like you?

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:49,630
I like you.

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
Why would I have such a dream?

36
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,570
It's making me so anxious.

37
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,130
Really.

38
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,400
Why do you keep calling me?

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,500
Hey.

40
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,330
What do you want?

41
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,770
I wanted to ask you,

42
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,300
that day we went to the hospital,

43
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,370
did I say anything strange to you?

44
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Because I feel like I said something, but

45
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,770
I can't seem to remember.

46
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,000
You don't remember?

47
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,970
You didn't say anything special.

48
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,670
You were just yelling like crazy.

49
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,030
Yelling like crazy?

50
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,130
How is that possible?

51
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,900
That's not my style at all.

52
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,200
Right. Fighting is your style.

53
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,270
You still haven't told me

54
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,900
what happened that day.

55
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,130
The recent issues with the breakfast shop

56
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,600
were all arranged by Deng Weiyu.

57
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
He knows I'm his brother.

58
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,670
Anyway, the day I met with him,

59
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,800
no matter what I said or did,

60
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
he thought I was competing with him.

61
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,770
I might as well go back to being Linlin's rich kid.

62
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,030
After all, a gift falling from the sky,

63
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,000
why refuse it?

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,930
Right?

65
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,070
A secret rich heir!

66
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,970
Remember to help me out.

67
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,300
Luxury apartment in Xinyi District,

68
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,730
close to the MRT,

69
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,930
two bedrooms and a living room. Thanks.

70
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,730
Lin Liying,

71
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,970
you already live in a luxury apartment in Xinyi District,

72
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,830
and you're still thinking about the MRT?

73
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,700
You really don't even know how to dream properly.

74
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,000
That's so cute.

75
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,700
I originally wanted to take a laid-back approach,

76
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,960
but now my fighting spirit has been completely ignited.

77
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,530
I must make San Francisco Beauty Salon successful.

78
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,200
I want to show Deng Weiyu

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,530
that I don't even care to compete with him.

80
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,030
That's amazing.

81
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,170
Hidden rich heir.

82
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,600
What are you doing? Keeping goldfish?

83
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm using it for you.

84
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,530
Deng Weiyu got hurt too.

85
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,500
He said he got into a fight with someone,

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,770
but he won.

87
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,400
Easy!

88
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
You fight but can't handle the pain? Take it easy.

89
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,170
Whatever.

90
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,130
What's wrong with you guys?

91
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,770
Why fight for no reason?

92
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,200
It's just been too hot lately,

93
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,730
makes everyone irritable.

94
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,570
So tempers flare.

95
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,730
Hot temper?

96
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,030
I'll make your temper even worse.

97
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,100
Much worse!

98
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,430
Hope it hurts like hell.

99
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
You're asking for it.

100
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,430
Childish.

101
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,300
Weiyu.

102
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,430
The food is heated and ready inside.

103
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,630
Okay, thanks.

104
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,000
Take this ointment

105
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,470
and apply it. Your wound will heal better.

106
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,570
Don't look at your phone while walking anymore.

107
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,870
You're like a little kid,

108
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,400
still bumping into things.

109
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,400
Peng.

110
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,500
Don't tell my mom.

111
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,100
Don't worry, I understand.

112
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,230
Come on.

113
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,530
Whatever the issue is, solve it like adults

114
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,530
in a proper way.

115
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,500
Adult way?

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,830
Okay.

117
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,370
Deng Weiyu,

118
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,300
you know my bank account, right?

119
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,530
Transfer one million to me,

120
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,000
and I'll apologize in any language

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,470
you want.

122
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,500
Jiang Zhihao,

123
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,560
I asked you to communicate properly.

124
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,500
I'm just kidding.

125
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,030
We didn't do anything wrong.

126
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,670
Why so serious?

127
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,970
Let's just forget

128
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,900
about what happened before, okay?

129
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Are you two really okay?

130
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,070
It's fine now.

131
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,130
Really, it's okay.

132
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,060
Or would you rather see this kind of

133
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,230
stuff?

134
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,800
Excuse me, may I borrow Lulu for a moment?

135
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,600
Lulu.

136
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,030
I'm counting on you two

137
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,360
to talk things through.

138
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,830
I just picked my nose.

139
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,270
But I washed my hands.

140
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,570
Childish.

141
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,600
I was about to ask if you're bored.

142
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,430
Jiang Zhilu doesn't know, right?

143
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,770
I haven't told her.

144
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,670
I hope you two can work things out.

145
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,630
She really likes you.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,060
Our business is none of your concern.

147
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,070
I'm really tired of arguing with you.

148
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,970
Seriously.

149
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,370
If you insist on treating me like an enemy,

150
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,300
fine.

151
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,870
I won't disappoint you, okay?

152
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,730
Dropping the act now, aren't you?

153
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,500
Fine. I'll be watching.

154
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,030
Deng Weiyu.

155
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,600
After Fang Nuo left, we've been

156
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,400
trying to retain Nuo Toast's customers,

157
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,000
perhaps not just the customers and workshop.

158
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,900
But we have to admit,

159
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Fang Nuo

160
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,000
is the soul of our Nuo Toast.

161
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,300
But have we considered

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
that there might be a group of people

163
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,270
who never came to Nuo Toast

164
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,670
because of Fang Nuo?

165
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,900
I recently observed our store and noticed

166
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,370
there are often groups of girls

167
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,770
who come to our store.

168
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,530
They usually

169
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,670
spend time in the nearby shopping district,

170
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,630
shopping and chatting,

171
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,130
or even after watching a movie,

172
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,300
they come to our store

173
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,730
for afternoon tea.

174
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,330
I actually think

175
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,270
we should focus on this market,

176
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,100
creating a Nuo Toast that's

177
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,170
delicious,

178
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,070
attractive,

179
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,000
and fun as a new trend.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,670
Eating at Nuo Toast

181
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,370
should be a fashionable thing.

182
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,000
I want to bring my girlfriends here.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,370
This is the future I want to create.

184
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,500
Thank you all.

185
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,200
Business transformation always has a painful period.

186
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
As long as our quality remains the same,

187
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,800
everything else

188
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,800
can be tested by the market.

189
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,900
Take it back.

190
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,800
Do you think I should organize

191
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,530
some interactive activities with customers?

192
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,130
For example,

193
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,100
making desserts,

194
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,500
or making toast.

195
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,530
That kind of activity.

196
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,600
If you can't work with me,

197
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
I can discuss it with my colleagues.

198
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,470
It's fine.

199
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,400
You don't think I'm still upset, do you?

200
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm just thinking about how to draw.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,670
So you're okay now?

202
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,470
You think you're that charming?

203
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,270
That's good then.

204
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,070
Those male leads in idol dramas

205
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,300
who can't get over the female leads

206
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,730
are really annoying.

207
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,100
So I'm the male lead now?

208
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,200
Didn't someone just say

209
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,030
I was only the second male lead?

210
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,830
You really hold grudges.

211
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,200
I need to go.

212
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,330
My mom asked me to come home for dinner.

213
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,500
My mom, she...

214
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,560
asked me to have dinner at your place.

215
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,160
It really makes a difference.

216
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,670
The skin feels so soft.

217
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,030
It seems a bit whiter too.

218
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,770
You should try my essential oil spa.

219
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,000
It smells so good.

220
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,930
Next time I'll take you for a hot stone bath.

221
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,130
Okay.

222
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,270
You two,

223
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,600
what's wrong?

224
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Is it because we're here

225
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,730
that you feel embarrassed?

226
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Today after our facial,

227
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,530
we thought we could all have dinner together.

228
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,070
Or are we interrupting

229
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,630
your romantic time?

230
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,330
Auntie, Grandma, Mom,

231
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,000
we have something to tell you.

232
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,470
We... we were never together.

233
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,300
What do you mean?

234
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,230
What do you mean 'never together'?

235
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,470
Didn't you tell me to say we broke up

236
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,270
so your mom wouldn't scold you?

237
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,170
Mom,

238
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,170
Auntie, Grandma,

239
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,170
I sincerely want to

240
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,370
apologize to you all.

241
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,670
Actually, Liying and I

242
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,970
were never together from the beginning.

243
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,300
It started because of the blind date.

244
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,400
I asked for her help,

245
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,030
but who knew later on

246
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,900
things would get so out of hand

247
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,470
and become uncontrollable.

248
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,700
So no,

249
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm single,

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,100
single,

251
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,170
a golden bachelor.

252
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:18,970
It's okay.

253
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,430
So,

254
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,400
you...

255
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,430
you two were fake all along?

256
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,100
What's past is past.

257
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,200
All that happened is also fate.

258
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,270
Since you're both still single,

259
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,030
why not take this chance to be together?

260
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,300
Or does

261
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,770
Liying have a boyfriend?

262
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,230
She doesn't. She doesn't.

263
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,770
Mom,

264
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,230
Liying is truly

265
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,570
a wonderful girl.

266
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,100
It's just that she has

267
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,900
someone better waiting for her.

268
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,470
I don't want her to miss out.

269
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,530
Let's eat.

270
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,130
Come.

271
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,000
Mom, come.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,430
Have some fish.

273
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,430
Auntie.

274
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,599
Try some chicken.

275
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,730
I'm so hungry. I'm going to eat now.

276
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,130
Finally, I don't have to pretend anymore.

277
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,400
Lying feels really awful.

278
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,530
Lying really does feel terrible.

279
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,100
But why don't you just tell your mom directly?

280
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,330
I don't think your mom is the type

281
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,570
who's unreasonable.

282
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,330
If you don't want to go on blind dates,

283
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,900
just tell her straight up.

284
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,670
'My Amnesiac Girlfriend.'

285
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,070
Have you seen this movie?

286
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,400
I don't have amnesia,

287
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
and I'm your ex-girlfriend.

288
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,770
You know,

289
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,630
the main character in that movie,

290
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,330
whenever she wakes up,

291
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,330
she forgets everything that happened the day before.

292
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,570
So if my memory

293
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,300
could only last for one day,

294
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,130
would I forget

295
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,830
that you rejected me

296
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,630
and think we still have a chance?

297
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,330
That would be terrible, right?

298
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,770
So,

299
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,430
I told myself

300
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,170
that today is the last day.

301
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,800
This afternoon,

302
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
I told you I was over you.

303
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,400
I was lying to you.

304
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,600
I still really like you.

305
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,470
Alright, Lin Liying.

306
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,030
I've been honest with myself.

307
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,900
You should be honest with yourself too.

308
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,600
Do you even know how to have fun?

309
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,930
Who swings that low?

310
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,730
Don't push me.

311
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,800
Hard to say.

312
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,570
- Push you down.
- Don't push me.

313
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,970
It's too high.

314
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,030
[Push]

315
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,200
It's such a pity we couldn't become

316
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
in-laws with you.

317
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,630
I think Bohan still has feelings

318
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,430
for our Liying.

319
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,470
I know my son.

320
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,900
He's been putting on an act for so long

321
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,830
just because

322
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,070
he's afraid I'll make him go on blind dates.

323
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,200
But since he's made himself clear,

324
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,330
he must have made up his mind.

325
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,800
Young people need their space.

326
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,470
More than those two,

327
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm more worried

328
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,230
that we won't have many chances to meet up anymore.

329
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,400
Life will become so boring.

330
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,070
Their lack of fate is their business.

331
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,770
We can meet up on our own.

332
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,770
Let me tell you,

333
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,100
I'm running a crochet class.

334
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,970
Why don't you all join?

335
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,200
Sure. It's fun.

336
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,900
Okay. Really?

337
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,700
But my eyesight isn't good.

338
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,570
That's not a problem. Don't worry.

339
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,770
Just wear reading glasses.

340
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,430
Is it that simple?

341
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,030
Yes, everyone has a great time.

342
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,430
Come join the class. Sure.

343
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,760
Mom, let's go together.

344
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,200
I quit.

345
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,300
Thank you, Deputy Manager,

346
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,230
for giving me this platform at Temporary Difference.

347
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,530
But I don't want to be a supporting role anymore.

348
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,570
Now I can finally open

349
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,530
my own restaurant.

350
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,400
I don't want to miss any opportunity.

351
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,230
This is what I've always wanted.

352
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,270
The show is about to start filming.

353
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,330
If I win representing Temporary Difference,

354
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,730
I'll have all kinds of opportunities then.

355
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,330
At this particular time?

356
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,800
Someone offers Jason to open a restaurant

357
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,430
seems too convenient.

358
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,170
I think someone is up to something.

359
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,530
Should I look into it for you?

360
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,300
Alright, that's not important.

361
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,170
What matters most now is

362
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,430
finding someone to replace him quickly.

363
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,870
Don't worry about this.

364
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,130
I'll handle it myself.

365
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,800
Jason is at least a head chef level.

366
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,300
You're suggesting people who just carry plates at Michelin restaurants.

367
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,500
Is that acceptable?

368
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,400
Those people I just mentioned,

369
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,670
you either think their resumes aren't impressive enough

370
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,000
or they're not camera-friendly enough.

371
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,030
If there were such perfect candidates,

372
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,700
they would have gone on the show themselves already,

373
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,500
not waiting for you to find them.

374
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,530
I thought of someone.

375
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,400
Jiang Zhihao.

376
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,330
No way.

377
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,600
Why not?

378
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,730
Jiang Zhihao was an early developer for Temporary Difference.

379
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,730
No one understands Temporary Difference better than him.

380
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,800
Jiang Zhihao is no longer part of our team.

381
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,430
His loyalty is questionable.

382
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,360
Absolutely not.

383
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,370
After the press conference.

384
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,630
You've changed quite a bit.

385
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,730
You don't have the same drive as before.

386
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,430
Maybe that's for the best.

387
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,730
You used to always say you had no time

388
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,670
to think about marriage.

389
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,130
Now you can finally give it serious thought.

390
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,830
I have no plans to get married right now.

391
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,170
When I meet the right person, I will.

392
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,400
I've met the eldest son of Hongpin Group.

393
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
He has his father's determination.

394
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,470
Find some time to have dinner together.

395
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,170
Hongpin's eldest son

396
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,600
is shorter than me

397
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,670
and fat.

398
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,270
In your eyes,

399
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,900
am I only worthy of someone like that?

400
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,200
What right do you have to criticize him?

401
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,730
After you get married,

402
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,390
everyone will soon forget about your scandals.

403
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,090
That was a misunderstanding.

404
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,970
I worked so hard to raise you,

405
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,430
only for you to wreck someone's marriage

406
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,070
and become a mistress?

407
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,000
If you won't think about yourself,

408
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,530
at least think about our Linlin Breakfast

409
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,790
and the company's reputation, will you?

410
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,470
Deng Weijie.

411
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,330
Why are you here?

412
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,830
This is my shop.

413
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,200
It's been open for two weeks now.

414
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
But I haven't told many people.

415
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,660
I wanted to keep it simple.

416
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:46,770
I have something urgent to do.

417
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,100
I need to go now.

418
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,770
Wait.

419
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,070
It's raining.

420
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,230
Here, take this.

421
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,330
Take it.

422
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,570
Our bread

423
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,170
comes fresh out of the oven at 3 p.m.

424
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,030
You're welcome to visit anytime.

425
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,570
The garbage truck is here.

426
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,400
So I...

427
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,300
I need to take out the trash.

428
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,800
Take care.

429
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,270
Make sure to come by.

430
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,300
Bye.

431
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,270
Welcome.

432
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,300
Ma'am,

433
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,870
how did you know I work here?

434
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,960
That wasn't hard to figure out.

435
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,570
Let me show you to a seat.

436
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,130
It's smaller than I expected,

437
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,730
but the atmosphere is nice.

438
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,500
Ma'am,

439
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
you're not here for a drink.

440
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,570
What brings you here to see me?

441
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,430
I really enjoy talking to smart people.

442
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,800
Here.

443
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,170
I won't break up with Weiyu.

444
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,670
You think I'm here to pay you

445
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,130
to break up with him?

446
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,230
Not at all.

447
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,670
A lady I know

448
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,330
is having an art exhibition soon.

449
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,900
I'd like to invite you to come with me.

450
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,700
We didn't get a chance to talk properly last time.

451
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,770
We should build our relationship.

452
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,200
I also want to show off

453
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,630
how beautiful my son's girlfriend is.

454
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,000
Besides,

455
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,130
attending more of these events

456
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,770
would be helpful for him.

457
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,030
Zhilu,

458
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,830
don't I look handsome like this?

459
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,130
What's the use of being handsome?

460
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,770
It looks good on the show.

461
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,830
What's wrong? Did you fight with Weiyu again?

462
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,070
No.

463
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,730
Then why the long face?

464
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,270
Is he not replying to your messages?

465
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,830
What's going on between you two?

466
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,970
I asked Weiyu but he won't tell me either.

467
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,800
It's annoying being caught in the middle like this.

468
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,900
Then stop being so nosy.

469
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,470
Fine.

470
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,900
I'm being nosy.

471
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,530
Jiang Zhihao

472
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,330
If a fried egg

473
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,800
falls in love with smoked chicken,

474
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,060
what song would it sing when confessing?

475
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,500
Excuse me,

476
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,600
this joke existed before you were born.

477
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,800
I can't believe you're still using it.

478
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,700
But my mom told me about it yesterday.

479
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,200
She's going to join a bad joke contest.

480
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,100
I think she'll fail.

481
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,600
Bad joke contest?

482
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,030
Is it about who's less funny?

483
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,130
I don't know.

484
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,230
What bad joke contest?

485
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,100
It's an Open Mic.

486
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,700
It's a stand-up comedy show.

487
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,970
I've been preparing for so long.

488
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,630
I'll invite you to come watch.

489
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,800
Preparing for so long...

490
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,260
Just for a little love song about fried eggs?

491
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,630
Is it funny?

492
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,130
It is.

493
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,330
Very funny.

494
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,330
I told Miaomiao about it yesterday.

495
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,890
You've signed it already?

496
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,400
That was quick.

497
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,670
Yes.

498
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,730
This is a contract.

499
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,770
Shouldn't you read it more carefully?

500
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,400
Aren't you afraid I might sell you off?

501
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,500
Would you?

502
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,430
Depends on how you behave.

503
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,230
Anyway, I've got your indenture contract now.

504
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,770
No need to be nervous.

505
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,600
Profile photo.

506
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,800
Good. Relax a bit.

507
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,730
Expression, more natural expression.

508
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,300
Good. Confident and bright.

509
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,030
Now, change your pose.

510
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,730
Look determined.

511
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,670
This isn't good. This one.

512
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,030
You're not in a marathon.

513
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,730
Okay, styling team, fix the clothes.

514
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,300
Fix it up. Touch up the makeup.

515
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,630
Um, the Linshi restaurant team can't make it now.

516
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,830
Can't come? No problem. They can reshoot later.

517
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,100
Then let's do

518
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,300
Meizi first.

519
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,530
Okay, move forward.

520
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,130
Alright, let's adjust the shooting schedule.

521
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,400
Good. We can continue once the styling team is done.

522
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
The Linshi restaurant?

523
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Their head chef Jason suddenly quit.

524
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,970
Everything's a mess now.

525
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,370
They can't find anyone to represent them in the competition.

526
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,600
What if they can't find anyone?

527
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,500
Worst case, Linshi will withdraw from the show.

528
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,800
Fortunately, we haven't officially started recording.

529
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,130
It won't affect us much.

530
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,300
We're here.

531
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,200
So the place you mentioned for buying afternoon tea for colleagues...

532
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
It's Nuo Toast?

533
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,030
We'll be working late today.

534
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,070
We need lots of sweets for energy.

535
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,130
Have you tried Nuo Toast before?

536
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,530
Come on, my treat.

537
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,000
Look.

538
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,770
This cake.

539
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,900
Hello, welcome.

540
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,830
See? A master's work is different.

541
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,100
The things they make

542
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,000
have such quality.

543
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,870
This croissant.

544
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,130
It's amazing.

545
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,730
I'll buy more of these later.

546
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,630
This... Jiang Zhihao?

547
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,570
What are you doing here?

548
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,400
Lin Liying.

549
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,000
We're taking photos at a nearby studio.

550
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,460
Aren't you with your boss?

551
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,270
Think about it.

552
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,700
Gao Bohan.

553
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,830
Our unfinished love story...

554
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,230
Can we continue it?

555
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,170
I remember now.

556
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,400
The unfinished love from before.

557
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
Can we continue it again?

558
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,730
So your ex-boyfriend

559
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,660
No, I mean your current boyfriend.

560
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,500
Are you all doing well?

561
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,900
That was just acting.

562
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,530
It's fake.

563
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,670
Fake.

564
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,000
It's not real.

565
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,530
So those touching love stories

566
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,200
are all scripted.

567
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
What's so touching about it?

568
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,570
This is my lifelong best friend, Lin Liying.

569
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,630
Oh, Lin Lin!

570
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,630
Hello.

571
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,470
One of us! That's great.

572
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,770
Could you please recommend

573
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,930
which bread is delicious?

574
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,930
Feel free to try some.

575
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,100
We can sample them?

576
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,800
How nice!

577
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,430
Here, try this.

578
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,570
This one?

579
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,000
It's their signature

580
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
toast.

581
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,470
Is it good?

582
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,030
It's fluffy, soft, and delicious.

583
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,630
The croissant seems good too.

584
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,630
Yes, I love it too.

585
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,930
This is amazing!

586
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,930
Look at this one.

587
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,170
It's extraordinary!

588
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,900
Mrs. Zhu,

589
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,430
did you really not study painting before?

590
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,200
With this talent, not becoming an artist

591
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,900
is such a waste!

592
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,830
Thank you. I'm so happy!

593
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,030
There are many more next door.

594
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,930
Come over.

595
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,070
This is incredible!

596
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,370
Look at this one. It's eye-opening!

597
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,600
It's like it has some magic power.

598
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
I can't take my eyes off it.

599
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,970
Mrs. Zhu,

600
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,900
you're too kind!

601
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,900
Finally, a smaller one!

602
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,300
This size would fit perfectly in my home.

603
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,100
I'll take this one.

604
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,230
Don't any of you try to fight me for it.

605
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,900
No problem.

606
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,070
Thank you.

607
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,230
I really like this material combination.

608
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,270
Zhilu,

609
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,870
what do you think of this one?

610
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,130
I'd like to hear

611
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,860
a young person's perspective.

612
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,630
This painting

613
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,000
uses the golden ratio for composition.

614
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,430
The visual impact is powerful.

615
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,900
As for the use of colors,

616
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,470
it's both avant-garde and bold.

617
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,830
You could say it's bold yet delicate,

618
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,330
rugged yet gentle.

619
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,200
You're so articulate!

620
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,230
Isn't my son's girlfriend impressive?

621
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,300
She's very knowledgeable,

622
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,030
so her perspective is unique.

623
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,100
Look at her style,

624
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,770
wearing an earring on just one side.

625
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,570
That's young people's artistic expression!

626
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,000
Yes,

627
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,230
I see.

628
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,830
May I ask what industry you work in?

629
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,170
She knows a lot about wine.

630
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,730
You can ask her about any wine questions.

631
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,200
Guess what she does?

632
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, so you're in the wine business!

633
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
We often host parties at our home

634
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,130
and need to buy wine.

635
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,470
If I buy wine from you in the future,

636
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,830
could I get a discount?

637
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,700
Is there any discount?

638
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,600
It's up to you.

639
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,370
Can I have your business cards?

640
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,530
How could I forget to bring my cards?

641
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,630
Today... why don't you contact me instead?

642
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,970
I'm her agent now.

643
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,470
Great, then we'll contact you.

644
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,200
No problem.

645
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,530
Thank you for your help.

646
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,970
Mom, I don't know what to do.

647
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,130
Have you ever experienced this?

648
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,300
It's like...

649
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,830
You really, really want to tell him.

650
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,600
But...

651
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,770
But doing so would only add to his pressure.

652
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,630
And then...

653
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,370
And cause him more troubles.

654
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,230
So...

655
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,830
You want to speak but can't.

656
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,870
Mom, haven't you ever felt this way?

657
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,500
Life is so hard.

658
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,870
Whose life isn't hard?

659
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,330
Time's up.

660
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,469
Got it.

661
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,800
Everyone, I'm heading home.

662
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,100
My wife will scold me otherwise.

663
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
OK.

664
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,600
Alright, car.

665
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,969
Sir!

666
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,770
You need to watch your car.

667
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,370
Do you know how to play chess?

668
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,070
This character isn't pronounced 'che'.

669
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,170
It's 'ju'.

670
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,200
Fine, then watch your car.

671
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
You're about to get a ticket.

672
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,100
My motorcycle!

673
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,370
Officer, wait...

674
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,400
This is the place.

675
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,800
Come on.

676
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,630
I really need to thank you today.

677
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,890
Otherwise my allowance for this month would be gone again.

678
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Let me treat you to a cup of black tea.

679
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,170
The black tea at our place is especially delicious.

680
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,270
So this breakfast shop belongs to your family.

681
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,970
Yes.

682
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,600
I've been here before.

683
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,500
Really?

684
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,760
I haven't seen you before.

685
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,970
I don't live nearby.

686
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,530
I heard this place has great reviews.

687
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,330
So I came specially to try it out.

688
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,570
You really know good food.

689
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,600
My son

690
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,270
has a natural talent for cooking.

691
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,770
The breakfast he makes

692
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,930
is really unique.

693
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,270
Your son isn't in the shop today?

694
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,500
He's busy today.

695
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,930
He's been working on something lately,

696
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,030
called... World Breakfast or something.

697
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,430
Anyway, it's some kind of filming job.

698
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,630
I don't really understand it.

699
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,000
It's one of those cooking shows that many people like to watch.

700
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,800
Please, have a seat anywhere.

701
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,830
I'll go get the chess set.

702
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,700
Okay.

703
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,900
You must be very proud of him.

704
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,770
This son of mine,

705
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,230
he's really something special.

706
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,170
I don't have much ability myself.

707
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,630
I can't help him much.

708
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,870
The fact that he's made it this far

709
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,470
is all due to his own efforts.

710
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,930
Wasn't there a different photo here before?

711
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,300
Maybe.

712
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,670
My son was worried

713
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,970
it would get stained with cooking smoke,

714
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,400
so he put it away.

715
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,530
That photo must be very important.

716
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,870
I remember,

717
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,470
I think it was a family portrait.

718
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,630
It's possible.

719
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,500
When we took this photo,

720
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,300
everyone was so happy together.

721
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,770
Now both mothers

722
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,870
are gone.

723
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,800
They're both gone.

724
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,030
This son

725
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,560
isn't my biological child.

726
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,070
He's my wife's

727
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,530
best friend's child.

728
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,930
She got sick when she was young

729
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,430
and passed away.

730
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,330
The child was very young,

731
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,800
so we took him in

732
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,200
and raised him as our own.

733
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,330
Unexpectedly, not long ago,

734
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,730
my wife also passed away.

735
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,270
Playing chess?

736
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,530
I'm back.

737
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,230
Hong Kong airport has changed a lot.

738
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,030
Many shops have closed down.

739
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,730
But I still found a tie

740
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,700
perfect for the future CEO.

741
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,570
What?

742
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,300
Still angry?

743
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,700
I asked Zhilu to go to the art exhibition

744
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,970
to get closer to her.

745
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,170
You can't live without her,

746
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,500
so as your mother, I have to compromise.

747
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,270
Mom, don't treat me like a fool.

748
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,030
I have my own life.

749
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,200
Can you please leave me alone?

750
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,270
When have I ever done anything to hurt you?

751
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,130
I've put up with the Deng family for so many years,

752
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,370
all to give you a better future.

753
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,900
You always say the same thing.

754
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,800
Because this is what you wanted.

755
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,930
Everything I do is for you.

756
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,200
Do you think I went to Hong Kong for fun?

757
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,000
The investor who helped Jason open a restaurant in Hong Kong

758
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,630
is Deng Weikang.

759
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,770
The highly anticipated cooking reality show,

760
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,070
'Breakfast With The World'

761
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,330
Taiwan episode will begin filming soon.

762
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,300
Jiang Zhihao is on this show, right?

763
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,430
It looks like a big production.

764
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,930
No wonder he's been so busy lately.

765
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,100
He really needs to work hard.

766
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,530
Keep going! Hope he can stick with it till the end.

767
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,170
That way, as his neighbors,

768
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,030
we'll all have something to be proud of.

769
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,900
Right, don't you think?

770
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,900
Go for it!

771
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,000
Go for it!

772
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,270
Come help me confirm

773
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,400
if the temp has arrived.

774
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,270
They're waiting for him backstage.

775
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,270
Come on, where's the temp?

776
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,600
Please have the temp get in position.

777
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
They're waiting for him backstage.

778
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,330
What did you

779
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,030
have for breakfast today?

780
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,200
Some people like scallion pancakes with egg.

781
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,100
Some people must have it with a large iced milk tea.

782
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,130
But I want to say

783
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,470
what I eat is

784
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,400
the source of energy for my day.

785
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,030
Breakfast With The World

786
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,530
brings together nine specialty breakfast shops from across Taiwan

787
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,270
to compete and challenge each other here.

788
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,970
Someone will be eliminated in each round.

789
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,530
Who

790
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,970
will ultimately stand on this stage

791
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,870
and become the king of the breakfast world?

792
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,900
Let's wait and see.

793
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,630
As for today's competition item, what will it be?

794
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,870
Nine types of fruit.

795
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,500
Nine competing teams.

796
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,370
Don't get excited.

797
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,400
Don't panic.

798
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,500
What kind of fruit will you choose?

799
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,200
Let's find out together.

800
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,130
Here we go.

801
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,430
Pull harder! You can do it!

802
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,830
Good! It's

803
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,230
an apple.

804
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,530
Rich in pectin.

805
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,970
Congratulations.

806
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,430
Congratulations! Dragon fruit.

807
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,890
Excellent. Very healthy.

808
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,270
Next up is

809
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,230
Jiang Zhihao from San Francisco Beauty Salon.

810
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,730
Such a promising young chef.

811
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,300
Hello. Please draw

812
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,230
and see what fruit you get.

813
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,300
Let's see what fruit you've drawn.

814
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,270
Pomelo.

815
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,870
Pomelo. Fragrant and rich pomelo.

816
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,100
Autumn's gift to you.

817
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,600
Congratulations.

818
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,270
Alright.

819
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,230
Have all the contestants drawn

820
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,800
their desired fruits yet?

821
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,430
There's a message.

822
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,570
Take a quick look.

823
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,870
How is it?

824
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,870
Jiang Zhihao got a pomelo.

825
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,970
Pomelo.

826
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,870
He hates pomelo the most.

827
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,270
That's so unlucky.

828
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,870
It's over.

829
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,300
Alright, let's take a look here.

830
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,830
Chef Deng Weiyu, who was called in as a substitute.

831
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,970
You've got

832
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,030
apple.

833
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,000
That's right. Is it on your dream list?

834
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,730
I eat it regularly.

835
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,370
That's quite humorous.

836
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,800
Regularly.

837
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,500
Are you slicing it thin now?

838
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,800
Yes.

839
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,930
I'm cutting it into slices about 0.1 centimeters thick.

840
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,570
Ladies and gentlemen.

841
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,370
'As thin as cicada wings'

842
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,630
must be referring to this.

843
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,330
Is this really an apple

844
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,130
or pufferfish?

845
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,030
Look, you can see through it.

846
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,830
Can you see that?

847
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,000
Translucent.

848
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,630
Just the apple alone tastes so good.

849
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,130
I'm really looking forward to your dish.

850
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,270
Do your best, okay?

851
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,930
Seems like someone is still trying

852
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,730
to build a good relationship with his fruit.

853
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,130
Let's go cheer him up.

854
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:25,870
Go.

855
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:13,900
Aiya.

856
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,570
If someone from our group

857
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,800
has to be eliminated,

858
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,370
it might not necessarily be a bad thing.

859
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,170
Jiang Zhihao,

860
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,600
what did you do to my mom yesterday?

861
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,470
Just kiss for ten seconds and you'll get pork belly.

862
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,170
Join in!

863
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,700
Ten.

864
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,530
Nine.

865
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,930
When you like someone,

866
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,700
but keep it to yourself and don't let them know.

867
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,800
It's really painful.

868
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,070
I'm not here today as the chairman.

869
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:31,900
Zhihao,

870
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,730
it's time to think about the future.

871
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,370
Jiang Zhihao is your brother.

872
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,700
Your brother is excellent.

873
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,670
Ladies and gentlemen.

874
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,430
Tonight's eliminated contestant is...

875
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,730
San Francisco Beauty Salon.
