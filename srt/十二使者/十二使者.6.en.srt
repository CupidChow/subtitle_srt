[panting]

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,890
[sighs]

5
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:36,419
I lost track of it again.

6
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:38,004
[breathes deeply]

7
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:39,422
[sniffing]

8
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:41,648
[gasps] It's definitely nearby.

9
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:43,901
It couldn't have gotten far.

10
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:47,555
Let's split up and search.

11
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,615
- I'll go this way.
- Sure.

12
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,426
Mirr, it's me.

13
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,261
[laughing]

14
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,028
- You startled me.
- Geez, Kangji.

15
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:12,865
[groans]

16
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,618
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

17
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:21,081
- It escaped us, didn't it?
- I wouldn't be here if it didn't.

18
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:23,584
I bet we scared it off.

19
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:28,964
What is it?

20
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:31,133
Isn't it weird?

21
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,594
- What do you mean?
- The evil spirits.

22
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:36,331
They used to come out only at night,

23
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:38,890
but now they show up at any hour.

24
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,086
There's more of them too.

25
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,962
Don't worry too much.

26
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,938
Let's come back with the others tomorrow.

27
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:47,566
Sure.

28
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,178
Will you stay seated there?

29
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,806
Let's go. We should go back
and join the others.

30
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,407
Sure. Go ahead without me.

31
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,868
On my own?

32
00:02:58,335 --> 00:02:59,536
Why? What about you?

33
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,878
Mirr, don't tell me…

34
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:10,464
Are you still seeing him?

35
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:14,494
[sighs] We told you to end it.
Until when--

36
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:16,996
This is my business. I'll handle it.

37
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,306
This isn't something you can handle alone.

38
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:23,226
What will you tell the others
and what if Taesan and Marok find out?

39
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,606
Mirr.

40
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:29,858
Be wise about this.

41
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,804
If you violate the rules
and keep seeing him,

42
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:36,198
Ogwi might have to pay a big price.

43
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,617
You and Ogwi.

44
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,287
I wish you'd choose
what's best for each other.

45
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:48,335
This will be the last time
I turn a blind eye.

46
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,510
[sighs]

47
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:02,917
Mirr.

48
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,978
Don't forget this. Ogwi isn't like us.

49
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,896
He's human,

50
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,858
and we were created to protect humans.

51
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:35,009

[Taesan] <i>If it gets dangerous,</i>

53
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:51,216
just run. I'll handle them.

54
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,525
[chuckles] Hey,

55
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,695
are you belittling me
or looking out for me?

56
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:00,741
You know full well I'm the only one
whose powers aren't sealed.

57
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,534
[chuckles]

58
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,788
I've got this.

00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:18,743
[grunts]

60
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,385
You puny brat.

61
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,598
Way to go.

62
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,936

- Goodness.

65
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,593
Uh-huh.

[breathes heavily]

71
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:30,932
Samin, did you take my soul stone?

72
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:39,774
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

73
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,345
[chuckles]

74
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:44,362
I have a choice to make.

75
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,324
One that brings me pleasure.

76
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,953
Who should I kill first?

77
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:56,374
[groans]

78
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:06,218

82
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:47,277
Mirr.

83
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,029
Mirr, wake up.

84
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:50,905
Mirr?

85
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,615
Mirr!

87
00:09:58,213 --> 00:09:59,273
Ogwi, you.

[breathing heavily]

89
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,293
Your memories are back. [chuckles]

[groans]

91
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,049
How does it feel

92
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,703
to be fully conscious yet unable to move?

93
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,220
[chuckling]

94
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,974
Though I was trapped
for thousands of years,

95
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:20,977
I could never get used to it.

96
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,067

00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:17,143
[groaning, wheezing]

98
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,369
Why did you have me sealed back then?

99

[wheezing, chuckling]

100
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:24,040
That wasn't what I planned.

101
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,527
It was God's will.

102
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,794
I see.

103
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,575
The same God
who has ignored me my whole life?

104
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,910
[chuckles]

105
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,969
How about I forsake you the same way?

106
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:40,974
Like the time I lost
in thousands of years of captivity

107
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,601
and the memories that were erased,

108
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:46,214
you will face death.

109
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,814

MAROK
INCOMING CALL

118
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,598
Chief, Marok's calling.

119
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,313
Hello? Old man!

120
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:34,856
Marok!

Taesan.

124
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,202
[laughs] Well, I…

125
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:50,106
It hurts a lot.

126
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,733
[stammers] Old man, what happened?

127
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:54,083
[Marok] <i>You…</i>

128
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,919
are going to listen to me.

129
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,381
Samin…

130
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,218
seems to have acquired Haetae's powers.

131
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,346
<i>Now,</i>

132
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:10,933
he will control humans as he pleases.

133
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,227
<i>That's why</i>

134
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:15,355
<i>you must</i>

135
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,274
open the Hellmouth, Taesan.

136
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:20,526
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

137
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,488
<i>A world without humans</i>

138
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:25,782
will be Hell…

139
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,993
stripped of any future.

140
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,521
Hold on.

141
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:31,788
<i>Also,</i>

[groans]

143
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:37,043
Ogwi took Mirr away.

<i>You must</i>

<i>find her.</i>

146
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,133
If Samin gets his hands

on the Dragon Soul

148
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:50,098
within Mirr too,

149
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:52,934
you won't be able to handle him

150
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,672
even if you guys get your powers back.

151
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:57,756
Do you hear me?

152
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,425
I got it, old man.

153
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,510
I'll get Mirr back, whatever it takes.

154
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:04,388
I'm on my way, so hang in there.

155
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:05,973

Survive and pay me back.

Chief, Marok's gone…

192

[Taesan] Old man.

[Taesan] Marok.

195
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:34,113
[Wonseung] Marok!

[crying]

197
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:58,554
[Kangji] Marok…

198
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,754
[Kangji] Marok…

00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,056
[crying]

200
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,236
[crying] Marok…

- [sighs]
- [sobs]

202
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:26,225
[Kangji] Marok!

203
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,270
[sobbing]

204
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:38,821
[Malsook sobbing]

205

[Malsook] Marok.

TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

207
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:15,566
[sighs]

208
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:46,555
At last, the world has returned
to how it used to be.

209
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,725
Humans are

210
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:52,812
without a doubt special beings.

211
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:58,192
To honor and cherish their time together,

212
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:02,655
they unite in thought and strength

213
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:05,199
to build stone graves like this

214
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,828
for the deceased.

215
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:11,664
[chuckles]

216
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,166
To protect these humans…

217
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:18,322
God sent you and the other angels

218
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,422
in human form.

219
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:22,299
Eventually,

220
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,844
as God intended, you and the angels

221
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,222
saved the human world.

222
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:32,977
My siblings are dead.

223
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:36,897
Sacrificing our lives to protect humans…

224
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,402
Is that what God really intended?

225
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,701
Protecting humans comes with sacrifices.

226
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,289
It is our destiny to accept such a life.

227
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,043
Taesan.

228
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,424
Do not let your siblings' deaths

229
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,343
cause you to waver. Okay?

230
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:11,056
[sighs]

231
00:24:13,943 --> 00:24:16,187
That is one miserable destiny.

232
00:25:15,337 --> 00:25:17,831
[footsteps approaching]

233
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:27,049

[groaning]

242
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:44,770
Chief!

243
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:54,488
[sighs] What's he thinking,
opening the Hellmouth?

244
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:57,767
It was bound to be shattered
at some point.

245
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,853
[Taesan grunting]

246
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:01,078
Chief…

247
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:23,220
Now,

248
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:25,555
with the Hellmouth shattered,

249
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:29,685
evil will engulf the world.

250
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:31,895
We have one day

251
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:34,773
to find Mirr

252
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:38,151
and kill Samin and Ogwi.

253
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:40,445
After that,

254
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:44,199
we'll reseal the Hellmouth.

255
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:40,970
For reasons still unknown,

256
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:43,264
the sky has started to turn black,

257
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:45,933
darkening the day as though it were night.

258
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:49,687
<i>Strange fine dust continues to fall</i>
<i>from the sky,</i>

259
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,913

263
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:03,591
- [person 4] Who's blocking the street?
- [person 5] Are you serious?

264
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:07,997
Who are those nutjobs?

265
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:09,681
[person 6] Get out of the way.

266
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:15,020

What are you doing?

272
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:38,877
[person 13] Move, will you?

273
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:35,725
So, for dinner…

274
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,229
Hey, your eyes!

275
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:30,196
[pedestrian] What's going on? Run!

Let's go.

281
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:49,288
Chief.

[coughs, gasps]

283
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:24,782
I've hurt him enough.

284
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,160
Haetae has turned into an evil spirit.

285
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:29,078
He must be eliminated.

286
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:30,747
That is God's will.
