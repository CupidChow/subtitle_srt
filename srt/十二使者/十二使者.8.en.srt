- You're taller even.

00:28:57,794 --> 00:29:00,372
What's with this bush on your head?
You need a haircut.

125
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,544
You haven't changed a bit.

126

Dalgi, we have chicken a lot lately.

127

- No, don't.
- Unbelievable.

128

I told you not to eat chicken.

129
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:15,663
- Sorry about that.
- He always has the most.

130
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,541
Guys, you know I only eat the radish.

131
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:20,335
Radish made you this fat?

132
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,061
- Well said.
- Come on, guys.

133
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,295

This looked delicious.

183
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,484
What's this?

184
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,612
Mmm. It's cotton candy.

185
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,865
Mmm. What a treat.

186
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,269
Did God make this too?

187
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:08,187
No, humans.

188
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:09,454
Really?

189
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:12,775
Can I have more of that money?

190
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,860
Money?

191
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:16,446
Nope, you've got to work for that.

192
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,240
Just so you know, I talked to Chief

193
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,840
so you can do some work.

194
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:25,637
From now on, address me as "sir."

195
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:33,812
What is it?

196
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,064
Just call me "sir," you punk.

197
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:41,554
Okay. Stop it.

198
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,598
Say it. "Sir."

199
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,892
Sure, I got it.

200
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,242
Say, "sir!"

201
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:51,022
Fine, sir. Are you happy now?

202
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,247
There we go.

203
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,359
Let's get something else.
This isn't filling.

204
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:57,111
No, it isn't.

205
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,714
Come on, I found an incredible place.
Their portions are huge.

206
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:04,342
Don't have too much.

207
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,415
- Humans are truly amazing.
- Right?

208
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:12,058
I didn't know their technology
would advance so quickly.

209
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,129
Ask me anything you want to know.

210
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,923
While you were asleep,

211
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:18,341
I kept a record

212
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:22,193
of every event and historical moment
on this device.

213
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,154
On this?

214
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:28,116
Is this a living organism?
How is that possible?

215
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,076
It's not like that.

216
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:34,232
Too much information at once
could give you a migraine,

217
00:34:34,256 --> 00:34:35,582
so let's take it slow.

218
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,585
First, learn how to use this.

219
00:34:40,637 --> 00:34:41,697
What's this?

220
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,131
- That's a cell phone.
- What?

221
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,883
A cell phone.

222
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,469
It's not something you eat.

223
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:49,413
You don't eat it.

224
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:52,974
Humans can't go a single day
without this device.

225
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,545
With this,

226
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:58,563
we can talk to each other
no matter how far apart we are.

227
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:01,524
This can provide everything you need

228
00:35:02,492 --> 00:35:03,678
to make life easier.

229
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,846
What?

230
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,322
It's like this. With this device…

231
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,935
hmm, you can play games,

232
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,160
as well as

233
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:15,731
order food, and buy clothes.

234
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:18,025
Come on. Who are you kidding?

235
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,819
Did you hone your lies while I was away?

236
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:20,903
It's true.

237
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:22,029
As if.

238
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,239
It's true.

239
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:25,283
Hear Wonseung's voice first, then.

240
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:26,576
Is Wonseung in this thing?

241
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,926
Of course.

242
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:32,889
There's audio too.

243
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:37,086
<i>I'm also at the office, you know.</i>

244
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,354
"JWIDOL"

245
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:41,841
Why are you calling me
when I'm right here?

246
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:43,175
I'm busy!

247
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,677
Let me study in peace.

248
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:48,973
"6TH MOCK CSAT"

249
00:35:48,997 --> 00:35:51,950
Why is catching bad guys this complicated?

250
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,186
Hey, what are you up to?

251
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,272
I'm studying to be a detective.

252
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:58,373
What? That came out of nowhere.

253
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,000
What's gotten into you?

254
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:05,255
Being the chief was never meant for me.

255
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:08,659
I'm going to succeed Marok instead.

256
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:11,636
Good thinking.
It's never easy to lead a team.

257
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,457
I'm rooting for you.

258
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:15,682
Good luck.

259
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,573
Dalgi, how's this?

260
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:33,476
Yangmi,

261
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,686
what do you think this is?
Do people wear this?

262
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,271
I don't think so.

263
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,273
- Really?
- That's a purse.

264
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,108
Oh, a purse!

265
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,902
Kangji, isn't this a purse?

266
00:36:42,926 --> 00:36:44,294
It's not.

267
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,255
There's more to choose from,
so look around.

268
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,090
It's something you wear?

269
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:53,955
What do you think of this?
Isn't it a pretty color?

270
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,165
It is. It looks good on you.

271
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:57,557
- Really?
- Let me try.

272
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,311
Let me see.
This'll be comfortable to fight in.

273
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:11,863
I'm exhausted.

274
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:28,046
Mmm. Finally, I feel awake.

275
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:30,840
Ah.

276
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,388
Hey, there. It's nice to meet you.

277
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,357
Welcome.

278
00:37:47,824 --> 00:37:49,510
How can I help you?

279
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,178
Help me with everything, please.

280
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,403
Got it.

281
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:54,432
This has just been released.

282
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:57,992
"Add this week's baseball schedule
to my calendar."

283
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:02,817
"ADD THIS WEEK'S BASEBALL SCHEDULE
TO MY CALENDAR"

284
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,652
That's good. I'll take 12.

285
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:09,071
- Did you say 12?
- Yes, there are 12 of us.

286
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:10,781
I'll be at your service.

287
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:13,951
Here are the 12 phones you ordered.

288
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,969
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

289
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:23,142
Just a second.

290
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:26,187
Hanu.

291
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:36,411
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

292
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,575
- Oh.

293
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,704
- Hmm?

294
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,187
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

295
00:38:48,218 --> 00:38:49,919
Guys, I bet you're hungry.

296
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:56,160
Because many people
see museums as intimidating,

297
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:59,371
I wanted to make the experience
less daunting and more accessible.

298
00:38:59,395 --> 00:39:02,625
Hmm. That's a fun idea,

299
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:04,767
and I admire how you're thinking

300
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:07,020
about the public.

301
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,924
Please forward me the project proposal,

302
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,425
and I'll plan a design.

303
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,817
- Really?
- Yes.

304
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,111
I have another meeting scheduled,

305
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,307
so I'll share a draft with you
by the end of this week.

306
00:39:18,331 --> 00:39:20,116
- Great. Thank you.
- Sure.

307
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,068
Please get back to me.

308
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:30,293
Sure.

309
00:39:57,203 --> 00:39:59,521
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

310
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:03,477
Unbelievable.
You're dragging your feet again.

311
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,827
Didn't you read the text?

312
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:11,250
- Let's go.
- Sure.

313
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:15,463
Bangwool!

314
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:17,632
Did she just…

315
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,634
She talked.

316
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:29,170
All right. Here's to Geumsoon and Manbok
opening their new street food restaurant.

317
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:30,379
A round of applause.

318
00:40:30,403 --> 00:40:32,756
"STELLA TTEOKBOKKI"

319
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:36,051
- Bon appétit!
- Bon appétit!

320
00:40:36,075 --> 00:40:37,136
That looks so good.

321
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,180
- Yangmi, enjoy.
- Show me how to eat this.

322
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,599
- Dalgi, you too.
- Well, just dig in, Hanu.

323
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:44,768
- Try dipping that in the sauce.
- In that?

324
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:45,853
Isn't it good?

325
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,412
- It's good.
- There you go.

326
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,872
Oh, boy.

327
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,360
- You'll enjoy the combo.
- Mmm!

328
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,570
It's so good.

329
00:40:54,594 --> 00:40:55,795
Try that.

330
00:40:58,264 --> 00:40:59,841
Look at you eat.

331
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:02,786
Doni's combo recommendations
never disappoint.

332
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,372
- Dig in before it gets cold.
- It's so nicely chewy!

333
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,375
- It's better when hot.
- Geumsoon, it's delicious!

334
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,835
Dalgi, this is chicken.

335
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:11,060
You shouldn't eat this.

336
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,341
- Try that.
- The fritters are incredible.

337
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:17,134
Geumsoon, can we get more fritters?

338
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:19,637
Mr. Taesan, not you too.

339
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:20,804
I'll get them.

340
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:23,933
- It's so good.
- You should dip this in that.

341
00:41:23,957 --> 00:41:25,059
- Really?
- Yes.

342
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,352
- Is it good?
- It's good.

343
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:28,771
- Siwan's here.
- We're here.

344
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:30,663
- Hi.
- Hello.

345
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:32,206
Hi!

346
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:35,042
You sweetie-pie.

347
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:36,904
He's adorable.

348
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,963
Mister, would you like
to hold my grandson?

349
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:41,048
Should I?

350
00:41:42,892 --> 00:41:44,203
But he's tiny.

351
00:41:44,227 --> 00:41:45,636
He's being shy.

352
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:47,346
Goodness.

353
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:50,641
Hey, there.

354
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,254
Aren't you a sweetie-pie?

355
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,047
He looks just like you, Geumsoon.

356
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:57,940
- Look, he's smiling.
- There you go.

357
00:44:42,156 --> 00:44:45,380
THANK YOU NA INWOO AND BAE YURAM
FOR MAKING A SPECIAL APPEARANCE

358
00:46:09,419 --> 00:46:12,452
