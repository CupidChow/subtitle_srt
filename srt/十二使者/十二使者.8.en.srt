<i>the God of Light awakened 12 animals</i>
<i>to grant them a calling.</i>

4

<i>The 12 angels, endowed with that power,</i>

15

<i>Darkness, wary of the angels' powers,</i>

19
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,714
<i>unleashed evil energy</i>

<i>across the world through its followers.</i>

21
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>The light faded,</i>

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,929

<i>Black dust seeped into people's bodies,</i>

00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,852
<i>turning them into evil spirits.</i>

25
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,783
<i>The angels ultimately chose</i>

<i>transforming him into an evil spirit</i>

37
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,590
<i>and used his powers</i>

38
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,009
<i>to attack the angels.</i>

39
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,305

<i>Then the evil energy</i>

44

<i>After long years,</i>

45
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,512
<i>Samin, once believed dead,</i>
<i>appeared before the 12 angels</i>

You're slimmer.

- You're taller even.

Get over here.

all his throwing stars.

00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,970
What's with this bush on your head?
You need a haircut.

123
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,142
You haven't changed a bit.

124

Dalgi, we have chicken a lot lately.

125

- No, don't.
- Unbelievable.

126
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,316
I told you not to eat chicken.

127
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,402
- Sorry about that.
- He always has the most.

128
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,280
Guys, you know I only eat the radish.

129
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,073
Radish made you this fat?

130
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,659
- Well said.
- Come on, guys.

00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,210
Mmm. It's cotton candy.

183
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,463
Mmm. What a treat.

184
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,007
Did God make this too?

185
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,926
No, humans.

186
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,052
Really?

187
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,514
Can I have more of that money?

188
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,598
Money?

189
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,184
Nope, you've got to work for that.

190
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,979
Just so you know, I talked to Chief

191
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,438
so you can do some work.

192
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:30,235
From now on, address me as "sir."

193
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,410
What is it?

194
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,662
Just call me "sir," you punk.

195
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,293
Okay. Stop it.

196
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,336
Say it. "Sir."

197
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,630
Sure, I got it.

198
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:51,840
Say, "sir!"

199
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,760
Fine, sir. Are you happy now?

200
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,845
There we go.

201
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,098
Let's get something else.
This isn't filling.

202
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,850
No, it isn't.

203
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,312
Come on, I found an incredible place.
Their portions are huge.

204
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:08,940
Don't have too much.

205
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,154
- Humans are truly amazing.
- Right?

206
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,656
I didn't know their technology
would advance so quickly.

207
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,868
Ask me anything you want to know.

208
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,661
While you were asleep,

209
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,079
I kept a record

210
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:26,791
of every event and historical moment
on this device.

211
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,752
On this?

212
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,714
Is this a living organism?
How is that possible?

213
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,674
It's not like that.

214
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,970
Too much information at once
could give you a migraine,

215
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,180
so let's take it slow.

216
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,183
First, learn how to use this.

217
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,436
What's this?

218
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,729
- That's a cell phone.
- What?

219
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,481
A cell phone.

220
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,067
It's not something you eat.

221
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,152
You don't eat it.

222
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,572
Humans can't go a single day
without this device.

223
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,283
With this,

224
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,161
we can talk to each other
no matter how far apart we are.

225
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,122
This can provide everything you need

226
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,416
to make life easier.

227
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,584
What?

228
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,920
It's like this. With this device…

229
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,674
hmm, you can play games,

230
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,758
as well as

231
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,470
order food, and buy clothes.

232
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,764
Come on. Who are you kidding?

233
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,557
Did you hone your lies while I was away?

234
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,642
It's true.

235
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,768
As if.

236
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,977
It's true.

237
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,021
Hear Wonseung's voice first, then.

238
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,314
Is Wonseung in this thing?

239
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,524
Of course.

240
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,487
There's audio too.

241
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,825
<i>I'm also at the office, you know.</i>

242
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,076
"JWIDOL"

243
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,579
Why are you calling me
when I'm right here?

244
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,914
I'm busy!

245
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,416
Let me study in peace.

246
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,712
"6TH MOCK CSAT"

247
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,548
Why is catching bad guys this complicated?

248
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,925
Hey, what are you up to?

249
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,010
I'm studying to be a detective.

250
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,971
What? That came out of nowhere.

251
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,598
What's gotten into you?

252
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,853
Being the chief was never meant for me.

253
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,398
I'm going to succeed Marok instead.

254
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,234
Good thinking.
It's never easy to lead a team.

255
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,195
I'm rooting for you.

256
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,280
Good luck.

257
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,171
Dalgi, how's this?

258
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,214
Yangmi,

259
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,425
what do you think this is?
Do people wear this?

260
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,010
I don't think so.

261
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,012
- Really?
- That's a purse.

262
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,847
Oh, a purse!

263
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,640
Kangji, isn't this a purse?

264
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:48,892
It's not.

265
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,853
There's more to choose from,
so look around.

266
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,688
It's something you wear?

267
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,693
What do you think of this?
Isn't it a pretty color?

268
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,904
It is. It looks good on you.

269
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,155
- Really?
- Let me try.

270
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,909
Let me see.
This'll be comfortable to fight in.

271
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,461
I'm exhausted.

272
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,644
Mmm. Finally, I feel awake.

273
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,438
Ah.

274
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,986
Hey, there. It's nice to meet you.

275
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:51,955
Welcome.

276
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,249
How can I help you?

277
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,917
Help me with everything, please.

278
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,001
Got it.

279
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,170
This has just been released.

280
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,590
"Add this week's baseball schedule
to my calendar."

281
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,595
"ADD THIS WEEK'S BASEBALL SCHEDULE
TO MY CALENDAR"

282
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:11,391
That's good. I'll take 12.

283
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,810
- Did you say 12?
- Yes, there are 12 of us.

284
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,520
I'll be at your service.

285
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,690
Here are the 12 phones you ordered.

286
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,567
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

287
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,740
Just a second.

288
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,785
Hanu.

289
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,170
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

290
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,173
Oh.

291
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,302
Hmm?

292
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,973
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

293
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,517
Guys, I bet you're hungry.

294
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:00,899
Because many people
see museums as intimidating,

295
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:04,110
I wanted to make the experience
less daunting and more accessible.

296
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,363
Hmm. That's a fun idea,

297
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,365
and I admire how you're thinking

298
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,618
about the public.

299
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,662
Please forward me the project proposal,

300
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,164
and I'll plan a design.

301
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,415
- Really?
- Yes.

302
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,709
I have another meeting scheduled,

303
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,046
so I'll share a draft with you
by the end of this week.

304
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,714
- Great. Thank you.
- Sure.

305
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,806
Please get back to me.

306
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,891
Sure.

307
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,295
TEAM DINNER
AT GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD OPENING

308
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,216
Unbelievable.
You're dragging your feet again.

309
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,425
Didn't you read the text?

310
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,848
- Let's go.
- Sure.

311
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,061
Bangwool!

312
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,230
Did she just…

313
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,232
She talked.

314
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,908
All right. Here's to Geumsoon and Manbok
opening their new street food restaurant.

315
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,118
A round of applause.

316
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,495
"STELLA TTEOKBOKKI"

317
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,790
- Bon appétit!
- Bon appétit!

318
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,874
That looks so good.

319
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,918
- Yangmi, enjoy.
- Show me how to eat this.

320
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,337
- Dalgi, you too.
- Well, just dig in, Hanu.

321
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,507
- Try dipping that in the sauce.
- In that?

322
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,591
Isn't it good?

323
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,010
- It's good.
- There you go.

324
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,470
Oh, boy.

325
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,099
- You'll enjoy the combo.
- Mmm!

326
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,308
It's so good.

327
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,393
Try that.

328
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,439
Look at you eat.

329
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,525
Doni's combo recommendations
never disappoint.

330
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,111
- Dig in before it gets cold.
- It's so nicely chewy!

331
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,114
- It's better when hot.
- Geumsoon, it's delicious!

332
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,574
Dalgi, this is chicken.

333
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,658
You shouldn't eat this.

334
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,079
- Try that.
- The fritters are incredible.

335
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,873
Geumsoon, can we get more fritters?

336
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,375
Mr. Taesan, not you too.

337
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,543
I'll get them.

338
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,671
- It's so good.
- You should dip this in that.

339
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:29,797
- Really?
- Yes.

340
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,090
- Is it good?
- It's good.

341
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,509
- Siwan's here.
- We're here.

342
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,261
- Hi.
- Hello.

343
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,804
Hi!

344
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,640
You sweetie-pie.

345
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,642
He's adorable.

346
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,561
Mister, would you like
to hold my grandson?

347
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,646
Should I?

348
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,941
But he's tiny.

349
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,234
He's being shy.

350
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,944
Goodness.

351
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,239
Hey, there.

352
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,992
Aren't you a sweetie-pie?

353
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,786
He looks just like you, Geumsoon.

354
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,538
- Look, he's smiling.
- There you go.
