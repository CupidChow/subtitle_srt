<i>Light emerged from pitch darkness,</i>

4
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:22,667
<i>bringing forth the sky,
ocean, land, plants,</i>

5
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:25,587
<i>animals, the sun, moon, and stars</i>

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,630
<i>to fill the wasteland.</i>

7
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:31,426
<i>Lastly, Light sent 12 angels,</i>

8
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:36,055
<i>each with the power of one of 12 animals,
to the land of the living</i>

9
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:39,267
<i>and chose a human to oversee them
in an effort to bring</i>

10
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:42,228
<i>peace and harmony to the world.</i>

11
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:46,900
<i>Humans worshiped Light,
the creator, as their god</i>

12
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:51,279
<i>and quickly helped the world flourish.</i>

13
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:54,073
<i>But as Light's territory grew,</i>

14
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,743
<i>Darkness's territory diminished,</i>

15
00:00:57,827 --> 00:01:00,079
<i>leading Darkness to give rise
to evil spirits</i>

16
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:01,706
<i>and begin consuming the world.</i>

17
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:06,252
<i>The 12 angels who shared
the almighty power of the God of Light</i>

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,714
<i>fought to defend the world</i>

19
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,382
<i>from evil spirits.</i>

20
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:14,344
<i>After noble sacrifices</i>

21
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,513
<i>and relentless battles,</i>

22
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:22,560
<i>the angels
triumphed over the evil spirits.</i>

23
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:26,522
<i>Thus, the angels' absolute power
and the power of evil</i>

24
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,442
<i>were sealed within the Hellmouth,</i>

25
00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:31,319
<i>and the angels now exist</i>

26
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,905

28
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,722
Shouldn't you at least tell me
who's here to see me?

29
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:11,359
Do I know you?

30
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,529
I'm with Angel Capital Group.

31
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,781
Angel?

32
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:21,494
Oh, right. You're the big guy at Angel.
I remember now.

33
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:26,249
Anyway, what brings you here?

34
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:28,751
I've been trying to reach you,

35
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:31,170
so when I found out you were here,
I dropped by.

36
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:36,175
It's bad enough being stuck in here,

37
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,428
but you came all the way here
to collect money?

38
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,347
This must be a joke.

39
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,974
I suggest you leave.

40
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:46,728
Or I'll have my boys blend Angel
or whatnot into a smoothie.

41
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:49,856
You owe us two billion won,
half in principal and half in interest.

42
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,525
After today,
it'll shoot up to 2.2 billion won.

43
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,402
A billion won just in interest?

44
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:56,654
And another 200 million after today?

45
00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:00,700
If you sell your business and your car,

46
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,869
you'll be able to pay it off.

47
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:04,829
Just sign here,

48
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,331
and I'll handle the rest.

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,294
I've never borrowed

50
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:13,504
from a loan shark
creative enough to collect

51
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:16,340
from someone in prison.

52
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:18,968
Now, get that scary piece of paper
out of my face.

53
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,179
Of course, I want to pay you back.

54
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:23,514
But I just can't.

55
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,266
Once I'm out of here,

56
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,226
I'll work my ass off at part-time jobs

57
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,063
and pay you back, interest and all.
How's that?

58
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:33,941
Mr. Jo Yangsu.

59
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:37,070
Let me say this again.

60
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,571
Sure.

61
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:43,034
We at Angel Capital Group
only lend money to thugs, gangsters,

62
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:45,495
and criminals like you.

63
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,371
Why?

64
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:51,375
Collecting from them is actually easier.
No trouble later too.

65
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,128
Here's something to think about.

66
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:55,880
For the last 100 years,

67
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:59,300
I've never failed to collect payment.

68
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,552
A hundred years?

69
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:03,888
Time must've been good to you.

70
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:14,398
What a joke.

71
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,737
- Good luck.
- "Good luck"?

72
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,539
Jwidol, make bail for Jo Yangsu.

73
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:30,623
<i>Got it, Chief.</i>

74
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,208
- I just transferred

75
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,210
his 200 million won bail as ordered.

78
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:57,984
Here at Angel Capital Group,
we share the love.

79
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:02,780
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but we don't offer general loans.

80
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:06,868
Unless you are considered high-risk,
such as having a criminal record

81
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:10,746
or engaging in illegal activity,
we do not conduct business.

82
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:16,252
Are you a gangster or an ex-convict?

83
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:19,255
I see, you're neither.

84
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:22,049
In that case, we can't offer you a loan.

85
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,177
Sure. Please explore other options.

86
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,573
What?

87
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,910
So that's where you were.

88
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:50,912
Okay.

89
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,882
Okay, let's do this.

90
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,759
I guess I'll be stretching my legs.

91
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:07,136
Guys, did you all see the video?

92
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,763
What? Just a second.

93
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,766
Chief said we should strike
while they've got cash on hand.

94
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,392
We should get going.

95
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:16,020
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

96
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:17,480
Time to go collect.

97
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:19,398
What about Doni?

98
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,901
He'll meet us there. We should get moving.

99
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:23,110
Okay.

100
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:46,384
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Taesan.</i>

101
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:48,177
It's me.

102
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,305
I was wondering how you
were doing.

103
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,556
You know how it is.

104
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,935
You're constantly on my mind,
and I care for you deeply.

105
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:57,228
That's news to me.

106
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:59,647
<i>You popped up in my dream last night.</i>

107
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,359
I saw a huge tiger,
and man, was I glad to see it.

108
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,736
I must've missed you a lot.

109
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,281
<i>Hello?</i>

110
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,074
<i>Are you still there?</i>

111
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:15,454
Anyway,
how's your health these days?

112
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,291
Are you still on antidepressants?

113
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:22,712
Taesan, you should take
better care of yourself.

114
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:26,257
Don't hesitate to let me know
if you need anything.

115
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,717
- Do you need money again?
- <i>Come on.</i>

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,927
Yes, I do.

117
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:32,638
<i>I haven't collected this month,
so I'll spot you next month.</i>

118
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:35,266
- I'm busy, so--
- <i>Taesan, wait!</i>

119
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,602
You know how we all
sometimes need quick cash.

120
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,481
You've worked harder than us

121
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,525
and are living a wealthier, cooler life,

122
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:47,278
but not me.

123
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,447
What's so cool about being a loan shark?

124
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:51,949
Anyway, why does a detective need money?

125
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,409
Hey.

126
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:56,037
Even detectives have to spend money
on stuff sometimes too.

127
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,706
If a detective is in shabby clothes,

128
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,626
he gets dogged
by all kinds of lowlife crooks.

129
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,421
That stings more now that I'm older.

130
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:06,797
You'll see.

131
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,883
We're only 100 years apart.

132
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,010
Hey, if we were humans,

133
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,971
a 100-year gap would mean
I'd be dead before you were born.

134
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:17,099
<i>Remember how it was
during the Second Manchu Invasion,</i>

135
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:19,518
when I was surrounded by those barbarians?

136
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:21,020
You do, don't you?

137
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:22,688
I believe I saved your ass.

138
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,273
You sure did,

139
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:26,692
and I was absolutely grateful.

140
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:28,527
I'm still grateful for it to this day.

141
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:32,365
I'm the kind of person
who'd never forget if I owed someone.

142
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,283
That's who we are to each other.

143
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,203
Unbelievable. Hold on a second.

144
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:40,373
<i>Okay. I'll pay you back.
You know you can count on me.</i>

145
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,375
- Ugh.
- <i>Don't "ugh" me.</i>

146
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:45,586
- <i>I just sent you some money…</i>

147
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:47,088
<i>…so don't go splurging this time.</i>

148
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:50,257
There we go. Right, thanks.

149
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:53,135
It's vital to my detective work,
that's all.

150
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:55,429
Of course, I'll never call you again.

151
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:57,390
Sure thing. Right, bye.

152
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:01,811
There's more downstairs, right?

153
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:03,521
- Yes, of course.
- Shall we?

154
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:05,689
Geez.

155
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:14,949
Thanks to this clinic,

156
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:19,870
- I can see the beauty of the world again.

157
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:22,915
Retinal degeneration

158
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,501
left me blind for three years,

159
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:29,922
and every doctor said there was no hope

160
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,549
of recovery.

161
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:40,266
Talking with

162
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:44,728
the handsome, kind, and angelic nurse

163
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,022
persuaded me

164
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:49,358
to get treatment

165
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,694

<i>Hello?</i>

168
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,534
<i>Hey, why aren't you on your way?</i>

169
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:00,327
<i>Since Doni is unavailable,</i>

170
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:02,830
- <i>Doni's AI secretary is responding.</i>
- Good job.

171
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:05,124
<i>Share the message with me,</i>

172
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,375
<i>and I'll pass it along.</i>

173
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,213
Doctor, please don't hurt me!

174
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,215
- Not again.

00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:14,800
Dr. Bangwool!

176
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,343
Doctor, please!

177
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,938
Ma'am, please stay for your treatment.

178
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:32,568
Bangwool, I asked you to go easy.

179
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,778
The patients are all running off!

180
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,032
He's still here, though.

181
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,493
Sir, it's all right.
Please let go of this.

182
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:41,577
It'll be fine.

183
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,871
Oh, dear.

184
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:46,123
Oh, no.

185
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,253
You've got to push past your fear.

186
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:54,340
- Her methods may look rough,

187
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,841
but they definitely work.

188
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:00,513
Hey, Bangwool.

189
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:07,811
You can't just go around snapping necks.
That's dangerous.

190
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,190
From now on, stick to medicinal herbs.

191
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:16,862
No way. My headache's gone.

192
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:23,953
It seems you had a serious case
of cervical disc herniation,

193
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:26,247
but luckily,
you responded well to treatment.

194
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,041
- So that's why my neck was hurting.
- That's right.

195
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:32,253
I've been suffering
from chronic headaches,

196
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:35,631
and no doctor has been able
to help me for years.

197
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,635
Thank you so much. I'm truly grateful.

198
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:41,554
I have to say,

199
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,931
your treatments are rather unorthodox.

200
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:45,849
Yes, our methods

201
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,520
were handed down from ancient times.
Pretty unique, right?

202
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:53,107
We extract therapeutic enzymes
from snake venom

203
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,526
for patient treatment.

204
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,404
Oh, how fascinating.

205
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:00,781
When I saw the ad,
I thought it was a scam--

206
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:01,949
A scam?

207
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:05,619
We've been
promoting our clinic with integrity.

208
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:06,787
Right?

209
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:09,123
Sure.

210
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,166
Your medication is ready. Shall we?

211
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,293
What? I see.

212
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:15,296
- Sure thing. Thank you, Doctor.
- Let's go.

213
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,590
Keep it up, but be gentle.

214
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:20,926
Just a second.

215
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,304
- Are you on any other medication?

216
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:25,889
Here it is.

217
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:27,349
Bangwool, be gentle.

218
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:29,143
Doctor…

219
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,187
Help me!

220
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:34,189
{\an8}That'll be 10,000 won.

221
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:36,734
- Is it really only 10,000 won?
- Yes.

222
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,070
In return, please write a nice review.

223
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:43,157
- Sure.
- Good.

224
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,284
Take one in the morning
and one in the evening.

225
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,244
Also, avoid greasy foods and alcohol,

226
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:49,955
especially pork fat.

227
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,999
In fact, you should cut out pork entirely.

228
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,460
Pigs are actually really cute animals.

229
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:58,005
In fact, many families even keep them
as pets along with dogs, right?

230
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,674
- Oh, sure.
- That'll be 10,000 won.

231
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:03,135
- Are you sure it's 10,000 won?
- Yes.

232
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:04,345
Cash, please.

233
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:07,056
- Here you go.
- Have a good day.

234
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,436
I see you can move now.
Wait, it's still too soon for that.

235
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,521
- Careful.

236
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:18,025
How much is everything?

237
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:21,570
Your total is 12.6 million won.

238
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:24,948
I'll take them all.

239
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,742
Would you like to pay in installments?

240
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:31,664
You see, the word "installments"…

241
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,333
That rubs me the wrong way.

242
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,835
I apologize.

243
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,339
- Of course, you'll pay in full.
- In full.

244
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:44,968
That's a lot of dough.

245
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:47,763
Gee, it's been so long.

246
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:54,812
It's bustling today.

247
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:55,896
Hmm?

248
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,275
To guard humans from evil spirits,

249
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,985
the primordial gods

250
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:05,239
sent down 12 angels
to the land of the living.

251
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:09,993
The angels fought tirelessly,
defeating countless evil spirits

252
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:13,580
who sought to cast darkness over us,

253
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:18,043
and at last sealed
the Hellmouth, the very source of evil.

254
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,129
Legend has it

255
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,214
- that the power within…

256
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,883
…that mask
is what drove away the evil spirits.

257
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:27,845
Ever since then, our ancestors…

258
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:30,431
Let's sit there.

259
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,017
This is some fine weather.

260
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:40,899
Ta-da.

261
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:42,151
These are for you.

262
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:44,903
What are these?

263
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:48,407
- It's my heartfelt gift to you, of course.

264
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,035
You know I'm always looking out for you.

265
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:55,289
I'm fine. I don't need these.

266
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:56,749
You don't need them?

267
00:14:56,832 --> 00:15:02,045
I took the time to pick out the items
that would look amazing on you.

268
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,089
Which you bought with Chief's money.

269
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:06,800
That I did.

270
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:10,554
I did Chief wrong.

271
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:13,891
There's no reason to feel bad.
Taesan's loaded.

272
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,184
Wonseung actually saw it.

273
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:18,187
He wipes with cash
instead of toilet paper.

274
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,813
- Unbelievable.

275
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:25,486
I've told you countless times
not to come to my workplace like this.

276
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,825
When are you coming back home?

277
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,245
Mirr, it's been over 10 years now.

278
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,832
You guys can't be apart like this.

279
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,252
And it's my duty
to keep the family together.

280
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,679
I should get back.

281
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:54,640
I'll be in touch.

282
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:57,851
Mirr, wait!

283
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,355
Take these with you!

284
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,657
What could she have seen in her dream

285
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:14,868
that she's hiding it even from me?

286
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:52,573
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

287
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:54,491
This is nice. It's been so long.

288
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,579
That's the bomb.

289
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:02,082
- Let's sit.

290
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:03,166
Geez.

291
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:05,711
Mmm.

292
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,045
Here.

293
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:10,173
Boss, how did you get out so soon?

294
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:13,260
- Exactly.
- I've been curious about that too.

295
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,597
My guess is that Gwangsu did me a solid.

296
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,265
We'll show our appreciation tomorrow.

297
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:20,225
- Sure, boss.

298
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,352
- Babe, you're getting a call.
- Right.

299
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:23,729
- Who is it?

300
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,147
Crap.

301
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:29,443
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Jo Yangsu,</i>

302
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,903
this is Angel Capital Group.

303
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:32,362
- <i>Angel?</i>
- <i>Angel?</i>

304
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:34,698
<i>You must be the big boss at Angel.</i>

305
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:39,995
I told you I'd work my ass off
and pay you back!

306
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:42,831
Feels good to be out, doesn't it?

307
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,166
Of course, it's nice.

308
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:50,339
Hold on a second.

309
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:53,258
Did you bail me out
so you could collect from me?

310
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,802
<i>You're a complete nutjob.</i>

311
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,806
I'm on my way, so I'll see you in a bit.

312
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,808
- Sure, drop by…

313
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:04,478
- Did he just hang up on me?
- What was that?

314
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,025
- You know Angel's boss, right?
- Sure.

315
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:11,610
- The burly one.
- Yes, boss.

316
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:14,613
- He's on his way, so kill on sight.
- Got it, boss.

317
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:17,199
Sora, get coffee with the girls.

318
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,618
I'll give you a call
after I take care of something.

319
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:20,827
Something must be up.

320
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,789
- I'm only saying this because I care,

321
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,750
- but I want to watch you fight.

322
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,502
Sora, we're not ordinary people.

323
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:31,964
Over there. Look at his cauliflower ears.
He's a former MMA fighter.

324
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:34,091
This one's a boxing champion.

325
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:35,842
I don't want you to see us

326
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:38,553
knocking people out
with blood flying everywhere.

327
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:40,597
I only want you to see nice things.

328
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,265
- I'll call you soon, okay?
- Mmm.

329
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:44,142
I'll be worried, but I hope it goes well.

330
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:45,936
- Sure.
- Call me.

331
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,437
- Get moving!
- Yes, boss!

332
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,773
- Stay behind them. I love you.
- Move!

333
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:52,067
- Grab your things. We'll go to Itaewon.
- No boys!

334
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,402
Let's move out.

335
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:55,612

336
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,698
<i>…and have called on the public</i>

337
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:00,409
- <i>…to cooperate and practice safe driving.</i>

00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,202
- What is it?
- <i>Chief.</i>

339
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,913
Jo Yangsu's boys will be crawling outside.

340
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:07,124
- Okay, thank you.
- <i>Drivers heading downtown,</i>

Shit.

Hey.

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,560
Geez.

Should I bag them all? Sure.

357
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:44,341
- The watch, too.
- Got it.

358
00:22:48,887 --> 00:22:53,433
You just need to sign this document.

359
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:54,517
Right.

360
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,526
- That's settled.

361
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:08,406
Since this doesn't cover the whole loan,

362
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:10,784
I'll throw in the car keys.

363
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:13,370
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

364
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,415
Jwidol, this is the place.

365
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,501
- We're here.
- Okay.

366
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,006
- See you later.
- Sure.

367
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,592
- Be safe.
- Got it.

368
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:56,955
- Hmm? Hold it. Hide.
- What? Why?

369
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:01,126
- Malsook, over here.
- Come here!

370
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:08,008
Hey, they're leaving.

371
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,801
I'll fly solo on this one.

372
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,511
- Don't get cheeky.

373
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,221
Gangsters run this place.

374
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:17,684
And they probably beefed up security
since they knew we'd be collecting today.

375
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,436
Seriously. Who do you take me for?

376
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,770
Go wait in the car.

377
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,828
Were you seriously dozing off just now?

378
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,121
See how it's packed today?

379
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:39,914
- Yes, boss.
- I told you this would work.

380
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:42,167
We've hit the jackpot.

381
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,961
- Finish the job solid today

382
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:47,088
- and make sure the drops go right.
- Yes, boss.

383
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:50,550
The Angel Capital Group people
will show up to collect, so stay sharp.

384
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:51,676
Yes, boss.

385
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,845
You know Seongmuk,
of the Vipers gang, right?

386
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:57,432
He skipped out to the Philippines
without paying Angel,

387
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:59,267
- and those punks…
- I knew it.

388
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,102
…tailed him there to collect.

389
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:02,937
They're straight-up evil. Like Satan.

390
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,022
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

391
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:07,025
You especially don't want
to take on their boss.

392
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,194
You can't win in a straight fight,

393
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:13,281
so arm up with bats and ashtrays,

394
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:15,158
jump him hard, and beat him to a pulp.

395
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,242
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

396
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:17,911
- Found the client.
- Get back to work.

397
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:18,995
I'll tail him.

398
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:51,569
- What the heck?

399
00:25:52,445 --> 00:25:53,446
What's going on?

400
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:56,199
- What?

401
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,625
I said I'd handle it.

402
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:06,918
And watch you take all day?

403
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:09,421
No can do. Let's go.

404
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,340
Why did I even bother
climbing up that way?

405
00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:17,011
- Come on.

406
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:19,013
Fine, let's go.

407
00:26:19,097 --> 00:26:20,306
<i>Area cleared.</i>

408
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,392
There are more upstairs, so be careful.

409
00:26:22,475 --> 00:26:23,768
The operator is deep inside.

410
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:27,313
- Are you kidding me?
- Double it.

411
00:26:27,397 --> 00:26:28,481
Hey!

412
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:30,650
You're hustling me, aren't you?

413
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:32,819
Bring me my money.

414
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,904
I want my money!

415
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:36,781
Bring me my money now!

416
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:39,325
No, let go of me!

417
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,328
I want my money. My money!

418
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:46,916
- Get lost.
- Let go!

419
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,168
Keep it down.

420
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:49,294
Let go of me!

421
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:52,672
- Keep it down.
- Let go of me!

422
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:55,925
- Let go!
- Just keep playing.

423
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,307
Looking nice.

424
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:06,561
Hey, get them.

425
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:07,687
Get them.

426
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:10,315
- What's going on?

427
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,358
This time around,

428
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:14,861
I'll handle this myself, so hang back.

429
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:18,406
What the heck?

430
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,783
- Block them, will you?

431
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,540
- What's going on?

432
00:27:27,624 --> 00:27:30,710
Would it kill Malsook
to be patient once in a while?

433
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:36,508
Run!

434
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:54,567
Damn it!

435
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:09,999
Crap.

436
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:16,172
- Hold on. Calm down, will you?

437
00:28:33,731 --> 00:28:35,608
- Get the rest, okay?
- Got it.

438
00:28:40,238 --> 00:28:41,322
Come on!

439
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:44,117
Looking good, guys.

440
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:46,327
One's getting away down the stairs.

441
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,413
He's leaving the building. Malsook?

442
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,629
- Where is he?
- <i>Down the stairs, at your 3 o'clock.</i>

443
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:57,880
He's dead meat.

444
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,251
Where did this hog come from?

445
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:37,170
Oink, oink.

446
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:39,714
What? You damn pig…

447
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,096
- Move!

448
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,642
How dare you run away?

449
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:55,188
Why are you here?

450
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:58,399
Well, I figured he had no other way to go.

451
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,693
You kicked him too hard, Malsook.

452
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:02,862
He might be concussed.

453
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:08,910
- All clear.
- <i>Okay.</i>

454
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:09,994
Did she get him?

455
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:12,455
- <i>She did.</i>
- Breathe.

456
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:13,998
<i>Don't tell me he's dead.</i>

457
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,377
Did he dislocate his jaw?

458
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,628
<i>And the bag?</i>

459
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:21,172
- We got the guy and secured the bag.

460
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:22,507
Okay, let's move out.

461
00:30:48,231 --> 00:30:49,649
I threw in some extra fritters.

462
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:51,442
- Thank you.
- Bye.

463
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:55,697
GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD

464
00:30:58,116 --> 00:31:00,952
- To-go, please.
- Sure. What can I get you?

465
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:02,036
Mister!

466
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:06,791
- Mister, it's you.

467
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,710
Mister, it's you!

468
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:14,340
Why didn't you come by recently?
I've missed you.

469
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,302
I've been busy. How's business going?

470
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:18,636
You know how it is.

471
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,097
During the day,
there's always a long line.

472
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,266
Everyone loves it.

473
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,059
Thanks for coming by, mister.

474
00:31:25,143 --> 00:31:27,437
Gee, no need to thank me.

475
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,148
You're the only human I talk to, Geumsoon.

476
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:36,237
You don't look so good.

477
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:40,533
Think about your health on the job
and try to drink less.

478
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:43,203
And hit the gym.

479
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:47,248
I've worked out for over 5,000 years,
and now I'm sick of it.

480
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,919
I've lived for too long.

481
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:54,756
Don't say that. You need
to stick around for centuries more

482
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,217
and keep protecting the innocent.

483
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,011
You're an angel, after all.

484
00:32:00,094 --> 00:32:02,013
Although it's a secret only I know.

485
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:04,140
- Someone might hear you.
- Whatever.

486
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:10,313
I quit protecting humans long ago.

487
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:11,397
You know that.

488
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,024
Remember how thugs came around

489
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:16,903
when I was in middle school,
attacking us and wrecking homes

490
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:19,572
to scare off my mom and the neighbors?

491
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:20,949
Of course.

492
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:22,909
Your mom sold tteokbokki too.

493
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:24,202
That's right.

494
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:27,747
You taught those punks a real lesson.

495
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,998
Swoosh and thud!

496
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:35,922
You saved me and my mom too.

497
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:40,510
That's how I was able
to keep the family business going,

498
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:42,595
and I couldn't be happier.

499
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:47,058
Even for an angel,

500
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:50,520
it must've been tough
to protect humans for so long.

501
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:54,774
You had to make sacrifices,
including losing your family.

502
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:58,403
You must be worn out,
no thanks to selfish human beings.

503
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:03,533
But did you know, mister,

504
00:33:04,158 --> 00:33:07,161
that people carry gratitude

505
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:10,832
deep in their hearts?

506
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,334
Like I do.

507
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:15,670
We humans aren't all bad.

508
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:21,217
Plus, this world isn't constantly
threatened by evil spirits anymore.

509
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:23,886
It's about time
you found your happiness too.

510
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,054
Be happy.

511
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:30,727
Geumsoon, you.

512
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,230
- You're all grown up now, huh?
- Hmm.

513
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:35,440
Hold on a second, mister.

514
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:39,319
Let me pack some tasty food for you, dear.

515
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,622
I won't take that.

516
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:54,375
Can't you accept it just this once,
Geumsoon?

517
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:57,628
Ever since you were young,
you were always so stubborn.

518
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,757
- Unbelievable.
- You brat!

519
00:34:01,382 --> 00:34:03,676
I've had my eye on you for a while now.

520
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,806
How dare you talk to your senior
like she's your equal?

521
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,184
- You obviously have no manners.

522
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:14,937
That's because I've known her
since she was a kid.

523
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,105
- Outrageous!

524
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,985
You little menace!

525
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:22,653
Sir, you appear to be drunk.

526
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:27,367
Wait, aren't you Manbok?

527
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,618
What?

528
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:30,703
You brat!

529
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:34,499
I'm right. You're Manbok,
the stationery store owner's son.

530
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:38,628
You were always sent out for salt
for wetting your bed.

531
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:39,962
What…

532
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:42,840
Are you Mr. Taesan?

533
00:34:42,924 --> 00:34:44,342
Yes, it's Mr. Taesan.

534
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:47,095
That's right, I'm Taesan.

535
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:51,182
It really is you!

536
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:53,684
How do you still look so young?

537
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:55,561
Manbok, it's really you!

538
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:57,188
- Goodness.
- Manbok!

539
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:02,068
You brat, it's been so long.

540
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,237
- Have you been alive and well?
- Yes!

541
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,115
How come you haven't aged at all?

542
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:09,158
<i>A significant number of relics</i>

543
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:11,160
<i>believed to date back
to the Paleolithic Era</i>

544
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:14,247
<i>were recently found

545
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,040
<i>in Songwon-gu, Seoul.</i>

546
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,668
<i>Here's Reporter Heo with the report.</i>

547
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:23,047
{\an8} <i>Beginning with earthenware</i>
<i>thought to be from the Paleolithic Era,</i>

548
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:26,717
{\an8}<i>various ancient relics are being uncovered
layer by layer.</i>

549
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:29,846
<i>Minerals
with intricate shapes and particles,</i>

550
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:33,683
<i>whose era of origin is hard to identify,</i>

551
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:37,103
<i>have attracted academic interest

552
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:38,646
{\an8}RELICS BEING TRANSPORTED TO NRIC

553
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:40,773
{\an8}<i>The excavated relics will be examined</i>

554
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:43,776
<i>at NRIC until the 25th…</i>

555
00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:55,121
What's this?

556
00:35:55,872 --> 00:35:57,623
- Something's not right.
- What?

557
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,042
- Show me.
- What's wrong?

558
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:03,045
Nothing is registering on this spectrum.

559
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:04,630
What's going on?

560
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:06,841
- What's that?
- What am I seeing?

561
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,718
The numbers are showing abnormal spikes.

562
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:09,028
We've found Ogwi.

563
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,084
Let's see.

564
00:38:07,295 --> 00:38:08,296
Hey.

565
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:10,756
Huh?

566
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:14,885
Kids, I got us some tteokbokki.

567
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:18,472
Kangji?

568
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,517
Malsook? Wonseung?

569
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:26,772
Doni, I even grabbed some sundae,
your favorite.

570
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:29,567
Are they not back yet?

571
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,528
They should have this while it's hot.

572
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:12,401
{\an8}BENEFIT THE WORLD OF HUMANS

573
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:41,097
There.

574
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,084
Are you all right?

575
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,920
Attempting this ritual under such strain
could be deadly.

576
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:23,133
There's

577
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:26,262
no more time to lose.
