1
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,835
<i>Light emerged from pitch darkness,</i>

2
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,879
<i>bringing forth the sky,</i>
<i>ocean, land, plants,</i>

3
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,799
<i>animals, the sun, moon, and stars</i>

4
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,843
<i>to fill the wasteland.</i>

5
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,638
<i>Lastly, Light sent 12 angels,</i>

6
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:41,268
<i>each with the power of one of 12 animals,</i>
<i>to the land of the living</i>

7
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,479
<i>and chose a human to oversee them</i>
<i>in an effort to bring</i>

8
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>peace and harmony to the world.</i>

9
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>Humans worshiped Light,</i>
<i>the creator, as their god</i>

10
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,491
<i>and quickly helped the world flourish.</i>

11
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,286
<i>But as Light's territory grew,</i>

12
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,955
<i>Darkness's territory diminished,</i>

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,292
<i>leading Darkness to give rise</i>
<i>to evil spirits</i>

14
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,918
<i>and begin consuming the world.</i>

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,465
<i>The 12 angels who shared</i>
<i>the almighty power of the God of Light</i>

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,926
<i>fought to defend the world</i>

17
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,595
<i>from evil spirits.</i>

18
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>After noble sacrifices</i>

19
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,726
<i>and relentless battles,</i>

20
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,773
<i>the angels</i>
<i>triumphed over the evil spirits.</i>

21
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,735
<i>Thus, the angels' absolute power</i>
<i>and the power of evil</i>

22
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,655
<i>were sealed within the Hellmouth,</i>

23
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,531
<i>and the angels now exist</i>

24
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,117
<i>among humans in human form.</i>

25
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:49,294
TWELVE

26
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,935
Shouldn't you at least tell me
who's here to see me?

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,571
Do I know you?

28
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,741
I'm with Angel Capital Group.

29
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,993
Angel?

30
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,706
Oh, right. You're the big guy at Angel.
I remember now.

31
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,461
Anyway, what brings you here?

32
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,964
I've been trying to reach you,

33
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,383
so when I found out you were here,
I dropped by.

34
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,388
It's bad enough being stuck in here,

35
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,640
but you came all the way here
to collect money?

36
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,560
This must be a joke.

37
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,186
I suggest you leave.

38
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,940
Or I'll have my boys blend Angel
or whatnot into a smoothie.

39
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,068
You owe us two billion won,
half in principal and half in interest.

40
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,737
After today,
it'll shoot up to 2.2 billion won.

41
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,614
A billion won just in interest?

42
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,867
And another 200 million after today?

43
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,912
If you sell your business and your car,

44
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,081
you'll be able to pay it off.

45
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,041
Just sign here,

46
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,544
and I'll handle the rest.

47
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,506
I've never borrowed

48
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,717
from a loan shark
creative enough to collect

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,553
from someone in prison.

50
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,181
Now, get that scary piece of paper
out of my face.

51
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,391
Of course, I want to pay you back.

52
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,727
But I just can't.

53
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,479
Once I'm out of here,

54
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,439
I'll work my ass off at part-time jobs

55
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,275
and pay you back, interest and all.
How's that?

56
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,154
Mr. Jo Yangsu.

57
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,282
Let me say this again.

58
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,784
Sure.

59
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:48,246
We at Angel Capital Group
only lend money to thugs, gangsters,

60
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,707
and criminals like you.

61
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,584
Why?

62
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,588
Collecting from them is actually easier.
No trouble later too.

63
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,341
Here's something to think about.

64
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,092
For the last 100 years,

65
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,513
I've never failed to collect payment.

66
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,765
A hundred years?

67
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,100
Time must've been good to you.

68
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,611
What a joke.

69
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,950
- Good luck.
- "Good luck"?

70
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,751
Jwidol, make bail for Jo Yangsu.

71
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,836
<i>Got it, Chief.</i>

72
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,420
I just transferred

73
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,422
his 200 million won bail as ordered.

74
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,135

{\an8}TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

76
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,196
Here at Angel Capital Group,
we share the love.

77
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,993
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but we don't offer general loans.

78
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,080
Unless you are considered high-risk,
such as having a criminal record

79
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,959
or engaging in illegal activity,
we do not conduct business.

80
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:21,464
Are you a gangster or an ex-convict?

81
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,467
I see, you're neither.

82
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,262
In that case, we can't offer you a loan.

83
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,389
Sure. Please explore other options.

84
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,785
What?

85
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,122
So that's where you were.

86
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,124
Okay.

87
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,094
Okay, let's do this.

88
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,971
I guess I'll be stretching my legs.

89
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,349
Guys, did you all see the video?

90
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,975
What? Just a second.

91
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,978
Chief said we should strike
while they've got cash on hand.

92
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,605
We should get going.

93
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,232
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

94
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,692
Time to go collect.

95
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,611
What about Doni?

96
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,113
He'll meet us there. We should get moving.

97
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,323
Okay.

98
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,596
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Taesan.</i>

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,390
It's me.

100
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,518
I was wondering how you
were doing.

101
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,769
You know how it is.

102
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,147
You're constantly on my mind,
and I care for you deeply.

103
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,440
That's news to me.

104
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,859
<i>You popped up in my dream last night.</i>

105
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,571
I saw a huge tiger,
and man, was I glad to see it.

106
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,949
I must've missed you a lot.

107
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,493
<i>Hello?</i>

108
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,286
<i>Are you still there?</i>

109
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,667
Anyway,
how's your health these days?

110
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,503
Are you still on antidepressants?

111
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,924
Taesan, you should take
better care of yourself.

112
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,469
Don't hesitate to let me know
if you need anything.

113
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,929
- Do you need money again?
- <i>Come on.</i>

114
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,140
Yes, I do.

115
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,851
<i>I haven't collected this month,</i>
<i>so I'll spot you next month.</i>

116
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,478
- I'm busy, so--
- <i>Taesan, wait!</i>

117
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,815
You know how we all
sometimes need quick cash.

118
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,694
You've worked harder than us

119
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,738
and are living a wealthier, cooler life,

120
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,490
but not me.

121
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,659
What's so cool about being a loan shark?

122
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,162
Anyway, why does a detective need money?

123
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,621
Hey.

124
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,249
Even detectives have to spend money
on stuff sometimes too.

125
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,918
If a detective is in shabby clothes,

126
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,839
he gets dogged
by all kinds of lowlife crooks.

127
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,633
That stings more now that I'm older.

128
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,010
You'll see.

129
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,095
We're only 100 years apart.

130
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,222
Hey, if we were humans,

131
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,184
a 100-year gap would mean
I'd be dead before you were born.

132
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,312
<i>Remember how it was</i>
<i>during the Second Manchu Invasion,</i>

133
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,731
when I was surrounded by those barbarians?

134
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,232
You do, don't you?

135
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,901
I believe I saved your ass.

136
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,486
You sure did,

137
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,905
and I was absolutely grateful.

138
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,740
I'm still grateful for it to this day.

139
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,577
I'm the kind of person
who'd never forget if I owed someone.

140
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,496
That's who we are to each other.

141
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,415
Unbelievable. Hold on a second.

142
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,585
<i>Okay. I'll pay you back.</i>
<i>You know you can count on me.</i>

143
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,587
- Ugh.
- <i>Don't "ugh" me.</i>

144
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,799
<i>I just sent you some money…</i>

145
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,300
<i>…so don't go splurging this time.</i>

146
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,470
There we go. Right, thanks.

147
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,348
It's vital to my detective work,
that's all.

148
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,642
Of course, I'll never call you again.

149
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,602
Sure thing. Right, bye.

150
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,023
There's more downstairs, right?

151
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,733
- Yes, of course.
- Shall we?

152
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,902
Geez.

153
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,161
Thanks to this clinic,

154
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:25,083
I can see the beauty of the world again.

155
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,128
Retinal degeneration

156
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,713
left me blind for three years,

157
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:35,135
and every doctor said there was no hope

158
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,761
of recovery.

159
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,478
Talking with

160
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,941
the handsome, kind, and angelic nurse

161
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,235
persuaded me

162
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,571
to get treatment

163
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,906

165
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,995
<i>Hello?</i>

166
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,746
<i>Hey, why aren't you on your way?</i>

167
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,540
<i>Since Doni is unavailable,</i>

168
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,042
- <i>Doni's AI secretary is responding.</i>
- Good job.

169
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,336
<i>Share the message with me,</i>

170
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,588
<i>and I'll pass it along.</i>

171
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,426
Doctor, please don't hurt me!

172
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,428
Not again.

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,013
Dr. Bangwool!

174
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,556
Doctor, please!

175
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,151
Ma'am, please stay for your treatment.

176
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,780
Bangwool, I asked you to go easy.

177
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,991
The patients are all running off!

178
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,244
He's still here, though.

179
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,705
Sir, it's all right.
Please let go of this.

180
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,789
It'll be fine.

181
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,083
Oh, dear.

182
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,336
Oh, no.

183
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,466
You've got to push past your fear.

184
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,552
Her methods may look rough,

185
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,054
but they definitely work.

186
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,725
Hey, Bangwool.

187
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,024
You can't just go around snapping necks.
That's dangerous.

188
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,402
From now on, stick to medicinal herbs.

189
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,075
No way. My headache's gone.

190
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,165
It seems you had a serious case
of cervical disc herniation,

191
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,459
but luckily,
you responded well to treatment.

192
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,254
- So that's why my neck was hurting.
- That's right.

193
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,465
I've been suffering
from chronic headaches,

194
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,843
and no doctor has been able
to help me for years.

195
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,847
Thank you so much. I'm truly grateful.

196
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,766
I have to say,

197
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,143
your treatments are rather unorthodox.

198
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,062
Yes, our methods

199
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,732
were handed down from ancient times.
Pretty unique, right?

200
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,319
We extract therapeutic enzymes
from snake venom

201
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,738
for patient treatment.

202
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,616
Oh, how fascinating.

203
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,994
When I saw the ad,
I thought it was a scam--

204
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,161
A scam?

205
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,832
We've been
promoting our clinic with integrity.

206
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,000
Right?

207
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,335
Sure.

208
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,379
Your medication is ready. Shall we?

209
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,505
What? I see.

210
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,508
- Sure thing. Thank you, Doctor.
- Let's go.

211
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,802
Keep it up, but be gentle.

212
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,139
Just a second.

213
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,516
Are you on any other medication?

214
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,102
Here it is.

215
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,562
Bangwool, be gentle.

216
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,355
Doctor…

217
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,400
Help me!

218
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,402
{\an8}That'll be 10,000 won.

219
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,946
- Is it really only 10,000 won?
- Yes.

220
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,283
In return, please write a nice review.

221
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,369
- Sure.
- Good.

222
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,496
Take one in the morning
and one in the evening.

223
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,457
Also, avoid greasy foods and alcohol,

224
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,168
especially pork fat.

225
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,211
In fact, you should cut out pork entirely.

226
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,672
Pigs are actually really cute animals.

227
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,217
In fact, many families even keep them
as pets along with dogs, right?

228
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,887
- Oh, sure.
- That'll be 10,000 won.

229
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,347
- Are you sure it's 10,000 won?
- Yes.

230
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,557
Cash, please.

231
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,268
- Here you go.
- Have a good day.

232
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,648
I see you can move now.
Wait, it's still too soon for that.

233
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,734
Careful.

234
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,237
How much is everything?

235
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,783
Your total is 12.6 million won.

236
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,161
I'll take them all.

237
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,954
Would you like to pay in installments?

238
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,876
You see, the word "installments"…

239
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,545
That rubs me the wrong way.

240
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,048
I apologize.

241
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,551
- Of course, you'll pay in full.
- In full.

242
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,181
That's a lot of dough.

243
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,975
Gee, it's been so long.

244
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,024
It's bustling today.

245
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,109
Hmm?

246
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,488
To guard humans from evil spirits,

247
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,198
the primordial gods

248
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,451
sent down 12 angels
to the land of the living.

249
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,206
The angels fought tirelessly,
defeating countless evil spirits

250
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,793
who sought to cast darkness over us,

251
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:23,256
and at last sealed
the Hellmouth, the very source of evil.

252
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,341
Legend has it

253
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
that the power within…

254
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,096
…that mask
is what drove away the evil spirits.

255
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,057
Ever since then, our ancestors…

256
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,643
Let's sit there.

257
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,230
This is some fine weather.

258
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,112
Ta-da.

259
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,363
These are for you.

260
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,116
What are these?

261
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,619
It's my heartfelt gift to you, of course.

262
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,248
You know I'm always looking out for you.

263
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,501
I'm fine. I don't need these.

264
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,961
You don't need them?

265
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:07,258
I took the time to pick out the items
that would look amazing on you.

266
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,302
Which you bought with Chief's money.

267
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,013
That I did.

268
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,766
I did Chief wrong.

269
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,103
There's no reason to feel bad.
Taesan's loaded.

270
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,396
Wonseung actually saw it.

271
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,399
He wipes with cash
instead of toilet paper.

272
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,026
Unbelievable.

273
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,698
I've told you countless times
not to come to my workplace like this.

274
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,038
When are you coming back home?

275
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,458
Mirr, it's been over 10 years now.

276
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,045
You guys can't be apart like this.

277
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,465
And it's my duty
to keep the family together.

278
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,892
I should get back.

279
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,852
I'll be in touch.

280
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,064
Mirr, wait!

281
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,567
Take these with you!

282
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,869
What could she have seen in her dream

283
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,081
that she's hiding it even from me?

284
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,785
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

285
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,704
This is nice. It's been so long.

286
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,791
That's the bomb.

287
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,295
Let's sit.

288
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,379
Geez.

289
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,923
Mmm.

290
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,258
Here.

291
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,386
Boss, how did you get out so soon?

292
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,472
- Exactly.
- I've been curious about that too.

293
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,809
My guess is that Gwangsu did me a solid.

294
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,477
We'll show our appreciation tomorrow.

295
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,438
Sure, boss.

296
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,565
- Babe, you're getting a call.
- Right.

297
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,941
Who is it?

298
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,359
Crap.

299
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,655
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Jo Yangsu,</i>

300
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,115
this is Angel Capital Group.

301
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,575
- <i>Angel?</i>
- <i>Angel?</i>

302
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,910
<i>You must be the big boss at Angel.</i>

303
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:45,207
I told you I'd work my ass off
and pay you back!

304
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,044
Feels good to be out, doesn't it?

305
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,378
Of course, it's nice.

306
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,551
Hold on a second.

307
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,471
Did you bail me out
so you could collect from me?

308
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,015
<i>You're a complete nutjob.</i>

309
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,019
I'm on my way, so I'll see you in a bit.

310
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,021
Sure, drop by…

311
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,690
- Did he just hang up on me?
- What was that?

312
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,237
- You know Angel's boss, right?
- Sure.

313
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,822
- The burly one.
- Yes, boss.

314
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,825
- He's on his way, so kill on sight.
- Got it, boss.

315
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,411
Sora, get coffee with the girls.

316
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,830
I'll give you a call
after I take care of something.

317
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,040
Something must be up.

318
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,001
I'm only saying this because I care,

319
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,962
but I want to watch you fight.

320
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,714
Sora, we're not ordinary people.

321
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,176
Over there. Look at his cauliflower ears.
He's a former MMA fighter.

322
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,303
This one's a boxing champion.

323
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,055
I don't want you to see us

324
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,766
knocking people out
with blood flying everywhere.

325
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,810
I only want you to see nice things.

326
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,478
- I'll call you soon, okay?
- Mmm.

327
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,355
I'll be worried, but I hope it goes well.

328
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,148
- Sure.
- Call me.

329
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,650
- Get moving!
- Yes, boss!

330
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,985
- Stay behind them. I love you.
- Move!

331
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,279
- Grab your things. We'll go to Itaewon.
- No boys!

332
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,614
Let's move out.

333
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,825

334
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,910
<i>…and have called on the public</i>

<i>…to cooperate and practice safe driving.</i>

- What is it?
- <i>Chief.</i>

337
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,126
Jo Yangsu's boys will be crawling outside.

00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,336
- Okay, thank you.
- <i>Drivers heading downtown,</i>

Hey.

Oh, oh…

00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:55,773
Geez.

Right.

353
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:35,956
Of course.

00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,646
You just need to sign this document.

357
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,730
Right.

358
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,739
That's settled.

359
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,619
Since this doesn't cover the whole loan,

360
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,996
I'll throw in the car keys.

361
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,582
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

362
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,628
Jwidol, this is the place.

363
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,713
- We're here.
- Okay.

364
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,219
- See you later.
- Sure.

365
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,805
- Be safe.
- Got it.

366
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,167
- Hmm? Hold it. Hide.
- What? Why?

367
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,338
- Malsook, over here.
- Come here!

368
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,220
Hey, they're leaving.

369
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,014
I'll fly solo on this one.

370
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,724
Don't get cheeky.

371
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,434
Gangsters run this place.

372
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,896
And they probably beefed up security
since they knew we'd be collecting today.

373
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,648
Seriously. Who do you take me for?

374
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:25,983
Go wait in the car.

375
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,041
Were you seriously dozing off just now?

376
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,333
See how it's packed today?

377
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,127
- Yes, boss.
- I told you this would work.

378
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,379
We've hit the jackpot.

379
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,174
Finish the job solid today

380
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,301
- and make sure the drops go right.
- Yes, boss.

381
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,763
The Angel Capital Group people
will show up to collect, so stay sharp.

382
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:56,889
Yes, boss.

383
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,058
You know Seongmuk,
of the Vipers gang, right?

384
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,644
He skipped out to the Philippines
without paying Angel,

385
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,480
- and those punks…
- I knew it.

386
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,315
…tailed him there to collect.

387
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,150
They're straight-up evil. Like Satan.

388
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,234
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

389
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,237
You especially don't want
to take on their boss.

390
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,406
You can't win in a straight fight,

391
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,494
so arm up with bats and ashtrays,

392
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,370
jump him hard, and beat him to a pulp.

393
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,455
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

394
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,123
- Found the client.
- Get back to work.

395
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,208
I'll tail him.

396
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,782
What the heck?

397
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,659
What's going on?

398
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,411
What?

399
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,838
I said I'd handle it.

400
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,131
And watch you take all day?

401
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,633
No can do. Let's go.

402
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,553
Why did I even bother
climbing up that way?

403
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,224
Come on.

404
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,226
Fine, let's go.

405
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,519
<i>Area cleared.</i>

406
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,604
There are more upstairs, so be careful.

407
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,981
The operator is deep inside.

408
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,526
- Are you kidding me?
- Double it.

409
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,694
Hey!

410
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,863
You're hustling me, aren't you?

411
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,031
Bring me my money.

412
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,117
I want my money!

413
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,994
Bring me my money now!

414
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,538
No, let go of me!

415
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,541
I want my money. My money!

416
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,129
- Get lost.
- Let go!

417
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,380
Keep it down.

418
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,506
Let go of me!

419
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,885
- Keep it down.
- Let go of me!

420
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,138
- Let go!
- Just keep playing.

421
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,519
Looking nice.

422
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,773
Hey, get them.

423
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:12,900
Get them.

424
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,527
What's going on?

425
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,571
This time around,

426
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,073
I'll handle this myself, so hang back.

427
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,619
What the heck?

428
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,996
Block them, will you?

429
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,753
What's going on?

430
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,923
Would it kill Malsook
to be patient once in a while?

431
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,720
Run!

432
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,780
Damn it!

433
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,212
Crap.

434
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,385
Hold on. Calm down, will you?

435
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,821
- Get the rest, okay?
- Got it.

436
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,535
Come on!

437
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,329
Looking good, guys.

438
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,540
One's getting away down the stairs.

439
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,625
He's leaving the building. Malsook?

440
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,842
- Where is he?
- <i>Down the stairs, at your 3 o'clock.</i>

441
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,093
He's dead meat.

442
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,464
Where did this hog come from?

443
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,382
Oink, oink.

444
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,926
What? You damn pig…

445
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,309
Move!

446
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,854
How dare you run away?

447
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,400
Why are you here?

448
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,612
Well, I figured he had no other way to go.

449
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,906
You kicked him too hard, Malsook.

450
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,075
He might be concussed.

451
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,122
- All clear.
- <i>Okay.</i>

452
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,207
Did she get him?

453
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,667
- <i>She did.</i>
- Breathe.

454
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,211
<i>Don't tell me he's dead.</i>

455
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,589
Did he dislocate his jaw?

456
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,840
<i>And the bag?</i>

457
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,384
We got the guy and secured the bag.

458
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,719
Okay, let's move out.

459
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,413
I threw in some extra fritters.

460
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,207
- Thank you.
- Bye.

461
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,461
GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD

462
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,716
- To-go, please.
- Sure. What can I get you?

463
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,801
Mister!

464
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,556
Mister, it's you.

465
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,474
Mister, it's you!

466
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,105
Why didn't you come by recently?
I've missed you.

467
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,066
I've been busy. How's business going?

468
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,401
You know how it is.

469
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,862
During the day,
there's always a long line.

470
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,030
Everyone loves it.

471
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,824
Thanks for coming by, mister.

472
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,201
Gee, no need to thank me.

473
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,912
You're the only human I talk to, Geumsoon.

474
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,002
You don't look so good.

475
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,298
Think about your health on the job
and try to drink less.

476
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,967
And hit the gym.

477
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,013
I've worked out for over 5,000 years,
and now I'm sick of it.

478
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,683
I've lived for too long.

479
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,520
Don't say that. You need
to stick around for centuries more

480
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,981
and keep protecting the innocent.

481
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,775
You're an angel, after all.

482
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,777
Although it's a secret only I know.

483
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,905
- Someone might hear you.
- Whatever.

484
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,077
I quit protecting humans long ago.

485
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,162
You know that.

486
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,788
Remember how thugs came around

487
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,667
when I was in middle school,
attacking us and wrecking homes

488
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,337
to scare off my mom and the neighbors?

489
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,713
Of course.

490
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,673
Your mom sold tteokbokki too.

491
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,966
That's right.

492
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,511
You taught those punks a real lesson.

493
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,763
Swoosh and thud!

494
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,686
You saved me and my mom too.

495
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:46,274
That's how I was able
to keep the family business going,

496
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,360
and I couldn't be happier.

497
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,822
Even for an angel,

498
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:56,284
it must've been tough
to protect humans for so long.

499
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,538
You had to make sacrifices,
including losing your family.

500
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:04,167
You must be worn out,
no thanks to selfish human beings.

501
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,297
But did you know, mister,

502
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,926
that people carry gratitude

503
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,596
deep in their hearts?

504
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,099
Like I do.

505
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,434
We humans aren't all bad.

506
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:26,982
Plus, this world isn't constantly
threatened by evil spirits anymore.

507
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,651
It's about time
you found your happiness too.

508
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,819
Be happy.

509
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,491
Geumsoon, you.

510
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,995
- You're all grown up now, huh?
- Hmm.

511
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,204
Hold on a second, mister.

512
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:45,083
Let me pack some tasty food for you, dear.

513
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,387
I won't take that.

514
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,140
Can't you accept it just this once,
Geumsoon?

515
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,393
Ever since you were young,
you were always so stubborn.

516
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,521
- Unbelievable.
- You brat!

517
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,441
I've had my eye on you for a while now.

518
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:14,571
How dare you talk to your senior
like she's your equal?

519
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,948
You obviously have no manners.

520
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,702
That's because I've known her
since she was a kid.

521
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,870
Outrageous!

522
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,750
You little menace!

523
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,418
Sir, you appear to be drunk.

524
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,131
Wait, aren't you Manbok?

525
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,382
What?

526
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,468
You brat!

527
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,263
I'm right. You're Manbok,
the stationery store owner's son.

528
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,392
You were always sent out for salt
for wetting your bed.

529
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,727
What…

530
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,605
Are you Mr. Taesan?

531
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,106
Yes, it's Mr. Taesan.

532
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,859
That's right, I'm Taesan.

533
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,946
It really is you!

534
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,449
How do you still look so young?

535
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,326
Manbok, it's really you!

536
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,952
- Goodness.
- Manbok!

537
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,832
You brat, it's been so long.

538
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,001
- Have you been alive and well?
- Yes!

539
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,879
How come you haven't aged at all?

547
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,610
<i>Minerals</i>

548
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:39,447

00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,541
<i>at NRIC until the 25th…</i>

553
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,885
What's this?

554
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,388
- Something's not right.
- What?

555
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,807
- Show me.
- What's wrong?

556
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,810
Nothing is registering on this spectrum.

557
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,395
What's going on?

558
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,605
- What's that?
- What am I seeing?

559
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,482
The numbers are showing abnormal spikes.

560
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,793
We've found Ogwi.

561
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,849
Let's see.

562
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,060
Hey.

563
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,521
Huh?

564
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,650
Kids, I got us some tteokbokki.

565
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,237
Kangji?

566
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,282
Malsook? Wonseung?

567
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,537
Doni, I even grabbed some sundae,
your favorite.

568
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,331
Are they not back yet?

569
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,293
They should have this while it's hot.

{\an8}BENEFIT THE WORLD OF HUMANS

571
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,861
There.

Are you all right?

573
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,684
Attempting this ritual under such strain
could be deadly.

574
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,898
There's

575
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,026
no more time to lose.
