3
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,775
Why does he keep following me?

4
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:20,530
Beats me.

5
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:33,876
Hey, kid. Go away. Shoo.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,795
Come on. Really?

7
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:38,464
He's been tagging along
because he likes you,

8
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:39,882
so be kind to him.

9
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,634
Who is that kid anyway?

10
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:46,889
His name is Haetae, and while he may be
too young to realize yet,

11
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:49,684
he has special powers
like the rest of you.

12
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,519
Haetae?

13
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,187
What is he exactly?

14
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:55,857
God created him

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,860
by giving him one trait
from each of you 12 angels.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,989
But among all the angels,

17
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,242
he was made to resemble you the most.

18
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:07,326
Me?

19
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,747
We look nothing alike.

20
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:15,751
Haetae will become

21
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:18,087
a guardian of the human world

22
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,009
alongside you and the other angels.

23
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,389
We can manage just fine on our own.
He'll be a nuisance.

24
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:32,268
- Play with him.
- No, go away. Shoo.

25
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,978
Don't be like that.

26
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,230
Come here. Go to him.

27
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,404
Don't follow me.

28
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:46,699
Go.

29
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,163
Look at him go.

30
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:39,126
Chief.

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,673
We should move out.

32
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:45,591
It seems to be done over there.

33
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,398
We exist to protect humans.

34
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,900
Don't forget that.

35
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:07,571
Certainly. I will take it to heart.

37
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:31,489
Bangwool, can we please stop?

38
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,867
Never mind the risks. I'm starving now!

39
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,830
I'm going to eat them all.

00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:00,559
You did good today.

43
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:04,897
Guys, where were you today?
The House of Angels?

44
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:06,524
Hey, Wonseung.

45
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:09,527
Where were you,
and why weren't you picking up?

46
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,653
What?

47
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,489
Well, you see…

48
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,618
I was helping Marok with something.

49
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,162
The drug bust you mentioned?

50
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:22,081
Yes, that drug bust I mentioned.

51
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:24,291
I was out all day and am starving.

{\an8}"60CHICKEN"

53
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,295
{\an8}- It's fried chicken! Nice.
- Let's go.

54
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:29,797
Let's go.

55
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,133
Inside we go.

56
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,679
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

57
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:38,889
Mirr, try this.

58
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,975
This isn't just crispy.
It's super crunchy.

59
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:42,643
Is it that crunchy?

60
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,607
Dip it in the sauce. It's good.

61
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:54,905
Mmm… That's tasty.

62
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:56,073
Right?

63
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:58,868
It's even good
with <i>tteokbokki</i> sauce.

64
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,870
Try it. Go ahead.

65
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,584
- It's good.
- Right?

66
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:11,797
- Have some.
- That looks good.

67
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,219
- This is your bonus for the month.
- Hmm…

68
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,596
Can you pass this along?

69
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,056
- Here.
- Pass it along.

70
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,641
Mirr too.

71
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:23,893
Oh!

72
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:24,977
Bangwool.

73
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,148
Each of you, give me one to donate.

74
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:31,066
Here.

75
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,611
Like Chief said, we need to be rich

76
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,237
because we'll be living forever.

77
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:39,158
So, Kangji, you can't take from us
and give what's ours to humans.

78
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,451
Hey.

79
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,078
Just hand it over, will you?

80
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:45,206
You already have more
than you could ever spend.

81
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,373
She's right.

82
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:50,085
I'm sick of counting all the zeroes
in my bank account.

83
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,420
Hand it over already.

84
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:53,339
- Give it here.
- Hand it over.

85
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:54,632
Thank you.

86
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,843
By the way, it's been quiet.

87
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,138
Were they simply evil spirits in hiding?

88
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:02,765
That makes no sense.

89
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:05,768
We'll soon have answers,
so don't worry so much.

90
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:07,853
What do you mean?

91
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:12,399
Ah… Mirr, you wouldn't know
because you were away for so long.

92
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:14,860
But from now on,

93
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:17,571
if you have any questions or need help,

94
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,573
come to me first. Got it?

95
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,034
Why would she when we have Chief?

96
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,163
Bangwool,
he's been acting strange since yesterday.

97
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,582
Could an evil spirit have fried his brain?

98
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,709
What? As if.

99
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,380
Let her examine you.

100
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:36,215
No, I'm fine. I'm all good.

101
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:39,176
I said I was fine.

102
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:40,803
I'm fine.

103
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:43,222
Fine. Do your thing.

104
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:47,810
Why so serious?

105
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:50,229
She says you're too dumb.

106
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,314
What? I'm too dumb?

107
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:53,691
You must be a pea brain.

108
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,693
That hurts.

109
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,736
Hey, you're here.

110
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,530
Have some chicken. It's tasty.

111
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,824
- This--
- I had beef for dinner.

112
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:04,326
- Is Taesan inside?
- Yes.

113
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:06,495
Eat up.

114
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,260
Come on.

115
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:25,681
As if hitting the bottle nonstop

116
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,684
will change anything.

117
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,153
Samin, you…

118
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,906
Have you ever laughed before?

119
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:09,410
I guess you haven't.

120
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:19,086
How about a laugh?

121
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,839
What are you playing at?

122
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,800
Smile a little.

123
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,928
Who knows?

124
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,223
Maybe if you amuse me…

125
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:36,228
I might find
all of Haetae's soul stones for you.

126
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:17,770
No!

127
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,442
Unbelievable.

128
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,780
Damn it.

129
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:32,868
What is it?

130
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:36,038
Did you dream about the kids again?

131
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:39,416
Are you okay?

132
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,544
Of course. I've gotten used to it.

133
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:47,508
Anyway, you should ease up
on the drinking now.

134
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,594
I barely had any.

135
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,432
You see…

136
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:04,942
Taesan.

137
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,569
I believe Ogwi…

138
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,490
has been awakened again.

140
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:08,880
<i>How did he escape?</i>

141
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,216
It seems like Samin

142
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:13,552
awoke him.

143
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,139
That's why

144
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,310
under no circumstances can Ogwi meet Mirr.

145
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:24,813
Ever since the evil spirits reemerged,

146
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:27,482
I had Wonseung track Samin down.

147
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,901
I told you to keep my kids out of this.

148
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:32,863
Evil spirits could appear any time,
anywhere. We must be prepared.

149
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:38,577
Okay, then.

150
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:41,413
Tell them about Samin and Ogwi,

151
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,415
but only tell me
once you have their location.

152
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,209
Sure.

153
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:52,090
Anyway, why has Samin
remained in hiding all these years,

154
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:55,469
only to come back and unleash Ogwi?

155
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,433
Now that Ogwi has awakened…

156
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,062
it will be a headache.

157
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,318
I should've killed him back then.

00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,349
Unbelievable.

161
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,727
Huh?

162
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,563
Wait, what's this?

163
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,691
{\an8}

164
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,822
Malsook, are you okay?

165
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,703
You've still got it, Mirr.

166
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:10,455
Look who's talking.

167
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,750
Why do you still have your powers

168
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,710
when we've lost ours?

169
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:17,838
Is it because of the Dragon Soul?

170
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,256
I'm just as clueless.

171
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,008
I'm glad at least you have your powers.

172
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,220
You'll train with me again
tomorrow, right?

173
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:26,805
Of course.

174
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,640
You suddenly seem to be going all out.

175
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:31,560
I should be of help to the family.

176
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,103
Let's go.

177
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,981
We have to recover fast
if we want to train harder.

178
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,107
Sure. Let's go.

179
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:44,906
Why did you get us so much?

180
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,616
This place has great cakes.

181
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,869
We deserve this after all that training.

182
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:53,039
Here. This milk cream cake is to die for.

183
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,750
I'll eat it myself, so go ahead.

184
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,211
I rarely offer to feed someone.

185
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:00,672
So don't make me look like a fool

186
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,424
and just open your mouth.

187
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:04,801
This is a reward for coming back to us.

188
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,975
It's really good.

189
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,019
We'll come here every day after training.

190
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,604
The buns here are just as good.

191
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,068
Why aren't you answering me?

192
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,405
I don't know if we can do that

193
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,742
because of the evil spirits.

194
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,329
Mirr, don't overthink it.

195
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,289
This isn't our first rodeo,

196
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:36,708
and last time, it was the evil spirits
who ran off.

197
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,293
We'll do as we've been doing.

198
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:40,962
After we catch them,

199
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:43,131
Marok will vanquish them
with a magic barrier.

200
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:48,887
We don't know
where the evil spirits came from

201
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,223
or how many exist.

202
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,099
Besides,

203
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,144
Marok is a human at the end of the day.

204
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:59,397
He hasn't explicitly mentioned it,

205
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,858
but he used more power
than he should've the other day.

206
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:06,071
If the evil spirits come back
and attack before he's recovered,

207
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:10,325
his body won't be able to handle
the staff's power.

208
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,334
Did you perhaps

209
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,962
have a vision?

210
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,008
It's about time you were honest about it.

211
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,220
Wasn't it your visions

212
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:33,640
that made you leave us before?

213
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,647
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,110
But I didn't have any visions.

215
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:49,447
I only asked because I was frustrated.

216
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,283
You don't need to apologize.

217
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,575
Geez.

218
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,452
Now I feel guilty for bringing it up.

219
00:19:56,413 --> 00:20:00,000
All right. Let's worry about this later
and dig in for now.

220
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:10,885
Is this good for the body?

221
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:14,264
What?

222
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:18,935
I should drink this
if evil spirits appear and I'm in danger?

223
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:23,231
This will enhance my powers,
but when the effect wears off,

224
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:25,150
I'll be in excruciating pain?

225
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,361
Bangwool, please.
I don't like being in pain.

226
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,782
So what if I'll quickly recover?
Did you give it to the others too?

227
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:36,828
This is the last vial? How so?

228
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:41,291
Because it was made with a medicinal herb
that disappeared 400 years ago?

229
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,460
Bangwool, you should've made more.

230
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,172
Marok, are you going somewhere?

231
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:49,924
Yes, to the police station.

232
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:51,593
Are you quitting the force?

233
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:53,553
I have a feeling I'll be busy,

234
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:57,349
and I don't want to be a nuisance
to my coworkers.

235
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,309
What do you mean, things will get busier?

236
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,187
Well, we'll talk in the evening.

237
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,649
Do I just drink this?

238
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,528
It smells nice.

239
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,823
TAESAN BUILDING

240
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,533
<i>Looking good.</i>

241
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:23,083
Jwidol, Marok told everyone to gather.

242
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,460
Just a second. I'm almost done.

243
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:27,128
What's this?

244
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:29,422
Malsook put in a request.

245
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:33,426
This is one good-looking sword.
Where's ours?

246
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,387
Give it here.

247
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,556
It took me forever to make this one.
Maybe, if I have time.

248
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,310
Hey, that's mean.

249
00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:44,062
- Do you have a crush on Malsook?
- What?

250
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:47,065
Of course not. Me?

251
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:48,566
That'd be insane. We're family.

252
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,694
Exactly.
You don't do that with family. Let's go.

253
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,655
Sure, let's go.

254
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:02,622
- Delicious, right?
- Yeah, Bangwool should've come.

255
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:05,166
- Mirr.
- Oh, yes?

256
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,506
We need to talk.

257
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,842
Sure.

258
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:32,026
Mirr, I have something to ask.

259
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,111
Sure.

260
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:35,738
Didn't someone come see you recently?

261
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:37,740
Me?

262
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:40,660
No, no one did.

263
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:45,665
What's this about?

264
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,877
That day, it was you

265
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,171
the evil spirits were after.

266
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,176
What? Ogwi's back?

267
00:22:56,718 --> 00:22:58,011
What are you saying?

268
00:22:58,094 --> 00:22:59,929
Marok, you sealed Ogwi yourself.

269
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:02,765
It turns out Samin is still alive.

270
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:06,269
It appears he awakened Ogwi.

271
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,271
Is that why evil spirits reemerged lately?

272
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,524
- That's right.
- Marok, I have to ask.

273
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:15,236
Mirr is still clueless, right?

274
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:22,619
Me?

275
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,579
What for?

276
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,372
That's what we're trying to figure out.

277
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:28,750
We need to know what they're after.

278
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:55,568
Mirr.

279
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:57,487
- Mirr.
- Yes?

280
00:23:58,655 --> 00:24:00,865
Marok and I will look into it,

281
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:03,243
so don't leave the house
for the time being.

282
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:06,454
- Chief, let me help--
- No, do as I say.

283
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,207
But Chief.

284
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,519
Why are they suddenly gathering?

285
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,603
What's going on?

286
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,221
- Please don't do this.
- Move.

287
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:31,140
Chief, please. Don't do this.

288
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:34,519
We lost members of our family.

289
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:36,979
Move.

290
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:39,649
Don't!

291
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,375
You defied God

292
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,919
and brought ruin to the world.

293
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:03,631
You've already ruined my everything.

294
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:06,509
Do as you wish.

295
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,469
I will end you myself.

296
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,536
<i>Chief, help us.</i>

297
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,288
<i>We're still in pain.</i>

298
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,497
<i>It hurts too much.</i>

299
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:39,417
- <i>Please.</i>
- <i>Mirr, Marok, even Geumsoon.</i>

300
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,877
<i>They'll all die.</i>

301
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,885
Chief, we're here.

302
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:59,437
Taesan, Wonseung located Ogwi and Samin.

303
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,996
Is there just one left now?

304
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:23,085
Yes.

305
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:25,546
Locate the last soul stone,

306
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:28,508
take the Dragon Soul from Mirr,

307
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,885
and merge them to give it life.

308
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:35,181
Then, you'll possess
all of Haetae's dark powers.

309
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,851
I still have one major obstacle.

310
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:41,145
Taesan.

311
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:45,399
The tiger's still prowling around Mirr.

312
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:48,152
Don't worry.

313
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:51,739
Taesan and the other angels' powers
were sealed beyond the Hellmouth.

314
00:28:52,657 --> 00:28:53,783
Besides,

315
00:28:54,492 --> 00:28:56,118
even Taesan has a weak spot.

316
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:04,418
{\an8}ANGEL CAPITAL GROUP

317
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:07,004
Doni.

318
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:10,508
Doni, get up already.

319
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:17,098
What's going on?

320
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:18,891
Have you seen Chief?

321
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:20,226
Where, in my dream?

322
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:22,061
No, today, in the real world.

323
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:24,522
I haven't. I was sleeping up until now.

324
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,649
Where could he have gone?

325
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,117
Did you talk to Wonseung?

326
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:52,370
Yes, I told him to keep it a secret.

327
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:56,666
If it gets dangerous, just run.

328
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:57,750
I'll handle them.

329
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,127
Hey,

330
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:03,881
are you belittling me
or looking out for me?

331
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:07,426
You know full well I'm the only one
whose powers aren't sealed.

332
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,350
I've got this.

333
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,228
Stay right behind me.

334
00:30:18,312 --> 00:30:19,480
I can't have you die, old man.

335
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:33,578
- Here.
- Thank you.

336
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:38,624
"GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD"

337
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,588
That's tasty.

338
00:30:51,304 --> 00:30:52,972
Business is unusually slow today.

339
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:56,434
If it were any other day, I'd be swamped.

340
00:30:56,517 --> 00:30:59,353
There's no harm in slowing down
every now and then.

341
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:02,064
How about a drink?

342
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:05,693
Cut back on that for your health.

343
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:07,904
Even Mr. Taesan was worried.

344
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:10,489
I only drink a little,
so no need to worry.

345
00:31:14,493 --> 00:31:15,745
Welcome.

346
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,172
<i>I saw them enter the tunnel,</i>

347
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,300
<i>but I couldn't see the entrance.</i>

348
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,305
There must be a dark magic barrier.

349
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:00,831
Taesan.

350
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,507
Chief, where are you?

351
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,175
Did you check your pendant? That's--

352
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:12,593
Give it here.

353
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:13,970
Chief, you must hurry.

354
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:15,972
It's near Geumsoon's food cart.

355
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:37,785
As expected,
the angels walked right into the trap.

356
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:39,954
Should I call for Ogwi?

357
00:32:55,428 --> 00:32:56,429
You must be

358
00:32:57,054 --> 00:32:59,056
the evil spirits
Mr. Taesan warned me about!

359
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,437
No…

360
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:07,481
Geumsoon, run!

361
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:09,025
Go!

362
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:33,275
Should we report to the police?

363
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:41,700
Manbok!

364
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:44,161
Manbok, what happened? Where's Geumsoon?

365
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:46,163
- Geumsoon…
- Where is she?

366
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:48,374
- Over there.
- Where?

367
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:50,000
Over there…

368
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:51,961
Poor Geumsoon. Oh, no.

369
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,021
{\an8}MR. TAESAN

370
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:15,586
Mr. Taesan…

371
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,757
Geumsoon, are you in there?

372
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,175
Geumsoon?

373
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:40,236
Geumsoon.

374
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,115
Geumsoon, are you all right? Geumsoon?

375
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,700
Marok!

376
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,953
Old man, hurry in here.

377
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:53,040
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Let's go.

378
00:37:09,306 --> 00:37:10,724
Let's go that way.

379
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,105
Come on.

380
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,693
Geez.

381
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:31,078
Geumsoon.

382
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,168
Get going with the others.

383
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:41,171
- Doni and I have got this.
- What?

384
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:42,464
You're here.

385
00:37:42,548 --> 00:37:43,549
Let's go.

386
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:45,634
- This way.
- Careful.

387
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,434
The two of us aren't enough, Malsook.

388
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:01,317
You're all dead meat.

389
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:34,767
Malsook…

390
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:50,824
Malsook, are you okay?

391
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,495
He's no joke.

392
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:55,996
Obviously, Malsook.

393
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:09,343
- Wonseung, clear a path.
- Got it.

394
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,641
That way.

395
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:52,237
When will
our additional <i>tteokbokki</i> order be ready?

396
00:40:52,321 --> 00:40:55,741
It's almost ready,
but aren't you eating too much?

397
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:58,160
Come on. <i>Tteokbokki</i>'s only a snack.

398
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:00,913
Since our job requires a lot of strength,
we can eat this much.

399
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:02,706
Please give us more.

400
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,709
I'm grateful, but eating this much--

401
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:07,169
More <i>sundae</i> and liver, please.

402
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:08,253
What?

403
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,840
- Chief, isn't the <i>sundae</i> delicious?
- Sure thing.

404
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:14,635
Doni and Jwidol
should be done collecting by now.

405
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:16,428
- Should I tell them to bring Bangwool?
- Sure.

406
00:41:16,512 --> 00:41:18,388
And the old man too. He might get upset.

407
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,933
I've already called.
He's probably on his way.

408
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:23,227
That reminds me. Chief, here.

409
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:27,606
"LEDGER"

410
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:31,151
Remember the goons who are
pulling scams with the land in Gangnam?

411
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:33,779
- Right.
- When should we strike them?

412
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:36,240
The sooner we act the better
because it's pretty big.

413
00:41:36,323 --> 00:41:39,409
I'll have Jwidol open a bank account,
so proceed carefully.

414
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:41,161
Don't worry about it

415
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,913
- and watch us handle it.
- Sure.

416
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:45,290
What do you need me to do?

417
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:47,751
Wait outside and pummel those leaving.

418
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:56,677
By the way,
have the thugs come back since?

419
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:58,345
Sorry?

420
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:01,306
Gosh, no. Not even once.

421
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,601
And I owe it all to you
and your colleagues.

422
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:07,688
Thank you so much for helping us.

423
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:11,024
You have it all wrong.
I wasn't trying to help you.

424
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:13,569
I was only claiming my own land.

425
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:17,948
Either way, let me know
if those thugs come back.

426
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:20,325
Got it. I won't forget
what you did for us.

427
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,119
I said I wasn't trying to help.

428
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:25,789
Mom, I'm back. I see a lot
of customers today. I'll wash the dishes.

429
00:42:25,873 --> 00:42:27,457
Forget it. Just go rest.

430
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,835
Wait. That thug!

431
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:33,297
- "That thug"?
- I mean, the man who took out the thugs.

432
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,885
You know,

433
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:41,138
I drew that while thinking about
how you saved us that day.

434
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:44,433
{\an8}"STAR TTEOKBOKKI"

435
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:48,020
You were like a star
shining brightly in the sky.

436
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:49,730
Wait, a star?

437
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:53,108
Maybe he's got a star face,
not star punches.

438
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:56,278
Thank you so much for saving us.

439
00:42:57,779 --> 00:42:59,948
What? I mean…

440
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:02,826
Your daughter's a sweetheart.

441
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,621
Who knew Chief had this side to him?

442
00:43:05,704 --> 00:43:08,707
Call me surprised.
She thinks he twinkles like a star.

443
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,504
Here. This is for the food.

444
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:17,299
Right.

445
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:20,010
I'll head out first.

446
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:22,012
What? Chief, where are you going?

447
00:43:22,512 --> 00:43:25,140
Thank you. Take care.

448
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:27,017
Come again.

449
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:37,653
Hold on. This is too much money.

450
00:43:37,736 --> 00:43:39,363
Geumsoon, stop him.

451
00:43:39,446 --> 00:43:40,906
That's not necessary.

452
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:42,366
Keep whatever's in there.

453
00:43:44,242 --> 00:43:45,661
But it's too much.

454
00:43:45,744 --> 00:43:47,287
Just take it, ma'am.

455
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:49,748
Chief is shy like that.

456
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:54,086
By the way,

457
00:43:54,169 --> 00:43:57,172
hasn't it been years
since Chief spoke to a human?

458
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:58,256
"Years"?

459
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,801
Hey, it's been over a century.

460
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:02,219
Could he be sick or something?

461
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,222
What's your chief's name?

462
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:06,932
His name?

463
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:08,141
Taesan.
