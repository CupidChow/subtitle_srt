1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:05,133
TWELVE

2
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:08,755
PRODUCTION SPONSORS
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS AND TOURISM AND KOCCA

3
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:14,184
TWELVE

4
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,211
- Did I keep you waiting?
- Hmm?

5
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:25,296
You're here.

6
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,548
I just split up with my crew.

7
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,550
Kangji?

8
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:32,928
Have you been watching us?

9
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,516
Let's go.

10
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,392
- Hmm?

11
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,103
Geez, sorry. How long was I asleep?

12
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,980
Sleep a bit more.
You must've been tired.

13
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:09,608
I'm good.

14
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,736
I doubt I'm more worn out

15
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,030
than you angels who protect humans.

16
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:17,533
All I do is spot evil spirits.

17
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:19,118
Don't sell yourself short.

18
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,869
Ogwi.

19
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:24,123
The gift God gave you is special.

20
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,291
If evil spirits
get past the magic barrier,

21
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,253
you're the only one who can detect
and find the soul stones.

22
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,172
But will I be able to uphold my duty?

23
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:35,342
I failed to spot them again.

24
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,428
That doesn't mean you lack power.

25
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:40,889
- Even the necklace reacted.

26
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,643
I don't know what's going on.

27
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,270
This time, the evil spirit vanished

28
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,939
just moments after I sensed its presence.

29
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,608
Also, I don't know why,

30
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,945
but I feel like I'm being watched.

31
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:57,281
Don't worry too much.

32
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:01,368
We're all trying hard
to fight off evil spirits,

33
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:03,078
and whatever happens,

34
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,372
I'll protect you.

35
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,755
You know,

36
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,090
I've started praying.

37
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,552
You said it yourself. Marok is human,

38
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:21,889
but he was granted his powers
after long years of praying.

39
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:26,018
When I gain power like Marok's
to vanquish evil spirits,

40
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,103
I'll be able to live among the angels,

41
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:30,731
and we'll never have
to be separated again.

42
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:32,483
Don't do it.

43
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:35,068
Don't even think about it.

44
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,030
What?

45
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:43,577
Don't try to change for me
by saying dangerous prayers.

46
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,078
I don't want that.

47
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:47,790
I like you
for who you are right now, Ogwi.

48
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,042
Why don't we

49
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,045
just tell everyone about us?

50
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:55,172
Don't be absurd.

51
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:58,050
They wouldn't understand
even if we told them.

52
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,260
Why haven't you told them
if it's that simple?

53
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,387
So do you want to keep sneaking around?

54
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,097
That's why I'm willing to pray--

55
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,182
Stop!

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,268
You want to be an angel?

57
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:10,687
You have no idea

58
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:14,817
how dangerous it is to fight evil spirits.

59
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:22,115
Sneaking around like this
is just as risky.

60
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,743
Kangji already knows about us.

61
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,541
Mirr.

62
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,043
Have faith in me.

63
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,255
Even if God ignores my prayers

64
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:39,716
and the other angels disapprove of us,
nothing will change.

65
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,971
My feelings for you won't change.

66
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,608
Soon, the black moon will rise,

67
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,944
and the Hellmouth will open right after.

68
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:01,530
Spread the word

69
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,032
and divide the angels.

70
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:19,590
You're here.

71
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:04,092
I've started praying.
You said it yourself. Marok is human,

72
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:06,928
but he was granted his powers
after long years of praying.

73
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,182
When I gain power like Marok's
to vanquish evil spirits,

74
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:12,517
I'll be able to live among the angels,

75
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,270
and we'll never have
to be separated again.

76
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,754
Are you the one

77
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,840
who's been hovering around me?

78
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:48,345
Why have you been watching me?

79
00:07:58,355 --> 00:07:59,356
Because

80
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:02,359
I thought you might be different

81
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:04,903
from other humans.

82
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,198
Why are you being foolishly stubborn?

83
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,909
It's not like God
will answer your prayers.

84
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,454
You're nothing more
than a powerless human.

85
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,416
Do you seriously believe

86
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:20,961
God would entrust a mere human
with ultimate power

87
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,840
that could shift the balance of the world?

88
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:27,884
If you wish to be with Mirr,

89
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,220
there's only one path.

90
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:34,599
Abandon your fragile human form

91
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,769
and gain power greater
than that of the angels.

92
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,481
Rather than obeying the angels,

93
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,360
make them follow your orders.

94
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,284
Want my help?

95
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,121
Who are you?

96
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:02,002
Humans call your god Light…

97
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,547
and me…

98
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:10,469
Darkness.

99
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,805
Ogwi,

100
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:17,225
I'll grant you a new life.

101
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,684
<i>Why should I?</i>

102
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:07,818
Tell me why I should do as you say.

103
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:08,985
Enough!

104
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,654
Those are his orders.

105
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:12,781
Have you forgotten

106
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:15,992
how you went from a mere human
to a being with power?

107
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:18,745
The scattered angels
have located the Hellmouth

108
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,997
and have begun to gather.

109
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,874
We can't handle them all,

110
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:25,919
but as long as we have Mirr's soul,

111
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:29,089
they won't be able to merge their powers.

112
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,757
Even at the Hellmouth,

113
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,176
they'll be helpless.

114
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:36,388
- If we don't stop them now--
- "We"?

115
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,234
"We"?

116
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,704
Know your place.

117
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:03,957
You're nothing but a worthless high priest
who lent your powerless body

118
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,043
to Darkness and cast some petty spells.

119
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:12,132
Don't you think it's absurd of you
to think that we're equals

120
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,843
just because we share a goal?

121
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,890
Don't get cocky and heed my words.

122
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:23,101
Your only task

123
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,606
is to take orders from me
and preserve that pitiful life you have.

124
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,108
From this point forward,

125
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,612
don't even try to walk in my shadow.

126
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,990
Keep your distance
and follow me in silence.

127
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:21,743
It's been a while.

128
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:26,623
Are you here alone?

129
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,292
Why did you betray us?

130
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,215
I asked why you betrayed us!

131
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:39,302
I got bored.

132
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,805
What?

133
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,473
I grew tired

134
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,809
of being stuck within the fence
built by God.

135
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,187
What about Mirr?

136
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:56,987
I only chose to live the way I want to.

137
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,906
Nothing has changed.

138
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,410
What are you doing?

139
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:04,619
Kill her already.

140
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,340
Come back with me.

141
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:19,551
Taesan will surely help you.

142
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:22,345
It's still not too late to ask
for God's forgiveness.

143
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,930
Forgiveness?

144
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:27,142
I prayed for countless days.

145
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:29,894
Your God is the one who abandoned me,

146
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:33,356
and your filthy rules
that divide angels from humans

147
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:36,192
destroyed my everything.

148
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:44,784
I'll ask you one last time.

149
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:47,579
Come back with me, Ogwi.

150
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:51,916
For Mirr's sake.

151
00:13:57,047 --> 00:14:00,008
- Stay still like that…

152
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:02,969
…for this is the last time
I spare your life for Mirr's sake.

153
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:16,149
Ogwi, no.

154
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,694
No, it can't be.

155
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,029
No…

156
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:23,031
No, you can't.

157
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,159
Ogwi, please.

158
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:34,042
Mirr!

159
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,338
It's dangerous to go alone.

160
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:39,547
Unbelievable.

161
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:42,133
Ogwi…

162
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,152
You fool.

163
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:13,553
Why did you come back here?

164
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:17,348
Your memories…

165
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,184
are back.

166
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:28,568
So much has changed

167
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,112
that I couldn't tell where I was anymore.

168
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:34,198
This was the only place I could recall.

169
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,997
I'll get Chief.

170
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,877
Running away like last time…

171
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,635
It won't do anyone any good.

172
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:58,181
Will I be confined again then?

173
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:13,196
Why did you make such a choice back then?

174
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,868
Why did you betray us
and stand with evil spirits?

175
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,244
I betrayed you?

176
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,539
That must be
how you self-absorbed angels saw it.

177
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,417
All I wanted was to…

178
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,179
Forget it.

179
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:41,307
It doesn't matter anymore.

180
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,611
Mirr.

181
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:08,418
TAESAN BUILDING

182
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,024
Let's go.

183
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:46,664
Help!

184
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,500
- Get them.

185
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,084
- It's okay.

188
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,310
I quit protecting humans long ago.

189
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,561
You know that.

190
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:53,606
If evil spirits return…

191
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,318
…you'll protect us
like you did in the past.

192

00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:37,942
It's a mess.

198
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:49,453
- Stop the van.
- What? What about Mirr?

199
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:50,955
- Pull over already.

200
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:09,807
Chief, I smell something nasty
from over there.

201
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,048
Got it.

202
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:45,593
Don't kill the evil spirits.
We can turn them back into humans!

203
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,223
Noted.

204
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:52,892
I'll be gentle.

205
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,311
Be gentle!

206
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,257
This way.

207
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:35,184
I believe we paid back
the loan we took out.

208
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,561
So what are you doing here, sir?

209
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:38,854
Let us in.

210
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:41,065
The boss isn't around right now.

211
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,858
I'm not here for him.

212
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:45,319
He really isn't here.

213
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:47,947
- We need to get back there.
- Please come back next time.

214
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:28,988
This liquor is very expensive
and hard to come by.

215
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,239
Huh?

216
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:31,574
Yangsu…

217
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,035
- …is this whiskey or cognac?

218
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:36,704
Hard liquor is basically whiskey.

219
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:40,291
Alcohol was my major in school, babe.

220
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,585
- Were you in school?
- Of course.

221
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,670
I was in school for 15 years,

222
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:48,257
located in different parts of the country.

223
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,009
You were in school for a long time.

224
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,635
Was it a PhD program?

225
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,765
Sora, shall we stop drinking now?

226
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,933
- Hmm?
- Why? I'm loving it.

227
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:01,353
What's with the ruckus?

228
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:03,022
See what's going on.

229
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,106
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

230
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:09,070
- What the hell?

231
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,875
Who is this punk?

232
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,627
- Move him.
- Of course.

233
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,004
Nice punch.

234
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,423
I told you Hyeonggyu
was a boxing champion.

235
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:31,592
That was nothing, boss.

236
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:39,850
Babe.

237
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,730
- What the hell?

238
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,777
What the hell?

239
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,684
Why? Where are you going?

240
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:24,061
- Mr. Taesan!
- Babe!

241
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:26,564
Something's off about them.

242
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,148
- Over there.

243
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:29,567
Look at them!

244
00:27:34,572 --> 00:27:35,906
Look at their eyes!

245
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:39,076
- You'll take them on?

246
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,526
Oh, what the heck?

247
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,452
Kangji, are there more?

248
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,287
That was all of them, Chief.

249
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:28,334
Moving forward, I'll be at your service.

250
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,960
- Don't be.
- Bow. What?

251
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,964
I know a lot of boys
who could take out a loan.

252
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,507
I like the sound of that,

253
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,176
but stay inside for now.

254
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,636
- What?
- Let's hurry.

255
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,220
- Sure, Chief.
- Absolutely, boss.

256
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:42,139
- Thank you, boss.
- Have a good one.

257
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,808
- Bow.
- Got it.

Kangji, are you sure they're here?

261
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,710
Yes, I'm sure.
The pendant is responding to the energy,

262
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:51,103
and I could never forget Ogwi's scent.

263
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:53,439
He's around here.

264
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:24,136
Bastard.

265
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,791
Where's Mirr?

266
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:30,168
She's in danger.

267
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:32,394
Samin took her.

268
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:34,798
He likely left for the Hellmouth,

269
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:38,442
and with Mirr's soul,
he'll obtain real power.

270
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:41,221
You're the only ones who can reseal

271
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,655
the Hellmouth.

272
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:45,976
I have a favor to ask.

273
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,911
Please stall some time so I can recover.

274
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:55,334
I'll take care of the rest.

281
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,176
Our brothers and sisters…

282
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,761
Chief, how…

283
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:33,180
Guys?

284
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,351
This isn't right.
How were they brought back to life?

285
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:40,688
They appear to be under Samin's control.

286
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,150
Summon your weapons.

287
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:47,278
But Chief, they're our siblings.

288
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:48,821
We need to stop them for now.

289
00:37:58,497 --> 00:38:00,374
I need to take care of Samin first.

290
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,418
Hold them off.

- Still…

292
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:05,838
Still, how could we…

293
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:08,132
You heard Chief.

294
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:11,844
Hold them off for now.

295
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:32,192
Chief,

296
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:33,694
we'll be right behind.

297
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:34,778
Sure.

298
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:16,195
Hanu!

299
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:44,932
Are you all okay?

300
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:47,393
I can't bring myself to hurt Yangmi.

301
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:48,894
Hanu's too strong.

302
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,229
Doni, keep him distracted.

303
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:52,314
Stop them the best you can.

304
00:43:06,305 --> 00:43:10,601
Join me,
and you'll acquire even greater power.

305
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:12,603
You'll be unstoppable.

306
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:25,824
How's that for an answer?
