Are you tired already?

00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,800
How can you be wiped out
before we've even started?

192
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,884
Get up already.

196

It's your first time working out with us.

197
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,568
Seriously, this is why I kept telling you
to exercise regularly.

198
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,655
Your body's giving up
since it's not used to physical activity.

Don't worry, Kangji.
Well begun is half done.

I warmed up today,
so I'll run with you tomorrow.

Tomorrow?

Are you saying you're leaving?

00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,499
Yes. Why?

204
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,502
Then you'll have woken up early
for nothing.

205

It's fine.

00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,798

Early breakfast is the best.

207
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,802

211

Why don't you just join me
for some ramyeon too?

212
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,188
You can work out later if you want.

213
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,482
We didn't come here to eat.

214
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,944
Malsook, why are you so snappy?

215
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,155
Because you keep muttering nonsense.

216
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,073
It must be because you're hungry.

217
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,325
- All the more reason to have ramyeon.
- [sighs]

218
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,121
Just go.

219
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,041
Leave without saying another word.

220
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,171
Kangji, I'll be at the convenience store
eating ramyeon,

221
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,214
so come by if you get hungry.

222
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,593
[chuckles] Sure. I'll meet you there
after the run, so enjoy for now.

Ah. Remember,
running isn't supposed to be work.

230

Let's keep it light today.

231

Don't be a baby like Doni.

232
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,407
Also, take that off when running.

233
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,201
That doesn't even work.

234
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,954
How can I,
when I've had this with me forever?

235
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,831
I know why you're wearing it.

236
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,543
You're wearing it in case
something happens to humans.

237
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,296
But the Hellmouth was sealed ages ago.

238
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,925
Don't forget why we live
in these human forms.

239
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,594
And stop dwelling on negative thoughts.

240
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,888
Let's pick up the pace.

241

Already? Hey!

00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,561
Not yet. I haven't even warmed up.

244
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,896
[Malsook] We're not out for a stroll.

245
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,231

How could I have bad blood with someone
when I've never been disliked?

Bangwool and I

[Doni] Don't be tempted by human food.

when I'm a pig, you ask? Listen up.

257
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,310
A pig's body fat percentage
is only about 13 to 15%.

258
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,229
By human standards,

259
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,857
pigs are lean and muscular. Got it?

[dog barking]

261
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,734
What was that?

262
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,196
Contrary to what I believe,
calluses on my toes don't count as muscle?

263
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,326
Look, what I have is 100% fat.

264
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,954
What do you think that means?

265
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,873
It means I'm not a pig.

266
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,376
God just gave me the abilities of a pig.

267
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,712

you ask?

00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,347
You want me to stop oinking
and give you a piece of the sundae?

Your dog's been barking at me
for some sundae,

calling me a pig.

What? Do you even hear yourself?

00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,955
I have the ability to read minds, you see.

279

Stop barking nonsense!

280
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,043

What are you doing? Just get lost, mister.

283
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,300
Why are you yelling at my precious dog?

284
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,344
- It barked nonsense at me.
- Leave it!

285
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,887
We're so sorry.

286

We're really sorry.
Please accept our apology.

when he's hungry.

What?

292
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,444
We brought you here to run,
not to cause trouble.

293
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,196
[Doni] I didn't cause any trouble.

294
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,907

So sorry.

298

You get it, right?

299
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,961
You know we'd lose
if we went up against a pig.

I'm so sorry.

Doni, Chief said
not to interact with humans.

I'm not the one
who actively interacted with a human.

You're having pork belly
and sundae for breakfast?

00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,130
What?

356
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,591
The years we've lived
could never be put into words.

357
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,511
So anyway, whose birthday is it?

358
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,931
[Jwidol] Wait, is it Bangwool's birthday?

359
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,101
"RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD"

360
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,644
Is that your ID card?

361
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,605
Goodness.

362
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,483
- Let's see it.
- [Doni] You still have that?

363
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,610
What era is this even from?

364
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,570
- Let me see.
- I'll get you a new one tomorrow.

365
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,739
[Wonseung] Give it here.

367
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,492
She needs to take a new photo first.

368
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,327
This is what I see.

369
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,828
In this photo,

370
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,332
she looks like a country bumpkin
snapping her first picture in the city.

371
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,959
Right? Don't you agree?

372
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,337

373
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,172

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,551
Oh…

376
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,137
What did she say?

377
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,598
- [Doni] You're to stop by the clinic.
- Why?

378
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,936
There's a strong medicinal herb
that can blind you and numb your tongue.

00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,700
Wonseung, as if you're any different.

384
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,577
- Check this out.
- What?

385
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,330
- What is it? Let me see.
- [laughing]

386
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,082
[Malsook] He looks like a total clown!

387
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,210
How so? That's decent enough.

388
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,753
That's actually pretty recent.

389
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,339
- [Wonseung] Hey!
- Check these out.

390
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,674
[Kangji] That's nasty.

391
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,883
Come on!

392
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,510
- Seriously?
- Stop it!

393
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,888

Are you here by yourself?

401
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,020
From across the room,
you looked so sexy sipping that wine.

402
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,355
I'd love to drink with you.
What do you say?

Are you a dog person?

00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,167
At my table, there's someone
who turns into one when he's drunk.

408
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,543
Want to go watch?

409
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:42,963
Leave.

00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,466

These lights are a little too bright,

420
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,861
so how about a cozy drink
back at my place?

00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,698
I've got expensive booze at home.
Let's go.

Samin.

431
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,931
What were you doing
while humans were flourishing?

432
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,979
Did you just toss aside your mission

433
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,981
to turn the world into hell?

434
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,859
My hands were tied.

435
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,154
After Haetae died
and the Hellmouth closed,

436
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,488
I lost all my powers.

437
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,616
I clung to life with everything I had

438
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,243
to look for you.

439
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,290
Of course. As if a high priest
would actually have any real power.

440
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,667

I need your help, Ogwi.

00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,312
You said the angels were still alive.

446
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,898
Even I can't take them on.

447
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,026
The angels lost their powers
and now live in human forms.

448
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,906
Besides, I'll give you power
even greater than what you already have.

449

450
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
How?

451
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,039
You can sense Haetae's energy.

452
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,958
I saw it with my own eyes.

453
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,045
The day Haetae was killed
by Taesan and the angels,

454
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,256
he left behind three soul stones.

455
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,842
Once you gather the soul stones

456
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,261
and feed their energy
into the Dragon Soul,

457
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,388
which oversees the energy
of angels and demons,

458
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,266
you can revive Haetae's power.

459

That power…

460
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,689
will be yours, Ogwi.

00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,752
You can trust me.

00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,673
This is also my last shot
at becoming immortal.

Why not?

Dalgi appeared in my dream yesterday,

477
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,149
and Dalgi's chicken friends rushed
into my arms.

478
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,694
I'm skipping chicken today
because it makes me think of Dalgi.

She's right. Just eat what's here
and don't complain

482

about being hungry later.

483
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,621
Got it.

484
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,540
Where's Chief?
Should we be eating while he works?

485
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,793
Maybe we should get him some.
He's looking thinner these days.

- Why didn't he take me with him?

I'd love to knock the hell
out of those thugs.

491

He'll be bringing in loads today alone.

492
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,104
What's the point
when he doesn't spend any?

493

00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,494
There will still be one left.

It's a promise.

Yes, of course.

I didn't make an appointment,
but I'm out of medication.

00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,291
Mr. Taesan's here to see you.

536
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,001
- Please let him in.
- Sure.

537
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,881
You're here.

538
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,716
I ran out of medication.

539
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,052
My chest feels tight,
and I'm struggling to breathe.

540
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,137
I'm out of medication.

544
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,521
Let's start with a brief consultation.

545
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,773
Your complexion looks much better.

546
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,901
My sessions and follow-ups
must be working.

547
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,985
Right.

548
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,029
No, they're completely useless.

549
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,990
Still, sessions with me
will help improve--

550
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,576
- No, I haven't gotten better.
- Not even a little bit?

551
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,036
None at all.

552
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,081
You need time to battle depression--

553
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,332
I need medication.

554
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,294
Sir.

555
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,049
If you're still not improving
under the care

556
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,843
of a talented doctor like me,

557
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,387
it means you don't fully trust me,
your doctor.

558
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,815
I'll prescribe a two-month supply,
as usual. Please relax and wait here.

559
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:25,569
[grunts]

560
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,822
Should I dim the lights for you?

561
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,906
Sure.

You can trust me.

566
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,100
This is also my last shot
at becoming immortal.

567
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,520
So that's what you're after.

568
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:03,899
[sighs]

569
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:05,901
If you

570
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,528
try anything stupid…

571
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,367
I'll rip your head from your body.

572
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,915
It's still not too late
to get rid of Ogwi.

573
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,669
Do you want to die
before we even open the Hellmouth?

574
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,590
Ogwi's the only one
who can find the soul stones.

575
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,386
We'll change the plan.

The exhibition, which showcased relics
that were previously not shown to public

597
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,401
and artifacts
with high preservation value,

598
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:38,238
attracted greater interest than usual.

599

600
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,409
Ms. Mirr, who dedicated
so much time to the exhibition,

601
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,705
along with the team members,
you all did a fantastic job.

602
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,415
Nice work, everyone.

603
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,168
- [worker] Good job.
- [worker 2] Nicely done.

605

[chuckles]

607
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,139
No way.

608
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,683
How does this make sense?

609
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,685
Evil spirits rising
after thousands of years?

610
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,271
I just talked to Marok. He's on his way.

611
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,397
Where's Chief?

612
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,482
- I'm calling him.
- [line ringing]

What if this is for real?

614
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:21,156
We're no different from any other humans.
How are we supposed to fight them?

[scoffs]

616
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:24,993
He's not picking up.

617
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,204
I have a location.
We'll know more when we get there.

618
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:32,125
Will we be okay?
Chief will have our heads for this.

619
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,628
If this is real, getting scolded
is the least of our worries.

620
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,756
Let's get going.

621
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,299
