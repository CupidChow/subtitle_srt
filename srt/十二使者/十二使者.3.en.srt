Mirr!

00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,247
Malsook!

00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:35,582
Malsook…

00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:19,876
Mirr.

Marok.

9
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,215
Evil spirits have reemerged.

10
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:27,717
How could that be?

11
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:30,428
Let's get out of here.

12
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:43,525
Come on.

13
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:59,666
- Oh! Malsook, are you okay?

14
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:04,087
Marok, they're too strong.

15
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,633
We can't take them on now.

16
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,429
I see. For now,

17
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:15,682
let's get out of here. Come on.

19
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,328
Marok, behind you!

20
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,921
Samin?

21
00:05:58,886 --> 00:05:59,971
Kangji.

22
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,681
Kangji, are you all right?

23
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,558
I'm fine, it's not that bad.

24
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,103
All right.

25
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:11,024
Doni, call Bangwool
and have her treat Kangji.

26
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,191
Sure, Marok.

27
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,194
Let's all head home.

28
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:16,738
- Kangji, let's go.
- Sure.

29
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,324
Let's hurry home.

30
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:22,285
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

31
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:23,578
Marok.

32
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:27,415
Evil spirits have reemerged, haven't they?

33
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,502
I can't say. I'm not sure what's going on.

34
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,254
Let's go.

35
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,048
Sure.

36
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:45,558
Wonseung, let's go.

37
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:46,643
What?

38
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,312
Sure. But hold on.

39
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:52,440
I can feel a familiar energy.

40
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:02,075
Marok,

41
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,120
you saw something
from the evil spirit, didn't you?

42
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:11,668
Well, I can't be sure of it just yet.

43
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:15,004
Taesan must be waiting, so let's go.

44
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:16,589
Sure.

45
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,398
It's been a while,

46
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:35,858

Chief. Bangwool, can you tend to Kangji?

50
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:31,289
I'll get going.

51
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:41,382
It'll be all right.

What's that smell?

54
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,397
I see.

55
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:40,358
- Kangji, that paste was made…
- Hmm?

56
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,111
…with the venom of a rattlesnake
and medicinal herbs.

57
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:44,862
It'll heal your wound in no time.

58
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,573
Thanks, Bangwool.

59
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:01,420
That hurts. I said that hurts!

60
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:03,506
That really hurts!

61
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:09,512
I see.

62
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:14,100
Malsook, you kicked so much
that your pelvis got twisted.

63
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:18,104
It's my wrist.

64
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:32,952
Got it. Mirr, she says you'll be fine.

65
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,121
Right. Thanks, Bangwool.

66
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,715
Where are you going?

67
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:54,140
I'll be back.

68
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,454
This must be a treasure trove
of all things healthy.

69
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:27,757
Having all of these to herself
explains her flawless skin.

70
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:49,070
Oh…

71
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:52,198
Mmm…

72
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:53,282
That's tasty.

73
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:58,913
No way. This will go great with beer.

74
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:03,251
This is really good.

75
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:05,670
I'll take this

76
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:07,880
and some of this.

77
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,848
Bangwool, what was that for?

78
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:19,934
What?

79
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:21,477
I shouldn't breathe?

80
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,980
How can I not breathe?

81
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,068
That left a mark.

82
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:47,795
I didn't know.

83
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:48,879
I'm sorry.

84
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:54,802
This doesn't seem to be doing anything.

85
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:56,554
Can I try turning this knob?

86
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,349
- Okay, here we go.

87
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:01,892
Good. A little more.

88
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:05,980
Bangwool!

89
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,113
I just…

90
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:18,576
- What's this for?

91
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:23,539
Marok, have you located the evil spirits?

92
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,126
No, not yet.

93
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,296
Chief.

94
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,175
This is urgent,
and we should spread out to locate them.

95
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:35,885
I told you to stay out of it.

96
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:38,721
Don't make me repeat myself.

97
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,097
But, Chief…

98
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:42,391
You'd think differently
if you had seen them.

99
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:46,020
Exactly. Anyway, I don't get
how evil spirits could have reemerged.

100
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:49,315
Marok, when the Hellmouth was sealed,

101
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,776
didn't the evil spirits without power
vanish too?

102
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,447
That's right. They were sealed away
along with your powers.

103
00:13:57,656 --> 00:14:00,534
Even if Kangji manages
to locate the evil spirits,

104
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:04,163
we still stand no chance against them
in these human forms.

105
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:05,915
We can't do anything about it,

106
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:07,374
since God decided

107
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,294
to balance the power
between good and evil.

108
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,714
Still, we'll have to figure out a way.

109
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:18,636
Fighting those evil spirits
for the first time in ages made it clear

110
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,388
that we may not age like humans,

111
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:23,057
but we're just as powerless.

112
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,353
Before they harm humans, we must--

113
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,980
Rather than sticking
our necks out for humans,

114
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:34,527
we'll focus on keeping
only this family safe.

115
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:41,200
Still, these are evil spirits
we're talking about.

116
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:45,037
Chief,

117
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:47,748
can I say something?

118
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:53,003
Honestly, it's been a long time.

119
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:58,300
Because you were constantly in pain
over what happened,

120
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:02,388
we followed your lead and did as told,
but this is way too irresponsible of you.

121
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,477
The purpose of our existence
is to protect humans.

122
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,730
That's the duty we should honor
to the very end.

123
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,566
Kangji, come on.

124
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:15,776
So?

125
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,282
We protected humans
for thousands of years, but for what?

126
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:23,868
You see,

127
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:26,328
even God has abandoned us.

128
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:28,873
Look at what we've become.

129
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:38,716
I refuse to uphold that duty
if it means losing my family.

130
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:42,219
You're not the only one grieving
their deaths!

131
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:45,723
Stop acting like
you're the only one who cares.

132
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:48,517
- What?
- I mourn those we lost,

133
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:50,895
but we should still stay true
to who we are.

134
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:53,522
I'm willing to die
while protecting humans.

135
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:55,316
Watch it, Kangji!

136
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:57,985
Both of you, that's enough.

137
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:06,285
Listen.

138
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,333
I refuse to lose anyone else.

139
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,837
Protect us, Chief.

140
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,549
Then we'll protect humans.

141
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,094
Duty or not…

142
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:28,516
that's why we exist.

143
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,054
Jwidol.

144
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:10,849
Didn't you make something
to track drug dealers?

145
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,268
Yes, Marok.

146
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:14,186
Good.

147
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,690
- Wonseung.
- Yes?

148
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:19,441
A word.

149
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:36,458
Ah…

150
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:44,258
Anyway, what did you want to talk about?

151
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:48,554
Well,

152
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,267
didn't you sense an odd vibe earlier?

153
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,852
Of course, I did.

154
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:58,147
Why did Kangji have
to tick off Chief like that?

155
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:02,401
His hatred for humans is nothing new.

156
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:03,569
Tell me about it.

157
00:18:03,652 --> 00:18:09,575
Meanwhile, out of all of us,
Kangji is particularly fond of humans.

158
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:11,785
I mean,

159
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:14,413
evil spirits are causing us
distress as is,

160
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,290
so why are we fighting each other?

161
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,170
- Wonseung.

162
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,339
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

163
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:26,175
Didn't you see that earlier?

164
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:28,761
Of course, I did.

165
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:31,597
Chief's eyes were burning with anger.

166
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,308
I'm talking about
how Taesan was looking at you.

167
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:40,272
Didn't you get the sense that he wanted

168
00:18:41,148 --> 00:18:43,567
to ask you a favor?

169
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:49,490
- What?
- Taesan knows he should help humans,

170
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,742
but wanting to do right by the rest of you

171
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:55,037
keeps him from taking the lead
in this matter.

172
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,581
That's why he looked at you

173
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:01,377
like he was pleading for you
to find those evil spirits.

174
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,379
He was pleading with his eyes.

175
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:06,298
- He wants me to step in for him?
- That's right.

176
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:09,093
What do you think that means?

177
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,888
He obviously sees you

178
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:16,266
- as the next chief.

179
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:19,603
The next chief? Me?

180
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,021
Exactly.

181
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:25,150
Taesan may be a big guy on the outside,

182
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:27,069
but he's actually quite shy.

183
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:29,780
- Right.
- Would it kill him

184
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,907
to just ask for favors out loud?

185
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,284
Why does he do it with his eyes?

186
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:37,037
He always lets his gaze speak for him.

187
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:46,130
Wonseung.

188
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:47,214
Yes?

189
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:50,884
Here's to becoming the chief.

190
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:49,229
We'll join you in time.

191
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:44,826
The one who awakened the evil spirits

192
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,119
is Samin.

193
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,373
Samin?

194
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,457
That's right.

195
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:53,710
The high priest who turned Haetae
into an evil spirit.

196
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:56,880
He still lives.

197
00:23:56,964 --> 00:23:59,299
But he's a human. How is that possible?

198
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,426
It's not, so I should look into it.

199
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,806
Either way, I'll say this now.

200
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,808
Leave my kids out of this.

201
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:08,976
Taesan.

202
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,894
Our purpose

203
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,523
is to help the human world.

204
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:16,149
And I should protect my family.

205
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:19,194
We're just ordinary humans now.

206
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:21,405
We have no power to fight evil spirits.

207
00:24:22,948 --> 00:24:23,949
Taesan.

208
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:26,076
Sacrificing to protect humans?

209
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:28,829
That's pointless.

210
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:46,805
TAESAN BUILDING

211
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,931
So, how are you feeling?

212
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:35,729
Though it's long overdue,

213
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:38,815
I'm thankful you returned.

214
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,526
Sorry it took me so long.

215
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,737
Don't say that.

216
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,073
<i>I refuse</i>

217
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:30,826
to lose anyone else.

218
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:32,536
Protect us, Chief.

219
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,704
Then we'll protect humans.

220
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:37,082
Duty or not,

221
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,252
that's why we exist.

222
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,164
GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD

223
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:19,583
It's Mr. Taesan.

224
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:29,301
What's all this?

225
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,177
Let me buy it.

226
00:27:32,262 --> 00:27:34,389
- What…
- What are you talking about?

227
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:37,475
Let me buy this food cart from you.

228
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:39,769
Mr. Taesan…

229
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,483
Here.

230
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:50,030
It could get dangerous,
so stay out of the country for a while.

231
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:16,264
Here.

232
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:17,349
Thanks.

233
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:21,353
If you press the red button,
the surrounding area will appear

234
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,146
- in green on the map.
- Okay.

235
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:25,899
If there's an irregularity,
orange spot will show.

236
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:28,777
I see. Sounds easy enough.

237
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,572
What task did Marok assign you
that requires this device?

238
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,657
What?

239
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:35,659
Well…

240
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:39,287
Well, he's after… Yes, drugs.

241
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:43,375
He's gearing up
for a crackdown on drug offenders

242
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,377
and asked me to lend a hand.

243
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,628
Really?

244
00:28:47,754 --> 00:28:49,381
- Why you, though?

245
00:28:49,464 --> 00:28:50,966
Who else could he ask?

246
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:53,593
I'm the only one
who's good at this kind of thing.

247
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:54,678
Don't you agree?

248
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,972
Unbelievable.

249
00:28:57,055 --> 00:28:58,473
Something feels off.

250
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:00,600
Red…

251
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:06,398
Seriously, does this thing even work?

252
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:29,973
Hey, Bangwool.

253
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:33,518
I'm glad you're practicing,
but do I have to hold this up?

254
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:35,354
I trust you, of course,

255
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:37,856
but that was pretty intense.

256
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,159
Bangwool, wait!

257
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,985
What do you mean,
nervousness helps you focus?

258
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:54,956
It's best to practice relaxed, Bangwool.

259
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:02,464
No, the apple's too risky.

260
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:03,548
Aim at this instead.

261
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,635
Geez.

262
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,221
Be careful.

263
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,687
- Bangwool, wait. I'm getting a call.

264
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:18,939
Just a second.

265
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,154
Why did you shoot
when I was getting a call?

266
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:28,865
I told you the apple was too risky!

267
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:32,285
Aim at this instead.

268
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:34,704
Practice with this, okay?

269
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:37,833
- A black stone?
- That's right.

270
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,670
It's the only relic missing
from the recent discoveries.

271
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,089
That's the stone.

272
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:50,345
What on earth is that?

273
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,686
Was there any other damage?

274
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:00,063
No, that's all they took.

275
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:05,569
- Sir.
- Yes?

276
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:07,195
You should see this.

277
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,791
- Sir.
- Yes?

278
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,168
I think you're getting a call.

279
00:31:31,928 --> 00:31:34,347
- Hey, Wonseung. Found anything?
- <i>Marok.</i>

280
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:36,016
<i>Well,</i>

281
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:39,895
I don't think the device
Jwidol gave works.

282
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:41,646
Nothing's showing up on it.

283
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,900
Still, keep scanning the whole area.

284
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:49,779
I remember that's where the evil spirits
first started emerging.

285
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:52,657
Shouldn't we tell Chief?

286
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:55,202
I said I'd take
full responsibility for this,

287
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:57,287
so just do as I say.

288
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,790
I'm worried Chief will be mad at me.

289
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:03,335
Remember what I told you?

290
00:32:04,586 --> 00:32:08,507
Who is set to eventually become
Taesan's successor?

291
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,968
- <i>You know that can only be you, Wonseung.</i>

292
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:14,513
Besides, Taesan hates this sort of thing.

293
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:15,597
<i>Of course.</i>

294
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,725
If you can locate the evil spirits first

295
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:21,102
and prevent war, this world…

296
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:25,941
<i>You'll be a true angel</i>
<i>who saves this world,</i>

297
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:27,567
<i>as you should be.</i>

298
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:33,031
I have to sacrifice myself
for everyone, don't I?

299
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,368
Yes, do just that.

300
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:38,245
That's my burden to bear.

301
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,248
- <i>This must be the path of a chief.</i>

302
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:43,625
That's it. Bear the burden.

303
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:46,503
<i>I mean it. You're the only angel</i>
<i>who can do this.</i>

304
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:49,548
Of course.
Becoming chief is no easy path--

305
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:52,300
What was that, Detective Kim?

306
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,678
Sure, I'll be right in.

307
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:58,974
Wonseung, they're asking for me.
We'll talk again later.

308
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:01,643
Don't forget. Make some sacrifices.
All right, bye.

309
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,478
- Hello? Marok?

310
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,273
He must be busy.

311
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,944
This is exhausting.

312
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,072
Ah…

313
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,326
I should have one of these.

314
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:23,665
Mmm…

315
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,292
Mmm!

316
00:33:28,587 --> 00:33:30,380
That boosted my energy.

317
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,385
Let's carry on.

318
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:58,158
Mirr, are you bored?

319
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,746
We're almost there, so hang tight.

320
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,290
Where are we going?

321
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:08,084
A place you'll also love.

322
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:26,019

323
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:28,563

324
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:37,030
- Kids, hi!
- Hi!

325
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:38,156
I'll take that.

326
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:40,533
Mirr, come on. Let's head inside.

327
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,912
Have you been well? You've gotten taller.

328
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:45,080
- Let's go inside.
- Sure.

329
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:46,957
Don't rush. One at a time.

330
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:02,305
Let me refill your glass, Mr. Taesan.

331
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:05,100
Don't stand up.
Others might get the wrong idea.

332
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:06,267
How could I?

333
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:08,186
I know my manners.

334
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:10,855
I guess you're right.

335
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:13,942
{\an8}"SEOUL AIRLINES"

336
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:16,987
Why did you bring the bag back?

337
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:20,281
I can't take this money.

338
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:23,994
You could all be at risk
if something happens.

339
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:26,246
I understand your concern,

340
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,000
but I can't abandon my mom's food cart
and leave the country.

341
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:34,504
You, of all people,
know how hard my mom fought to keep it.

342
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:45,473
What's taking him so long?

343
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:48,143
He's still got five minutes.

344
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,783
- Oh…

345
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:24,804
Hey, Chief.

346
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:27,724
What exactly happened?

347
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:30,018
Do you remember the thug
who borrowed money from us

348
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:32,270
to buy land in the marketplace?

349
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:34,022
Yongpal, the boss of the Samgeori gang.

350
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:36,024
Sure, Yongpal, the boss
of the Samgeori gang.

351
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:38,485
Anyway, he duped Ssangkal,
the boss of the Jongno gang,

352
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:40,487
and took off with his money.

353
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,990
In retaliation, the Jongno gang is tearing
up the market and forcing everyone out,

354
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:45,408
claiming they'll open bars.

355
00:36:45,492 --> 00:36:49,162
The Samgeori gang's boss, Yongpal,
bought the marketplace land with my loan.

356
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:52,415
Until he pays me back, the land is mine.

357
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:55,001
The Jongno gang has already
taken over the marketplace.

358
00:36:55,877 --> 00:37:00,131
This is hurting the vendors there,
so we should probably do something.

359
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,008
I'm worried people will get hurt.

360
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:05,345
Why are you guys working like this?

361
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:08,932
I told you to focus only on what's ours

362
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:10,683
and pay no attention to the humans.

363
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:16,397
Let's go and get my land back.

364
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:19,734
Guys, let's go.

365
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:23,738
Chief, wait for us.

366
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,410
What are they doing?

367
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,162
Don't do that.

368
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:33,248
Oh, dear.

369
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,541
"GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD"

370
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:43,591
Lady, I told you
to pack up and leave ages ago.

371
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:45,093
It's best for all of us

372
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:48,304
if you leave quietly
while we're still being nice.

373
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:50,682
- Damn you!

374
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:53,184
Damn it, woman. Get lost already.

375
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:54,769
- Okay.
- Would you rather crawl out?

376
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:57,730
- I'll leave, okay?
- Be gentle, will you?

377
00:37:57,814 --> 00:37:58,857
Why you…

378
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:00,775
Come on.

379
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:04,737
- We've struggled against them enough.
- Oh?

380
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:06,489
- Let's go.
- You.

381
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:07,740
Haven't we met before?

382
00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:09,367
As if.

383
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,452
- I know you from somewhere.
- Geumsoon.

384
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:15,456
Would you look at that?
You're like two peas in a pod.

385
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:19,294
That glare is straight-up the same.

386
00:38:20,503 --> 00:38:24,048
I see you only learned
the nastiest things from your mom.

387
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:27,468
Hey, since the mom's busy,

388
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,220
teach the daughter a lesson.

389
00:38:32,974 --> 00:38:35,018
All right, people. Over here.

390
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:36,352
- What now?
- Who's he?

391
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:38,146
- Excuse us.
- What now?

392
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:41,941
Kim Yongpal of the Samgeori gang
put this land up as collateral,

393
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:45,403
and Angel Loans will be taking over
as of today.

394
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:46,487
What the heck?

395
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:49,908
Everything here,
down to the tiniest item, is ours,

396
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:52,493
and you'll get hurt if you touch anything.

397
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:56,039
You folks of the Jongno gang,

398
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:58,458
please make a swift exit this way.

399
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:02,795
Hold on. Which one of you is Ssangkal?

400
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:09,844
Oh, there you are.

401
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:11,471
Got it. Noted.

402
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:13,264
Good.

403
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:16,601
Boys, take them out.

404
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,812
- We're up.
- Sure.

405
00:39:34,244 --> 00:39:35,912
- What was that?
- Hold on.

406
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:45,421
You again?

407
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:47,715
I knew it.

408
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:50,134
Unbelievable.

409
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:51,219
Do you know me?

410
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:09,779
I told you to be good, you punk.

411
00:40:10,697 --> 00:40:12,490
You were a bandit in a past life.

412
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:15,368
I'll be good from now on.

413
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:18,413
My liver…

414
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:47,358
If evil spirits return,

415
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,154
you'll protect us
like you did in the past.

416
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,790
Would you like a refill?

417
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,667
Sure.

418
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:09,547
You probably have sore knees,
so stop getting up like that.

419
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,132
- I'm okay.
- Thanks.

420
00:41:16,596 --> 00:41:19,724
By the way, are you two together?

421
00:41:21,017 --> 00:41:22,393
What are you saying, mister?

422
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:25,229
You could be, if you're both willing.

423
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:27,774
- You make a sweet couple.
- Right?

424
00:41:27,857 --> 00:41:30,610
Just so you know,

425
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:32,320
my type

426
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:35,990
is someone as sweet and beautiful
as Geumsoon.

427
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:39,827
Manbok sure has great taste in women.

428
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,789
She was known as Audrey Hepburn
back in the day.

429
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:44,290
Sweet and beautiful.

430
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:48,169
- You two should seriously consider this.

431
00:41:48,252 --> 00:41:49,295
Mister!

432
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:52,924
Mister, here.

433
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:58,096
Have one of these.

434
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:01,974
- Enjoy it with your drink.
- Sure.

435
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:06,896
Ah…

436
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:09,857
Have you lost your mind? Unbelievable.

437
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,069
- Give one to Manbok too.

438
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:16,114
- Mister, please.
- Ah…

439
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:19,242
- Eat it yourself.

440
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:22,870
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

441
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:25,373
Enjoy.

442
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:26,833
Thank you.

443
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,794
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

444
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:31,754
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

445
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:33,798
Yes.

446
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:35,842
- Would you like more?
- Sorry.

447
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:36,968
Don't be.

448
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:40,179
What matters is that we're together again.

449
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,621
<i>Mirr?</i>

450
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:07,290
- Mirr.

451
00:43:08,624 --> 00:43:10,001
What?

452
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:11,252
You were spacing out.

453
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,713
I'd like my food, please.

454
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:15,339
Sure. Sorry about that.

455
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:17,925
- Take your time and eat your fill.
- Got it.

456
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,887
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

457
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,555
- It's tasty.
- Please enjoy.

458
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:23,973
Thank you.

459
00:43:46,621 --> 00:43:48,164
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

460
00:43:48,247 --> 00:43:50,500
The day Haetae was killed
by Taesan and the angels,

461
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:53,669
it left behind three soul stones.

462
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:55,671
Once you gather the soul stones

463
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,174
and feed their energy
into the Dragon Soul,

464
00:43:58,257 --> 00:44:00,384
which oversees the energy
of angels and demons,

465
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,137
you can revive Haetae's power.
