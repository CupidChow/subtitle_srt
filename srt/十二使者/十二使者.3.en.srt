vanish too?

00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,018
Rather than sticking
our necks out for humans,

191
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,565
we'll focus on keeping
only this family safe.

192
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,238
Still, these are evil spirits
we're talking about.

193
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,075
[Kangji] Chief,

194
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,786
can I say something?

195
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,123
[sighs]

196
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,041
Honestly, it's been a long time.

197
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,338
Because you were constantly in pain
over what happened,

198
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,426
we followed your lead and did as told,
but this is way too irresponsible of you.

199
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,515
The purpose of our existence
is to protect humans.

200
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,768
That's the duty we should honor
to the very end.

201
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,604
Kangji, come on.

202
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,814
[Taesan] So?

203
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,320
We protected humans
for thousands of years, but for what?

204
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,906
You see,

205
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,366
even God has abandoned us.

206
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,911
Look at what we've become.

207
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,754
I refuse to uphold that duty
if it means losing my family.

208
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,257
You're not the only one grieving
their deaths!

209
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,761
Stop acting like
you're the only one who cares.

210
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,555
- What?
- [Kangji] I mourn those we lost,

211
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,933
but we should still stay true
to who we are.

212
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm willing to die
while protecting humans.

213
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,354
Watch it, Kangji!

214
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
Both of you, that's enough.

215
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,569
[sighs]

216
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,323
[Taesan] Listen.

217
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,371
I refuse to lose anyone else.

218
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,875
[Kangji] Protect us, Chief.

219
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,587
Then we'll protect humans.

220
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,132
Duty or not…

221
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,554
that's why we exist.

222
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,018
[sighs]

223
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
[Kangji sighs]

224
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,570
[sighs]

225
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,905
[sighs]

226
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,949
[sighs]

227
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,243
[sighs]

228
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,290
[sighs]

229
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,092
Jwidol.

230
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,887
Didn't you make something
to track drug dealers?

231
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,306
Yes, Marok.

232
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,224
Good.

233
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,728
- Wonseung.
- Yes?

234
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,479
A word.

235
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,785
[Marok sighs]

236
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,496
Ah…

237
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,627
- [sighs]
- [grunts]

238
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,296
Anyway, what did you want to talk about?

239
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,592
Well,

240
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,305
didn't you sense an odd vibe earlier?

241
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,890
Of course, I did.

242
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,185
Why did Kangji have
to tick off Chief like that?

243
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,439
His hatred for humans is nothing new.

244
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,607
Tell me about it.

245
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,613
Meanwhile, out of all of us,
Kangji is particularly fond of humans.

246
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,697
[sighs]

247
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,823
I mean,

248
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,451
evil spirits are causing us
distress as is,

249
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,328
so why are we fighting each other?

250
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,208
- [sighs]
- Wonseung.

251
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,377
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

252
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,213
Didn't you see that earlier?

253
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,799
Of course, I did.

254
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,635
Chief's eyes were burning with anger.

255
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,346
I'm talking about
how Taesan was looking at you.

256
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,310
Didn't you get the sense that he wanted

257
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,605
to ask you a favor?

258
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:55,528
- What?
- Taesan knows he should help humans,

259
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,780
but wanting to do right by the rest of you

260
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,075
keeps him from taking the lead
in this matter.

261
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,619
That's why he looked at you

262
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,415
like he was pleading for you
to find those evil spirits.

263
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,417
He was pleading with his eyes.

264
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,336
- He wants me to step in for him?
- That's right.

265
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,131
What do you think that means?

266
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,926
He obviously sees you

267
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,304
- as the next chief.
- [gasps]

268
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,641
The next chief? Me?

269
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,059
Exactly.

270
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:31,188
Taesan may be a big guy on the outside,

271
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,107
but he's actually quite shy.

272
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,818
- Right.
- Would it kill him

273
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,945
to just ask for favors out loud?

274
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,322
Why does he do it with his eyes?

275
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,075
He always lets his gaze speak for him.

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,168
Wonseung.

277
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
Yes?

278
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,922
Here's to becoming the chief.

279
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,178
[sighs]

280
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,847

[Marok] We'll join you in time.

[Marok]
The one who awakened the evil spirits

298
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,157
is Samin.

299
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,411
Samin?

300
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,495
That's right.

301
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,748
The high priest who turned Haetae
into an evil spirit.

302
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,918
He still lives.

303
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,337
But he's a human. How is that possible?

304
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,464
It's not, so I should look into it.

305
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,466
[sighs]

306
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,844
Either way, I'll say this now.

307
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,846
Leave my kids out of this.

308
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,014
Taesan.

309
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,932
Our purpose

310
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,561
is to help the human world.

311
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,187
And I should protect my family.

312
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,232
We're just ordinary humans now.

313
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,443
We have no power to fight evil spirits.

314
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:29,987
Taesan.

315
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,114
Sacrificing to protect humans?

316
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,867
That's pointless.

So, how are you feeling?

322
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,767
Though it's long overdue,

323
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,853
I'm thankful you returned.

324
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,564
Sorry it took me so long.

325
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,775

331
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,574
[Kangji] Protect us, Chief.

332
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,742
Then we'll protect humans.

333
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,120
Duty or not,

334
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,290
that's why we exist.

00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,215
Let me buy it.

00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,427
- What…
- What are you talking about?

344
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,513
Let me buy this food cart from you.

345
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,807
Mr. Taesan…

346
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,521
Here.

347
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,068
It could get dangerous,
so stay out of the country for a while.

- Okay.

354
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,937
If there's an irregularity,
orange spot will show.

355
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,815
I see. Sounds easy enough.

356
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,610
What task did Marok assign you
that requires this device?

357
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:39,695
What?

358
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,697
Well…

359
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,325
Well, he's after… Yes, drugs.

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,413
He's gearing up
for a crackdown on drug offenders

361
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,415
and asked me to lend a hand.

362
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,666

- Why you, though?
- [scoffs]

Who else could he ask?

00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,631
I'm the only one
who's good at this kind of thing.

366

Don't you agree?

367
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,010

Oh, there you are.

551
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,165
Got it. Noted.

552
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,958
Good.

553
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,293
[sighs]

554
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,295
Boys, take them out.

555
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,506
- We're up.
- [Wonseung] Sure.

556
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,719
[grunting, groaning]

557
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,606
- What was that?
- Hold on.

558
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,608
[people clamoring]

559
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,115
You again?

560
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,409
I knew it.

561
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,828
Unbelievable.

562
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:56,913
Do you know me?

563
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,499
[grunts]

564
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,254
[groans, whimpers]

565
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,473
I told you to be good, you punk.

566
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,184
You were a bandit in a past life.

567
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,062
I'll be good from now on.

568
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,107
My liver…

569
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,988
[heartbeat echoes]

570
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,616
[♪ romantic music playing]

571
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,917

572
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,714
[heartbeat stops]

573
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,052
If evil spirits return,

574
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,848
you'll protect us
like you did in the past.

575
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,484
Would you like a refill?

576
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,361
Sure.

577
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,241
You probably have sore knees,
so stop getting up like that.

578
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,826
- [Manbok] I'm okay.
- Thanks.

579
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,418
By the way, are you two together?

580
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,087
What are you saying, mister?

581
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,923
You could be, if you're both willing.

582
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,468
- You make a sweet couple.
- [Manbok] Right?

583
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,304
Just so you know,

584
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,014
my type

585
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,684
is someone as sweet and beautiful
as Geumsoon.

586
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,521
Manbok sure has great taste in women.

587
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,483
She was known as Audrey Hepburn
back in the day.

588
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,984
Sweet and beautiful.

589
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,863
- [laughs]
- You two should seriously consider this.

590
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,989
Mister!

591
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,618
Mister, here.

592
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:03,790
Have one of these.

593
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,668
- Enjoy it with your drink.
- Sure.

594
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,590
Ah…

595
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,551
Have you lost your mind? Unbelievable.

596
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,763
- [laughs]
- Give one to Manbok too.

597
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,808
- [Geumsoon] Mister, please.
- [Manbok] Ah…

598
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,936
- [Geumsoon] Eat it yourself.
- [Manbok laughs]

599
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,564
- Enjoy.
- [child 1] Thank you.

600
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,067
Enjoy.

[child 2] Thank you.

602
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,488
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

603
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,448
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

604
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,492
Yes.

605
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,536
- [Jwidol] Would you like more?
- Sorry.

606
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,662
Don't be.

607
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,873
What matters is that we're together again.

608
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,877

[Kangji] <i>Mirr?</i>

612
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:12,984
- Mirr.
- [gasps]

613
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,695
What?

614
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,946
You were spacing out.

615
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,407
[child 3] I'd like my food, please.

616
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,033
Sure. Sorry about that.

617
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,619
- Take your time and eat your fill.
- Got it.

618
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,581
- There you go. Enjoy.
- [child 3] Thank you.

619
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,249

[♪ ominous music playing]

622
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,858
[Samin] <i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

623
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,194
The day Haetae was killed
by Taesan and the angels,

624
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,363
it left behind three soul stones.

625
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,365
Once you gather the soul stones

626
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,868
and feed their energy
into the Dragon Soul,

627
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,078
which oversees the energy
of angels and demons,

628
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,831
you can revive Haetae's power.
