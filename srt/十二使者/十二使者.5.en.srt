00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:11,267
TWELVE

2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,142
TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

3
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,904
Seriously? You're still not ready?

4
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,328
Let's go. Malsook's almost here.

5
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,750
Come on.

6
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,923
So, are you really not coming?

7
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,842
<i>That's right. I'm not.</i>

8
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,845
So much for whining about missing her.

9
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,264
<i>Who are you saying I've been missing?</i>

10
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,600
<i>I was carrying out my duty, nothing more.</i>

11
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,604
Says the man who always visited her
on his days off.

12
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,273
<i>Whatever, you brat.</i>

13
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,108
<i>Don't forget to tell her this.</i>

14
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,736
<i>She shouldn't even dream</i>
<i>about seeing me again. Got it?</i>

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,904
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

16
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,616
As if he won't go see her again.

17
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,371
Don't worry. I'll explain well later.

18
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,749
Where's Chief and the others?
They're not around.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,585
In the Philippines for work.

20
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,545
The Philippines? That's out of the blue.

21
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,882
The boss of the Vipers gang
sold the nightclub and fled at night.

22
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,094
They all flew there
just to hunt that guy down? Why?

23
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,431
He was scared of flying alone.
He's never been on a plane before.

24
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,849
Who, Chief?

25
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,893
Isn't he way too big to be afraid?

26
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,312
Couldn't he have taken just one of them?

27
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,856
Doni was excited about the food,

28
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,693
and Wonseung leapt at the chance
to be somewhere warmer.

29
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,985
And Jwidol?

30
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,446
They made him tag along to locate the guy.

31
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,407
It never gets any easier.

32
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,742
- Let's go.
- Come on.

33
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,161
Bangwool, you ride shotgun.

34
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,499
I'm impressed, though.

35
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,543
Chief? Or the others?

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,044
No, the boss of the Vipers gang.

37
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,172
How could he even consider
running off with Chief's money?

38
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,799
Tell me about it.

39
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,593
Chief should focus on collecting,
not lending.

40
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,514
- Collecting…
- This is because he comes off as a softie.

41
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:44,933
A softie?

42
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,936
- What are you talking about?
- It's obvious.

43
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,856
Chief's too cute for his own good.

44
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,691
He's like a little kitten.

45
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,192
Right?

46
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,780
All right. Off we go.

47
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,702
I'm fine.

48
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,872
I don't think you're fine.

49
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,718
Mmm.

50
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,061
Who made this?

51
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,815
Why? How does it taste?

52
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,526
Why does <i>budae jjigae</i>
taste like caramel macchiato?

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,570
Let me try it.

54
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,790
Geez, that tastes awful!

55
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,171
Bangwool, wait!

56
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,716
I told you to just observe.

57
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,844
That just ruined my appetite.

58
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,846
I should've just gone
to the Philippines with Chief.

59
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,767
What are you doing?
We were going to grill them as is.

60
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,814
No, don't that.

61
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,565
Stop!

62
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,568
- It'd be a disaster if you get sick.
- Tell me about it.

63
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,239
We don't eat just
to end up vomiting, but she won't listen.

64
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,698
Bangwool, come on.

65
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,158
Stop it, Bangwool.

66
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,827
Would you please stop?

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,911
Bangwool, please.

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,120
Mirr!

69
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,915
Bangwool.

70
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,753
What took you so long?

71
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,381
You haven't eaten, right?

72
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,260
Why is Bangwool pouting?
Did something happen?

73
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,970
Of course not. Have a seat.

74
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,014
- Would you like some caramel macchiato?
- Is there caramel macchiato?

75
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,432
Yes, and it tastes amazing.

76
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,393
She's pissed.

77
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,189
- Just let it go.
- Mirr, help.

78
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,151
Bangwool, what about the thing
I asked for?

79
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,327
Give it to Doni, not me.

80
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,706
He'll need it one day.

81
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,587
Hey, come have some sweet potatoes.

82
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,671
Sure.

83
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,633
- Careful, it's hot.
- Here we go.

84
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,805
Mirr, get over here.

85
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,671
TWELVE

86
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,430
Malsook, are you okay?

87
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,599
He's no joke.

88
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,351
Obviously, Malsook.

89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,602
I have no other choice.

90
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,200
What's that?

91
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,702
- What is it?
- Oh…

92
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,246
Hey, what's wrong?

93
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,499
Man, that's tasty.

94
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,418
Huh?

95
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,373
They're persistent, aren't they?

96
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,875
You've got to be kidding me.

97
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,769
Bangwool?

98
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,813
Bangwool!

99
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,932
Geumsoon?

100
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,516
Geumsoon!

101
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,435
Marok!

102
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,745
Geumsoon, no.

103
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,169
Chief.

104
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,672
Chief!

105
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,674
Chief.

106
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,571
Taesan.

107
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,780
Geumsoon is…

108
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,703
Geumsoon.

109
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,664
Mister…

110
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,640
Geumsoon.

111
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,956
Hey, are you okay?

112
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,751
It hurts, Malsook. Let's go.

113
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,423
Let's hurry.

114
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,764
DOLMEN SUSEOK FOLK MUSEUM

115
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,209
TAESAN BUILDING

116
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,502
Where's Bangwool?

117
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,922
Bangwool!

118
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,971
Goodness.

119
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,203
What the… What happened here?

120
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,707
Bangwool!

121
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,501
- What.
- Oh, no.

122
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,714
- Bangwool, wake up.
- Bangwool?

123
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,800
Are you okay?

124
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,595
Bangwool, what happened?

125
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,643
Bangwool, where…

126
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,813
Hey, what happened here?

127
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,897
Hey.

128
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,149
What happened?

129
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,693
They took Mirr away.

130
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,777
- What?
- What?

131
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,113
Who was it?

132
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,825
Samin came with his goons,
and Bangwool's injured.

133
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,868
Samin?

134
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,621
Bangwool.

135
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,165
Are you all right?

136
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,836
She's good.

137
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,131
- Tend to Geumsoon.
- Sure.

138
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,217
Taesan,

139
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:19,765
it seems they attacked Geumsoon
to distract us

140
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,517
and take Mirr away.

141
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,439
I'll find them and kill them all.

142
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,065
Taesan.

143
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,819
The pendant is not responsive.

144
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,446
Wonseung found their lair.

145
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,364
That's where they must be!

146
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,616
You saw it yourself.

147
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,452
The place has been warded off
by a dark magic barrier.

148
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,621
If they find out about our plan,

149
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,624
it'll put Mirr in bigger danger. Got it?

150
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,506
Bangwool, Geumsoon is severely injured.

151
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,636
Let's go to her. Jwidol, Kangji,
get us hot water and towels.

152
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,720
- Sure.
- Got it.

153
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,193
Taesan.

154
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,281
I'll try to find

155
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,201
a solution as soon as possible,

156
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,703
so give me some time.

157
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,008
Bangwool.

158
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,844
How's Geumsoon?

159
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,516
What…

160
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,268
She's getting worse.

161
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,355
A wound caused by an evil spirit's venom
can't be cured with human medicine.

162
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,111
She'll do everything she can,

163
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,740
but sadly, Geumsoon is beyond help.

164
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,616
This is bad.

165
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,495
- They even have Mirr now.
- Darn it.

166
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,622
Is there no way at all?

167
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,421
The Hellmouth.

168
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,718
By opening the Hellmouth,

169
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,970
we might be able to regain our powers.

170
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,389
Bangwool's powers will be restored too,

171
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,933
and she could save Geumsoon.

172
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,059
No.

173
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,230
That's not guaranteed.

174
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,358
And opening the Hellmouth

175
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,736
could further endanger the human world.

176
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,035
This is tough.

177
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,496
Where's Chief?

178
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,832
He's with Geumsoon.

179
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,376
<i>No… Don't you worry.</i>

180
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,337
<i>I'll save you. Get out of here.</i>

181
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,963
<i>No…</i>

182
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,458
Where am I?

183
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,172
What is this place?

184
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,894
Wait. You saw Ogwi and Samin?

185
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,064
- Yes.
- Where?

186
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,026
Tell me. Where was it?

187
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,278
Will you take accountability
if something happens to Mirr?

188
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,572
I'm sure Marok will loop us in
in due time.

189
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,074
Take a chill pill.

190
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,784
Listen to Wonseung, Malsook.

191
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,828
Are you seriously siding with him now?

192
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,623
If we were to act,
we should do so as a team.

193
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,375
- Didn't you learn anything from earlier?
- Whatever!

194
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,128
Go on and waste your time waiting, then.

195
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,256
I'll get Marok's approval
and go alone if I must.

196
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,218
I told you to cool it.

197
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,095
Besides, Marok left earlier.

198
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,387
Did he go to work?

199
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,181
Earlier,

200
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,058
we made a mess at the mall.

201
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,060
Of course, police officers
must've been called in.

202
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,229
Why would Marok go there?

203
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,730
Doni, not you too.

204
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,774
He's out doing his job as a detective!

205
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,025
Marok quit the force!

206
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,111
What?

207
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,952
Hey, Wonseung!

208
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,162
Where are you going?

209
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,714
Chief.

210
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,050
Marok left without telling anyone…

211
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,096
…and something doesn't feel right.

212
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,651
I'll try to find a solution
as soon as possible,

213
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,404
so give me some time.

214
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,489
Please.

215
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,636
Let us begin.

216
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,313
- <i>I'll protect you.</i>
- <i>The prayer has begun.</i>

217
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,190
- <i>I'll save you.</i>
- <i>You will be sealed.</i>

218
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,150
<i>I will end you myself.</i>

219
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,439
Mirr!

220
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,484
How long has he been gone?

221
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,529
Well, about an hour.

222
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:32,000
Samin, how have you managed
to stay alive all this time?

223
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,169
That's ironic,

224
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,671
coming from a human being.

225
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,759
I'm no ordinary human.

226
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,762
I'm the human

227
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,472
handpicked by God.

228
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,107
The grown-ups are talking…

229
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,026
…so know your place.

230
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,330
Now,

231
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,208
Samin, I want to know how you've managed

232
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,752
to stay alive all this time.

233
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,107
Geez.

234
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,654
Come on, boys.

235
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,948
Does anyone here have any manners at all?

236
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,116
Look at yourselves.

237
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,118
One, two, three, four, five, six…

238
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,413
Do you even need this many of you

239
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,124
just to take out good old me? Come on.

240
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,710
By the way,

241
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,381
let me share an amusing fact…

242
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,009
before you die.

243
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,305
See this?

244
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:15,186
You see, this staff
has three hidden features.

245
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,120
One.

246
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,540
It vanquishes puny spirits like you.

247
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,500
Two.

248
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,295
It allows me to split and channel

249
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,922
my maximum power.

250
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,266
Three.

251
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,229
It's pathetic that I have to
explain this as well.

252
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,733
You know what? The third power

253
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,651
is something for you to think about

254
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,154
when you get bored
on your way to the underworld.

255
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,864
Got it?

256
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,590
You puny brat.

257
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,135
Way to go.

258
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,243
Huh?

259
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,964
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

260
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,382
Not even God

261
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,093
will be able to save you.

262
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,064
Did you awaken Haetae's soul?

263
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,361
You want to know?

264
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,364
I spent thousands
of years praying…

265
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,119
so that I could open the Hellmouth.

266
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:57,992
Is this the end?

267
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,786
No, of course not.

268
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,704
No… I'll save you.

269
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,415
We need to get out of here.

270
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,542
Let's get going for now.

271
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,836
Mirr, I…

272
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:14,008
No.

273
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,343
No…

274
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,303
Ogwi, no.

275
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,532
Please don't do this.

276
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,200
Move.

277
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,911
Taesan, please. Don't do this.

278
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,373
We lost members of our family.

279
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,750
Now, move.

280
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,461
Don't!

281
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,062
You defied God

282
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,690
and brought ruin to the world.

283
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,902
You've already ruined my everything.

284
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,822
Do as you wish.

285
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,908
I will end you myself.

286
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,626
No…

287
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,010
No, don't.

288
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,263
Please don't.

289
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,556
No…

290
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,693
What do you think you're doing?

291
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,986
Don't worry.

292
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,033
I only erased Mirr's memories of Ogwi.

293
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,826
What? Marok!

294
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,871
This is God's will.

295
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,957
Leave first with Mirr.

296
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,419
I'll deal with Ogwi.

297
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,191
Mirr.

298
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,443
Mirr…

299
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,613
Mirr!

300
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,657
Ogwi.

301
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,076
It's time for you to pay for your sins.

302
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,870
There was a time

303
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,498
when you lived amicably with the angels.

304
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,542
For that, I offer my last mercy,

305
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,461
erasing Mirr from your memories.

306
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,756
You will be sealed in Hell for eternity,

307
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,801
and you'll be neither dead nor alive.

308
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,637
Finish me instead.
