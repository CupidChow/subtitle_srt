1
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:32,166
WTF!?!

2
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:34,725
Hey!

3
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:37,566
Why are you here?

4
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:38,909
It’s my house.

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,700
My house! Look

6
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:54,368
True, so we slept all night together last night?

7
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,168
So, our houses are very close?

8
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:18,578
Really really close

9
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:34,063
Can you take me to travel today?

10
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,665
Sure! but I don't know if you will get bored or not.

11
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:40,193
I'm not bored. I have you.

12
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,769
Oh, why are you sleeping together?

13
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,039
Do you know each other? Are you a lover?

14
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:02,087
No

15
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:05,247
Then why are you sleeping in the same house?

16
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:10,891
You don't have to hide from me. I understand.

17
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,185
Well, last night we drank a lot…

18
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:14,650
Ok then. No Equals No

19
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:17,588
But two of you are really nice.

20
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:21,119
Wipha, come quickly.

21
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,836
Day, let's hurry up and take a shower. Meet me at the pier.

22
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,987
Today I will take you on a trip.

23
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,375
Quickly!

24
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,290
Slow again. Hurry up!

25
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:32,440
Very slow

26
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:38,329
What's wrong?

27
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,647
Oh, they had all dispersed before you came.

28
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:44,954
Learn to spy on your neighbors like everyone else

29
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,824
to be aware of any news of them.

30
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:48,425
And you must practice a bit.

31
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:50,334
Practice what?

32
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:52,368
Learn to stop nosey.

33
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,176
You’re a saleswoman, not a journalist.

34
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,744
It’s none of your business.

35
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:01,098
Hey Wipha! How dare you speak to your wonderful aunt like this?

36
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,043
Come on, let's clear things up with me first.

37
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:03,900
No

38
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,777
Wipha!

39
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,064
How I got to know Mem

40
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,446
It's like a magnet that draws me in.

41
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:31,336
It's a feeling of indescribable safety.

42
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,724
If you compare, it’s probably like the first day we entered university alone.

43
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:41,125
But then I turned around and saw someone who I really wanted to get to know.

44
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,650
He would probably be a good friend.

45
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:48,231
And I think I will be a good friend in this university.

46
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:52,389
Mem keeps listening and tries to understand me in every way as I told.

47
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:55,578
He takes me to new places.

48
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:00,095
I smile every time when I look at Mem.

49
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:03,866
Now I have more confidence in this journey.

50
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:06,744
Thank you!

51
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,934
New friend

52
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,844
You’re good at drawing

53
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:29,568
not much but thank you

54
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,297
Why did you draw

55
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:34,721
or just for fun?

56
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:37,882
It's my job

57
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,419
I got a job drawing the cover of the notebook

58
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,713
and a postcard

59
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,285
send to the printery.

60
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,619
Sounds good, did what you liked.

61
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,735
It's like waking up to do what you love every day.

62
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,659
I told you already

63
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:57,144
That's all I'm thankful for and I'm very happy now.

64
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:20,070
(Humming)

65
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:24,475
(Humming)

66
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:28,782
(Humming)

67
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,188
(Humming)

68
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:38,629
(Humming)

69
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,436
Need help?

70
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,463
No problem, I can do it.

71
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:56,456
Ofcourse

72
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,926
Let me help you

73
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:25,467
Ohhh

74
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:29,785
If I don’t have your help

75
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,922
I wouldn't be able to eat grilled today.

76
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:36,148
Come on, let's eat. I’m getting hungry.

77
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,018
Begin!

78
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,058
Day

79
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:05,388
The stain is on your face

80
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,122
Come on, let me wipe it.

81
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:12,465
It's going to be even more.

82
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:42,004
not yet finished?

83
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,475
Uh, Yes

84
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,872
finished

85
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:48,349
Let's eat.

86
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,523
Can I disturb you for a moment?

87
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:36,412
I've been writing a lot of songs. must hurry to play

88
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:37,734
Afraid to forget

89
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:41,403
Oh, it's such an honor.

90
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:45,354
In any case, Play to the fullest. I will listen carefully.

91
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,698
How is it?

92
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:48,910
It’s good!

93
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:54,189
But at the end it's still not okay, it feels weird.

94
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,219
Well, if it is...

95
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:04,304
(Humming)

96
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:20,402
(Humming)

97
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,301
Sounds good! It’s fit

98
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:25,200
let's try to play.

99
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,937
Fantastic!!!

100
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,862
This is what I have always been looking for.

101
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,809
But how much I can't imagine

102
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,099
This isn't just a painter anymore.

103
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,868
Good songwriting

104
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,740
not that much. Just try to hum along with my feelings.

105
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:13,552
But I'm glad to be part of your song.

106
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,113
I have to say thank you to you

107
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:18,565
Never mind

108
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,573
Mem and I have become closer.

109
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:30,629
Sometimes my heart races.

110
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,605
When looking at the face of the mem

111
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:36,795
What I feel I've known it all along.

112
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:40,916
And it seems like it's going to keep increasing.

113
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:11,909
Ah, are you ready?

114
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,500
Yes!!!

115
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:14,815
Go! start

116
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,624
Why don't we play together and have fun?

117
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:04,430
I’m not very good at sports.

118
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,472
Go ahead

119
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,449
I have played enough. so tired

120
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,694
I have one place I want to take you to.

121
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:17,718
where?

122
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,534
If it's hot, I don't go.

123
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,339
Wowww It’s great.

124
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:34,741
It's very quiet here. There aren't many people coming. I really like drawing here.

125
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:38,201
Be careful, Day.

126
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:39,011
Very cold.

127
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,711
It's slippery.

128
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:45,920
Well, I say that the water is cold, come down carefully.

129
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,414
No time! Won't you come and play together?

130
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:53,461
No, go ahead. I'd rather draw a picture here.

131
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:54,631
OK
