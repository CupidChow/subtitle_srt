1
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:57,092
Day is the person who completes me.

2
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,893
And also someone who can make me blank.

3
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,747
Day has disappeared from my life for several days.

4
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:12,570
I feel guilty that I allowed myself to feel this much towards Day.

5
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:22,761
If that day I could stop myself suppress my own feelings

6
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,939
Now Day might be beside me.

7
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,166
All this time

8
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:39,643
I have never been able to save anyone in my life.

9
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,851
It's like everything is predetermined.

10
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,901
I must be lonely.

11
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,668
Day

12
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:49,946
Oh

13
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:52,271
Where he going?

14
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:56,835
Have a fight?

15
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,450
What’s wrong?

16
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:03,987
Take it easy.

17
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,325
Nothing

18
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,557
He probably wanted to be quiet.

19
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:12,787
so bad

20
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:14,117
already quarreling

21
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:15,599
Toy!

22
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,058
Why do you say that?

23
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:18,702
Hey

24
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:20,175
Come here

25
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:49,611
Where did that young man go?

26
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,071
I don’t know

27
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:05,866
Where’re you going to travel? How come you are not asking me to come with you?

28
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,841
I’m not going to travel.

29
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,395
run errands.

30
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:19,035
So can I come with you?

31
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:26,836
Okay

32
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,658
Me and Day, no one asked.

33
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,681
or explain the whole story that happened.

34
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:23,154
I just want to keep the memories of Day again.

35
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,481
It's the most thing I want to do right now.

36
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,409
Please don't make this mistake again.

37
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,456
Follow me

38
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:48,944
Where are you going?

39
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:50,243
I think that I have arrived

40
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:54,253
If you really here, you have to stand at the train tracks.

41
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,932
Walk carefully Mem.

42
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,543
It's okay, I can walk.

43
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,785
Didn't I tell you to walk carefully?

44
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,514
I caught you in time

45
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:28,526
Thanks

46
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:30,883
If it doesn’t have you, I'd be in trouble.

47
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:37,779
Well, let's just walk along this track.

48
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,920
I go to run an errand around here.

49
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:45,676
So high.

50
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,331
Afraid of heights?

51
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:50,189
A little bit.

52
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,816
Hold my hand

53
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:57,201
If you want.

54
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,383
Happy Birth Day mom.

55
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,698
Today’s my mom Birth Day.

56
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,879
And it was on the day my mother passed away.

57
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:52,657
I'm sorry

58
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:54,912
I didn’t prepare anything to pay homage to your mom at all.

59
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:56,462
Never mind

60
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,490
Thank you for coming with me from a long way.

61
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:02,181
I'm willing to come.

62
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:04,984
Are you okay?

63
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:08,895
Yeah, I’m okay.

64
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:12,303
Mom has been lost since I’m childhood.

65
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,973
So, I don't have much memories of my mom.

66
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,795
I just know that my mom is very beautiful.

67
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:26,507
And this

68
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,134
Oh

69
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,870
I see you carrying it all the time.

70
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,356
Nice

71
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,128
This is the only thing that has been with me since childhood.

72
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,443
It’s the only item that reminds me of my mom.

73
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,697
So, you don't have a picture of your mom?

74
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,571
Nope

75
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,532
When my mom passed away, I was very young.

76
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,604
And then I was sent here.

77
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,553
no relatives at all

78
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:04,757
There’s only the uncle who is my mom's friend.

79
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,887
Keep sending my tuition fees until I graduate.

80
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,169
And My Dad

81
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:18,397
I Don’t know

82
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,733
when my mom passed away

83
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,892
I ended up at the school where I was teaching.

84
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:29,786
Leaving here only when going to university.

85
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:33,001
Finally missed.

86
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:34,933
so, I come back here.

87
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:40,821
I'm sorry about everything.

88
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,943
It's okay.

89
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:48,574
Nowadays I really do everything happily.

90
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:54,172
every life path I choose.

91
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:57,006
very happy

92
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:00,196
Thank you

93
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,701
Feeling good to be here with you.

94
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,423
I thought that we would never meet again.

95
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,670
You like being with me?

96
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,520
What a Gorgeous

97
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,074
Like a dream

98
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,016
It's beautiful and very peaceful here.

99
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:41,908
Not many people get here because it&#39;s difficult.

100
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:45,479
I respect you for bringing the car here.

101
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,656
I'm so lucky to have you

102
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,639
So I came to a beautiful place.

103
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,326
Shall we go camping?

104
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,741
It'll get dark first.

105
00:15:58,771 --> 00:15:59,846
Okay

106
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,052
Are you ready to see my cooking skills?

107
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:27,548
Ofcourse

108
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,227
I’m starving

109
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,945
But I can't do much.

110
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,783
Hmmm, it's too delicious to eat.

111
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,525
So, eat well.

112
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,675
I was determined to do my best.

113
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,172
Delicious!!

114
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:05,248
Thanks

115
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,074
How is it?

116
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:24,755
Good job

117
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:27,641
Without you, this song would never be perfect.

118
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,843
not that much

119
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,571
All of Day's own intentions.

120
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,387
You must have reached your dreams.

121
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:36,983
if I stay at home

122
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:39,198
There's no end to my song

123
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:40,999
Why?

124
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,904
Day's father doesn't like playing music.

125
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,375
He doesn’t like the violin at all.

126
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,361
but always stubborn

127
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,054
Because I loved the sound of the violin since I was young.

128
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
But every time I see you play

129
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,008
You look very happy.

130
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:02,207
Because of you

131
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,585
Thank you
