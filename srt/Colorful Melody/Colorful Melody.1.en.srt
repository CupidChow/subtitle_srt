1
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:13,836
I believe that every journey will always lead us to discover new things.

2
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:17,035
My decision to journey this time.

3
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,290
I hope it will take me closer to my dreams.

4
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:26,320
Even though I decided to stay for a long time, But I feel like it's worth it.

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,667
Whether it's a small step or a big step.

6
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:32,032
Every step will mean a lot.

7
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,000
See you later, my dream.

8
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:40,926
We want to Invite tourists to watch the sunset on the Mon Bridge.

9
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:44,062
And saw many ways of life of the natives.

10
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,447
There’s a boat for rent to go to the ancient temple.

11
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:50,495
If anyone wants to wear it as a Mon people dress.

12
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:52,856
You can rent a dress and take a picture

13
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:56,487
beside the bridge.

14
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,664
We're very welcome.

15
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,373
(All proceeds go to lunch for underprivileged children)

16
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:02,756
Where are you now?

17
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,808
Get lost?

18
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:05,165
I don't know.

19
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,528
I Follow the GPS.

20
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,685
Now in the rubber plantation.

21
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:10,907
not sure if that's right.

22
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:24,000
Day

23
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,881
long time no see

24
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:39,236
How are you B?

25
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:41,161
Good day,

26
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,849
I miss you so much.

27
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:45,481
Day, this is Toy.

28
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:47,481
Hello

29
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,240
Hi

30
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Hurry up, the kids are waiting.

31
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:53,338
I'm not quite sure

32
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:55,338
about teaching children to understand.

33
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,569
Smart like you. How can they not understand?

34
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:00,315
Be sure, Day

35
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:02,010
You’re already good.

36
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,184
It's like coming to fulfill the dream of being a volunteer teacher.

37
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,000
Let’s go!!!

38
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,388
Oh!

39
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:16,400
Where did Teacher Mem go?

40
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Teacher Mem went to do an errand.

41
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,965
Okay. Everyone

42
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:22,902
today I have a new music teacher to introduce.

43
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,759
Hello, my name is Teacher Day.

44
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,449
I am a volunteer music teacher.

45
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,550
Hello Teacher Day.

46
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:33,072
Don't be naughty with Teacher Day, understand?

47
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,933
We understand.

48
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,163
Teacher Day, where did you come from?

49
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm from Bangkok.

50
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Can you sing?

51
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:43,660
Yes. But I'm not so sure.

52
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:48,000
Anyway. Can you sing a song for the children?

53
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:52,185
I'm not sure, I didn't prepare anything.

54
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,185
I want to listen

55
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:55,368
Aha!

56
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:58,808
Here is the old teacher's keyboard. Let's play with it.

57
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:42,146
You heard the sound of the song I sang now or not

58
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:52,629
is our song distilled from the heart

59
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:58,328
It tells the story of the two of us.

60
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:05,624
We met on the right day

61
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:12,634
and time keeps telling me

62
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:17,487
That you're the one I'm looking for

63
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:24,000
I wrote this song for you

64
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,690
To tell the story of how I feel

65
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:42,111
that in my heart there is always you

66
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:48,000
Can I ask for you

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,207
Be with me now

68
00:07:55,207 --> 00:08:06,947
Let me have you and you have me forever.

69
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,365
Thank you

70
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:18,274
Okay, the time is up. Don't to do your homework.

71
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:19,848
Ok

72
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,564
Thank you teacher.

73
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,403
Day sings well, right?

74
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:42,855
Seeing the eyes without blinking at all.

75
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:44,708
Mem

76
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,872
this is my friend.

77
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,000
He will travel here for a while.

78
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,917
Also be a volunteer teacher too.

79
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,695
Yeah, yesterday...

80
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,695
We met on the Mon Bridge, right?

81
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:56,417
Oh!

82
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:58,278
Have you met?

83
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:01,326
Yesterday, I went to draw a picture at the Mon Bridge.

84
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,049
Saw he playing the violin.

85
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:06,788
Nice to meet you.

86
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,513
Nice to meet you too.

87
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:19,703
Cheers!!

88
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,502
How long will you be here?

89
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,858
Probably for a while.

90
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,406
To compose a song that hasn't finished yet.

91
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:32,198
If staying at home about 10 years to finish.

92
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,214
Oh yeah... Why are you here?

93
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:35,746
Well...

94
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:39,270
He called to ask for peace place with me.

95
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,463
So, I recommend “Sangkhla”.

96
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,601
Because I really miss Day too.

97
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,242
And it's really peaceful here.

98
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:47,266
Oh/So I would like to recommend.

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,864
I asked Day

100
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,199
Oh! I want to answer

101
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,257
I just want to hear it from Day's mouth./What's wrong?

102
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:51,761
Is your name Day?

103
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:52,261
Don’t bug me

104
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,506
Day,

105
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,697
Do you make music for YouTube or do you sell it?

106
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,411
Oh, it's just the orchestra that I like.

107
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:01,411
They will come to exhibit in Thailand.

108
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:03,965
And they have an audition for a violinist to join the band too.

109
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:06,155
If I gets it, I will also go on a world tour.

110
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,739
I want to try it.

111
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,376
You’re so good and passed comfortably.

112
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:14,842
You’re so good and passed comfortably.

113
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:16,560
I have to compose the song for the audition myself.

114
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,560
I will try my best.

115
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:21,237
Not so difficult at all. I'll help you.

116
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:22,762
Oh!

117
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,649
It's better to learn to sing it in the right key first.

118
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,206
I didn't speak to you.

119
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,264
Don't be rude

120
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,152
Why not

121
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:30,000
can't you talk to me?

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,695
Why?Hah!   You think you good?

123
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:32,897
You’re his girlfriend?

124
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,426
No

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,640
Always hurry,

126
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,005
being my boyfriend isn't that good?

127
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:42,307
Being friends is the best.

128
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:45,961
Uh......

129
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,961
Cheers

130
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:01,033
Are we drinking too much?

131
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,055
B has been drinking a lot like this since she was in school

132
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,055
until she was nicknamed "B Blacked out "

133
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,204
Then....

134
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,204
Are you okay to teach tomorrow?

135
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,526
Tomorrow they don't have a lesson.

136
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,106
So they drink heavily like this.

137
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,609
What a relief

138
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,280
So what are you going to do tomorrow?

139
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:29,143
I’ll take a boat and go to draw an ancient temple.

140
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,576
What will it be If I want to go with you.

141
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:34,381
Yes,

142
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,243
but it's very early.

143
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:37,883
You will wake up?

144
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,243
I wants to go. I’m still up to it.

145
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,332
Love it,

146
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:52,967
The atmosphere is both nice and calm.

147
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:56,047
Maybe this place can make Day finish composing.

148
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,000
It must be very important to you, isn't it?

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,253
I liked the sound of the violin since childhood.

150
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,087
If I pass the audition

151
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:07,558
will be able to follow my dream
that I intended.

152
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,137
Dreams are very important to me.

153
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:12,563
Good,

154
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:15,145
then I hope you can fulfill your dream.

155
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:16,087
Thank you so much

156
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,179
So...

157
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,179
what’s your dream?

158
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,532
My dream

159
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:25,504
is waking up every morning.

160
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,586
Drink delicious coffee every day,

161
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:31,835
draw pictures,

162
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,226
teach children,

163
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,226
it's all worth it.

164
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:36,340
Is that all?

165
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:37,533
Yeah,

166
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,782
I'm so happy now.

167
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:46,022
Let's go back.

168
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,773
I have to wake up early tomorrow.

169
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:48,330
Okay,

170
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,330
I starting to feel sleepy.

171
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,186
Ah...

172
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:56,463
and what should we do with these two?

173
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,489
Don't worry,

174
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,903
I'll take care of B.

175
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,903
It my duty since at school.

176
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:06,219
Let’s go back. good luck

177
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,219
see you tomorrow.

178
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:08,719
See you.

179
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:18,941
Let’s go back,

180
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,359
You’re very drunk.

181
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:23,534
Is it morning already?

182
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:24,869
I’m not drunk yet.

183
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,149
Stop talking,

184
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:27,844
let's go, I'll send you home.

185
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,637
You like him?

186
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:49,411
Are you awake?

187
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,079
Let me send you home?

188
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:54,270
It's okay,

189
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,048
I can go back by myselves.

190
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,086
Are you okay?

191
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:09,086
I can send you home.

192
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:18,839
What's going on all day?

193
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,923
Nothing

194
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,360
Come here

195
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:48,576
(Howling dog sound)

196
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:50,659
Hey!

197
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,856
Hey you!

198
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:54,360
Hey

199
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,246
Ohhh quiet

200
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:57,193
What happen?

201
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,307
Is that a thief?

202
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:01,752
Where is it?

203
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,641
Huh! I'll hit the head.

204
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,112
Hmm

205
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,053
Oh god!

206
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:12,000
Nothing. He just shocked me. Think I'm a ghost.

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,243
Umm

208
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,243
my heart is frighteningly.

209
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:16,357
Oh,

210
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:18,606

211
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,606
Uhhh

212
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,604
Came to secretly see K-POP again, right?

213
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:24,448
Hmm...

214
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:25,562

215
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:27,562
Tomorrow you have to help me open the shop.

216
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:28,343
Go!

217
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:29,148
Fine

218
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,000
Go!

219
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,224

220
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,282
Ummm

221
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,389
I'm so sorry.

222
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,190
My auntie's nephew like to watching Korean singers late at night.

223
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,921
Never mind

224
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,361
I don't want to bother you anymore.

225
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:51,692
I gotta go.

226
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,658
Wait !!

227
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:57,157
If you want something

228
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,157
You can call me at my shop.

229
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,772
