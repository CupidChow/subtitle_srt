1
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:29,015
Day

2
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,775
Day

3
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:31,878
Time to wake up

4
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:33,313
I made coffee for you

5
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,200
Smells good

6
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,237
morning coffee

7
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,307
I want you to be refreshed

8
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:54,185
Beautiful

9
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:55,255
I like it

10
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,728
I drew it for you

11
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,098
in order to miss each other

12
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:08,007
I look forward to seeing you soon.

13
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,609
I always ready to hug.

14
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,177
Or?

15
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,642
where to flee?

16
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:15,543
No way

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,103
Ahh

18
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:33,103
Can I borrow some toothpaste?

19
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,824
It's supposed to be in your front pocket.

20
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:39,960
pick it up

21
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,560
What is this Mem?

22
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:41,593
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

23
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,137
What's wrong with having a surgical license?

24
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not feeling well.

25
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:58,756
What's wrong with you? You can tell me.

26
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:00,623
How can I help?

27
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,369
i just know

28
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,379
that I have heart disease

29
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,258
It's to the point that it requires surgery.

30
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,322
the doctor said

31
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,115
I can have my heart stop beating at any time.

32
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:29,306
There is only one cure, surgery.

33
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,167
Why don't you hurry up and treat it?

34
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:36,802
What are you waiting for?

35
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,636
I’ll go with you.

36
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:41,532
It's very risky

37
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,103
that I will not be able to return to life

38
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,859
Mem just wants to continue living.

39
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,095
Before

40
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,958
I just too scared

41
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:17,814
I just too scared

42
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,164
However life has to choose.

43
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:45,853
don't cry

44
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,440
I’m here.

45
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,240
I didn't go anywhere.

46
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,086
Let's not just think about things that haven't happened yet.

47
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,000
I’ll stay here beside you.

48
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:02,260
We'll be together like this.

49
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:03,789
Don't be afraid of.

50
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:06,958
Hmm

51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,714
(Song)

52
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:34,880
Memory

53
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:38,010
My memory

54
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:41,711
You’re the only person in my heart.

55
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,074
In life, I don't think anyone still remember your picture.

56
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,571
Every time I look

57
00:07:57,264 --> 00:08:03,132
You're not far away

58
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:08,054
My memory.

59
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:00,661
Hi Mem

60
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,255
I'm sorry, I'm busy helping father in the factory these days.

61
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:06,327
But in three days we will see each other again.

62
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:07,729
I miss you so much

63
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:09,862
Miss you too.

64
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:12,000
How’s the audition result?

65
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:13,668
Uh

66
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,103
Did not pass.

67
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:16,599
but I already know.

68
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:18,474
Many people come to audition.

69
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,072
I know it already that I don’t pass.

70
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:24,000
But, It’s alright. I’ll have to go back to teach the children’s.

71
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,834
The children might miss you very much.

72
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,432
Day, come help me for a while.

73
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:30,924
Yes, I’m coming.

74
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,156
Ah! Mem, Let’s talk later.

75
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,025
I’m hurry

76
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:34,989
Day

77
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,041
I thing we need to break up.

78
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:45,964
What’s wrong with you?

79
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,794
No need to come here anymore Mem.

80
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:52,123
I’m leaving.

81
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:54,322
Where?

82
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,063
Where’re you going?

83
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:59,557
My foreign friends invite me to go for work abroad

84
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,997
and I decided

85
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,654
I’ll live there.

86
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,236
Keep drawing

87
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:09,867
and follow my dream.

88
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,280
You can tell me where you want to go.

89
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,882
I can bring you anywhere you want.

90
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:16,871
I’m so sorry

91
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,580
Everyone has a dream.

92
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:22,040
Mem

93
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,671
I’ll go make my dream.

94
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:34,665
Mem

95
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,166
Have you traveled today?

96
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,323
Umm…

97
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:22,050
going to board

98
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,398
I’m really happy with you, Day.

99
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:26,956
Thanks

100
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,056
How’s Mem going on?

101
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,847
Nothing

102
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:35,538
I go first

103
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,658
Have a safe flight

104
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:03,487
Hello

105
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:04,590
you back?

106
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,701
Going on a fun trip?

107
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
Actually, I go for work.

108
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:08,676
come back this time

109
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:10,846
Are you ready to help your family business?

110
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:12,448
I have to divide the time.

111
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,182
But I still want to follow my dream.

112
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:15,600
Great!!

113
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,068
Just share some time.

114
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:20,040
Your new office looks very cool.

115
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:22,372
I did it when you went abroad

116
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,000
to let you take care of.

117
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,801
But you went abroad first.

118
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:27,701
Come back this time

119
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,203
You've got to take care of it here.

120
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,406
I gave it to you.

121
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,372
Where did you get these pictures from?

122
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:44,339
These pictures?

123
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:46,571
My old friend's child draws it.

124
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:47,402
Look nice?

125
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:48,738
An old friend's child?

126
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:49,576
Yes.

127
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:51,011
He's pitiful

128
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,878
His father has an accident.

129
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,542
His mother gets pregnant for a few months.

130
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,437
When he was five

131
00:12:57,437 --> 00:12:58,773
His mother was gone.

132
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,407
no relatives

133
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:03,336
I’m very pity because I saw him since he was a child.

134
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,004
So, I give scholarships.

135
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,500
Uh

136
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,869
Actually, you've met him

137
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,238
as a child.

138
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:10,806
but probably can't remember.

139
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:13,404
That day, Mem's mother was sick.

140
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,670
So, she came to see me for advice.

141
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,633
Let’s go

142
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,799
Say hi to your uncle.

143
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,301
Hi

144
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:29,836
Hi

145
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,196
Mem

146
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:34,840
Yes?

147
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,574
go and wait over there.

148
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:37,511
OK

149
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:38,960
Take the violin with you.

150
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,336
Long time no see.

151
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:49,336
How’s your day?

152
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:50,605
Well

153
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,908
as you know

154
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,372
What did the doctor say?

155
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:57,628
Um

156
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,443
He…

157
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,144
Recommend many things.

158
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,908
But he also wanted us

159
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,435
to have a backup plan.

160
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:10,298
Want any help you can tell me.

161
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't be considerate

162
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:14,564
Thanks

163
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,428
You said like this,

164
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:18,531
I was relieved.

165
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:20,864
You’re a father

166
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,499
You would understand

167
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:23,337
that

168
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:24,807
Um...

169
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,807
Really understand

170
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,203
I still remember that

171
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:26,904
you share your toys with mem.

172
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:28,107
He’s really glad.

173
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,210
Nonstop playing.

174
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:31,443
But what a pity

175
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,211
that he suffers from the same disease as his mother.

176
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,510
I tried to get him to have surgery

177
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,320
but he had always refused.

178
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:39,153
Until the middle of this year

179
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:41,119
Suddenly, he confirmed to undergo surgery.

180
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,986
Would like to live for a long time

181
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,587
even at risk.

182
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,321
How is he?

183
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:48,000
Um

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,768
That's what I was worried about.

185
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,266
because he refused to contact me how it was.

186
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:53,535
until now

187
00:15:58,993 --> 00:15:59,664
Hey

188
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:00,701
Where’re you going?

189
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:01,638
Day

190
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:44,445
Finished yet?

191
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:45,548
Almost done.

192
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:50,371
Day

193
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,600
You’re back

194
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,168
I’m thinking about you

195
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:55,535

199
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,214
Day's voice is very sad.

200
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:21,280
Is it a good idea?

201
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,745
if I don’t do this

202
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,637
He will not follow he's dream.

203
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,720
I don't want to ruin his dreams.

204
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:39,287
I think well

205
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm really happy with Day.

206
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:45,162
another thing

207
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:48,955
I don't even know

208
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:51,680
How long can I live with Day?

209
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,071
Good idea

210
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,462
It’s Okay to be like this.

211
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:14,672

212
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:16,174

214
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:23,128
We all have dreams.

215
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,353
I want to follow my dream.

216
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,337

217
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:43,130

218
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,358

219
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,262

221
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:06,791
Place

Food

223
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:09,520
Song

224
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,665
drawing

225
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:14,566
We often keep people in these things.

226
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:22,361
Seeing, hearing, touching will always bring that person back.

227
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,317
That is confirmation that we’ll never forget him.

228
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:33,446
For me, Mem is the person who will be my memory.

229
