=Episode 4=

3
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,010
How is it?

4
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,550
Does it taste good?

5
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,630
It's very good.

6
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,310
Especially sweet.

7
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,670
Have more if you like it.

8
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,870
Just one won't be enough.

9
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,750
Here, Second Madam.

10
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,750
Let me get you another one.

11
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,199
You...

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,750
Bai Shuangshuang, what are you doing?

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,710
Shuangshuang.

14
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,999
Have you lost your mind,
Bai Shuangshuang?

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,790
Seems to me the one who's mad
is you, dear sir.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,590
This shumai contains sweet rice wine.

17
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,079
Rice wine contains alcohol.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,500
Don't you know Master Lu has
tuberculosis and can't have alcohol?

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,950
What were you thinking?

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,479
Do you want Master to get better,

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,710
or are you trying to harm him?

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,030
It's Shuangshuang who's observant,
as always.

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,350
I truly shouldn't be eating this shumai.

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,470
Thank you for the effort, dear sir.

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,150
What were your true intentions?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,670
Father,

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,190
that's not what I meant.

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,110
I didn't know there was rice wine in it.

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,279
Father.

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,959
Chishu definitely didn't do it
on purpose.

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,079
He only wanted to bless you.

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,430
Why are you still explaining?

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,590
I've lost my appetite.

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,390
- Master. Please calm down.
- Father.

35
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,990
Master.

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,430
Calm down.

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,670
Nannan.

38
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,670
Look here.

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,230
If one day, your mother accidentally eats shrimp,
you must give her the medicine in time.

40
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,150
Understood?

41
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,319
Got it.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,830
I'll definitely protect Mother.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,559
Useless.

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,430
You can't even please the old man.

45
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,150
Absolutely worthless.

46
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,510
Bai Shuangshuang,

47
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,910
since when are you allergic to shrimp?

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,150
I'm not feeling well.

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,190
I want to know what really happened
to you over these three years.

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,439
Tell me,

51
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,030
then I'll give the medicine back to you.

52
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,639
The medicine?

53
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,710
Give me the medicine.

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,190
Looks like you don't want it that badly.

55
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,990
I bet you're faking the allergy too.

56
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,750
I'll just throw it away then.

57
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,790
Bai Shuangshuang.

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,150
Bai Shuangshuang.

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,750
Give me the medicine.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,150
Give me the medicine.

61
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,359
I just saved you.

62
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,559
Aren't you going to thank me?

63
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,990
Is that how you treat me?

64
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,799
If it weren't for you,

65
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,350
I would've taken the medicine already.

66
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,190
It wouldn't have become so dangerous.

67
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,870
Young Master.

68
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,510
This is my room.

69
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,030
Shouldn't you be leaving?

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,470
What a heartless woman.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,590
I shouldn't have bothered helping you.

72
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,270
Lu Zhuo.

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,030
About what happened back then,
I wronged you.

74
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,110
But things got to that point

75
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,990
because Master Lu allowed it.

76
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,159
I can admit my fault.

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,439
But don't forget,

78
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,830
in this matter,

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,159
everyone in the Lu family

80
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,430
was an accomplice.

81
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,150
Second Madam.

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,390
Master is calling for you.

83
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,630
Madam, are you all right?

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,990
I'm fine.

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,190
Hong Dou.

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,159
Help me put the medicine away.

87
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,159
Make sure no one finds it.

88
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,150
All right.

89
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,590
Still no good.

90
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,470
Stop stop stop.

91
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,750
I just hit him!

92
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,999
Seven hundred and thirty-two days,

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,719
and I finally landed a hit
on our Young Master!

94
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,150
I finally did it!

95
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,350
All right.

96
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,679
No more.

97
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,990
You win today.

98
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,559
Again again.

99
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,719
All right, one more.

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,510
Young Master.

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,990
Why are you distracted?

102
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,910
A'wen.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,359
Don't you think Bai Shuangshuang

104
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,950
has changed?

105
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,070
What could a woman like her change into?

106
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,670
Unless she's not even her.

107
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,990
(Not Bai Shuangshuang)

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,430
Mother.

109
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,390
Mother.

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,870
Nannan, stop messing around.

111
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,590
Nannan.

112
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,830
Steward Li.

113
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,390
Take your niece back.

114
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,799
Then hurry to the front hall

115
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,150
and help entertain Master Du.

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,630
Yes, Master.

117
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,270
Let's go.

118
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,190
Second Madam.

119
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,030
The child and I were
rehearsing my new play.

120
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,959
He plays my daughter,

121
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,110
Nannan.

122
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,119
What is it?

123
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,190
Moved by the new plot I wrote?

124
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,030
Or perhaps

125
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,959
I stirred up your sorrowful memories.

126
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,550
Or maybe

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,230
you were reminded of our child.

128
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,399
Ye Nanzhao, are you insane?

129
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,750
I'm a famous writer and playwright now.

130
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,719
If I die,

131
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,319
it'll be all over the newspapers.

132
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,879
Don't think that old geezer Lu

133
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,559
can protect you.

134
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,919
How dare you bring that up,

135
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,990
Lin Chishu.

136
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,350
Have you forgotten

137
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,790
how you got famous in the first place?

138
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,670
A plagiarist is still a writer, huh?

139
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,630
And

140
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,479
before you married into the Lu family,

141
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,279
who even cared about your plays?

142
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,679
A bought reputation is still fame?

143
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:57,919
You...

144
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,079
What? Scared?

145
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,230
Did I hit a nerve?

146
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,079
Scared people will find out
you're a fraud?

147
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,679
All show and no substance.

148
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,199
Shut up.

149
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,079
You think you've hidden it well, do you?

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,879
Let me tell you,

151
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,719
everyone knows you're useless.

152
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,239
Shut up.

153
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,519
They just don't say it
because they don't want trouble.

154
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,710
Shut your mouth.

155
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,759
Steward Li.

156
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,310
Quick, go get the Master.

157
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,830
Second Madam has gone mad.

158
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,070
Hurry up.

159
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,230
Once the Master arrives,

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
let's see how long you can keep up
this act, little stepmother.

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,790
Come on.

162
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,390
Keep hitting.

163
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,559
Ow ow ow.

164
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,439
Wait!

165
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,679
Stop.

166
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,559
Nanzhao!

167
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,550
Stop, wait!

168
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,950
Even if you beat me to death,

169
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,990
what good would it do you now?

170
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,230
Do you know what to say
when they arrive later?

171
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,870
I know.

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,759
Nanzhao,

173
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,550
this is all a misunderstanding.

174
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,470
It's all just a misunderstanding.

175
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,030
I'll never expose you.

176
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,990
Get up.

177
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,839
Master.

178
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,310
They're just over there.

179
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,230
You're still so naive.

180
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,550
Ye Nanzhao.

181
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,710
You're finished.

182
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,279
Shuangshuang.

183
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,839
Shuangshuang.

184
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,919
Help someone, quick.

185
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,639
Hurry!

186
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,359
Save her.

187
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,119
Quick!

188
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,910
Father.

189
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,110
Father.

190
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,319
What happened here?

191
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,630
How did she fall in the water?

192
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,879
Master,

193
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,550
he was rehearsing a new play,

194
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,030
and was hitting the child.

195
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,710
I couldn't stand it,
so I said a few words.

196
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,110
Who knew him...

197
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,470
But please don't be angry, Master.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,550
Perhaps he was just too upset.

199
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,279
So,

200
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,159
he accidentally pushed me in.

201
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,999
Father, don't believe her.
That's not what happened, Father.

202
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:45,559
Father.

203
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,119
Don't listen to stepmother's nonsense.

204
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,919
- She...
- Shut up!

205
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,359
Look at you.

206
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,119
This is the fine son-in-law
you brought into my family?

207
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,519
Father.

208
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,870
- It's not...
- You useless!

209
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,390
Come.

210
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,390
Let's go.

211
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,950
Let me help you, Master.

212
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,439
Wenyin. Are you all right?

213
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,830
I have something to tell you.

214
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,750
Bai Shuangshuang is Ye Nanzhao.

215
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,070
Where's the real Bai Shuangshuang?

216
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,560
How would I know?

217
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,750
But I'm certain the current
Second Madam of the Lu family is Ye Nanzhao.

218
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
If you weren't so stupid,

219
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,799
how could Ye Nanzhao still
be alive to cause trouble?

220
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,590
That vile woman is far too cunning.

221
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,679
I'm just a scholar.

222
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,430
Of course I can't match
her dirty tricks.

223
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,110
That woman must be eliminated.

224
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,910
Eliminate her?

225
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,550
You think it's still that easy now?

226
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,039
No matter what happened,

227
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,799
she is now Bai Shuangshuang.

228
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,230
She's my father's darling.

229
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,639
If anything happens to her,

230
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,790
the first one kicked out will be you.

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,190
Then,

232
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,950
let Father be the one to abandon her.

233
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,119
Let her lose her support.

234
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,630
Abandon her?

235
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,999
Back then when she stirred up
trouble with my brother,

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,399
didn't Father still take her side?

237
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,230
He even drove my brother
out to keep her.

238
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,119
That's because he didn't see it
with his own eyes.

239
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,110
And after all, it was your brother.

240
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,190
It happened inside the house.

241
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,190
Family disgrace is easier to hide.

242
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,590
But if it happens in public,

243
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,750
and more people see it,

244
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,279
then it'll be harder to conceal.

245
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,670
What do you mean by that?

246
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,830
(Isn't Father attending)

247
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,959
(the banquet hosted by Boss Du,
the President)

248
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,830
(of Jiang City Chamber
of Commercein a few days?)

249
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,150
(The banquet will gather
all the elites of Jiang City.)

250
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,070
(We'll create an opportunity)

251
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,430
(to separate her from Father.)

252
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,719
Who are you?

253
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,950
What do you want?

254
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,110
Let go of me.

255
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,879
Let go.

256
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,879
Stop struggling, Madam.

257
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,519
It's useless.

258
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,199
We're just doing our job for money.

259
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,270
If you must blame someone,
blame your own bad luck.

260
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,910
(Give her an aphrodisiac.)

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,519
(Then give her a man.)

262
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,919
The rest is up to you.

263
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,990
(Let her, in front of everyone,)

264
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,630
(be nailed for her promiscuity.)

265
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,839
You scared me to death.

266
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,230
My little sweetheart.

267
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,790
Master Lu hates betrayal the most.

268
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,079
If he finds out about this,

269
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,830
let's see if you can still survive.

270
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,390
Before you die,

271
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,870
have a bit of fun with me.
