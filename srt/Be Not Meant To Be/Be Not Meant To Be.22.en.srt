=Be Not Meant To Be=

2
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,712
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,599
(Boss.)

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,239
(The letter Bai Shuangshuang received)

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,910
(is indeed with First Madam.)

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,550
(According to the letter,)

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,399
(Sealed)
(its sender should be the one)

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,150
(abducted the Cheng sisters back then.)

9
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:20,999
(The sender's surname is Zheng,)

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,190
(and he lives in Nan City.)

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,719
(I found out)

12
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,039
(this man named Zheng Sandao)

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,950
(works as an enforcer
for an underground casino.)

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,919
(People like that
often change their residence.)

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,590
(No one knows his whereabouts.)

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,870
(He can't be found?)

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,190
(Then find a way to lure him out.)

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,670
(Lu Zhuo, what's an enforcer?)

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,990
(In underground gambling dens,)

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
(those who win big may leave alive,)

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,360
(but not with the money.)

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,300
(The moment they excuse themselves
from the game,)

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,230
(they're killed
and robbed by the casino's enforcers.)

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,310
(Then I know
how you're going to lure him out.)

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,710
(Lu Zhuo. Let me help you with that.)

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,470
Big or small?

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,030
(Out of curiosity,)

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,759
(I secretly practiced dice rolling.)

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,359
(Though I'm not good at it,)

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,320
(it's enough to get by.)

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,960
(This time, I can put my skills to use.)

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,700
(Here's the dealer's token. As agreed,
you'll spend a day working there.)

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,750
(Those gamblers
won't play with strangers.)

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,870
(So)

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,439
(A'wen will pretend to follow my lead)

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,830
(so as to make them bet against us.)

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,910
(Nanzhao, use the method I taught you.)

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,950
(Give them a few early wins.)

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,479
(Once they drop their guard)

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,230
(and bet all their chips,)

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,630
(we turn the tables and take it all.)

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,430
(That way,
we become the biggest winners.)

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,510
(When that happens,)

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,670
(the casino will surely make a move.)

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,150
(Understood.)

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,350
(Leave it to me.)

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,510
Cut it out. One more round!

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,919
What do we do, A'wen?

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,999
Don't get too close.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,590
Don't alert him.

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,750
Mister!

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,830
Don't move!

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,319
Mister.

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,159
You don't get to leave

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,430
after winning the money.

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,670
Get out of my way!

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,030
Zheng Sandao.

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,519
Mister, you've got the wrong person.

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,390
Still denying it?

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,110
Why were you tailing our boss?

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,159
Mister.

62
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,079
I picked up something
you dropped at the casino.

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,439
It looked valuable.

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,319
The dealer

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,119
said it was yours,

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,239
so I went after you,

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,639
hoping to get a tip from you.

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,670
Search me if you don't believe me.
It's in my pocket.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,190
Stay still.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,910
Boss.

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,750
It's really yours.

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,199
Thank you, mister.

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,110
Thank you, mister.

74
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,430
How strange.

75
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,230
They said Zheng Sandao would come.

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,350
But where is he?

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,270
Oh no.

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,950
Nanzhao.

79
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,790
Let's go!

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,110
Sir.

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,070
Just go straight from here.

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,430
Zheng Sandao?

83
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,350
Since you know my name,

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,310
how dare you cheat in the casino?

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,079
Hand over the money you won

86
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,350
at once.

87
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,270
Or I'll put a bullet in you!

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,350
The money

89
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,839
isn't with me.

90
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,350
It's with my fiancé.

91
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,350
Well,

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,470
why don't you come with me to get it?

93
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,919
Trying to pull a trick on me, huh?

94
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,110
I'll go after your lover after dealing with you!

95
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,759
Don't move!

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,390
Gentlemen...

97
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,519
Spare me,

98
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,279
please!

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,799
I don't want the money anymore.
Take it as my tribute to you.

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,950
Money?

101
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,879
Zheng Sandao.

102
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,079
Our young master is rich enough

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,119
to buy the entire Nan City.

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,270
A'wen.

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,750
Then what are you here for?

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,750
We came to settle a score with you.

107
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,870
Do you remember what you've done?

108
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,190
Wait...

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,470
What have I done?

110
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,990
I haven't...

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,639
I haven't done anything wrong.

112
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,670
Did you abduct two girls

113
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,599
fifteen years ago?

114
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,710
Abduct?

115
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,110
No...

116
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,510
I did sell two little girls
fifteen years ago.

117
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,479
But

118
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,279
my wife rescued them.

119
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,719
They were orphans,

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,199
so I sold them off.

121
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,039
But that wasn't abduction.

122
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,750
I didn't abduct them!

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,790
Where's your wife now?

124
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,190
That's right.

125
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,110
I did abduct the girls.

126
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,310
Why did you do that?

127
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,470
Because Cheng Qingping
killed my daughter.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,310
I wanted him to feel my pain.

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,439
Master, I beg of you!

130
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,439
Lend me some money

131
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,679
and save my girl,

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,479
Master!

133
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,519
The doctor said

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,239
if she doesn't get medicine soon,
she won't make it,

135
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,839
Master.

136
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,199
I beg of you,

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,119
Master!

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,439
Drag her away

139
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,790
Master, do me a favor!
Please save my girl, Master!

140
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,799
I worked for the Chengs

141
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,030
for over ten years.

142
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,279
The eldest young lady

143
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,439
was raised on my milk.

144
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,030
I'd given it my all.

145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,550
The medicine cost

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,150
even less than a day's tea expense
for Cheng Qingping.

147
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,950
Yet he refused to save my daughter.

148
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,190
He said

149
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,590
giving money to servants
was against the rules.

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,239
Everyone

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,230
would follow suit after that.

152
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,670
Dear.

153
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,550
Why didn't you tell me about this?

154
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,950
What good would that do?

155
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,999
You were always out gambling.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,919
Otherwise,

157
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,310
we could've afforded
to buy our girl the medicine.

158
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,550
So

159
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,190
you kidnapped
Cheng Qingping's daughters.

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,630
I know I was wrong

161
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,830
Those children were innocent.

162
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,439
Now

163
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,830
I have liver disease.

164
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,550
I'm being punished for my action.

165
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,350
If I had the chance,

166
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,719
I would give my worthless life

167
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,830
to make up for my wrongs!

168
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,310
I sympathize with you

169
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,830
and condemn Cheng Qingping's coldness.

170
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,350
But because of you,

171
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,870
my big sister
never saw our parents again.

172
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,430
Your big sister?

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,110
You're
Cheng Qingping's younger daughter?

174
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,590
You mean Miss Jingshu passed away?

175
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,790
Well,

176
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,559
the Chengs have found her, no?

177
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,670
She's not my sister.

178
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,310
She's a mere impostor.

179
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,279
Thus,

180
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,630
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

181
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,199
Are you going to expose her?

182
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,879
Yes.

183
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,790
Do you have any idea?

184
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,550
Of course I do.

185
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,590
You two killed my foster son.

186
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,039
How dare you still show up here
in my residence.

187
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,950
Mr. Cheng.

188
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,630
We're unarmed.

189
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,110
And we're here

190
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,790
to have a sincere talk with you.

191
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,110
I'm the one who killed him

192
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,999
But Yan Jinxing

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,910
was determined to kill Nanzhao.

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,950
I did it all for Nanzhao.

195
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,070
You're turning the tables on us now.

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,430
Nanzhao was Jinxing's fiancée.

197
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,470
How could he

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,830
want to harm her?

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,310
He never liked me.

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,990
He wanted to marry me for my identity.

201
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,950
This jade pendant
has been with me since childhood.

202
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,430
I bet you know it, Master Cheng.

203
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,190
You are...

204
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,759
Mr. Cheng,

205
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,710
she's your real younger daughter.

206
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,150
Back then

207
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,670
I was sold to the Yan family as a maid.

208
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,310
When Yan Jinxing learned who I was,

209
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,910
he wanted to marry me

210
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,630
so as to become your son-in-law.

211
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,830
He even planned to get rid of me

212
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,070
and take over the Cheng family estate.

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,470
If what you say is true,

214
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,350
why would he help me find Jingshu?

215
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,350
The one Yan Jinxing brought home
was never your daughter.

216
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,310
She's his cousin

217
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,559
and my half-sister.

218
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,270
Her birthmark is actually a tattoo.

219
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,350
That was all Yan Jinxing's doing.

220
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,030
Then

221
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,630
why would he do so?

222
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,479
He's coveted
the Cheng family property all along.

223
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,159
When he found out

224
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,159
you didn't plan to let him have it,

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,670
he came up with another scheme.

226
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,519
He involved Lu Wenyin in all this
to make her his last resort,

227
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,479
in case I refused to cooperate with him.

228
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,510
And why should I

229
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,070
believe you're telling the truth?

230
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,550
I won't just take your word for it.

231
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,150
What proof do you have?

232
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,950
Mr. Cheng.

233
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,719
Of course we can prove it.

234
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,470
I've brought the witness to you.

235
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,230
Come in.

236
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,870
I'm sorry, Master.

237
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,199
Please forgive me.

238
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,230
Nanny Xu?

239
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,710
Master.

240
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,870
I abducted the young ladies

241
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,039
because I resented you

242
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,870
for not lending me money

243
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,510
and letting my girl die.

244
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,990
So it was you.

245
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,350
I went after all of my enemies.

246
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,710
To my surprise,

247
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,719
the one who hurt my girls

248
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,750
was their nanny.

249
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,390
Why didn't I think of it sooner?

250
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,599
How could you

251
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,959
lay hands on my girls under three?

252
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,599
Someone!

253
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,119
Yes.

254
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,110
Master Cheng.

255
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,870
Hear her out first.

256
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,870
Master.

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,590
Even if you shot me dead today,

258
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,630
I'd have no complaint.

259
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,270
I have liver disease,

260
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,799
and my days are numbered.

261
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,559
Please

262
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,950
give me a chance to atone for my sins.

263
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,359
How?

264
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,879
I raised Miss Jingshu.

265
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,350
So all these years,

266
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,839
I would ask around

267
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,550
about her situation every so often.

268
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,039
After I sold her,

269
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,790
she was passed from family to family.

270
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,830
Eventually,

271
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,470
she was sold to work at a dance hall

272
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,990
and given the name Bai Shuangshuang.

273
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,319
She then married
into the Lu family in Jiang City

274
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,519
and became a concubine.

275
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,750
Where is she now?

276
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,750
She died in an accident.

277
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,430
However, Master,

278
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,910
I swear

279
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,239
the one living here

280
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,950
is definitely not
your biological daughter.

281
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,190
Do you have any evidence?

282
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,830
After I took the girls,

283
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,199
Miss Jingshu couldn't stop crying

284
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,510
and insisted on going home.

285
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,110
During the struggle,

286
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,270
I accidentally pushed her over.

287
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,750
Her head kept bleeding.

288
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,150
After the wound healed,

289
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,030
there was a lengthy scar on her head.

290
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,759
Only I know about this.

291
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,399
If that lady
who claims to be your daughter

292
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,879
has no scar on her head,

293
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,110
then she's not the real one.

294
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,199
Someone.

295
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,639
Yes.

296
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,799
Bring the young lady here.

297
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,510
Yes, sir.

298
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,150
Father.

299
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,270
We have guests today.

300
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,630
Miss Jingshu.

301
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,510
We finally meet again.

302
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,870
Miss Jingshu.

303
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,470
Don't you remember me?

304
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,830
Why?

305
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,030
Don't you recognize your nanny?

306
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,510
Of course I do.

307
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,430
It's been so many years.

308
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,990
I didn't recognize her right away.

309
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,790
Miss Jingshu.

310
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,110
You loved it
when I combed your hair as a child.

311
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,470
I even brought
the little wooden comb you loved.

312
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,350
Have a look.

313
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,270
It's been over twenty years.

314
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,710
Why do you look so worn out?

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,430
Truth be told, Miss Jingshu,

316
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,910
I suffer from a terminal illness.

317
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,390
So my days are numbered.

318
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,430
This time,

319
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,990
I just wanted to see you one last time.

320
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,950
Let me comb your hair once more.

321
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,400
I guess there's no need for that.

322
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,230
Just grant her wish.

323
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,990
Miss Jingshu.

324
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,910
Here.

325
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,110
Come.

326
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,710
Master.

327
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,750
She has no scar on her head.

328
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,830
What scar? What nonsense
are you talking about?
