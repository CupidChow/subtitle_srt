3
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,890
Lu Wenyin.

4
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,190
Drop the act already.

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Only Nanny Xu knows

6
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,430
how to tell the real first young lady
of Cheng family from a fake one.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,750
Father!

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,190
Don't listen to their nonsense.

9
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,959
Ye Nanzhao must have bought them off

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,919
to drive us apart.

11
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,199
I'm your biological daughter...

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,799
Master Cheng.

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,990
As you can see,

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,110
not only did she deceive you, but she's
also not remorseful for it at all.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,350
Ye Nanzhao.

16
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,479
Don't make me...

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,390
Well,

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,310
how do you explain this?

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,679
This... This jade pendant...

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,430
That's right.

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,270
I've proved my identity.

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,950
Lu Wenyin,

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,350
do you think we're twins?

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,510
Father!

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,159
You've seen my birthmark.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,110
I'm truly your biological daughter.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,550
A'wen has found

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,870
the tattooist
who got you that birthmark.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,230
No...

30
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,590
You pretended to be my daughter

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,630
and tried to seize my family property.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,950
You expect me to forgive you?

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,479
Someone!

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,150
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,959
Take her away!

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,790
Yes, sir!

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,790
What are you doing?

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,550
I said, take her away!

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,119
Cheng Qingping.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,799
I gave you a chance.

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,119
You old fool.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,830
Wait...

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,519
Have you lost your mind?

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,030
Trying to go against me?

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,310
Thanks to your busy schedule,

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,550
you haven't had time
to take care of the household.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,110
Thus, I've had the chance

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,919
to make these disobedient ones

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,239
take my side.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,159
Cheng Qingping.

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,039
Open your eyes and look around.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,270
Are your soldiers here?

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,190
Tell those out there

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,350
that Master Cheng has fallen sick.

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,959
Starting today,

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,670
I'll be in charge

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,359
of this household.

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,030
Lu Wenyin. Do you really think
those few men of yours in Nan City

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,710
are enough to trap us?

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,190
Lu Zhuo!

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,350
I knew you've sneaked your soldiers
from Jiang City to Nan City.

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,070
But so what?

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,910
You won't get to leave this place.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,030
Don't worry.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,270
He's not going to die.

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,479
He needs to stay alive

67
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,950
so that I can have more fun.

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,230
Take them away.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,030
Move!

70
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,070
Move!

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,310
Ye Nanzhao.

72
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,310
Let's play a game.

73
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,390
I'm giving you a chance to save Lu Zhuo.

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,919
Whip Lu Zhuo until I'm happy

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,710
and I'll spare his life tonight.

76
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,999
Otherwise,

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,390
I'll shoot him to death now.

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,230
What do you think about this game?

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,270
Lu Wenyin.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,870
You can have my life anytime.

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,190
Just let Nanzhao go.

82
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,230
Sure.

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,150
Kneel and beg me for it, then.

84
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,230
Kneel.

85
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,230
Can you let her go now?

86
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,630
But I still want
to play the game with you.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,560
I'll let you go
when you're done whipping him.

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,990
Why?

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,950
Aren't you going to save him?

90
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,710
If so, I'll do it myself.

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,590
Nanzhao.

92
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,990
It's okay.

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,390
I can stand the pain.

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,190
Do it.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,910
I missed it.

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,910
Three.

97
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,830
Two.

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,310
It's up to you
whether you want to save him or not.

99
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,670
Harder.

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,590
Carry on with that.

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,790
Truth be told,

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,959
the Cheng family property
is nothing to me.

103
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,710
I just want
to make your lives miserable.

104
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,790
Harder.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,990
You can't never outdo me.

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,710
I must

107
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,670
avenge Chishu completely.

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,510
Is that enough?

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,919
That's about it.

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,430
I'm tired already.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,950
We'll continue it tomorrow.

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,150
Lu Zhuo.

113
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,670
Are you alright?

114
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,879
Don't you worry about me.

115
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,350
How can I not?

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,870
According to our plan,

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,150
A'wen and our men

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,110
are on the way here from Nan City.

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,190
Since I've failed to show up,

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,750
A'wen must be looking for us.

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,230
But...

122
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,350
Can you make it until then?

123
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,150
As long as you're fine,

124
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,270
I'll do anything.

125
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,070
Miss Jingshu!

126
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,430
This is bad, Miss Jingshu!

127
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,879
Something's happened!

128
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,360
We're in trouble, Miss Jingshu!

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,320
What's all this noise?

130
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,159
Yang A'wen is here with their men.
And they've just forced their way in.

131
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,439
How many are there? What's there to fear?

132
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,399
That's not it.

133
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,639
He brought a lot of men.

134
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,710
They've already surrounded the residence

135
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,079
I heard they've been secretly

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,710
dispatching their men to Nan City.

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Almost everyone
from the Qinglong Society is here.

138
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,310
What?

139
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,799
Lu Zhuo.

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,039
Ye Nanzhao.

141
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,030
I'll send you two to hell right away.

142
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,430
Both of you sure are affectionate.

143
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,759
Too bad.

144
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,990
I've had enough fun.

145
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,230
Lu Wenyin.

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,630
Since you hate me,

147
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,079
just come at me.

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,150
Let Lu Zhuo go.

149
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,190
Nanzhao...

150
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,270
Be patient.

151
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,550
One at a time. It's your turn after this.

152
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,510
Lu Wenyin.

153
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,870
What are you doing?

154
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,150
Young Master!

155
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,750
Lu Zhuo!

156
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,959
Lu Wenyin!

157
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,710
Stop it!

158
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,959
If you so much as hurt her,

159
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,670
I'll take your pathetic life

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,630
even if you flee
to the ends of the earth.

161
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,359
Don't worry, Zhuo.

162
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,670
I won't.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,870
Ye Nanzhao is like my talisman.

164
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,750
I can't bring myself to harm her.

165
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,439
But I'll decide

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,839
how and where

167
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,270
she lives.

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,639
Get me a car.

169
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,950
One of my men will drive.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,990
Let us go.

171
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,790
Didn't you hear me?

172
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,510
A'wen.

173
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,950
Get the car.

174
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,910
Yes.

175
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,990
Young Master.

176
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,350
The car is ready.

177
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,270
Put the gun down!

178
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,670
Put it down.

179
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,070
No one is to follow us.

180
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,399
If I see any of your cars,

181
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,670
I'll shoot her on the spot

182
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,670
Get in.

183
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,870
Go faster.

184
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,279
Young Master!

185
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,070
Young Master!

186
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,230
Nanzhao!

187
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,590
Young Master!

188
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,230
Here.

189
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,710
Careful.

190
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,412
(Cheng Residence
Half a month later)

191
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,879
Lu Zhuo.

192
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,910
You're awake.

193
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,590
Why did you have to harm me like that?

194
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,030
Bai Shuangshuang!

195
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,070
Young Master!

196
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,830
Let go!

197
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,630
Yang A'wen.

198
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,439
Why are you defending Bai Shuangshuang?

199
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,159
Young Master,

200
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,830
this is Miss Ye!

201
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,830
Miss Ye?

202
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,750
Why is she here?

203
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,070
Have you forgotten, Young Master?

204
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,350
That night,
after Lu Wenyin abducted her,

205
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,510
you led us all
to search the whole city.

206
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,950
Miss Ye was locked up by Lu Wenyin
in the dockside warehouse.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
She planned to send her off
to Nanyang the next day.

208
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,110
Later,

209
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,039
she sent us a signal

210
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,399
using fireworks in the warehouse.

211
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,590
She managed to tell us
her precise location.

212
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,350
Just as Lu Wenyin
was about to kill Miss Ye,

213
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,630
you were there in time to save her.

214
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,710
But Lu Wenyin's gun

215
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,630
went off the moment you shot her dead.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,030
That ignited those boxes of fireworks,
causing the warehouse to explode.

217
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,430
To protect Miss Ye,

218
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,630
you were badly injured.

219
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,750
Young Master.

220
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,830
Don't you remember any of this?

221
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,950
A'wen.

222
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,270
Go get the doctor.

223
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,159
Your young master seems
to have forgotten me.

224
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,910
Sure.

225
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:00,862
(Nan City
One month later)

226
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,150
Miss Ye.

227
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,479
The doctor said

228
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,710
my memory may not recover so soon.

229
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,239
A'wen has told me

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,510
about our past relationship.

231
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,790
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,350
I can understand your grief
over losing a loved one.

233
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,390
But I truly cannot return your feelings.

234
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,950
I can stay by your side
as you slowly recover.

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,750
We can even spend more time together.

236
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,910
Didn't the doctor say so?

237
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,279
You'll recover in no time

238
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,830
with proper care.

239
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,150
Miss Ye, you may have misunderstood.

240
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,639
I'm not that eager

241
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,830
to regain my memory.

242
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,670
And you're aware

243
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,510
that Bai Shuangshuang was my enemy.

244
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,150
I really can't stand seeing
this face of yours

245
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,950
and go on living.

246
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,390
That's your thought.

247
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,959
It's not what Lu Zhuo thinks.

248
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,630
Don't play word games with me.

249
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,740
I have something to attend to.

250
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,870
I've paid for all this.

251
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,710
Stay as long as you like.
