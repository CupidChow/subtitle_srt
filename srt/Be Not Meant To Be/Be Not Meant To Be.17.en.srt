00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,712
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,950
Lu Zhuo!

4
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,190
Why are you here?

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,710
Don't get me wrong.

6
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,150
Miss Ye almost fell down,

7
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,550
so I reached out to help her.

8
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,390
Young Master Lu.

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,230
I didn't expect you to be here so soon.

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,870
Dinner is ready.

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,310
Please.

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,510
Godfather.

13
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,630
Is he the honored guest you invited?

14
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,070
Yes.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,910
That's right.

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,270
I specially
invited Young Master Lu here.

17
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,710
Nanzhao.

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
Actually, the reason I asked you here

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,350
is to give you something.

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,830
After the last proposal,

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,070
I forgot to put the ring on you.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,270
I'll make it up this time.

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,030
Jinxing.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,630
It's just a formality.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,670
It doesn't matter much.

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,230
Nanzhao.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,630
I love you.

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,479
Actually, all this time,

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,350
I've treated you as my closest family.

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,230
From now on,

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,270
we'll truly be one family.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,990
Alright.

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,710
Mr. Cheng.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,390
I arrived at just the right time.

35
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,519
Indeed.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,359
Let's talk inside.

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,150
Please.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,630
First, let me make some introductions.

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,839
The lady sitting on my right

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,639
is Jinxing's fiancée,

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,070
Miss Ye Nanzhao.

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,559
And the gentleman on my left

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,270
is the honored guest
I specially invited today,

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,079
the leader
of the biggest gang in Jiang City,

45
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,759
the Qinglong Society,

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,710
Lu Zhuo.

47
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,310
Young Master Lu.

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,790
This is my godson,

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,230
Yan Jinxing, the governor of Nan City.

50
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,950
Godfather.

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,679
We've actually met before.

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,150
He was the one who hijacked
that shipment at the docks two months ago.

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,430
Jinxing,

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,959
there were some misunderstandings
between our families.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,590
We had a few unpleasant run-ins.

56
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,590
Luckily, that's all in the past.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,319
This time, Young Master Lu has come
to seek a collaboration with us.

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,359
So let's just wipe the slate clean.

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,239
From now on,
our families will join hands,

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,430
making money together.

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,430
Why?

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,310
You don't want to work with me,
Governor Yan?

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,519
Of course I do.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,510
In fact,

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,079
you're technically my cousin.

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,559
That's right, Jinxing.

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,630
But we haven't really
spent much time together before.

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,230
I'm not all that familiar with you.

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,430
Still,

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,990
your fiancée, Miss Ye, and I

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,110
know each other.

72
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,190
Young Master Lu, you do love to joke.

73
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,479
Since we're all acquainted,

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,710
let's not stand on ceremony.

75
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,390
Here,

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,679
let's raise our glasses.

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,230
Here's to a long and prosperous
partnership between our families.

78
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,519
- To a pleasant cooperation.
- Cheers.

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,630
To a pleasant cooperation.

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,350
Nanzhao.

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,799
For the wedding,

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,630
how about we hold it by the lake?

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,879
I think a church is rather tacky.

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,350
You definitely wouldn't like it.

85
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,519
I even found
the most famous tailor in Nan City

86
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,830
to make your wedding gown.

87
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,630
The design is the latest style.

88
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,950
I want you to be
the most beautiful bride.

89
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,879
Sorry,

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,910
Mr. Cheng. The long trip has tired me out.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,159
I'll head back to rest.

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,110
Please enjoy your meal.

93
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,479
How inconsiderate of me.

94
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,590
Please, Young Master Lu.

95
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,950
Come, come.

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,710
Here.

97
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,919
Here.

98
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,230
Let's dig in.

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,870
Nanzhao.

100
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,319
This is Master Jiang,

101
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,950
the most celebrated tailor in Nan City.

102
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,839
If there's any issue with the gown,

103
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,959
just let him know.

104
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,070
Master Jiang is renowned in Nan City.

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,839
Even I heard of him
upon my arrival here.

106
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,759
I'll trouble you, then.

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,559
Madam, you flatter me.

108
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,119
It's my honor to be designing

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,510
the governor's wife's wedding gown.

110
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,639
My female assistant

111
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,959
is already waiting inside.

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,239
She'll take
the most precise measurements for you.

113
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,759
And I

114
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,919
will make adjustments
based on those measurements,

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,550
ensuring it's perfect.

116
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,159
Have a seat.

117
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,950
Governor Yan.

118
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,519
Your wife has such poise,

119
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,159
making her a true lady of distinction.

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,790
How blessed you are.

121
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,390
Lu Zhuo?

122
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,270
Lin.

123
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,750
Make sure you take
careful measurements for Madam.

124
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,950
What are you doing?

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,390
You can leave now.

126
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,599
I just need a reason

127
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,190
to get into a fight with Yan Jinxing.

128
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,679
What exactly are you up to?

129
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,910
What do you think?

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,550
I'm taking measurements.

131
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,350
Otherwise, how will you
explain yourself to Yan Jinxing?

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,830
Madam.

133
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,679
Please relax your body

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,790
and stand naturally.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,750
Governor Yan.

136
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,879
The first step

137
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,430
is to measure her height.

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,910
This will determine
the overall length of the gown.

139
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,630
Height, five feet.

140
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,110
Lin.

141
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,830
Are you done yet?

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,870
Height, five feet.

143
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,950
Next is shoulder width.

144
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,839
The shoulder width
will determine if the gown's design

145
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,030
fits properly.

146
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,070
Shoulder width, one foot and two inches.

147
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,999
Shoulder width, one foot and two inches.

148
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,110
Next, we'll measure the bust.

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
The bust measurement ensures
the top of the gown

150
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,150
is neither too tight nor too loose.

151
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,590
I'm telling you.

152
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,950
If you struggle any more,

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,110
you'll just waste more time.

154
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,110
If Yan Jinxing comes in,

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,990
you won't be able to explain yourself.

156
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,710
Lin.

157
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,910
What's going on?

158
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,430
Why is it taking so long today?

159
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,590
Hurry up.

160
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,870
Nanzhao.

161
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,430
Is there a problem?

162
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,790
It's fine.

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,670
Two feet five inches.

164
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,030
Next,

165
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:03,150
the waist and hip measurements
matter as much.

166
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,239
These determine

167
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,910
whether the gown's hems
and lines flow smoothly.

168
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,350
Lu Zhuo, that's enough!

169
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,510
Enough?

170
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,790
I've never even seen you
in a wedding gown.

171
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,710
He can't be the first to see it.

172
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,639
We'll also measure the sleeve length...

173
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,599
Don't go too far.

174
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,750
Too far?

175
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,430
If he were to see you

176
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,679
kissing me in the wedding gown

177
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,950
meant for him,

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,750
wouldn't that be worse?

179
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,750
Let's confirm the style again.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,710
Do you want to kiss me,

181
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,790
or do you want him to see it?

182
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,910
I hate you, Lu Zhuo.

183
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,159
Believe it or not?
I'll lift the curtain right now

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,430
and let him see?

185
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,750
Oh.

186
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,679
So Madam was trying on the main gown.

187
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,670
Looks like you wanted
to surprise the governor.

188
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,630
How lovely.

189
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,639
Madam.

190
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,710
Would you like to try another style?

191
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,870
Yes.

192
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,119
No rush.

193
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,990
Take your time.

194
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,630
It's fine.

195
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,590
This one is perfect.

196
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,630
Let's go.

197
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,510
Lin.

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,350
Pack up the other dresses inside.

199
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,710
Stop.

200
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,830
What's in your hand?

201
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,070
An invitation from Madam to a friend.

202
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,399
Fine,

203
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,999
you may go.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,950
Yes, sir.

205
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,870
Nanzhao.

206
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,639
(Invitation, Lu Zhuo)

207
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,590
What's this?

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,790
I'm writing our wedding invitations.

209
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,070
This one is for Lu Zhuo.

210
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,030
Give it to him.

211
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,030
So you've really let him go.

212
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,039
Of course.

213
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,590
I never cling to
what doesn't belong to me.

214
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,390
I'm different.

215
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,670
My heart has always belonged to you.

216
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,599
If you want it,

217
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,630
you can take it anytime.

218
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,630
Carry on with it.

219
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,710
Zhuo.

220
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:58,697
(Invitation, Lu Zhuo)
Here's our wedding invitation.

221
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,119
She asked me to give it to you.

222
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,430
We'd love to have you there.

223
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,830
How generous of you.
Aren't you afraid I'll steal your bride?

224
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,150
You must be kidding.

225
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,510
You'd need
the bride's consent to do that.

226
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,390
And right now, I doubt your cousin-in-law
would go with you.

227
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,590
If you don't want to attend it,

228
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,670
I won't insist.

229
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,870
Sure.

230
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,439
Not only will I be there for it,

231
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,430
but I'll also
prepare a grand gift for you.

232
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,010
No need for a gift.

233
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,719
We're family.
You need not stand on ceremony.

234
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,599
Why?

235
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,830
Are you afraid to accept it?

236
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,550
I'll look forward to your gift, then.

237
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,710
How cruel!

238
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,599
Young Master.

239
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,279
You're even giving him a gift?

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,199
If it were me,

241
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,270
I'd give him a slap instead!

242
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,710
Who says a gift has to be a joyful one?

243
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,870
Get me a camera.

244
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,999
What does that mean?

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,350
How can a camera upset him?
