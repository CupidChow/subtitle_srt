00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,640
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,910
How did you hurt your hand?

4
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,190
I'm fine.

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,070
Wenyin.

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,199
I told you. Your hands
are meant for writing poetry.

7
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,319
They mustn't get hurt.

8
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,470
Why won't you listen?

9
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,190
I'm sorry, Wenyin.

10
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,599
When I saw she was unharmed,

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,950
I acted on impulse.

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,519
From now on, let me handle that woman.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,919
I refuse to believe

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,030
she can always cheat death.

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,470
Don't worry.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,190
Let's wait until after tomorrow.

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,559
Of course.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,599
You've prepared this new play
for so long.

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,199
It's your debut performance.

20
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,079
You mustn't let that dead woman

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,670
ruin your mood.

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,790
You really understand me best.

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,639
I wish you a successful premiere,

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,230
my great writer.

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,190
Which poem would you like
to hear tonight?

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,190
A new one.

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,350
Something no one has ever heard,

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,590
just like your new play.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,559
Madam.

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,510
This is a theatre ticket
from Young Master.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,079
Just as you suspected,

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,790
they still have more tricks to play.

33
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,070
(Peace)
Hong Dou.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,679
If anything happens to me...

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,790
Madam,

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,479
why not cancel tomorrow?

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,519
There's no need to risk your life.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,310
(Peace)

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,030
Hong Dou.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,710
This path was my choice.

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,719
No matter what,

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,110
I must walk it to the end.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,470
Madam.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,790
By the way,

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,510
is Young Master home today?

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,399
He is.

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,830
Are you planning
to visit him tonight, Madam?

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,190
Since I've decided
to end everything tomorrow,

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,430
then the debts I owe

50
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,270
must also be repaid in full.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,430
Young Master Lu.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,750
Coming to see me this late,

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,350
what brings you here?

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,190
I have something for you.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,990
A gift for me?

56
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,510
Is this to repay my favor?

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,359
You helped me at the dance hall
last time.

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,270
Thank you.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,750
My favor isn't so easily repaid.

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,350
It depends on the gift

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,750
if it's good enough.

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,750
(Peace)

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,990
You're part of the Qinglong Society.

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,630
Danger is inevitable.

65
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,910
This is made of rosewood.

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,270
It symbolises peace.

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,430
You...

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,830
You made this yourself?

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,390
Maybe it's not worthy.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,110
You probably won't like it.

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,039
How about this?

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,590
I'll give you something else later.
Just give this one back first.

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,150
Who gives someone a gift

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,710
and then asks for it back?

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,199
So, have I repaid

76
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,470
this favor?

77
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,750
You're that eager
to settle things with me?

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,159
The matter between us

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,750
is not that easy to end.

80
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,390
Let me tell you,

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,350
You and I

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,950
got a long way to go.

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,110
(Lu Zhuo)

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,870
(There is no later.)

85
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,919
(Tomorrow is the end.)

Front page headline!

87
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,999
New play by famed author Lin Chishu

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,559
premieres tonight
at Jiang City Grand Theatre.

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,310
Front page headline!

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,239
First of all,

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
thank you all for joining us today.

92
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,479
We've invited you here to celebrate the premiere
of my son-in-law Lin Chishu's new play.

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,190
His first performance.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,630
We hope you'll all show your support.

95
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,479
On behalf of my son-in-law,

96
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,110
I thank you all.

97
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,639
Master Lu,

98
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,439
your son-in-law is no ordinary man.

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,470
He's the most celebrated talent
in all of Jiang City.

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,919
Publishing books, writing plays,

101
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,679
he's a true scholar.

102
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,519
A cultured man.

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,479
Director Ma, you flatter my son-in-law.

104
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,630
Director Ma,

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,559
our Chishu's plays

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,230
really are always sold out.

107
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,350
Master Lin,

108
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,159
how long until the performance begins?

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,759
Brother, what's the rush?

110
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,319
Chishu hasn't even spoken yet.

111
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,999
Chishu,

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,519
let's not waste any more time.

113
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,670
Let the show begin.

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,830
Alright, Father.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,550
Don't be nervous.

116
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,830
All of Jiang City's elite
are here tonight.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,039
After tonight,

118
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,599
you'll be the most influential writer
in Jiang City.

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,670
Go on now.

120
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,470
Hurry.

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,550
This is the work I'm most proud of.

122
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,639
It tells the story of a young couple

123
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,670
and their turbulent love affair.

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,959
Today,

125
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,230
I welcome you all

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,750
to be the very first

127
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,350
to witness it.

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,990
(The Execution of Chen Shimei)

129
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,999
Why did they change the play?

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,430
Is it an added performance?

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,790
No idea.

132
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,830

Why are

138
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,590
your eyes so red?

139
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,359
It's Qianji Poison.

140
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,959
At first, it just causes bloodshot eyes,

141
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,190
blurring vision.

142
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,270
Excellent! Bravo!

143
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,550
Wonderful performance!

the antidote obediently,

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,270

That's the second stage
of Qianji Poison.

152
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,839
Dizziness, tremors,

153
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,599
even convulsions.

154
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,199
Shut up!

155
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,359
Give me the antidote!

156
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,039
Lin Chishu, you're a joke.

157
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,519
You killed me. You killed my daughter.

158
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,999
There's a blood feud between us.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,870
Why would I ever give you the antidote?

160
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,750
Go to hell with the poison!

161
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,390
The poison's taking hold.

162
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,150
Nanzhao.

163
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,390
I was wrong.

164
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,750
I did you wrong.

165
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,950
I'll kneel before you!

166
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,719
I was heartless.

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,799
I'm vile.

168
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,310
I was vain and greedy.

169
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,750
I'll tell you the truth,

170
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,550
it was all Lu Wenyin's doing!

171
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,070
This is "The Execution of Chen Shimei".

172
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,510
Must be an encore scene

173
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,679
to warm up the audience.

174
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,439
She forced me not only to kill you,
but to kill our daughter as well!

175
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,599
I didn't want this either, Nanzhao.

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,150
Don't say that to me.

177
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,919
Your repentance should be for Nannan.

178
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,350
Yes, you're right.

179
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,919
Nannan.

180
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,679
Nannan, Daddy was wrong.

181
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,119
Please forgive me, my darling girl.
You don't want Daddy to die, do you?

182
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,830
Daddy, let go of Mum.

183
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,870
Mum!

184
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,639
Let go of Mum!

185
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,519
Nannan!

186
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,470
I don't want to...

187
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,150
Nannan, stop it.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,950
Nannan!

189
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,150
