00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
(Lu Residence)

4
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,300
It's all right now.

5
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,510
You're safe.

6
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,550
What's wrong?

7
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,230
Don't you recognise me?

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,750
All these years,

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,350
I've never stopped thinking about you.

10
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,790
I'm sure you have a lot
to say to me too.

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,430
(It seems)

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,270
(they must have been lovers.)

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,390
Stepmother.

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,710
(Stepmother?)

15
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,470
(Did he just call me "Stepmother"?)

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,830
(Then that woman...)

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,870
(She must be his father's concubine.)

18
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,710
(Could it be they're committing incest?)

19
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,750
Let go.

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,550
Now you know fear?

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,479
Do you remember
how you framed me back then?

22
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,279
(Framed him?)

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,350
- (So they're not in an incestuous relationship.)
- You said, if they see us alone in this room,

24
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,070
(Then this means...)

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,799
Would they still believe
the lies you told

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,590
that I tried to assault you?

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,870
(He's...)

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,399
(Taking revenge on that woman.)

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,199
Shuangshuang!

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,599
Master, slow down.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,999
Master.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,150
I'm fine.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,030
(No.)

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,510
(I can't stay here.)

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,950
(I have to get out.)

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,510
Let go of me!

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,670
I don't want to hurt you.

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,710
Please.

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,230
Do you have any idea
what I've been through all these years?

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,550
Now,

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,030
I've crawled my way out of hell.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,990
Stepmother.

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,790
It's your turn to go to hell.

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,470
Shuangshuang?

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,070
You're awake, Shuangshuang?

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,790
Shuangshuang.

47
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,790
Shuangshuang.

48
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,750
Shuangshuang.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,070
What's happened?

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,919
(Lu Songyan)
(He's...)

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,999
(Jiang City's wealthiest man,
Father of Lu Zhuo)

52
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,190
(The master of this household.)

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,270
- You unfilial son! What are you doing now?
- Master.

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,150
Young Master seems to
have misunderstood me.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,870
We'd barely spoken a few words

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,710
when he suddenly went into a rage.

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,150
I was so frightened, Master.

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,679
You unfilial son!

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,070
Apologise to your stepmother.

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,910
Young Master.

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,910
You've come without invitation.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,919
(Yan Tinglan, First Madam of the Lu family)
You could've at least informed us in advance.

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,750
Today is Wenyin's wedding day.

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,510
I've come to see what kind
of man my new brother-in-law is.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,750
Bai Shuangshuang.

66
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,030
You really haven't changed at all.

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,950
This isn't over today.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,390
We'll have time later.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,279
Lu Zhuo.

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,119
You unfilial child.

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,390
Forget it, Master.

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,790
I'm all right.

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,750
Where have you been these past few days?

74
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,959
Surely it doesn't take
that long to visit your mother.

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,519
It's normal to stay

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,470
a few more days with her.

77
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,000
As long as she made it
back in time for the wedding, it's fine.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,830
Shuangshuang.

79
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,439
The wedding is about to begin.

80
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,150
Go and get ready.

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,630
Mm.

82
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,559
Hong Dou, why are you
just standing there?

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,470
Hurry and help Second Madam get ready.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,910
There's no need.

85
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,710
I...

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,350
I'll do it myself.

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,070
Hong Dou. Take Second Madam
to the front courtyard in a bit.

88
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,310
Yes.

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,310
(No.)

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,510
(I need to get out of here.)

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,190
Second Madam.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,150
This way, please.

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,350
Second Madam.

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,239
(This Bai Shuangshuang)

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,790
(must have caused a lot of trouble.)

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,710
(I need to find a chance to escape.)

97
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,279
Hang it here, all right?

98
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,310
Let's set it up first.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,070
Okay.

100
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,270
Second Madam.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,310
(Happiness.)

102
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,830
Coming.

103
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,319
Hong Dou.

104
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,670
You go ahead.

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,910
I'll go find Master myself.

106
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,870
All right.

107
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,710
Tie it tighter.

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,070
They're coming!

109
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,150
The groom has come to fetch the bride!

110
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,879
How grand!

111
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,670
Indeed.

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,719
Such a grand procession.

113
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,630
(Happiness)

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,519
How blessed they are.

115
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,790
Such a fine-looking couple.

116
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,150
She was once so looked down upon.

117
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,470
(Lu Residence)

118
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,470
(The one Lin Chishu is marrying)

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,990
(turns out to be her.)

120
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,710
(Heavens have eyes.)

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,190
(I've become Second Madam
of the Lu family.)

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,910
(Nannan.)

123
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,830
(Mother will make the one
who caused your death)

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,150
(pay with blood.)

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,199
(Lu Wenyin, Lu Zhuo's sister)

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,110
Will the bride and groom
now serve tea to their parents.

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,910
(Happiness)

128
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,559
Father.

129
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,279
Mother.

130
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,470
Please have some tea.

131
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,399
Very good.

132
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,839
Today, two families unite.

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,710
A vow is made before all.

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,199
May your union last forever.

135
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,110
A perfect match in harmony.

136
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,070
Excellent.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,839
Good children.

138
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,030
You may rise.

139
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,199
Now,

140
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,479
serve a cup of tea

141
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,830
to your stepmother.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,830
(Ye Nanzhao.)

143
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,599
Go on, Chishu.

144
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,750
Greet your stepmother, Bai Shuangshuang.

145
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,950
(Bai Shuangshuang.)

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,470
Lin Chishu,

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,919
you beast!

148
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,430
Lin Chishu,

149
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,070
you great scholar.

150
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,719
Father,

151
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,879
why should I kneel to her
on my wedding day?

152
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,910
Wenyin,

153
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,990
she is still your elder.

154
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,279
Stepmother.

155
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,390
Please have some tea.

156
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,750
Please have some tea.

157
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,030
Stepmother.

158
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,239
Then I

159
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,710
wish you both

160
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,390
to be as inseparable as twin lotuses.

161
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,390
Nanzhao,

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,790
may we too be like twin lotuses.

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,590
Apologies, son-in-law.

164
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,519
My memory isn't very good.

165
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,799
What's the next line again? I've forgotten.

166
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,270
You're well-read,

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,190
could you remind me?

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,759
What Second Madam means
is may the couple be forever united...

169
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm sure the son-in-law knows this.

170
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,710
For a lifetime and beyond,

171
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,070
forever joined at the root.

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,919
Ah,

173
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,079
so that's the line.

174
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,359
The Lu family's new son-in-law

175
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,830
really lives up to the name
of Jiang City's top scholar.

176
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,550
Indeed.

177
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,159
You...

178
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,519
How can you be so clumsy?

179
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,359
It's fine.

180
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,839
You...

181
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,039
Just wipe it off.

182
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,439
I'm so sorry, son-in-law.

183
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,030
My hand slipped.

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,030
It's all right.

185
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,630
Very well.

186
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,919
Let the banquet begin.

187
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,239
Honored guests,

188
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,350
please be seated.

189
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,790
Wenyin,

190
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,479
I got water on my clothes.

191
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,879
I'll go change.

192
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,559
Mm, all right.

193
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,590
Go ahead.

194
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,390
Second Madam.

195
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,790
Is something the matter?

196
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,190
It's nothing.

197
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,399
I accidentally dirtied
your clothes just now.

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,679
I came to offer an apology.

199
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,159
No need.

200
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,510
I'll just change into a fresh set.

201
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,470
By the way,

202
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,350
there's something
I don't quite understand.

203
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,079
How did Ye Nanzhao,

204
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,950
who should've been dead long ago,

205
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,070
suddenly become
Second Madam Bai Shuangshuang?

206
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,310
Let's hope the Lu family's son-in-law

207
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,430
can keep that title a little longer.

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,110
Nannan.

209
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,679
Nannan is the name of the daughter

210
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,590
in my new novel.

211
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,159
I'm not much of a son-in-law,

212
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,180
but I seem to share
a strange fate with Second Madam.

213
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,030
Once the book is finished,
I'll be sure to gift you the first copy.

214
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,399
The main character is a pitiful man.

215
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,479
His wife

216
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,830
not only cheated with another man,

217
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,790
she even caused the death
of their only daughter.

218
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,150
The man fought desperately
to protect her,

219
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,359
but his wife

220
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,390
still set fire
to their daughter and killed her.

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,750
Right before she died,
the girl kept crying out.

222
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,310
Mother.

223
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,439
Mother.

224
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,030
Nannan, stop that.

225
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,870
Mother.

226
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:44,999
Mother.

227
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,550
Nannan.
