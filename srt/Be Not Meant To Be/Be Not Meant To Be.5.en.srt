be good

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,950
and keep me company.

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,839
What's going on?

7
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,630
Where is she?

8
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,750
Open the door!

9
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,270
Open the door!

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,750
Open up!

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,759
This way!

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,590
Quick!

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,270
Lu Zhuo!

14
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,830
Help me!

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,510
Bai Shuangshuang,
what trouble have you stirred up again?

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,590
What's wrong with you?

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,950
Help me.

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,430
Help me.

19
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,230
You've been drugged.

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,510
Help me.

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,390
Lu Zhuo.

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,799
Please hit me.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,430
What on earth are you trying to do?

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,670
Bai Shuangshuang,

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,390
your way of seducing men
is still as bizarre as ever.

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,630
How exactly do you want me to help you?

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,230
I...

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,230
I want...

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,310
I want you to leave me alone.

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,590
Lu Zhuo.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,310
Lin Chishu set me up.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,910
He drugged me to harm me.

33
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,670
I don't want to lose control
and drag you down with me.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,950
Bai Shuangshuang.

35
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,590
Hong Dou.

36
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,799
Quick! Your lady and the young master
are resting inside.

37
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,510
Ah?

38
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,719
It's not what you think!

39
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,230
Don't let anyone else in!

40
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,399
Nature calls.

41
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,510
Keep watch for me.

42
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,279
Oh.

43
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,990
- Make sure you watch carefully!
- Alright.

44
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,390
You're not Bai Shuangshuang.

45
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,070
Who exactly are you?

46
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,030
Thank you.

47
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,950
You helped me this time.

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,710
Right now, I am Bai Shuangshuang.

49
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,550
You said Lin Chishu set you up.

50
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,879
Then tell me,

51
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,950
what grudge is there between you two?

52
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,070
Maybe I can give you a hand.

53
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,550
Master, you're here.

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,150
Why are you so jumpy?

55
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,919
What's the Second Madam doing inside?

56
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,679
Master,

57
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,150
she's resting in the room
with a headache.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,539
Open the door.

59
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,479
Lu Zhuo, what are you doing?

60
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm going in to check on her.

61
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,070
Madam, the Master is here.

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,919
Let go of me.

63
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,190
You still haven't answered me.

64
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,510
Let go.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,719
Master.

66
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,639
The door is locked.

67
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,830
Go on!

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,959
Shuangshuang.

69
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,479
Lu Zhuo, I'm begging you.
I have something very important to do.

70
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,920
If you won't talk, I'll tell the Master
you're not Bai Shuangshuang.

71
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,950
You'll definitely be kicked
out of the Lu household.

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,590
Guards!

73
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,119
Go.

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,999
Get the key.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,150
Yes, Master.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,319
Let go of me now.

77
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,670
I need Bai Shuangshuang's identity
to stay in the Lu Residence.

78
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,079
Master.

79
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,990
The key.

80
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,799
Lin Chishu drugged me.

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,350
Just so the Master would see it.

82
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,279
Why didn't you open the door?

83
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,279
I...

84
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,110
I had a bit of a headache just now.

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,950
I laid down and accidentally
fell asleep.

86
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,270
Master, let's go home.

87
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,399
Master.

88
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,630
Let's go home.

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,630
Mm.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,150
Wait.

91
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,910
What's with that red mark on your neck?

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,799
It's nothing.

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,719
It's just...

94
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,350
A little rash, that's all.

95
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,030
Why are there two wine cups?

96
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,670
Kneel.

97
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,350
Who is the one you had
a secret affair with?

98
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,879
Who is it exactly?

99
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,039
I didn't, Master.

100
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,999
You didn't?

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,070
What's that red mark on your neck?

102
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,990
I'm sure there are more on your body.

103
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,599
Do you dare right now

104
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,550
to take off your clothes and let me see?

105
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,359
What?

106
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,559
Feeling guilty?

107
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,839
No more excuses?

108
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,710
Take them off.

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,030
(Lu Zhuo.)

110
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,510
(Please hit me.)

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,430
(This injury will help me.)

112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,110
(Lin Chishu keeps harming me.)

113
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,319
(I must not let him off.)

114
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,279
Who did this?

115
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,630
Quick, tell the Master.

116
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,830
Who on earth did this?

117
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,350
It was someone from
the Lu Residence trying to harm me.

118
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,630
Someone from the Lu Residence?

119
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,110
Raise your head.

120
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,710
Lift your head.

121
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,199
Master.

122
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,950
Mas...

123
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,119
Tell me.

124
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,270
Who told you to do this
behind the scenes?

125
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,319
No, no.

126
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,399
Master.

127
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,199
I...

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,350
I just couldn't stand the Second Madam.

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,270
You won't talk?

130
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,110
Fine.

131
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,399
Tie him up. Throw him into the river
to feed the fish.

132
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,190
Master.

133
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,310
Master, spare me.

134
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,990
Master.

135
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,590
Master, wait.

136
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,310
Let me have him.

137
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,070
I want to deal with him myself.

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,350
He's yours.

139
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,470
Shuangshuang just wants
to vent her anger.

140
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,079
Fine.

141
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,430
I'll allow it.

142
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,430
Everyone not involved,

143
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,439
disperse.

144
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,950
Master, Master.

145
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,270
Let's go.

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,630
I'll give you one more chance.

147
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,350
Tell me who ordered you.

148
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,399
Second Madam.

149
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,670
Please spare me, Second Madam.

150
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,430
Say it again.

151
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,910
I...

152
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,159
I can't say it.

153
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,479
I really can't.

154
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,079
I know he's watching you.

155
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,590
That's why you don't dare speak.

156
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,110
Then you'll just have to die.

157
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,270
Speak.

158
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,310
Even if I don't,

159
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,430
I'll still die anyway.

160
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,070
But I won't let you die so easily.

161
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,470
What did you make me drink?

162
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,359
The poison you just took

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,999
is called Tetanus Poison.

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,519
At first, your eyes turn red and blurry.

165
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,670
Your vision fades.

166
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,790
After a short while,

167
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,959
your whole body starts convulsing.

168
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,470
Your head jerks back.

169
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,430
Your spine bends in reverse.

170
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,270
Like a drawn bow.

171
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,550
Until your head and feet meet.

172
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,790
The body ends up shaped
like a weaving loom.

173
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,710
Second Madam.

174
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,199
I'm begging you.

175
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,790
Give me the antidote.

176
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,319
I'll tell you everything.

177
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,310
Too late.

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,350
I'm not interested anymore.

179
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,239
Second Madam.

180
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,359
Second Madam.

181
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,439
Then give me a swift death.

182
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,270
Just kill me.

183
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,670
If evildoers could die that easily,

184
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,190
wouldn't that be too kind for them?
