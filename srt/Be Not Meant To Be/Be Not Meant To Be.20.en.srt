Behind this diamond ring

lies a heart-wrenching,
unforgettable love story.

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,719
Don't go. You haven't said yes
to my proposal yet.

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,430
Deal with your personal matters first.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,710
Nanzhao.

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,070
What is it?

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,110
Nothing.

00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,310

One-fifty.

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,639

Any higher offers?

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,719
(Lu Zhuo. Are you really going to sell it?)

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,799
I bid three hundred.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,950

Three hundred once.

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,990
Nanzhao.

Marry me.

The next auction item

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,030
is a rose hairpin.

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,799
It is donated
by the wife of the governor,

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,679
Miss Ye Nanzhao,

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,350
to this auction.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,390
This hairpin is exquisitely designed

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,990
and superbly crafted,

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,350
making it a work of fine artistry.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,200
(Ye Nanzhao.)

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,800
- The starting bid for the rose hairpin

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,239
One silver dollar?

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,759
How did they set that price?

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,599
Bidding is now open.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,910

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,630

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,599
As expected of the governor,

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,279
he raised the bid
straight to one hundred.

57
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,000
- Any other bidders?
- Jingxing.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,799
Governor Yan,
one hundred silver dollars once.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,910
I bid two hundred.

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,679
Two hundred.

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,359

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,559
Any higher offers?

Five hundred silver dollars.

66
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no need to compete.

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,559
I'm determined

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,910
to have this rose hairpin.

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,790
In that case,

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,510
five hundred once.

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,470
Five hundred twice.

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,990
Five hundred thrice.

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,430
I bid one thousand.

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,470
Is the hairpin really worth that much?

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,270
Any bids higher than one thousand?

76
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,710
Sold.

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,799
Well, congratulations.

78
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,310
Congratulations.

79
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,319
He's got it.

80
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,279
Indeed. A thousand silver dollars.

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,630
How unexpected.

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,470
There must be a story
behind that hairpin.

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,150
I present this hairpin
to Miss Ye Nanzhao

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,230
as her wedding gift.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,390
With this rose hairpin,

86
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,590
I hereby

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,319
wish the newlyweds a lifetime together

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,710
in everlasting harmony.

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,399
I have matters
to attend to in Jiang City,

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,390
so I won't be there
for your wedding with Jinxing.

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,399
The final auction item of the night

92
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,470
is a butterfly gemstone necklace.

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,710
Unfortunately,

94
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,479
this rare treasure

95
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,630
has already been privately
reserved by Master Cheng.

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,670
In addition,

97
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,159
Master Cheng
has an important announcement tonight.

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,070
Please welcome him.

99
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,470
Thank you all for coming.

100
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,719
Today,

101
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,910
I would like to introduce someone.

102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,430
I have finally found

103
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,750
my long-lost eldest daughter,

104
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,310
Cheng Jingshu.

105
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,390
A long-lost daughter?

106
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,110
Father.

107
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,190
She's so beautiful.

108
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,230
Jingshu.

109
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,030
I have a gift for you.

110
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,350
What a lovely butterfly.

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,350
But isn't this

112
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,030
too valuable?

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,630
Jingshu,

114
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,839
this butterfly

115
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,959
is exactly the same
as the birthmark on your body.

116
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,159
Money is of no concern.

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,399
Its value

118
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,870
comes from you.

119
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,070
Thank you, Father.

120
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,470
Moreover,

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,959
there is one more thing

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,910
I would like to ask for your help with.

123
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,990
Apart from my eldest daughter,

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,430
I lost my younger daughter Jinglan
at the same time.

125
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,790
They are twin sisters, and they're
very much alike in appearance.

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,039
When Jinglan went missing,

127
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,270
she was wearing
a butterfly jade pendant.

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,550
(A butterfly jade pendant?)

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,839
The warden said

130
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,719
I was brought to the orphanage
with this pendant.

131
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,959
He also said

132
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,119
it might have been
a gift from my parents.

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,159
Don't worry, Nanzhao.

134
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,510
I'll definitely help you
find your parents.

135
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,079
But you must keep it a secret.

136
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,710
Don't tell a soul.

137
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,630
Of course. Let's pinky swear.

138
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,479
Anyone who can provide clues
about Jinglan

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,199
(Could it be)

140
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,680
will receive a generous reward from me.

141
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,350
(the pendant I have?)

142
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,319
To thank you all for attending,

143
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,639
Master Cheng has prepared

144
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,879
red wine as a gift for the guests.

145
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,990
Please help yourselves.

146
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,230
How thoughtful of Master Cheng.

147
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,479
Considering how kind he's been,

148
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,110
of course he'll find her.

149
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,159
Good people are rewarded.

150
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,070
Master Cheng will surely find her.

151
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,350
(It's gone.)

152
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,190
(Jingxing...)

153
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,559
(Are you certain
this is what Foster Father described)

154
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,630
of his younger daughter's pendant?

155
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,230
Yes, Governor Yan.

156
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,790
Master said

157
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,159
he found the craftsman

158
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,279
who made the original pendant years ago

159
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,239
and had it redrawn.

160
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,270
There's no mistake.

161
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,919
Don't worry, Aunt.

162
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,470
Leave Wenyin to me.

163
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,510
Governor Yan.

164
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,470
Are you really going to Jiang City

165
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,190
for a distant cousin?

166
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,710
I'm going to Jiang City,

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,950
but it's not for Lu Wenyin.

168
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,230
It's for someone more important.

169
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,270
Young Master Yan.

170
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,070
(Nanzhao.)

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,790
(Don't blame me.)

172
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,710
(If you must,
blame your foolish father.)

173
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,319
(The Cheng family business)

174
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,870
(must be mine.)

175
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,799
You're back, Young Lady.

176
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,790
A'wen asked me to give this to you.

177
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,119
Where is Lu Zhuo?

178
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,519
Young Master went back to Jiang City
right after the auction.

179
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,270
A'wen told me pass you this.

180
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,830
It turns out that Young Master
didn't marry someone else.

181
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,479
Come with me, Hong Dou.
I have something to tell you.

182
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,430
Yes.

183
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,670
Long time no see, Jinxing.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,310
What are you doing here?

185
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,150
Didn't I tell you not to come
unless necessary?

186
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,279
Yan Jingxing,

187
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,910
you really are foolish.

188
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,030
How can you be so sure
Ye Nanzhao will work with you?

189
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,599
Don't worry.

190
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,750
I'll make sure
Ye Nanzhao doesn't get rid of you.

191
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,030
You're still somewhat useful.

192
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,399
But if Ye Nanzhao betrays you,

193
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,990
wouldn't you end up with nothing

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,390
at all?

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,790
I just don't get it.

196
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,199
Why not find someone obedient
to acknowledge as family?

197
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,470
Wouldn't that work?

198
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,910
After all, your goal is to become
the Cheng family's son-in-law.

199
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,390
It doesn't matter

200
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,110
who the daughter is.

201
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,359
This is none of your concern.

202
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,110
I know what to do.

203
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,390
I hope so.

204
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,159
Young Lady.

205
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,239
By that logic,

206
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,150
the governor stole your pendant.

207
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,470
But why would he do that?

208
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,639
I have no idea either.

209
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,350
But only he knew
where I buried the pendant.

210
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,110
Bai Shuangshuang and I look alike.

211
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,119
On top of that,

212
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,039
her birthmark and my pendant
match as proof.

213
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,160
I'm afraid we are
the foster father's real daughters.

214
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,830
Lu Wenyin's claim of kinship

215
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,270
is surely a scheme.

216
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,550
And Jingxing must be in on it.

217
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,759
But without the pendant,

218
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,079
you have no way to prove your identity.

219
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,470
What should we do, then?

220
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,870
Are you looking for this?
