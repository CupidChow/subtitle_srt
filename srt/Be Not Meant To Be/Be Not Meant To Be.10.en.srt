00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,269
Two.

4
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,639
It's been some time.

5
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,719
I bet she's long dead
due to suffocation.

6
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,510
No!

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,959
No!

8
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,190
He wouldn't dare to do it!

9
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,280
One.

10
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,910
He wouldn't dare to do so!

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,639
Don't tell him.
He wouldn't dare to do it!

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,119
Don't fall for his trap, Mother!

13
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,230
I'll fight you to the end!

14
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,710
Only I

15
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,030
can take your life.

16
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,999
Madam!

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,430
You're finally awake!

18
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,550
Where am I?

19
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,879
This is hospital. You had been unconscious
for the past two days.

20
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,070
And I have good news for you.

21
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,230
Check this out.

22
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,799
(News Daily)
Lu Wenyin's confession is published.

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,999
It's been the talk of the town.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,750
Lu Wenyin dares not
show herself in the public.

25
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,880
(Lu Wenyin admits to conspiring)
I even heard

26
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,390
( with husband to murder his ex-wife and daughter.)
she appeared mentally perturbed.

27
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,919
It wasn't me...

28
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,879
She killed his wife and daughter.

29
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,910
It wasn't me.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,319
It wasn't me!

31
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,639
She'd be haunted by their spirits.

32
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,559
No wonder her husband,
who was a playwright,

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,799
was killed.

34
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,630
I bet she was a jinx to him.

35
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,630
Chishu.

36
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,030
Chishu.

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,750
Chishu.

38
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,790
Chishu.

39
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,039
Chishu.

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,879
Not only Lu Wenyin has lost her marbles,

41
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,999
(News Daily)
but First Madam is also always weeping.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,039
Above all,

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,039
it's caught
the police bureau's attention.

44
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,559
Unfortunately,
after investigation and review,

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,470
although Lu Wenyin was found guilty,

46
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,359
given her mental condition,

47
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,999
they eventually decided
not to imprison her.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,300
The Lu family was ordered to keep her
under strict supervision.

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,039
Madam,

50
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,079
no matter what,

51
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,870
at least they finally
got what they deserved.

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,790
Mother.

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,190
(Nannan.)

54
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,079
Hong Dou.

55
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,030
Mm.

56
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,070
Thank you.

57
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,310
Thank you for always being there for me.

58
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,310
I'm no longer Bai Shuangshuang.

59
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,390
You need not call me madam anymore.

60
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,750
Just call me by my name.

61
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,230
Could I call you Young Lady?

62
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,239
If not,

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,630
I would feel awkward.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,830
Sure.

65
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,030
Mm.

66
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,750
Oh, right.

67
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,110
Where's Lu Zhuo?

68
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,190
I remember it was he who saved me.

69
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,790
Well...

70
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,470
He's injured.

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,870
Second Madam.

72
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,959
You're awake.

73
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,270
Is Lu Zhuo in there?

74
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,399
Where did you get hurt? Is it serious?

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,550
How is he doing?

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,710
Thank you for your concern.

77
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,679
Young Master

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,510
isn't doing quite well.

79
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,310
He's still recuperating.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,150
Second Madam.

81
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,830
Please leave.

82
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,590
Our young master

83
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,270
can't see you now.

84
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,519
Why not?

85
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
He got injured trying to save me.

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,639
I'm going to see him no matter what.

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,790
Second Madam!

88
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,039
Lu Zhuo.

89
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,070
Second Madam!

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,279
How are you doing?

91
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,039
Lu Zhuo,

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,990
where did you get hurt?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,519
Let me see.

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,950
Are you alright?

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,319
I knew

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,670
you'd be fine.

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,390
Ma'am.

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,030
Young Master Lu's optic nerves were damaged
by splinters from the coffin.

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,959
He is currently blind.

100
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,750
A three-month recovery period
is required.

101
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,719
During this time,

102
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,350
he must be cared for
with great attention.

103
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,070
If he recovers well,

104
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,839
his vision

105
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,030
may return.

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,639
However,

107
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,470
if the recovery goes poorly,

108
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,190
he'll have to live in darkness
for the rest of his life.

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,750
Young Master!

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,119
It was all my fault!

111
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,919
It was all my fault!

112
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,150
It was all my fault!

113
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,990
I failed to protect you.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,670
You put your life at risk

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,870
in order to save Madam.

116
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,239
If you had gone blind,

117
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,310
how would I face
the ancestors of the Lu Family?

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,030
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,390
It was all because of me.

120
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,630
No, it wasn't.

121
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,110
A'Wen.

122
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,030
See the doctor out.

123
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,870
Young Master...

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,950
Go ahead.

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,910
Teach me, Doctor.

126
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,390
How do I take good care
of my young master?

127
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,070
Thank you so much, Doctor.

128
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,759
There's

129
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,030
no next time.

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,159
Wait...

131
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,959
Doctor.

132
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,799
Hear me out.

133
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,679
How was it?

134
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,319
I did as you said.

135
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,759
Did she suspect anything?

136
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,559
Rest assured.

137
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,599
It went well.

138
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,479
Everything is on track.

139
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,199
My heart is pounding.

140
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,919
I feel like

141
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,719
we're lying to her.

142
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,279
Isn't it inappropriate to make her stay

143
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,039
using this ploy?

144
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,630
We're doing them

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,150
a big favor here.

146
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,999
Only then

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,799
can your madam...

148
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,239
No,

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,239
only then your young lady

150
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,590
can get together with our young master.

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,470
Well,

152
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,799
isn't that wonderful?

153
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,080
Stop overthinking things.

154
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,179
What would you like to have? It's my treat.
I know of a shop that serve nice food.

155
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,199
There should be

156
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,670
a box on the table.

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,190
Inside it is a gift for you.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,950
That's a rose hairpin.

159
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,030
Once you open it,

160
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,670
it turns into a hairpin dagger
for self-defense.

161
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,350
If I'm ever not around,

162
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,070
you can use it to protect yourself.

163
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,070
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,870
It's all because of me

165
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,030
that you've lost...

166
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,479
This isn't your fault.

167
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,830
I did that of my own accord.

168
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,119
My name isn't Bai Shuangshuang.

169
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,070
My real name is Ye Nanzhao.

170
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,479
It was just by chance

171
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,190
that I happened to have
the exact same face as Bai Shuangshuang.

172
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,759
But our fates

173
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,430
couldn't be more different.

174
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,870
Nanzhao.

175
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,470
What a beautiful name.

176
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,039
I really want to truly get to know you.

177
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,750
The real Ye Nanzhao.

178
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,230
It's a pity you're leaving.

179
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,790
We might never get the chance again.

180
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,710
Forget it.

181
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,150
Did you take the hairpin?

182
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,990
I was going to help you put it on.

183
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,639
But I can no longer manage that.

184
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,350
Put it on yourself, okay?

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,110
Lu Zhuo.

186
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,070
Thank you.

187
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,239
For the next three months,

188
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,910
you'll need someone to look after you.

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,279
If you're up for it...

190
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,430
I'd like to.

191
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,159
Sir,

192
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,879
would you like to buy a flower
for your wife?

193
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,839
What kind do you have?

194
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,230
We have roses.

195
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,590
I'll take them all, then.

196
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,239
Madam,

197
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,146
your husband treats you so well.

198
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,439
May these roses

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,550
bring you lasting happiness.

200
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,550
Go on.

201
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,719
(Young Master.)

202
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,339
(Miss Ye is truly a kind soul.)

203
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,219
Here. Open your mouth.

204
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,959
(Even though
she was still in the hospital herself,)

205
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,159
(she snuck out and went home)

206
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,150
(to cook for you.)

207
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,430
(Young Master,)

208
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,350
(you'd better not mess this up.)

209
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,279
Lu Zhuo,

210
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,759
that's your tenth bowl.

211
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,670
Are you sure you want more?

212
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,759
Yes.

213
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,110
I want more.

214
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,830
It's my first time shaving someone.

215
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,519
I'm afraid I might hurt you.

216
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,590
It's okay.

217
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,310
I have complete faith in you.

218
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,950
Did I miss a spot?

219
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,070
Can you see me?

220
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,710
No.

221
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,590
I can't see anything.

222
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,670
What's wrong?

223
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,999
Nothing.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,639
I just

225
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,230
accidentally cut your hand.

226
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,430
As long as you're fine.
