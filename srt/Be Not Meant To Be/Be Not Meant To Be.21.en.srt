00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,712
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,230
Are you looking for this?

4
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,479
Ye Nanzhao.

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,750
Why couldn't you just feign ignorance?

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,710
Wouldn't it be better if we joined hands
to take the Cheng family fortune?

7
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,039
Everything was going smoothly.

8
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,030
Why did you have to expose me?

9
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,279
When did you find out

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,910
that I was the Cheng family's daughter?

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,910
Knowing too much does you no good.

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,670
A woman

13
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,230
is better off being dull.

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,350
You knew
before coming to Jiang City, didn't you?

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,150
That's right.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,870
I came to find you

17
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,350
to become the Cheng family's son-in-law.

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,070
Otherwise, why do you think
Lu Zhuo was getting drowned alive?

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,510
That was my doing.

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,670
I just didn't expect

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,230
you'd actually save him.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,550
At this point, I'll just tell you

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,190
that I took Bai Shuangshuang
to the boat.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,239
I helped First Madam
deal with her rival for favor

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,590
and cleared that obstacle for myself.

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,030
Yan Jingxing.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,950
You've changed so much

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,790
that I don't recognize you.

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,630
Where did the old you go?

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,550
He's long dead.

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,590
He died fifteen years ago.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,799
My family fell into ruin,

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,350
and I was sent to the Chengs.

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,959
I toiled away for Cheng Qingping

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,110
for fifteen years.

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,830
And what happened?

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,550
He guarded against me like an outsider

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,310
all the time.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,639
Cheng.

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,879
It's been years.

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,230
Apart from a birthmark,
there's been no clue.

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,830
Searching for the two young ladies
has been a challenge.

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,750
I will spare no cost to find them

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,599
until the day I pass.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,670
I cannot let the Cheng family's fortune

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,830
end with me.

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,790
I think Jingxing
has both character and ability.

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,950
He makes an dependable choice.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,079
Dependable or not,

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,670
he remains an outsider.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,079
I can't possibly hand over
the Cheng family fortune

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,030
to some outsider.

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,679
But both young ladies are women.

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,079
Even if we manage to locate them,

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,439
how will they inherit the fortune?

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,470
Then we'll find them good husbands.

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,870
Our grandsons
who bear the Cheng surname.

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,759
That way, both the bloodline and fortune

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,239
can be passed down.

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,470
While I was risking my life
for Cheng Qingping like a dog,

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,719
where were you?

62
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,919
Let me tell you.

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,799
I'm not coveting
the Cheng family fortune.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,119
I made that fortune

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,599
in the first place!

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,110
You wouldn't get it!

67
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,670
Listen up, Ye Nanzhao.

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,950
I'll give you one last chance.

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,470
Either

70
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,999
marry me

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,470
and I'll restore your status
as a wealthy young lady.

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,390
Or

73
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,630
I'll destroy this pendant,

74
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,590
and you'll lose it forever.

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,750
I'm telling you, Yan Jingxing.

76
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,079
What I've wanted was never

77
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,880
the title of eldest daughter
of the Cheng family.

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,230
I only want Lu Wenyin

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,110
to pay for what she has done!

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,790
Ye Nanzhao, you're frighteningly naïve.

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,470
Do you think I'll let you do that?

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,950
Lu Wenyin's claim of kinship

83
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,830
was orchestrated by me.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,550
I have nothing more to say to you.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,270
Nanzhao.

86
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,110
Given how well you know me,

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,990
do you think I'll let you go?

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,230
You won't.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,350
I've already told Lu Zhuo
to return to Jiang City for evidence.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,279
(Lu Zhuo.)

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,399
(By a twist of fate,)

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,399
(misunderstandings arose between us.)

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,439
(What happened)

94
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,399
(was Yan Jingxing threatening me
with your life)

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,750
(and forcing me to fake my death
and leave Jiang City.)

96
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,119
(I only recently discovered)

97
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,599
(that my resemblance to Bai Shuangshuang
was no coincidence.)

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,199
(It turns out we were
the long-lost sisters of Cheng family.)

99
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,999
(Yan Jingxing knew
my identity long ago,)

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,439
(so he pretended to marry me)

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,630
(in an attempt
to inherit the Cheng family fortune.)

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,859
(What's more,
he colluded with Lu Wenyin)

103
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,920
- A'wen, get back to the Lu Residence.
- (who's pretended to be)

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,459
(the Cheng family's eldest daughter,
trying to take over the residence)

105
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:27,999
Why go back?

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,459
(and seize the Cheng family fortune.)

107
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,870
I'm going back
to expose Lu Wenyin's identity.

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,310
Ye Nanzhao, I'll kill you!

109
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,550
Go ahead.

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,110
If you kill me,

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,839
Lu Zhuo will hand over

112
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,110
the evidence
that Lu Wenyin isn't Bai Shuangshuang

113
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,710
to Master Cheng!

114
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,159
Once you lose
Master Cheng's trust completely,

115
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,590
you're done for.

116
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,710
And you still naïvely think Lu Zhuo
will come back to save you?

117
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,830
Stop dreaming.

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,150
If he dares step into Nan City,

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,030
I'll make sure both of you die together.

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,319
Keep an eye on her. Take her
to the station to meet Lu Zhuo tomorrow.

121
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,110
Yes, sir.

122
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,725
(Nan City Station)

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,870
Governor Yan.

124
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,719
The station has been sealed off.

125
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,510
We've checked.

126
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,790
He's the only one on the train.

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,470
Mm.

128
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,150
Let me go with you.

129
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,310
No need.

130
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,670
Well,

131
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,270
I'll handle this deal myself.

132
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,199
All units, on alert!

133
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,350
Yes, sir!

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,230
Nanzhao.

135
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,799
Lu Zhuo.

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,359
Don't worry,

137
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,270
I'm fine.

138
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,990
I brought what you wanted.

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,350
Let Nanzhao go.

140
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,990
Thank you

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,750
for coming all the way here
just to deliver the evidence to me.

142
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,030
I'll let you have the evidence.

143
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,350
Release Nanzhao now.

144
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,119
Let's have

145
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,119
an even trade.

146
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,030
Throw it over first.

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,830
Are you alright?

148
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,390
I'm fine.

149
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,870
Yan Jingxing.

150
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,870
I must hand it to you.

151
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,199
You actually dared
to get on this train alone.

152
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,990
Everyone down there is mine.

153
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,470
Do you really think
you can get out alive?

154
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,630
Is that so?

155
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,110
Start the train!

156
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,990
Hurry!

157
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,999
Move!

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,230
Stop them, now!

159
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,990
I regret it.

160
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,790
I made a mistake back then.

161
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,719
I shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble

162
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,390
to scheme for Ye Nanzhao to marry me.

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,590
I should have just killed her,

164
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,910
so you'd live in agony for life.

165
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,110
Yan Jingxing.

166
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,470
Let's see

167
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,430
who between us can get off this train.

168
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,830
Nanzhao!

169
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,110
Lu Zhuo!

170
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,359
I'll take your life today!

171
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,470
Even the King of Hell
wouldn't dare claim my life.

172
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,350
You shall meet your demise today!

173
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,159
Stop,

174
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,950
Yan Jingxing!

175
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,470
We grew up together.

176
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,430
And now you're pointing a gun at me?

177
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,030
Nanzhao.

178
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,150
Shoot!

179
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,830
Nanzhao.

180
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,479
When you were bullied,

181
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,710
who stood up for you?

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,790
We're family,

183
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,910
so why side with some outsider?

184
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,270
You've changed long ago.

185
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,190
You're no longer
the one I knew as a child.

186
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,950
Fine.

187
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,310
Put down the gun.

188
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,470
I'm not killing Lu Zhuo.

189
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,510
Nanzhao.

190
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,390
Nanzhao!

191
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,150
Nanzhao.

192
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,710
I'm here.

193
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,920
(Changyang Station)
(It turns out )

194
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,279
(Yan Jingxing and First Madam set the trap
that killed Bai Shuangshuang.)

195
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,459
(The scheming aunt and nephew
committed countless crimes,)

196
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,399
(but little did they know,)

197
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,070
(they brought us together.)

198
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,110
Nanzhao.

199
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,230
It's all over now.

200
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,870
Come with me.
Let's go back to Jiang City.

201
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,230
Not now.

202
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,310
Lu Wenyin is still in Nan City, and she's
impersonating the Cheng family's daughter.

203
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,990
I can't let her get away with it.

204
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,350
It's a pity

205
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,719
that all the evidence is gone now.

206
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,630
Not necessarily.

207
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,990
A'wen went to see Hong Dou.

208
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,710
Hong Dou said that
before Bai Shuangshuang went missing,

209
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,830
she received a letter.

210
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,950
After reading it,
she made her way to Nan City.

211
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,550
Unfortunately,

212
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,910
I couldn't find the letter.

213
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,623
I suspect First Madam has it.

214
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,430
That means

215
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,310
Lu Wenyin knew about the birthmark

216
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,910
because she read that letter.

217
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,550
Exactly.

218
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,830
The one
who sent Bai Shuangshuang that letter

219
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,550
probably knows her true identity.

220
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,919
If we find that person,

221
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,350
we can expose Lu Wenyin.

222
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,750
Then let's go now.

223
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,990
No rush.

224
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,470
I've had A'wen see to that.

225
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,830
As for the rest,

226
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,430
leave it to me.

227
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,150
Lu Zhuo.

228
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,710
Thank you.

229
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,830
A simple thank-you isn't enough.

230
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,830
I want you to promise me

231
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,550
that from now on,
you'll discuss everything with me.

232
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,999
You're not allowed to leave me again.

233
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,030
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,710
I truly had no choice then.

235
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,550
I don't want your apology.

236
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,190
I want your word.

237
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,110
Sure.

238
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,950
I promise.

239
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,310
What...

240
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,910
What are you doing?

241
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,710
A verbal promise isn't enough.

242
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,830
It needs a seal to make it count.

243
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,250
(Changyang Station)
