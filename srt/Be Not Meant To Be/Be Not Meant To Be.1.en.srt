1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,750
(Jiang City)

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,029
Nannan.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,270
Blow out the candles.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,230
What did you wish for?

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,919
I want to always

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,359
be with Father and Mother.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,710
(Ye Nanzhao, Li Nanzhao's wife)

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,430
Nanzhao.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,790
Here's a gift for you.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,030
All these years,

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,279
you supported me
from a penniless teacher

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,830
to an associate professor.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
You've worked hard without complaint.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,160
Thank you
for everything you've done for me.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,230
Lin Chishu...

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,950
What are you doing?

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,150
I'm sorry, Nanzhao.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,750
Please forgive me.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,040
I have to marry her.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,400
She's both powerful and influential.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,740
So she can help me become a professor,
maybe even a principal!

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,070
I'm sorry, Nanzhao.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,230
I'll treat you better in my next life.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,910
Mother!

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,270
Mother!

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,919
Nannan.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,079
Why are you here?

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,990
Nannan.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,190
Nannan.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,590
Nannan.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,559
Mother!

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,710
Nannan, don't worry about me.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,279
Run!

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,159
Nannan.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,999
Come with me.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,959
Come with me!

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,399
Lin Chishu, hands off her!

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,390
Nannan!

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,110
Nannan, come with me.

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,919
You're coming with me!

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,510
Stop it, Nannan!

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,950
Lin Chishu!

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,830
Nannan.

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,070
My Nannan!

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,870
You animal!

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,799
I...

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,190
I didn't mean to hurt you.

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,470
Even if I knew I'd be burned
like a moth to a flame,

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,230
I would still leap into the fire.

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,350
I'd like this fire to burn on.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,990
Until it reaches the end of our love.

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,950
Chishu.

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,590
You made the right choice.

54
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,319
What a pity.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,430
I never even got to meet her,

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,910
and she's already dead.

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,870
Let's go.

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,230
Nannan...

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,230
Nannan...

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,110
I'm here.

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,750
Nannan!

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,310
Nannan!

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,830
Chishu, did you know?

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,870
All these people are lining up
to enter the concession.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,239
They wait here day after day,

66
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,350
hoping to fight their way
into high society.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,030
Chishu.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,950
These are chaotic times.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,030
A man as talented as you

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,990
should make good use of what you have.

71
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,599
Back up! Back up!

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,279
Back off!

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,270
Make way!

74
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,430
Chishu.

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,750
Welcome to

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,830
high society.

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,030
Bravo!

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,590
Brava!

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,520
=Be Not Meant To Be=

80
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,640
=Episode 1=

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,870
I'm going to file a report.

82
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,470
I'm going to file a report.

83
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,230
I'm going to file a report.

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,670
I'm going to file a report...

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,790
I'm going to file a report...

86
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,319
Miss!

87
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,470
Are you alright?

88
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,679
Why are you walking alone
in this heavy night rain?

89
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,599
Did something happen?

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,990
I'm going to file a report.

91
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,440
It's far from here.

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,639
It's dangerous for you to go there alone
in this downpour.

93
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,519
Get in the car.

94
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,519
There's hot water inside.

95
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,910
Go ahead and warm yourself up.

96
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,999
What do we do?

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,079
The boat's about to leave.

98
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,799
Are we really being sold off to Nanyang?

99
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,030
(Nanyang?)

100
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,519
(No way. I have to get out of here!)

101
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,630
She's dead!

102
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,230
She's gone!

103
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,430
She's dead!

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,839
She had it coming.

105
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,799
She was nothing

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,030
but a shameless woman.

107
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,990
Indeed.

108
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,799
Everyone was trying
to find a way to escape.

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,870
But her?

110
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,399
She used her looks

111
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,439
to seduce those men.

112
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,159
She thought that'd get her out of here?

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,510
As if.

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,870
Exactly.

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,559
Look at her.

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,039
What an ugly death her is.

117
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,799
She couldn't even die with dignity.

118
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,510
(Even in death, one deserves dignity.)

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,390
(Why does she)

120
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,870
(look exactly like me?)

121
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,710
Wait...

122
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,070
Where are you from?

123
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,150
Who's your boss?

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,990
Boss.

125
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,590
Someone's coming this way.

126
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,990
Wait.

127
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,590
Is that

128
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,790
the second-in-command

129
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,270
of Qinglong Society?

130
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,430
Lu Zhuo?

131
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,470
(Lu Zhuo, Second-in-command
of Qinglong Society)

132
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,710
Mr. Lu.

133
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,479
If we caught your woman,

134
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,359
just say the word

135
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,910
and we'll return her to you.

136
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,799
But isn't that inappropriate

137
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,830
for you to barge onto our turf
with all your men

138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,839
at this late hour?

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,910
Inappropriate?

140
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,560
You've kidnapped these women

141
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,399
for human trafficking. And you're here
talking about what's inappropriate?

142
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,470
Open up.

143
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,559
Don't make our second-in-command
repeat himself. Otherwise, we...

144
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,510
What will you do?

145
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,319
We work for the Yan family.

146
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,199
You dare

147
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,750
get rid of us?

148
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,430
Young Master.

149
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,070
We've gone along well
with the Yan family all these years.

150
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,079
(Yang A'Wen, Lu Zhao's follower)
If the leader found out, what should we do?

151
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,990
He'd never know.

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,390
Don't spare any of them.

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,830
We've found them.

154
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,030
They're all in here!

155
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,599
Young Master.

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,750
That's Second Madam.

157
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,470
(Second Madam?)

158
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,950
(Could it be)

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,519
Second Madam.

160
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,699
(they've been looking for her?)

161
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:04,900
We're getting you out of here.

162
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,070
(No way.)

163
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,910
(I'm seeking revenge.)

164
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,270
(So I must stay alive.)

165
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,270
(I'm sorry.)

166
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,670
(I must stay alive.)

167
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,270
(I'm going to get revenge.)

168
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,910
(I must stay alive.)

169
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,590
(I'm going to get revenge.)

170
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,790
(I must stay alive.)

171
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,750
(I'm going to...)
