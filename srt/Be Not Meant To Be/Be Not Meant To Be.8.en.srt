=Episode 8=

3
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,290
Stop it!

4
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,910
What is all this, Shuangshuang?

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,350
Get over here!

6
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,999
Dear.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,719
Father!

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,479
Shuangshuang.

9
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,799
What's happened?

10
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,599
What's it?

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,470
Dear.

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,319
Wenyin suddenly went berserk

13
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,390
and claimed I killed Chishu.

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,159
You've suffered.

15
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,550
Wenyin.

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,359
Both you

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,399
and Chishu have gone crazy,

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,039
huh?

19
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,839
You lying wench!

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,950
I'm going to get rid of you today!

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,919
She's going to kill her.

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,959
- What are you doing?
- I'll get rid of you!

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,150
Let go of me!

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,070
Hear me out, Father.

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,759
She...

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,879
She's a murderer.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,839
She killed my husband!

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,659
But we saw Lin Chishu trying
to kill Shuangshuang.

29
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,759
There was no way

30
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,239
he would do so
during the premiere show.

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,479
It's been her conspiracy,

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,199
Father!

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,559
She's not Bai Shuangshuang.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,359
She's Lin Chishu's late wife,

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,359
Ye Nanzhao!

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,190
Father...

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,679
Kill her for me, Father!

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,439
Stop causing a scene here, okay?

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,799
Dear.

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,879
Take her away already.

41
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,670
Father...

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,159
Lock her inside the ancestral hall
so that she can reflect herself.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,230
Just you wait, Bai Shuangshuang!

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,880
Dr. Ma from Jiang City Hospital's
psychiatry department.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,470
Get him for me.

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,230
Let me go!

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,230
Let go!

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,639
No...

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,679
Don't lock the door!

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,030
Don't lock it!

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,910
Let me out!

52
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,279
Let me out!

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,199
Dear.

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,230
Do something to save Wenyin.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,959
She's truly gone mad.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,550
Please don't blame Miss Lu.

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,439
Perhaps she's become delirious

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,799
from overwhelming grief.

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,599
No.

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,599
This won't do.

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,439
Get the best doctor here

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,639
to treat her condition.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:22,999
Sure.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,279
No matter how much it costs,

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,239
we need to do so at once.

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,270
Yes.

67
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,959
Don't touch me!

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,599
Scram!

69
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,279
Get lost!

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,250
The doctor has come out.

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,839
Doctor. What's the situation?

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,279
How's my daughter doing, Doctor?

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,550
The patient is indeed
experiencing mental problems.

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,319
But

75
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,340
it's curable as long as she cooperates with me.

76
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,120
(Examination results: neurotic delusion.)
Here's the diagnosis from Mr. Ma.

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,990
She has a mental condition.
What do we do now?

78
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,110
I'm going to make her aware

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,350
that messing with me
was the worst mistake of her life.

80
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,230
I'll make her live to regret it.

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,899
(Lu Wenyin.)

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,937
(The memorial tablet
of the late great-grandfather, Lord Lu)

83
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,310
What are you doing here?

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,719
I came to see if you're truly remorseful kneeling
before these ancestral tablets.

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,310
I deeply regret it.

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,599
I should've killed

87
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,870
you and your low-born child
with my own hands!

88
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,230
Ye Nanzhao.

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,239
I'll make you pay

90
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,359
once I've got out of here.

91
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,270
So what if you manage to get out?

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,150
Do you think your father
will believe you?

93
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,399
Don't you forget

94
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,719
you're just a fake.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,390
Would my father believe a liar like you
instead of me?

96
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,079
In my opinion, it doesn't matter

97
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,070
who he believes.

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,519
What matters is

99
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,350
the one he believes is normal.

100
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,190
What do you mean?

101
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,030
Here's the thing.

102
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,470
I bumped into your attending doctor
on my way here.

103
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,679
Unfortunately,

104
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,150
he said you've gone mad.

105
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:58,199
(Examination results: neurotic delusion.
Frontal lobotomy is recommended.)

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,270
He's got you this diagnosis.

107
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,279
Frontal

108
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,320
lobotomy?

109
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,399
(Neurotic delusion.
Frontal lobotomy is recommended.)

110
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,799
It's also my first time
hearing this surgery.

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,679
Thus, I asked the doctor

112
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,950
for the surgical equipment.

113
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,359
This needle

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,919
will go through

115
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,190
your eye

116
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,350
to enter your brain.

117
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,790
Right here.

118
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,270
You wicked woman.

119
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,830
Trying to scare me, huh?

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,230
Scare you?

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Your father

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,510
(Frontal lobotomy is recommended.)
hasn't read this diagnosis.

123
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,470
Do you think he'll allow this surgery

124
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,670
after reading it?

125
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,390
My father...

126
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,830
My father...

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,030
You're not sure either, no?

128
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,199
In fact,

129
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,279
you know better than I do

130
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,279
how much he cares about his reputation.

131
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,470
Well,

132
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,510
would he rather be mocked
for having a mad daughter,

133
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,750
or have an obedient one
to preserve his family's reputation?

134
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,030
No...

135
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,350
I was wrong.

136
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,110
I've done you wrong.

137
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,319
I apologize.

138
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,830
I was really wrong.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,839
I've done you and your daughter wrong.
I beg of you. Please spare me.

140
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,870
Lu Wenyin.

141
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,390
You colluded with Lin Chishu,

142
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
and you ordered him to kill me

143
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,870
and my daughter.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,759
Your hands may be clean, but you've been
the mastermind before all those evil deeds.

145
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,780
Yet you haven't shown a shred of remorse.
How could I ever let you off the hook?

146
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,519
I...

147
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,230
I can do whatever you want me to do.

148
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,910
Anything.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,350
I'll do anything you want me to do. I'm serious.

150
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,030
I just want you to do this.

151
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,291
(Confession Letter)

152
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:45,970
(Deserve death. Guilty.)

153
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,270
Sign the confession letter

154
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,990
and I'll tear up the diagnosis for you.

155
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,224
I...

156
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,160
(Confession Letter)

157
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,350
The surgery or the confession?

158
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,070
I... I'll fess up.

159
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,279
I... I...

160
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,590
I'll admit to all my crimes.

161
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,990
All of them.

162
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,630
I can't reach it.

163
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:35,112
(Guilty)

164
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,680
(Confession Letter)

165
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,710
Well...

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,750
Well, what about...

167
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,159
Relax.

168
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,510
I'll keep my word.

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,150
Shuangshuang.

170
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,110
Why are you here?

171
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,239
Dear.

172
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,879
Father...

173
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,430
Wenyin has been crying.

174
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,079
I came to comfort her.

175
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,639
There, there.

176
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,550
Wenyin.

177
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,390
Stop crying.

178
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,430
The doctor said,

179
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,639
as long as you take
your medicine every day,

180
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,350
there's hope for recovery.

181
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,479
Medicine?

182
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,350
Yes.

183
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,359
You lied to me.

184
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,439
Ye Nanzhao, you evil woman!

185
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,279
Wenyin!

186
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,439
Good grief, Wenyin!

187
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,079
Wenyin!

188
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,959
Stop it!

189
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,199
I'm going to kill you!

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,099
Wenyin!

191
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:36,919
Take her life for me.

192
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,599
Wenyin.

193
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,510
Kill her for me!

194
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,239
Second Madam.

195
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,670
The newspaper draft is ready.

196
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,840
(News Daily)
It'll be published the day after tomorrow.

197
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,519
Now the crimes
of Lu Wenyin and Lin Chishu

198
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,559
will be known to the world.

199
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,911
The truth is finally out.

200
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:51,887
(Lu Wenyin admits to conspiring
with husband to murder his ex-wife and daughter.)

201
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,710
Thank you, Hong Dou.

202
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,879
But

203
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,590
are you letting Lu Wenyin
off the hook just like that?

204
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,119
Both Lu Wenyin and Master Lu

205
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,799
care about

206
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,870
their reputations.

207
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,950
So I want her to live in a world

208
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,910
where she's criticized for what she did.

209
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,830
Only then will she live the rest of her life
feeling remorseful.

210
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,599
Someone like Lu Wenyin

211
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,430
deserves it.

212
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,199
Now that everything's come to an end,

213
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,310
will you come with me?

214
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,999
But what about Young Master?

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,150
Didn't you always say
you owed him your life?

216
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,630
It's okay.

217
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,190
I'll make it clear to him.

218
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,759
We'll

219
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,110
move elsewhere.

220
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,599
Nan City.

221
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,959
That's where I grew up.

222
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,870
What do you think?

223
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,879
Sure!

224
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,639
I'll go

225
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,950
where you are.

226
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,000
Help!

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,579
(Lu Wenyin admits to conspiring
with husband to murder his ex-wife and daughter.)

228
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:55,630
Help!

229
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,399
Madam!

230
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,799
Madam!

231
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,399
Are you alright, Madam?

232
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,359
I'm fine, Hong Dou.

233
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,070
Ah!

234
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,239
Lu Wenyin.

235
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,959
Let go!

236
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,070
Let us go!

237
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,959
Lu Wenyin!

238
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,350
This is bad!

239
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,759
Wait...

240
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,879
That's A'Wen!

241
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,879
What do you think, A'Wen?

242
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,310
Aren't we efficient...

243
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,759
Let us go!

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,879
You silly things!

245
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,159
I told you to get them here.

246
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,359
And what have you done?

247
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,799
Huh?

248
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,870
Wait, A'Wen.

249
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,519
Isn't this always how we do it?

250
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,559
Oh my!

251
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,550
Untie them now!

252
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,399
Let go!

253
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,239
Untie them. Now!

254
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,639
Yes...

255
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,359
Untie them!

256
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,479
Quick!

257
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:29,959
Hurry!

258
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,679
Untie them!

259
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,319
Be quick!

260
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,319
You bandits!

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,350
How roguish!

262
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,879
Enough!

263
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,359
- Second Madam.
- We don't have time for all this. Let's go.

264
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,119
Second Madam...

265
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,759
I beg of you.

266
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,390
Please don't tell Young Master
about this.

267
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,070
Second Madam.

268
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,110
What did you ask me here?

269
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,630
Don't be mad.

270
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,560
This ballroom just opened today.

271
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,200
I thought we'd come here
for a bit of fun.

272
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,430
May I have a dance with you?

273
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
Thank you for your kind invitation.

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,239
But I don't want it.
Also, I don't know how to dance. I'm leaving.

275
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,350
Well,

276
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,430
haven't you tried to repay my kindness?

277
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,439
How do you want me to repay it?

278
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,590
Have a dance with me.

279
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,510
Lu Zhuo.

280
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,310
Consider this dance
my way of saying thank you.

281
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,959
After this dance,

282
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,230
we're even.

283
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,070
You want us to get even?

284
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,390
You'll do a solo dance, then.

285
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,430
Everyone, stop.

286
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,510
Let her dance.

287
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,750
Go ahead.

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,470
I'm not good at it,

289
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,950
so just make do with it.

290
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,070
How embarrassing.

291
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,190
I've never seen such a dance.

292
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,630
How nice.

293
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,630
That looks like it.

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,559
Brava!

295
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,510
Brilliant!

296
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,439
They're hiding in the room!

297
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,510
Burn them alive!

298
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,430
Hong Dou.

299
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,590
Fire!

300
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,159
Fire!

301
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,910
Young Master.

302
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,679
Quick, put it off!

303
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,470
Oh no.

304
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,670
Young Master is afraid of fire. Hurry!

305
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,590
Lu Zhuo.

306
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,910
Are you alright, Lu Zhuo?

307
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,590
Lu Zhuo!

308
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,550
Lu Zhuo!

309
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,799
(There, there, Zhuo.)

310
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,519
Lu Zhuo.

311
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,119
(Afraid not.)

312
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,950
You're coming with me.

313
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,750
We'll leave this world together.

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,639
Lu Zhuo.

315
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,479
No...

316
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,479
Are you alright, Lu Zhuo?

317
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,359
No...

318
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,799
Why did you lie to me?

319
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,510
Lu Zhuo.

320
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,070
Don't come near...

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,739
Don't come near!

322
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:26,150
You liars!

323
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,039
You all lied to me!

324
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,270
Don't come near!

325
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,999
Young Master!

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,910
Young Master!

327
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,590
Lu Zhuo!

328
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,870
Lu Zhuo!

329
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,670
Stop screaming!
