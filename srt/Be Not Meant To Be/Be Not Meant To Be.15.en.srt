3
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,819
Young Master.

4
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,199
I've let you down.

5
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,919
I failed you, Young Master.

6
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,599
They pointed their guns at me

7
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,710
and claimed to want to kill my family.

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,470
Your Master.

9
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,719
I'm sorry!

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,790
I'm sorry!

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,839
It's all my fault!

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,110
Young Master!

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,550
Young Master...

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,759
It's all my fault,

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,679
Young Master!

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,670
A'wen.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,470
You're not to blame for this.

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,910
Come here.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,670
Young Master!

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,990
A'wen.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,990
Young Master.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,310
You know who I care the most.

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,430
Young Master.

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,350
Take good care of her.

25
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,399
Young Master...

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,590
Go.

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,390
- Young Master...
- Go!

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,039
Young Master.

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,470
Wait for me.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,670
I beg of you, Young Master Yan.

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,910
Help us to get out of this city.

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,990
Only you can do us this favor.

33
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,350
Nanzhao. You know nothing about
how these gangs work.

34
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,999
Lu Zhuo isn't going
to get away with it.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,510
I can do you a favor and save him.

36
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,679
But I hope

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,670
you can leave him willingly.

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,830
Nanzhao.

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,719
Forgive me

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,110
for my selfishness.

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,399
I fancy you.

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,390
I've been looking for you
everywhere all these years.

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,670
Promise me you'll leave Lu Zhuo

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,430
and I'll get rid of Tie Shanhu for you.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,919
Once Tie Shanhu is gone,

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,230
Lu Zhuo is safe.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,790
We then head back to Nan City.

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,950
Let's start anew, okay?

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,350
I'm not asking too much, am I?

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,510
Sure.

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,470
You have my word.

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,799
Miss Ye.

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,199
Go save our young master.

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,639
They're going to drown him alive!

55
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,790
Hold on, A'wen.

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,830
Young Master Yan.

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,599
Lu Zhuo

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,320
used the Qinglong Society's boats
to traffic arms,

59
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,103
which was a serious violation

60
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:08,959
of the society's iron rule
of the three forbidden trades.

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,950
According to the code,
he should be drowned alive.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,750
Leader.

63
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,510
Who is going to issue the order?

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,750
You or me?

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,670
Do it.

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,430
Yes.

67
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,750
Yan Jinxing.

68
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,950
Go now

69
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,430
before it's too late.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,990
Thank you, Lord Tiger.

71
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,590
Bring it on.

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,110
Nanzhao.

73
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,270
Are you alright?

74
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,590
I'm fine.

75
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,230
You gave me the fright of my life.
I thought I'd lose you.

76
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,990
Of course not.

77
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,630
We have a lifetime ahead of you.

78
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,590
Aren't you going to propose to me?

79
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,790
Where's the ring?

80
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,350
I'm all ready.

81
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,430
Nanzhao!

82
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,750
Young Master!

83
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,950
A'wen.

84
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,239
Where's Nanzhao?

85
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,310
Where is she?

86
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,879
You're finally awake, Young Master!

87
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,679
You'd been unconscious for some time.

88
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,839
Our men were worried sick.

89
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,710
Answer me. Where is she?

90
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,990
Young Master.

91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,550
Get some good rest.

92
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,719
For one last time, Yang A'wen,

93
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,990
where is Ye Nanzhao?

94
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,150
Well...

95
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,310
That night,

96
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,910
I kept searching for her
along the riverbank.

97
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,839
That was a fast-flowing river.

98
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,070
To save you,

99
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,710
she pushed you ashore with all she had.

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,630
Yet she didn't make it.

101
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,790
Wait.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,719
Young Master.

103
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,750
Calm down!

104
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,990
Young Master!

105
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,159
Ye Nanzhao is dead!

106
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,590
She's not coming back to life!

107
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,119
Listen up, A'wen.

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,630
Nanzhao won't die in vain.

109
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,630
I'll make

110
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,710
those who caused

111
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,350
her death

112
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,950
pay for what they did.

113
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,350
(Mr. Lu.)

114
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,279
(Do you take Miss Ye to be your wife?)

115
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,630
(As her husband,)

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,959
(in sickness and in health,)

117
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,999
(you will love her,)

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,039
(care for her,)

119
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,119
(honor her,)

120
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,310
(accept her,)

121
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,439
(remain faithful to her forever)

122
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,270
(until the end of your life.)

123
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,030
(I do.)

124
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,430
(The bride may enter now.)

125
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,790
(In the eyes of God,)

126
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,430
(marriage is a sacred vow.)

127
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,239
(It is a union of two souls)

128
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,679
(witnessed by the Lord)

129
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,950
(and sealed in an everlasting covenant.)

130
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,110
(Amen.)

131
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,310
(Ye Nanzhao.)

132
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,590
(My wife.)

133
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,710
(No matter how far I must go,)

134
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,230
(I will avenge you.)

135
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:50,424
(Qinglong Society leader Lu Zhuo weds,
identity of bride remains a mystery)

136
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,480
(Caution in all that we govern)
Young Master.

137
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,590
Someone spotted Scar Eagle in Nan City.

138
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,879
I've already sent our men to confirm it.

139
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,999
It really is him.

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,590
He's under close surveillance now.

141
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,950
We can move anytime.

142
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,430
Let's go.

143
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,479
To Nan City.

144
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,350
Yes!

145
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,037
(Nan City)

146
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,790
Lu Zhuo is having a good life.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,759
You two just split up.

148
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,119
He's already married

149
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,350
in no time.

150
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,830
You don't have
to keep updating me on him.

151
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,990
We're not in contact anymore.

152
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,159
Actually, I think

153
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,550
you shouldn't blame Lu Zhuo.

154
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,510
As far as he knows, you're already dead.

155
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,750
If he knew you were still alive,

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,510
he would never have made that choice.

157
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,510
There's no "if."

158
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,790
Let's go.

159
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,710
Aren't the guests already here?

160
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,070
Let's go.

161
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:04,737
(The Paramount)

162
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,639
Please, let me go!

163
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,750
I'm married with a child.

164
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,159
Let me go. Please let me go!

165
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,470
I like mature women like you.

166
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,550
Please let me go!

167
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,710
Please...

168
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,030
Sir.

169
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,230
Please spare me, sir.

170
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,270
Lu Zhuo!

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,990
(Nanzhao.)

172
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,030
(Forgive me)

173
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,679
(for not telling you sooner.)

174
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,190
(It was meant to be a surprise.)

175
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,270
(Will you marry me?)

176
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,950
(I love you.)
