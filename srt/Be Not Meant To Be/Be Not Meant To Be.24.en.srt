=Episode 24=

3
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,850
They're together.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,879
They're not together.

5
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,719
They're together.

6
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,670
They're not together.

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,510
They're together.

8
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,910
They're not together.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,630
Wait...

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,590
Young Master.

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,030
What is this?

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,599
If you dump Miss Ye now,

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,550
you'll regret it
when you regain your memory.

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,039
Fine, I've run my mouth.

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,990
I'll stop talking.

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,519
How are the Lus doing?

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,119
Upon learning about Lu Wenyin's death,

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,359
First Madam has gone insane.

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,159
They're waiting for you

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,870
to go back
and deal with the family property.

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,390
Let's head back to Jiang City, then.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,439
If we travel back to Jiang City now,

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,150
you won't get to see Miss Ye again.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,790
That's perfect.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,199
Not having to see that face

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,310
puts my mind at ease.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,839
Wait.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,950
Here comes Miss Ye!

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,070
You see, Young Master.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,750
Though you don't remember her,

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,239
your body

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,399
responds to her name.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,319
Yang A'wen.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,510
I'm warning you.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,199
Stop teasing me with her.

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,959
Young Master.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,270
Heed my advice
and spare yourself the trouble.

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,750
Break her heart and you'll
have a hard time getting her back.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,870
Perfect.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,350
With my busy schedule,

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,590
I have no time for that.

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,679
Miss Ye.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,350
Yang A'wen. Go get the car now!

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,150
I'll go get the car.

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,870
Lu Zhuo.

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,470
What's the matter?

47
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,712
I'm going back to Jiang City with you.

48
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:33,119
I've made myself clear.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm proposing this idea
as the head of Cheng family.

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,870
The Cheng family?

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,750
My father has let me
taken over the household.

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,079
Well,

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
under Yan Jinxing's management,

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,510
the Cheng family
committed many wrongdoings,

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,790
from arms trafficking to human trafficking.

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,270
Now that I've taken over,

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,870
I want to give it a fresh start.

58
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,240
It's your family affair.
What does that have to do with me?

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,430
Our family is
the second-largest family in Jiang City.

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,590
Working with me is your best option.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,870
Come on. Let's head back
to Jiang City together.

62
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,159
(Jiang City)
(Half a month later)

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,039
How grand this is!

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,039
Young Master.

65
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,670
What do you think?

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,710
My family owns many ships,

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,950
so I plan to start a shipping company.

68
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,919
With war breaking out everywhere,

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,319
supplies are hard to come by.

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,990
I hope to do my part as well.

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,870
Looks like you've thought this through.

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,350
That's a good idea,

73
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,039
but this doesn't seem to have much

74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,590
to do with the Qinglong Society.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,110
Of course it does.

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,590
With pirates running rampant,

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,790
I need the Qinglong Society
to escort us.

78
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,559
Miss Ye.

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,270
You know what the Qinglong Society does,

80
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,950
don't you?

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,910
I do.

82
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,590
But the Qinglong Society
under Lu Zhuo's leadership

83
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,710
will be completely different
from what it used to be.

84
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,030
This is something
he's always wanted to do.

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,550
Sure.

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,670
The Qinglong Society can join this deal.

87
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,430
But I have one condition.

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,910
I need to join your trading company.

89
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,030
I'd like to give my men

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,350
a legitimate identity.

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,870
Deal.

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,030
A'wen.

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,359
How did that woman

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,679
win me over?

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,199
Young Master.

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,719
As far as I know,

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,599
it seems

98
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,030
you were the one who courted Miss Ye.

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,350
Impossible.

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,190
I hate her face so much.

101
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,590
She must have tricked me somehow.

102
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,870
Young Master.

103
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,790
If you really hated her,

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,279
why did you buy her roses,

105
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,910
and this many at that?

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,079
I just like roses.

107
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,550
They aren't for her

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,910
How stubborn you are.

109
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,839
Young Master.

110
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,719
Let's get going.

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,910
Miss Ye is meeting you tomorrow
to sign the contract.

112
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,870
It's just a contract.

113
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,390
Why must we be here?

114
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,350
Because this place

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,790
means a lot to me.

116
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,390
Where's the contract?

117
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,550
Once we sign this contract,

118
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,550
I'll be returning to Nan City.

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,719
Who knows

120
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,830
when we'll meet again?

121
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,790
So, Lu Zhuo,

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,270
will you keep me company a bit longer

123
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,150
as business partners?

124
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,990
Sure.

125
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,710
What do you want to do?

126
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,990
I know you don't trust me.

127
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,350
After all, in your eyes,

128
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,030
I'm more like Bai Shuangshuang.

129
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,950
A woman who once deceived you.

130
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,910
I didn't believe you either.

131
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,950
But, Lu Zhuo,

132
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,750
you said you'd prove it to me.

133
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,830
So now

134
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,590
it's my turn to prove it to you.

135
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,270
Ye Nanzhao, what are you doing?

136
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,470
You say you hate me,

137
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,639
despise me,

138
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,710
and are annoyed by me.

139
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,350
If you

140
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,790
truly never want me in your life again,

141
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,230
then don't hold on to my hand.

142
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,830
Have you lost your mind, Ye Nanzhao?

143
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,870
Do you know how dangerous that was?

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,070
What if you fell?

145
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,910
I thought I'd make you remember me

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,230
by staying with you over the past month.

147
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,870
But you didn't.

148
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,039
I thought

149
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,639
being where we first met

150
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,759
might make you remember me.

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,030
Still, you didn't.

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,030
Now that we're here,

153
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,910
why can't you remember me?

154
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,230
We've been through it all.

155
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,390
Why is it that you,
of all people, forgot me?

156
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,030
Ye Nanzhao.

157
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,710
Stop crying.

158
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,950
If you keep crying,

159
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,190
I might just
fall in love with you again.

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,439
Alright.

161
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,510
Didn't you say so?

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,230
If we spend more time together,
I'd remember it.

163
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,950
Do you mean it?

164
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,350
Yes.

165
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,750
I mean it!

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,936
Everyone, come take a photo.

(Grand Opening of Shiye Co., Ltd.)

168
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,670
Boss.

169
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,359
- Where's Ah Wen?
- Your young master listens to my young lady.

170
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,279
- By the way, where's my brother?
- Your young lady listens to our young master.

171
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,879
Over there.

172
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,330
- Your young lady listens to our young master.
- Your young master listens to our young lady.

173
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,719
A'wen. Come down for the photo.

174
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,559
Hurry up, A'wen.

175
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,719
You're the only one missing.

176
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,630
Okay, coming!

177
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,750

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,359
Come on.

179
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,110
Yes.

180
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,719
Haven't they always been close?

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,190
Why are they always arguing now?

182
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,710
Maybe

183
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,830
they're not as close as we are.

184
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,710
Photo time.

185
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,061
Hong Dou.

(Grand Opening of Shiye Co., Ltd.)

187
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,550
Here.

188
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,879
Everyone, stand still.

189
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,599
Ready.

190
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,399
Three.

191
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,959
Two...

192
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,750
Wait a second.

193
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,159
They look perfect together.

194
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,190
So sweet.

195
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,319
Three.

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,919
Two.

197
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,919
One.

198
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,590
Is white sugar sweet?

199
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,830
Yes!

200
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,830
You remember now?

201
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,990
Not entirely.

202
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,519
Didn't the doctor say

203
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,350
we need more physical intimacy.

204
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,990
Why don't you kiss me again?

205
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,150
How cunning of you, Lu Zhuo.

206
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,070
I was never a good man to begin with.

207
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,390
The doctor also said

208
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,070
I might never remember in my life.

209
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,350
In that case, I'll need you

210
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,919
to stay with me

211
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,110
for life.

212
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:59,090
(The End)
