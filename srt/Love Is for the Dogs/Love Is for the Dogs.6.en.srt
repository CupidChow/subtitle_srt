1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,080
My first love... was you, Shirosaki.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,480
You're the one I can't help but think about.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,590
Tomorrow, you'll probably come to mind, too.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,230
It was you back then, it's you right now.
And it will always be, you.

5
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,740
I...

6
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,180
I...

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,730
I feel similarly.

8
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,340
"Similarly"?

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,430
"Similarly"?

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,010
You come to my mind, too.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,900
You are special to me.

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,600
As Dorako.

13
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,100
What?

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,830
Dorako?

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,720
What do you... mean?

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,600
You're Dorako, the girl who helped me care for a dog,
and shared dorayaki with me.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,460
And now we've bonded as Shogun and Sakura's owners.
So I thank you for that.

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,820
- You're welcome.
- Alright then, see you.

19
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,820
Kai, what's with that half-baked reply?

20
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,450
You overheard?

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,330
No, not at all.

22
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,240
Please excuse me.

23
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,250
I know.

24
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,220
That just means that I was rejected.

25
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,800
But it's fine. I'm just relieved that I got that all out.

26
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,850
It's regarding Mrs. Kasuga's case.
Please review the text in the notarized document.

27
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,210
Will do.

28
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,840
But it's also possible that he's indirectly telling me
that he likes me.

29
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,350
Aiko, it's Mom. Let's have lunch together.

30
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,780
There are some things I wish to speak with you about.

31
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,520
Come to think of it, I don't even have his number.

32
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,010
[Woo So Ha has sent a photo]

33
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,820
Aiko, you forgot this.

34
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,520
Where's So Ha?

35
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
He's busy with work.

36
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,230
Your arrival was sudden, so I have not informed him yet.

37
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,250
Your luggage is empty?

38
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,680
I need space to pack him in.

39
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,130
Pack what in?

40
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,650
So Ha.

41
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,090
Sorry?

42
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,530
Let's go.

43
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,460
What's wrong with Mr. Shirosaki?

44
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,710
He's been at it for a while now.

45
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:50,430
Sir, we know you have time on your hands, but please,
let Watanabe do the cleaning.

46
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,510
Me?

47
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,070
That was...

48
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,190
My first love was you, Shirosaki.

49
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,460
What did that mean? Was that in the past?

50
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,010
- Sir?
- Let me do the cleaning.

51
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,300
What's wrong with him?

52
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,120
He's suddenly replenishing the supplies.

53
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,810
Mr. Shirosaki's been acting strange today.

54
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,090
Isn't he always?

55
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,730
Gosh... Mr. Shirosaki,
just leave all these trivial tasks to Watanabe.

56
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,760
Why must I do everything?

57
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Come on, just do it.

58
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,640
- Please, do it.
- I'll do it.

59
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,020
Sir, how about you go enjoy a lunch break with Shogun?

60
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,170
Here you go, Sir.

61
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,390
What's going on?

62
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,520
You're looking for So Ha?

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,440
He's out making deliveries.

64
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,200
Is that so? I'll wait for him inside then.

65
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,020
Miss...

66
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,020
That dog...

67
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,400
You are Mr. Kai?

68
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,290
Erm, may I help you?

69
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,190
What was that?

70
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,220
Hi, Aiko. You came.

71
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,250
I'm here for my bag...

72
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,850
I've kept it inside.

73
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,090
A lot happened yesterday, huh?

74
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,870
Let me treat you to lunch.

75
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,750
Wait. Now is not the time to head on in.

76
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,080
A date?

77
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,460
For real?

78
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,450
In the first place, Shirosaki's private life
has always been a mystery.

79
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,810
I'm surprised he's rather popular with women.

80
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,250
I don't even know what became of his relationship
with Ms. Yuka.

81
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,810
Ms. Yuka has begun dating someone else recently.

82
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,930
- Huh? Really?
- Yeah.

83
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,830
In any case, this is awkward, so I'll get going.

84
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,400
Hang on.

85
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,160
What's wrong? You're not your usual self.

86
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm regretting it.

87
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,200
My mind just went blank that day.

88
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,020
Something welled up inside me, and my confession
came out like overflowing water.

89
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,000
You get what I mean?

90
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
No, I don't.

91
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,570
But this much, I can tell you.

92
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,680
For someone like Kai who's slow to catch on,
you have to be direct with your words.

93
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,660
Be direct, how?

94
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,380
In Korean, we say, "sarang-haeyo".
In English, it'd be, "I love you".

95
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,770
But there are too many variations of "I love you" in Japanese.

96
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,810
You must be more affirmative and direct.

97
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,720
I like you.

98
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,890
I'm telling you that I like you.

99
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,680
That lady sounds like...

100
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,050
Nah, it couldn't be.

101
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,100
But it is.

102
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,640
Woo So Ha.

103
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,850
You're So Ha's sister.

104
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,870
Heading out for deliveries.

105
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,840
Hang on. Where are you going?

106
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,240
You know that you're being really rash, don't you?

107
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,940
Pardon me, but who are you?

108
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,670
What?

109
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,800
You're that lawyer.

110
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,620
The name's Hanamura. Thank you for letting Shogun stay here.

111
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,940
Right, his sister.

112
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,250
I was wondering who she was.

113
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,530
Erm... So Yeong...

114
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,860
[Episode 6]

115
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,410
Kai, Sumomo isn't doing well.

116
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,960
Bring her to the hospital immediately.

117
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,690
- I'll leave Shogun to you.
- Huh? Sure.

118
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,980
- Where's the pet carrier?
- In the store room. Over there.

119
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,650
She's having seizures?

120
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,950
She's showing neurological symptoms.
Administer oxygen and run a blood test.

121
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,990
- Got it.
- I'll also prep the ultrasound.

122
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,890
- Prepare the emergency medication.
- Got it.

123
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,340
Sir, her breathing is becoming more labored.

124
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,080
Intubate her.

125
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,420
We've got her seizures under control for now.
I suspect it's terminal kidney failure.

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
What do you plan to do?

127
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,210
I'm barely holding up in caring for her on my end.

128
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,270
Any senior rooms available at Sincere?

129
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,300
They're full at the moment.

130
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,010
I'll try somewhere else.

131
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,530
We'll look after her here for the time being.

132
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,680
Mr. Shirosaki, you have a call.

133
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,250
See you.

134
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,200
Please take care of her, Kosuke.

135
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,710
Ms. Yuka.

136
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,730
I'll watch over Sumomo.

137
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,980
Thank you.

138
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,250
I see.

139
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,560
Mr. So Ha's sister suddenly came in like a massive typhoon,

140
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,540
and expressed her love for that gentle vet.

141
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,040
That's the gist of it, yes.

142
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,530
She's what I'd call an alpha.

143
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,160
Us boorish folk don't stand a chance against winners like her.

144
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,340
They snatch away our opportunities,

145
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,760
and leave us broken and defeated.

146
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,420
No, I understand.

147
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,020
I'm already plenty defeated.

148
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,550
Thank you for coming.

149
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,200
No, no problem at all.

150
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,870
It is an honor to meet you.

151
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,130
May I ask what brings you all the way here to Japan?

152
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,490
Actually, there's something that's troubling me.

153
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,540
She says she is troubled about something.

154
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,440
I heard that So Ha has been active
in animal rescue efforts in Japan.

155
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,950
He has been praised for giving up his stake in the company,

156
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,980
and rejecting financial help from his family.

157
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,210
He even rejected family support to live alone.

158
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,180
What? Then Mr. So Ha's reputation...

159
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,040
Indeed. Others hold him in high regard,

160
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,550
even though he was disowned by the family.

161
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,570
He's even being touted as the next candidate
for president of WooRoA.

162
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,790
It was one of the topics of our recent shareholders' meeting.

163
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,680
In other words...

164
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,460
He has been nominated to be the next successor
of the WooRoA Group.

165
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,930
That's why I flew here to find out what he thinks of all this.

166
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,630
I want to know whether he'll come back with me
to rebuild his career,

167
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,040
or whether he'll remain in Japan forever.

168
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,470
That is a major decision that Mr. So Ha has to make.

169
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,750
I would also like to hear Ms. Hanamura's thoughts on this

170
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,420
before I go to him personally.

171
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,250
How is So Ha currently doing in Japan?

172
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,910
Is he fit to be a candidate for president of the WooRoA Group?

173
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,600
Ms. Hanamura would certainly be the best person to ask.

174
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,550
Let Hanamura know that we need all this info from her.

175
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,060
Yes, sir.

176
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
We will find out, and update you accordingly.

177
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,430
Thank you.

178
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,690
I'm back, Shogun.

179
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,420
Shirosaki has frequent night shifts,
so So Ha manages the house chores on his own.

180
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,660
Looks yummy.

181
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,250
Bon appétit.

182
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,550
Wow, so good.

183
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,020
It's So Ha.

184
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,500
Aiko, sorry to disturb you.

185
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,070
I made sure to add veggies into my dinner tonight.

186
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,780
Shy person...
["XX person" series]

187
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,370
Grumpy person... That's Kai.

188
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,190
At night, he reviews his Japanese.

189
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,200
And in the morning, he brings Shogun for walks.

190
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,640
Let's go, Shogun. Wanna go to the beach?

191
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,210
Off we go!

192
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,970
That guy...

193
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,050
I told him not to leave the clothes in the washing machine.

194
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,200
[Kai, enjoy!
P.S. I know you like it spicy]

195
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,360
Thank you for waiting. Here's a smiley heart for you.

196
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,830
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

197
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,930
- He's really cute.
- Way too handsome.

198
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,140
As you can see, he is very popular at work.

199
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,980
He easily makes friends with everyone
in a town that's unfamiliar to him.

200
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,800
People are naturally drawn to him.

201
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,490
That is the most important trait one needs in business, is it not?

202
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,660
I agree.

203
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,490
They can't do without the young master anymore.

204
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,010
Is that so?

205
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,990
So Ha, you can go take your break.

206
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,830
Okay.

207
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,000
And here is your payslip for the month.

208
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,820
Thank you very much.

209
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,780
I'm so touched.

210
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,530
Let's treat Mr. Kai to something with this.

211
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,080
What?

212
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,280
Hey!

213
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,630
Please, have a seat.

214
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,010
Thank you.

215
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:30,420
I had you join us tonight
because I wanted to personally express my gratitude to you.

216
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,500
Thank you for taking care of my little brother.

217
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,110
To be honest, he's really a handful.

218
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,650
Says you.

219
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,680
I took care of almost everything.

220
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,120
Nonsense. I was taking care of stuff, too.

221
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,620
- In what way?
- Back at you.

222
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,040
Alright, let us ー

223
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll pass on the alcohol. I'll drink this.

224
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,080
Cheers.

225
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,630
Cheers.

226
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,910
Mr. Kai.

227
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,510
Have one.

228
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,260
Delicious.

229
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,600
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

230
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,020
So Ha, doesn't this bring back memories?

231
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,920
This place reminds me of the restaurant we used to frequent.

232
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,940
The one at Hangang Park?

233
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeouido Hangang Park. My favorite hangout spot.

234
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,610
There's a restaurant there that I used to frequent.

235
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,250
I see.

236
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,490
What's this?

237
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,660
That's kkaennip. Like, wild sesame leaves.

238
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,400
Wild sesame?

239
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,350
This is when I need someone to hold it down for me.

240
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,990
Please excuse me. It's the hospital.

241
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,770
Here you go.

242
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,270
I don't need your help.

243
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,950
Why?

244
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,920
Let go. I'll do it myself.

245
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,860
Aiko!

246
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,140
Over here.

247
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,920
Is it really alright for me to join in?

248
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,590
Of course.

249
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,430
Because you're my chingu.

250
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,610
How is Theo?

251
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,960
He's woken up, and drank some water.

252
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
His condition is currently stable.

253
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,270
What about Tora? Has his fever gone down?

254
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

255
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,330
It's this girl, right?

256
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,610
What about her?

257
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,790
She's the reason you won't go back to Seoul?

258
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,520
The two of you, that's a bit too...

259
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,260
Cheers.

260
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,620
Cheers.

261
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,900
You like Ms. Aiko, don't you?

262
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,890
What are you talking about?

263
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,530
Translate what I said.

264
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,860
He likes you.

265
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,180
That's why he wants to stay here.

266
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,760
You're wrong.

267
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,320
What is wrong?

268
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,980
Erm... well, I'm talking about Kai.

269
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,370
Don't make assumptions. I just like the way of life here.

270
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,180
Can't you be more honest with yourself?

271
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm serious.

272
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:03,790
You abandoned WooRoA
and turned your back against your family.

273
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,830
All the more reason you should be honest.

274
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,990
I already said you're wrong.

275
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,030
I...

276
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,750
have been dumped.

277
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,330
Hanamura?

278
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,060
What's going on?

279
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:37,720
It was for the best. I feel completely, and utterly alleviated.

280
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,590
That's right. Everything just... blew right away.

281
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,290
- I'm fine.
- Let me send you home.

282
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,420
It's fine, I'm okay. My home is nearby.

283
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,300
But you don't look okay.

284
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,970
I can walk home on my own.

285
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,570
In that case... I'll watch out for you.

286
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:27,010
♪ Sakura, Sakura, oh adorable Sakura ♪

287
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,460
♪ Her boyfriend's name is Shogun ♪

288
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,290
You're tone-deaf.

289
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,840
What do you want, Shadow?

290
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,010
Huh?

291
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,780
A shadow is following me.

292
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,570
Yes, I am.

293
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm right here.

294
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,140
You're really nice, Shadow.

295
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm very worried about you.

296
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,370
Alright, follow me, Shadow.

297
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,550
Whoa! Watch out, don't trip yourself.

298
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,220
I hope she gets home safely.

299
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,150
So Ha, come back with me.

300
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,900
To where?

301
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,190
You have to head back sooner or later.

302
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,130
I'm not leaving.

303
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,180
Woo So Ha.

304
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,410
What's there to go back for?

305
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,840
There's no point in going back.

306
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,840
My family...

307
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,680
They hardly see each other.

308
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,840
They're only concerned about competition, profits, and results.

309
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:12,180
When I'm in that home, I don't know who I am anymore.

310
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,820
And it's not as if Dad is waiting for me to go back.

311
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,370
He's only waiting for an obedient son to return to him.

312
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,660
So Ha.

313
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,810
You know you shouldn't take Dad's words as they are.

314
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,120
Are you stupid?

315
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,320
You should know.

316
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,590
Dad is actually worried about you.

317
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:44,040
No matter how much you hate it, we're still family.

318
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,200
So, let's go back.

319
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,200
So Yeong.

320
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:03,060
Right now, I'm just Woo So Ha.

321
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,790
I'm not going back with you.

322
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,250
I've found my reason to be here.

323
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,450
Why don't you stay in Japan for a little longer?

324
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,630
You said you liked Kai, didn't you?

325
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,450
That's because he treats you well.

326
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:39,050
And don't you think he's a wonderful guy
who's passionate about saving animals?

327
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,800
Too bad he doesn't seem ready to accept anyone into his life.

328
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,280
That certainly seems true.

329
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,120
Hey! What about you?

330
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,970
What are you planning to do here?

331
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,950
Hey!

332
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,340
Let's part ways here.

333
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,770
Will you be alright?

334
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,000
Of course. I just need to go upstairs.

335
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,950
Wait, Shadow.

336
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,470
Yes?

337
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,030
Thank you.

338
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,380
- Hello?
- Mr. Shirosaki, Sumomo is...

339
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,230
How are her vitals?

340
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,400
Her blood pressure remains low.
We've administered a vasopressor.

341
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,490
But she still remains unresponsive.
She's not passing enough urine either.

342
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,680
Kosuke.

343
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,190
Don't be too sad.

344
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,420
I'm sure she's feeling scared about saying goodbye.

345
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:56,740
We need to reassure her with an "it's okay",
and send her off knowing she's got people at her side.

346
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,050
I wonder if Sumomo still remembers them.

347
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,420
Who?

348
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:15,090
Her old family, and the discipline and kindness
they shared with her.

349
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,730
They say most dogs do.

350
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,750
I will relay these conditions to the other party.

351
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,790
I'll let you know whether it's enough
to enter into a mediation agreement.

352
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,300
Thank you for your help.

353
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,650
My head's about to explode.

354
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,890
Looks like you're doing pretty well as a lawyer.

355
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,320
I woke up early today to prep the files.

356
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,880
Thank you.

357
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,750
You should thank Mr. Shirosaki, not me.

358
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,690
Huh?

359
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:54,020
When I called you last night, you said that
Mr. Shirosaki turned into a shadow and sent you home.

360
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,190
I hope I didn't say anything weird to him.

361
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,550
I'm scared to ask him about it.

362
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,680
Monitor her breathing rate.

363
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,060
Yes, sir.

364
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,430
Can you eat, Sumomo?

365
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,760
Mr. Shirosaki, Ms. Yuka is here.

366
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,050
This is Mr. Nagakura.

367
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,930
He is the son of Sumomo's former owner.
I tried my luck and contacted him, and he came down here.

368
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,040
When my father passed, we couldn't take her in
as my company apartment didn't allow pets.

369
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,130
Please pass this to Sumomo.

370
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,110
Do you recognize this, Sumomo?

371
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,850
That's right. It belonged to your former owner.

372
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,000
I heard they often used to sunbathe with this
on a bench in a park.

373
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,190
Did that make you feel better?

374
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,290
Yummy, isn't it?

375
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,530
Yummy.

376
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,930
She has a peaceful expression.

377
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,110
That's great.

378
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,480
It's okay.

379
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,220
It's okay, girl.

380
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:21,150
I wanted to thank you for yesterday,
when I heard about Sumomo.

381
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,020
15 years and 4 months.

382
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,130
She did well.

383
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:41,510
We know very well that they will leave us one day.
But it's still hard to accept.

384
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,690
I pretend that I'm already used to it.

385
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,220
But we can also think it this way.

386
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:09,090
They'll be waiting for us when it's our turn to bid farewell.

387
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,200
Sakura will definitely appear before me, wagging her tail.

388
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,060
So I believe I'll be happy

389
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,810
if I follow after her.

390
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,350
Funny.

391
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,860
I had the very same thought.

392
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,030
That's why until then, I make sure to work hard
and do whatever I can.

393
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:53,260
So that one day, I can proudly tell them I've done my best.

394
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,010
Looks like us dog-lovers think on the same wavelength.

395
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,400
I have to send Sumomo off.

396
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,710
I'll let Sakura play with Shogun for a little longer then.

397
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,430
Would that be okay?

398
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,840
I'll see you later.

399
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,220
Sure.

- Especially to Kai?
- Yeah.

403
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,580
Tell him that I'll visit him again.

404
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,090
If he continues to be so clueless, I'll make him mine.

405
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,140
- You're going to scare him off.
- What?

406
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,470
I'm sorry.

407
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,970
For disappointing you.

408
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,460
I guess you're already used to that.

409
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,810
You're trying to change.

410
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:46,850
You're rediscovering yourself by meeting new people,
and experiencing new things.

411

I'll explain your situation to Dad.

We haven't managed to resolve the situation at all.

Here you go.

418
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:35,960
- Thank you.
- We've finally managed to establish a connection with WooRoA.

419
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,020
If this goes on, the opportunity will slip right from our fingers.

420
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,370
That would be terrible.

421
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,490
We have to seize these opportunities.

Ms. Yuka said we're closing shop for the day.

They're bidding farewell to Sumomo?

430
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,030
I'm really gonna feel lonely.

431
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,970
There are so many things that I wasn't able to do for her.

432
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,530
I was hoping to tell her I love her one last time.

433
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,230
Not being able to tell her that makes me feel...

434
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,270
I'm full of regrets.

435
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,980
What do you need me to help with?

436
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,600
Our rooftop dog park is still open,
if you could help me close it.

437
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,180

I'll have to leave someday.

442
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,980
