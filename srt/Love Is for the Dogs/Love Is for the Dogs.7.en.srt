00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,910
I like you.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,350
No, that doesn't sound right.

00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,640
You're important to me.

Aiko, I like you.

00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,190
I...

9
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,490
I mean, of course, I do like you too, as a chingu.

10
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,590
That was what you meant, wasn't it?

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,650
You like me not as a love interest, but as a friend.

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,200
If so, I apologize for misunderstanding.

13
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,100
It's both.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,400
Huh?

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,610
As a love interest, and as a friend. Half-and-half.

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,910
Or perhaps more like a seven-three split.

17
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:34,160
Seven and three...
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,440
No problem.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,760
Sorry, if you'll excuse me.

20
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,390
Sorry Mom, I was a bit tied up.

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,500
What? Divorce?

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,710
I'm coming in.

23
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,550
Wow, I see that you've kept your place clean and neat.

24
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,280
Why?

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,510
Let me put the peaches in the fridge.

26
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,220
Why a divorce, now?

27
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,280
Just the other day you'd given up on leaving Dad
because it was troublesome.

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,220
You have a quaint little rice cooker.

29
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,850
I want a stylish cooker like this one,
that I can use to make rice just for myself.

30
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,200
I want to live alone, and sleep and wake up on my own terms.

31
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,070
You haven't done that before, Mom?

32
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,810
I moved out of my family home the moment I got married.

33
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,280
I had to do a follow-up test during my health screening.

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,950
A follow-up test?

35
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,450
They found a shadow in my lungs.

36
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,260
And when I did a more detailed test,
it turned out to be just my rib, so everything was fine.

37
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,790
I'm really glad to hear that.

38
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,410
But you see, that was when it hit me.

39
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,260
If I'd really fallen ill, it would have been too late.

40
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,530
I have to change my life while I'm still healthy.

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,410
But your Dad won't hear any of it.
I'm serious about this, though.

42
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,920
Right, Sakura?

43
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,180
I understand now.

44
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,600
I'll help you. Let's discuss this with Dad.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,400
If you both can't come to an agreement,
I'll help you as a lawyer.

46

Thank you.

47

Cheer me on too, okay, Sakura?

48
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,230
Once again, thank you for inviting me!

49
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,360
I figured you'd feel like having a drink or two,
so I've brought a range!

50
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,130
Great idea.

51
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,500
Tonight, I shall teach Mr. So Ha
how to appreciate Japanese wine.

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,660
I think you're the one who wants to drink.

53
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,200
You're absolutely right, Mr. Shirosaki! I wanna drink!

54
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,260
Pretty please? Just a teeny request from your cute junior here!

55
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,130
Please drink with me!

56
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,610
Like I mentioned, Ms. Yuka and I…

57
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,900
Yeah, you said things were going great.

58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,190
You're dating each other?

59
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,080
We did discuss something like that,

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,710
but nothing's changed since then,
and she brushes it off whenever I try to ask her out.

61
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,050
Does she even treat me as her boyfriend?

62
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,950
It must be that.

63
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,220
Must be what?

64
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,300
Starting a relationship is hard.

65
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,900
- Starting a relationship?
- I'm actually an expert on the matter.

66
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,430
But I keep fumbling when it comes to Ms. Yuka.

67
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,790
Maybe there's a difference in the intensity
of both your feelings?

68
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,170
That's it! You're really something, Mr. So Ha.

69
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,640
Difference in intensity?

70
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,070
The one who likes the other more tends to suffer.
That's the hard truth.

71
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,490
Says Mr. So Ha, the love expert!

72
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,340
Love expert, how?

73
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,530
- You wouldn't understand, Kai.
- That's rude.

This is really good.

78
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,760
- Kai, drink some too.
- I'll pass, in case I get called up for another emergency.

79
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,010
No wonder you haven't been able to start a relationship.

80
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,370
Exactly.

81

I've been meaning to ask,
how are things between you and Ms. Hanamura?

82
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,270
What do you mean "how are things"?

83
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,420
I've always felt like there's something going on
between the two of you.

84
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,670
But come to think of it, something also seems to be going on
between Mr. So Ha and Ms. Hanamura.

85

To Aiko, I'm half love interest, and half friend.

88
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,460
Is that so? Then how does Mr. Shirosaki feel
about Ms. Hanamura?

89
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,440
To me, Hanamura is…

90
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,950
Love interest versus friend…

- A seven-three split.
- Wow, seven?

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,400
No, maybe it's the other way around.

What's with that off-kilter back-and-forth seesawing?

This must be really tough for Kai to decide.

I'm sorry. Mr. So Ha, seriously, you're cool.

106
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,010
If he gets serious,
he'll surely snatch Ms. Hanamura away.

Are you really okay with that? That's what I mean!

108

Doesn't matter. I'm fine with things as they are.

If I hadn't decided to get a divorce,
I wouldn't have visited your office like I did today.

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,440
So Ha, was that man following you?

345
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,440
Sir, it's hard to tell when he'll be back,
so you'll have to handle things cautiously.

346
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,850
Please speak carefully as well.

347
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,550
I know. I'll be careful.

348
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,030
What did Yeonsu say?

349
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,220
That guy's from the paparazzi.

350
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,240
What?

351
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,620
I've long since been exposed to such people, so I'm used to it.

352
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:16,560
In fact, I'm hoping they'd take a picture of me
washing the dishes right now.

353
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,580
If I'm causing too much trouble for you, I can move out.

354
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,440
So Ha.

355
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,490
Don't suddenly say you're moving out and stuff like that.

356
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:43,740
My mother got divorced and remarried,
and I've been living alone ever since we were separated.

357
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,030
So I've always thought that it was impossible for me
to live together with another person.

358
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:58,470
But right now, I figure it's fine even with you in the house.

359
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,500
- Hyung.
- What's that?

360
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,540
It means "big brother".

361
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,200
- Hyung!
- What the... Don't come near me!

362
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,460
- What the hell?
- Hyung!

363
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,080
Stop it.

364
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,620
Kosuke! Welcome.

365
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,420
Are you free tonight?

366
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,620
Wanna go out for drinks?

367
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,590
I can't tonight. How about tomorrow?

368
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm on night shift tomorrow.

369
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,690
Then I guess we'll take a rain check?

370
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,990
Why did you agree?

371
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,930
Why did you say yes when I asked you to go out with me?

372
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,020
Are you playing around with me or something?

373
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,200
That's not what I ー

374
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,580
Then I want us to see each other more,
and be together every day.

375
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,850
This much is all I have for now.

376
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,740
Right now, romance only takes up this much of my mind.

377
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,940
The rest is reserved for work.

378
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,070
If you're okay with this much capacity, then we can go out.

379
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,120
My capacity... is this much.

380
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,520
Then I guess it won't work out.

381
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,300
Excuse me for a bit.

382
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,440
Hello, So Ha?

383
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,740
This is so hard...

384
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,770
What happened to So Ha?

385
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,910
He's being targeted by the paparazzi.

386
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,050
He was worried he'd cause trouble for our cafe,
so he contacted me.

387
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,710
Being a rich heir must be tough.

388
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,210
Shogun, it feels good, right?

389
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,040

Ruby!

392
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,720
She's in a bad mood today because of that collar.

393
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,380
Yeah. She has to look good, too.
Guess I'll take it off.

394
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,010
Please don't do that.

395
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,700
What?

396
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,940
You may not be aware, but if these animals get serious,
they could hurt you.

397
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,800
Huh?

398
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,040
The reason why they won't do that,
is because they love their owners.

399
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,990
Please don't abuse their trust.

400
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,030
We will be waiting for her at the hospital.

401
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,950
So Ha is funny, kind, and seems popular with women.

402
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,650
Yeah.

403
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,620
Mr. Doctor is warm and makes you feel relaxed.

404
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,640
Makes me wonder what you will do.

405

Like I said, I'm just fine on my own.

406
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,170
I mean, in the future.

408
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,000
No, it's nothing.

409
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,160
I'm counting on you tomorrow.

410
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,230
I hope everything will work out.

411
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,600
Good night.

00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,040
Good night.

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,030
What's all this? Goodness!

414
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,480
I kind of expected it,
but this is what happens once you leave him alone.

415
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,960
My future with him is bleak.

416
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,720
Chikako?

417
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,400
You're finally back.

418
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,090
- You too, Aiko. Welcome home.
- You're late. It's way past the meeting time.

419
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,520
It's been so long since the whole family was here,
so I bought plenty of stuff.

Let's have a good talk.

Mom, come over here.

424
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,300
Okay.

425
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,680
Why do you insist on leaving?

426
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,260
I just want to feel at ease at home.

427
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,200
You're already plenty at ease.

428
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,940
In the mornings, when you're here in the living room,
I stay put in my bedroom.

When I'm outside here, you don't come out of your room.

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,380
We both sense each other's presence, yet we avoid each other.

431
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,090
It feels stifling.

432
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,720
From now on, I want to relax comfortably at home.

433
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,700
Is that too much to ask for?

434
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,420
Is it not a good enough reason for a divorce?

435
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,400
I get it.

436
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,660
I didn't want to bring home the stress I had at work,
so I decided to keep it all in.

437
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,780
But I ended up making you suffer because of that.

438
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,790
I'm sorry.

For giving birth to Aiko.

442
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,460
I also wanted to say the same thing.

443
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,530
I fell in love with you, and married you.

444
00:32:54,610 --> 00:33:00,230
And together, we had Aiko. That's more than enough for me.

"In fact, I'd rather be alone and feel relaxed".
That was what I thought.

449

I can't bring myself to hate you.

451
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,040
And if I don't hate you, then maybe...

452
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,440
Just maybe, I can believe in you one last time.

453

But if you start fighting again,

So it's true? The paparazzi were targeting So Ha?

00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,320
A reporter from a gossip magazine
suddenly approached him yesterday for an interview.

470
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,130
As a precaution, we bought over the footage
at WooRoA Group's request.

Is that a business strategy?

To prevent that article about you from leaking out,

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,240
we had to fork out money to buy ad space in that magazine.

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,840
- Hey...
- Gosh, you scared me!

518
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,420
You were the one who scared me.

519
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,940
I didn't expect you to call me all of a sudden.

520
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,200
I mean, look.

521
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,840
I bought one. A smartphone.

522
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,070
Why did you suddenly want a smartphone?

523
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,410
I just suddenly felt like it.

524
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,030
This thing is amazing.
It's like a phone and computer combined.

525
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,480
I know that.

526
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,110
When I looked up your office number with it,
I accidentally made a call.

527
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,380
You probably tapped on it.

528
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,410
And your friendly assistant answered the call.

529
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,160
You must mean Rumiko, our paralegal.

530
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,400
Yes, and she gave me your personal number.

531
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,030
So, what did you want to ask me?

532
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,100
I wanted to ask you how to save this number onto my phone.

533
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,530
- You called me here for that?
- Huh?

534
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,830
I mean, you had me come
just to teach you how to save a number?

535
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,810
I thought it was some emergency and rushed over.

536
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,650
I didn't call you over. I wanted to ask you over the phone,
but then you suddenly came here.

537
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,150
"Suddenly came here"?
You make it sound like I'm to blame.

538
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,230
But I did have other things to ask you.

539
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,000
Like what?

540
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,560
Like, how to use apps...

541
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,020
Sorry?

542
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,350
And stuff about security. Oh right, and this screen protector.

543
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,820
Looks like you need some special technique to apply it on.

544
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,880
W-What's this "SOS slider"?

545
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,450
Is my phone making a cry for help?

546
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,070
Sorry.

547
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,740
Yes, it's me. Do you have some time now?
[Epilogue]

548
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,380
Ms. Aiko.

549
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,760
Ms. Yuka.

550
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,850
Are you looking for So Ha? He's not in today.

551
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,200
No, I brought Sakura down here for a grooming session today.

552
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,740
May I ask you something?

553
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,340
Sure, go ahead.

554
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:28,050
Do you think that love is an illusion?

555
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,610
It's an instinct.

556
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,460
Pardon?

557
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,670
Love is an instinct.

558
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,560
An instinct.

559
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,020
What a difficult concept to grasp.

560
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,630
There, just now.

561
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:52,790
The person who came to your mind. That's instinct.

562
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:09,050
Excuse me, I have to go.

563
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:15,080
See you.

564
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,620
- Kiss.
- Huh?

565
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,250
- Just now was...
- E-Erm...

566
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,350
Because you are here, Aiko.

567
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,740
What did you just say?

568
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,190
Then be my guest.

569
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,020
Wait, So Ha.

570
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,940
I don't need you anymore.

571
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,070
I don't need anything anymore.
