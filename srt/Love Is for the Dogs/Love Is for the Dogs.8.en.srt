Do you think that love is an illusion?

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,980
Love is an instinct.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,380
There, just now. The person who came to your mind.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,510
That's instinct.

Go ahead.

10
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,330
What just happened was due to romantic interest, right?
If so, I...

11
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,220
No, it wasn't.

12
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,640
That... was purely a reflex.

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,550
- Reflex?
- Right. Spinal reflex, they call it.

14
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,770
You know, like when parrots peck with their beaks,
or dolphins nuzzle.

15
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,410
It was a reflex, with no other meaning to it.

16
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,950
Yes?

17
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,310
Good news, Mr. Shirosaki!

18

Mr. Shirosaki! You're here too, Ms. Hanamura.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,970
Did you both meet each other during your break, sir?

21
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,020
- No, I...
- I came for Sakura...

22
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,120
Don't worry, I was just casually asking.

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,730
But it's nice, isn't it?

24

Meeting each other in between breaks,
secretly going out together...

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,040
I went through this before, too.

26
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,120
Once upon a time, I dropped my glove at a ski resort,

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,980
and the one who picked it up for me is now my husband.

while watching the fire on the stove...

- No, that was lovely.

Turns out that owner's son is an executive
at an insurance company.

51

There are all kinds of pet insurance these days, right?

52
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,760
They cover doctor visits, hospitalization, surgeries,

53
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,610
dental checkups, and even pet hotel discounts.

54
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,760
So as a company newly offering pet insurance,

55
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,640
they're interested in helping fund the shelter.

Of course you'd be thrilled. It's a huge donation!

59

We're talking about hundreds of millions here.

60
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,760
That's right. All for the ideal pet town
that Mr. Shirosaki envisioned.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,690
To make it work,
we'd need 300 million for renovations, for starters.

62
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,410
Operations-wise, there's personnel costs, utilities,
food and medical expenses.

63
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,890
That adds up to 1.2 billion yearly.

64
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,140
And that'll all be paid for by the insurance company?

65
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,180
Of course, making profits is their goal,

66
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,820

and are eager to help.

Let's see...

121
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,120
First, you'd go out for meals,
and ascertain your feelings for one another.

122
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,290
Then meals become dates,
and you'd grow closer from there.

Better not to do things in the wrong order though.

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,990
Wow, I'm excited to visit the place. Let's go!

176
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,170
First, they take in dogs and cats
from the municipal animal welfare center.

177
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,860
The animals are then isolated for a week for medical tests,
before being moved to the housing unit.

178
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,510
How many animals are you currently sheltering?

179
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,780
We have up to 80 animals, dogs and cats included.

180
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,040
Would you like to look around?

181
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,090
Yes, please.

182
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,380
Kai, go with them.

183
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,660
- I'll stay to...
- No.

184
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,420
He has work to do. You and I will go, So Ha.

185
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,870
Let's go, So Ha.

186
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,210
Here is where they're trained to socialize and get used to people.

187
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,300
To teach them proper behavior.

188
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,730
But that doesn't mean these dogs haven't been trained.

189
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,550
There's always a reason for their inappropriate behavior.

190
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,620
Not enough food, lacking sleep -
it could even stem from a fear of humans.

191
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,930
So these trainers try to find out the reason,
and improve their behavior, right?

192
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,460
The scenery here is beautiful.

193
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,070
You can get a better view of the scenery further up ahead.

194
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,030
I'll let those two take it from here.

195
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,840
Shall we?

196
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,330
Ready?

197
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,950
One, two, say cheese.

198
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,650
It's done. Thank you.

199
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,440
Shogun totally loves this place.

200
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,650
He runs around forever whenever I bring him here.

201
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,390
Maybe next time I'll bring Sakura here, too.

202
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:56,410
I guess... I still can't erase that from my memory.

203
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,680
What?

204
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,490
I mean, that reflex thing...

205
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,410
Don't worry, I thought nothing of it.

206
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,680
- "Nothing"?
- Well...

207
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,770
Nothing strange, that is.

208
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,340
Even though we kissed?

209
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,950
To be more specific, the one who kissed me, was you...

210
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,780
To be even more specific,
the one who first came over and touched my hair, was you.

211
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,410
That's because a leaf was...

212
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,890
- A leaf?
- Yeah, a leaf. It was on your hair.

213
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,080
The trees by the road... were they camphor trees?

214
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,830
- We can go verify it if you want.
- Forget it.

215
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,020
I thought nothing of it myself.

216
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,460
If you'll excuse me.

217
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,870
I just... wanted to properly talk to you...

218
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,590
Nice breeze.

219
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,370
We're done talking.

220
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,040
We're not done, but if you say we're done, then we're done.

221
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,100
What's going on, you two?

222
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,180
Hello?

223
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,490
Ruby? Of course I remember her.

224
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,930

225
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,090
[Shirosaki Animal Hospital]

226
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,250
What do you mean by a misdiagnosis?

227
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,820
If I remember correctly, your diagnosis for Ruby was...

228
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,060
Glaucoma?

229
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,470
It's likely primary glaucoma.

230
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,090
We need to keep her eye pressure under control,
so please bring her in again in three days.

231
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,610
But later on, Ruby's appetite began to dwindle.

232
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,440
So I brought her to another hospital for a second opinion.
Turns out it was uveitis.

233
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,140
Uveitis?
[inflammation of the uvea in the eye]

234
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,220
And apparently, it was caused by lymphoma.

235
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,240
How is Ruby's current condition?

236
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,400
She's scheduled to undergo chemotherapy at this hospital.
[Doctor's Note]

237
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,970
I see.

238
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,720
But when I examined her,
I only found her eye pressure to be high.

239
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,550
- There were no symptoms to suggest it was uveitis.
- So you're saying...

240
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,160
that you're not responsible for this?

241
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,120
Sir, I was also present when Mr. Shirosaki was examining Ruby.

242
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,080
Ruby was in good health, her appetite was great,
and she didn't present any other symptoms.

243
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,130
I'm suing this hospital.

244
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,480
- Pardon?
- This dog is very popular, you see.

245
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,700
She had ongoing contracts, several of which I had to reject
because of your misdiagnosis.

246
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,090
I have to seek compensation for that loss of income.

247
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,820
Sir, please...

248
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,780
May I say something?

249
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,860
Who are you?

250
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,820
I am a lawyer.

251
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,080
If you wish to seek compensation due to misdiagnosis,
you will need to present objective evidence.

252
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,430
And it is your responsibility as the pet's owner,
to find that evidence.

253
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,750
To ensure the case is handled based on fact and not emotion,

254
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,630
you should first prepare evidence,

255
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,680
and then use that as a basis for further discussion.

256
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,500
We can provide you with the test results
and medical records from the consultation.

257
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,350
You may also wish to get a third opinion from another doctor.

258
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,050
Of course. That's what I plan to do.

259
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,420
- Prepare the documents.
- Got it.

Sorry, our morning consultations have ended.

348
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,860
May we speak with your director?

00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,100
[Hisayo Koyanagi,

350
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,250
Ministry of Agriculture?

351
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,710
- Nefachin?
- Yes.

352
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,900
It's an unapproved treatment for feline AIDS, or FIV.
We suspect you're utilizing this substance.

353
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,860
No, our hospital uses no such thing.

354
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,620
- We've received report that you do.
- From who?

355
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,550
I'm not legally authorized to disclose that.

356
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:29,410
We only utilize standard symptomatic treatments
like steroids, antibiotics, and analgesic drugs.

357
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,000
Then what's this?

[Nefachin]

359
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,970
Young master.

360
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,480
How did it go?

361
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,910
After some investigating,
it seems this matter is related to us after all.

362
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,360
What?

363
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:56,720
The whole thing started with WooRoA Logistics,
where you used to work, and their strategy in Asia.

364
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,900
If I recall correctly, they wanted to expand WooRoA Electronics.

365
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,030
With that expansion,

366
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:11,230
they plan to set up logistics hubs
in Tokyo, Dalian, Mumbai, and Kuala Lumpur.

367
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,420
And if we can become the legal counsel
for the entire logistics arm of WooRoA...

368
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,570
Our firm, in name and in reality,

369
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,880
will undoubtedly become a major firm. Boom!

370
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,170
Major firm...

371
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,270
To gain favor with WooRoA, the one they are targeting...

372
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,650
is you, Young Master.

373
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:40,030
They teamed up with that Sagara to ruin Mr. Kai's reputation,
and get him into financial trouble.

374
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,250
Sir, staying with Mr. Kai will hurt him further.

375
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,430
You have no choice but to return to Seoul.

376
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,430
This is all because of me.

377
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,930
- Where is Sagara's clinic?
- Huh?

378
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,310
I want to meet him.

379
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,940
Young Master...

380
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,930
Sir...

381
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,870
I have never handled that drug before.

382
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,300
Got it. That's all. Thank you for your time.

383
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,400
Thank you.

384
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,170
Indeed, we did not find any signs of Nefachin being used.

385
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,870
I am glad that you understand.

386
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,230
We will visit again.

390

I'm just a nobody right now.

But very soon, you will become somebody.

392
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,350
It was you, right?

393
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,660
You were scheming behind Kai's back and had him cornered.

394
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,050
Hang on a second. What are you talking about?

395
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,740
The way you accuse me like this...

396
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,990
I wanted to help Kai, but he was the one who rejected my help.

397
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,170
Besides, do you have any evidence?

398
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,170
- Evidence?
- That's right.

399
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,480
Don't worry, I'll find it very soon.

400
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,000
Because you're the heir to WooRoA?

401
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,220
But as I recall, right now, you're simply Woo So Ha,
the man who ran away from home, no?

402
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:01,150
You used the dog and Kai as an excuse
to run away from WooRoA.

403
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,060
Sure, you are savoring your freedom,

404
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,520
but ultimately, you are nothing.

405
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,020

406
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,990

418
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,780

but someone is trying to force Shirosaki into a corner.

481

I came here to discuss that matter.

482
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,250
It's all my fault.

483
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,710

I came here in search of Shogun.

You came at the right time.
I have something to discuss with you.

494
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,250
I'm only speaking hypothetically now, but...

495
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,550
If I decide to sell the hospital,

496
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,000
would you handle the negotiation on my behalf?

497
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,480
Come again?

498
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:57,200
It won't happen yet, but if the financial situation worsens
and becomes a burden to the staff,

499
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,810
or affects the quality of care to the animals,

500
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,660
then I have to make a decision.

501
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,220
If I sell the hospital to Sagara,
the animal shelter will also be taken care of.

502
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,280
- But...
- Of course, I want to keep the hospital if I can.

503
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,830
But as its director,

504
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,370
I have to also consider the possibility
of selling the hospital.

505
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,120
If me stepping down can solve the problem, I will do so.

506
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,980
You're a coward.

507
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,610
My father always tells me
that we don't need any incompetent managers.

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,660

- What?
- To Seoul.

514
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,640
In that case, be my guest.

515
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,250
Yeah, I'll go back.

516
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,670
I don't need this place anymore.

517

Hey, I'm heading out first. I'll leave the keys to you.

521
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,290
You awake?

522
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,550
So Ha has left?

523
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,550
I figured he'd contact you.

524
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,570
I haven't heard from him either.

525
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,190
So right now, he's probably...

526
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,350
Then he meant it?

I didn't think he'd really leave.

Let's go.

539
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,530
What?

540
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,500
We may never see him again.

541
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,800
I don't want to have any regrets.

542
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,550
- Go? Where?
- To see So Ha.

543
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,680
In Seoul.

Hello, Hanamura?

547
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,980
Farewell, Kai.

548
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,210
Thank you for the delicious tamagoyaki.

549
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,670
Thank you for the Napolitan.

Thank you too, Shogun.

Thank you, for everything.

553
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,010
Yours truly, So Ha.

554
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,030
- Hey, So Ha!
- So Ha!

555
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,860
- How have you been?
- This... is instinct.

556
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,160
I can't allow that in this office.
