00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,520
I'm suing this hospital.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,980
I had to reject several ongoing contracts
because of your misdiagnosis.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,070
I have to seek compensation for that loss of income.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,200
It's strange that all these negative reviews came in so suddenly.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
Someone is trying to force Shirosaki into a corner.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,170
It's all my fault.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,610
I have to also consider the possibility
of selling the hospital.

9

You're running away.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,960
I'm going back to Seoul.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,820

I didn't think he'd really leave.

15

Let's go. I don't want to have any regrets.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,050

Is that from Mr. Kai? Or perhaps Ms. Aiko?

27

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,940
I won't answer their calls.

Come to think of it, fate works in mysterious ways.

31
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,480
It's through searching for Rocky that you met so many people.

32
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,950
Sir, are you sure it's okay to leave things like this?

33
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,530
It's from my dad.

You have been invited to attend a charity gala party
at a hotel this evening.

I know you hate going to such events, but...

36
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,020
Got it. I'll go.

37
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,960
What a crowd.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,480
I heard there's a charity event going on here today.

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,820

Excuse me. Please excuse me.

- Sorry, coming through.
- Excuse me.

Excuse me. Sorry.

- So Ha, over here!

He feels so far away.

48
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,820
We used to be so close to each other.

49
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,440
So Ha is like someone from a completely different world.

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,150
So Ha's sister previously mentioned
that he used to hang out here.

Why wouldn't you answer our calls?

61
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,710
Why did you leave Japan without telling us?

62
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,250
You can't just say "Alright, bye", and leave like that.

63
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,990
You were trying to avoid us, weren't you?

64
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,060
You figured that if you continued to stay,
you'd cause trouble for Shirosaki.

65
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,310
What my boss and Sagara did may have led you to believe
that you were the cause of it all.

66
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,010
That's why you...

67
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,660

Love, friendship, and the vacation.

82
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,420
Likewise for me.

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,660
It just... hurts here.

84
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:28,050
It's not a heart problem, or anything like that.

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,900
You feel hurt because of So Ha, right?

86
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,060
- Sakura.
- Welcome back, Mr. Shirosaki, Ms. Aiko.

What's with those two? They look like they're in their own world.

They've been staying with each other for so long,
they're too in love to be apart.

93

That means the two of you will have to move in together, no?

- What?

Neither of you seem totally against the idea though.

By the way, is Mr. So Ha really not coming back?

104
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,050
He said it's over.

105
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,220
Knowing So Ha, I'm sure he must have a reason for this.

106
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,020

Why did So Ha suddenly leave?

124
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,070
Feels lonely, right?

Now that we're facing a manpower shortage,
it'll be hard to run the clinic 24/7.

We still don't have enough evidence.

159
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,810
At this point, we can only prove
that the chief and Sagara are acquainted,

160
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:35,960
and that the man who filed this lawsuit
had been visiting Sagara's clinic.

Also, though it's just a suspicion and cannot be proven yet,

162
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,740
it's highly possible that someone snuck the illegal drug
into Mr. Shirosaki's hospital.

163
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,700
Additionally, since the lawsuit was filed,
there's been a rise in negative reviews of the hospital.

I've looked through all the reviews,
but couldn't find anything significant.

The only way forward is to file a disclosure request one by one.

We need more direct evidence,

Mr. Shirosaki is a kind-hearted vet.

345
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,760
Anyway, I wanted to help you, no matter what.

346
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,740
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

347
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,890
So, about Ms. Takada...

348
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:10,020
Right. It seems like she knows the person
who sued Mr. Shirosaki's hospital.

349
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,320
Ruby's owner?

350
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,500
- Mr. Yumoto?
- Yup.

351
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,140
He was originally a breeder,
and was caring for this champion dog.

352
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,770
When the dog developed a heart condition,
it was Sagara who treated it.

353
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,010
Since then, they've been in close contact.

354
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,800
Ms. Takada had actually dated Sagara at one point,
and was later dumped by him.

355
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,840
If we ask her, she might agree to be a witness.

356
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,960
In that case...

357
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,630
We could sue them?

358
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,420
He doesn't like anyone touching his neck.

359
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,820
- Any skin problems?
- No.

360
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,650
But his front legs don't respond much.

361
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,800
- Here are the results of Jiro's blood test.
- Thanks.

362
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,230
His blood test results also turned out normal.

363
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,580
That can only mean syringomyelia.

364
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,200
So there's a cyst in his spinal cord.

365
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,640
But we can only confirm that with an MRI.

366
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:14,380
Yeah. That's how it is. Of all days, it had to happen today.

367
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,760
This is bad...

368
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,950
Should we bring him to a hospital with MRI equipment,
or a testing facility perhaps?

369
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,560
But expenses-wise... Jiro is a rescue dog, so it'll be costly.

370
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,410
- I'll contact Ms. Yuka for now.
- Okay.

371
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,600
How much are the fees?

372
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,360
Taking an MRI requires Jiro to be fully sedated,
so it'll cost around 100,000 to 200,000 yen.

373
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,150
The earlier the treatment, the better, right?

374
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,510
We can start with a symptomatic treatment first.
That way, the costs will be lower.

375
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,540
Why not bring him to my clinic?

376
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,050
Immediately. Free of charge, of course.

377
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,220
Why are you here?

378
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,650
Because I want to help Kai.

379
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,530
Joining our efforts together to run the clinic
may not be a bad idea.

380
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,040
That's what I want you to understand.

381
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,420
Besides, Yuka...

382
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,440
you shouldn't depend on others too much.

383
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,330
It's not fair to take advantage of Kai's kindness

384
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,000
to make him pay for the tests and treatments.

385
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,810
I know that, but...

386
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,060
That's enough.

387
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,720
You've been pulling strings behind our backs, haven't you?

388
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,090
That's right. You must've done something to force Mr. Shirosaki
to sell this hospital to you.

389
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,030
You're sorely mistaken.

390
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,280
I'm truly sorry for what I've done in the past.

391
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,020
But a clinic cannot run without proper equipment.

The same goes for the animal shelter.
If you can't make any profits, it will not last.

and obstruction of business operations.
