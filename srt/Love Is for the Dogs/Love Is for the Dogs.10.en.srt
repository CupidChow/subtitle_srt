1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,140
I want to help Mr. Shirosaki.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,730
Therefore, please allow me to resign.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,020
Let's sue them, Shirosaki.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,450
Please stop fighting. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,130
You have no one to help you.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,570
I want to help my friends.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,450
I've finally found it.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,300
I'm back.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,700
Let's fight this out.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,390
Together.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,600
What do you mean, "together"?

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,660
Take a look at this.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,750
What is it?

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,120
I guess I have to give it some thought.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,420
Sir?

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,020
Your reward.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,670
- This is...
- A recording of my father's meeting.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,190
I'm sure it'll come in handy during the trial.

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,770
But Shirosaki said he doesn't want to
make matters worse than they already are.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,030
I've already met up with him.

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,530
What?

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,360
A rainbow has appeared.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,920
Rainbow?

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,300
Also, I wanted to see her.

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,440
I wanted to see Aiko.

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,050
And you too, of course.

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,400
I've brought some weapons we can use.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,940
Huh?

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,370
Your hospital's reputation has been damaged.
You may end up losing the place.

30
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,820
But we can't let that happen.

31
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,050
You must protect it, Kai.

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,770
I knew you had your reasons.

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,880
Thank you, So Ha.

34
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,310
Let's do it. Let's go to court.

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,280
That's why... we need your help, Aiko.

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,150
Of course.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,210
Though the first floor is a yoga studio,

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,390
they only have afternoon lessons
every other day, and on the weekends.

39
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,140
That won't bother me.

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,980
This is a wonderful office space you've introduced me to.

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,600
Not to mention...

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,300
That's right. I'm officially leaving Honzawa & McCarthy
to join the Hanamura Law Office.

43
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,660
Thank you so much for doing this.

44
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,440
Ms. Aiko.

45
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,440
Let's do our best together.

46
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,480
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,320
More importantly... your signboard's a wee bit too small, no?

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,480
You should make it bigger.
And throw in a picture of yourself.

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,630
No way. I don't look good in photos.

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,680
- Of course you look good.
- No, thanks. I'm no model, really.

51

Don't say that. Let's start by marketing your face.

- Congratulations on starting your own law firm.
- Thank you.

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,210
Congrats.

This is good.

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,450
- Bon appétit, guys.
- I'm the one who cooked all this.

58
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,820
Yay, there's Napolitan.

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,060
- Here you go.
- Tamagoyaki! Nice.

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,650
Kai, you're my dear soulmate.

61
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,980
I'm digging in.

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,370
I knew it. This is what I came back for.

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,400
You're only here for the food, huh?

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,450
I heard that you've been doing well
as Director of Information Strategy.

65
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,560
I do it only for the sake of doing it, not because I enjoy it.

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,960
Meanwhile, I can only worry about my work.

67
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,960
- Why?
- Because you've only just started out?

68
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,460
I haven't been approached for any new cases at all.

69
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,400
Not even a single divorce consultation since leaving the firm.

70
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,930
Well, it can't be helped.

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,040
Anyway... we can only drink ourselves silly tonight.

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,140
- Let's raise our glasses.
- Erm... sure.

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Let's go easy on it.

75
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,080
What on earth are you doing?

76
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,140
I was shouting, "We're going to court!",
but since it'll disturb the neighbors,

77
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,990
I shouted in silence.

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,930
You're drunk!

79
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,020

Kai...

86
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,220
Do you remember what I said the other day?

87
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,080
That I had come to see Aiko.

88
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,280
Oh, right. When you brought over the evidence.

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,270
That was only part of the reason why I came back.

90
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,390
The other reason is because...

91
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,010
I want Aiko to become my partner.

92
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,800
Your partner?

93
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,020
A partner, who supports me in my business,

94
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,580
and a partner whom I can spend personal time with, together.

95
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,880
Sounds like... a proposal.

96
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
What if it was?

97
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:55,100
I plan to ask Aiko once the trial is over.

98
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,740
I want to know how you feel, Kai.

99
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:06,420
It's a gesture to express one's love for the opposite sex.

100
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,650
It's an instinct.

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,380
If that's what you're going to do, then I'm rooting for you.

[Last Episode]

103
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,770
As a result of the defendants' lies,
various rumors regarding the plaintiff have spread.

104
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,450
This has caused a large amount of slander
and defamatory reviews online.

105
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,540
Additionally, the actual...

106
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,140
Kai, your face...

Say what?

108
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,510
Your face is too stiff. Relax a little more.

109
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,780
Of course it's stiff. We're talking about a trial here!

110
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,070
What's that?

111
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,580
Refreshments.

00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,650

Oh, nothing.

120
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,660
Alright, let's rehearse through the questions for the trial.

121
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,930
- Got it. I appreciate your guidance.
- Don't mention it.

122
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,400

123

And we'll finally meet the final boss.

Are you perhaps talking behind my back?

126
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:36,220
I can't believe that you're going head-to-head with us.
I like that spirit.

127

I'm honored to hear that.

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,900
I've always thought you were arrogant.

130

I can finally say this, since you're no longer part of us.

They interfered with the plaintiff's business
and damaged his reputation.

149

These are serious unlawful acts amounting to
defamation and damage to credibility.

150

The defendants' arguments are as outlined
in the statement of defense, correct?

151
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,030
That is correct, Your Honor.

152
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,590
These accusations are baseless.

153
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,630
This is a classic example of a SLAPP suit
that should not exist.

Representative of the defendants, your opinion on this?

160
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,070
- Please proceed.
- Very well.

161
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,570
You said you saved the data from the pet-monitoring camera?

162
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,710
That's right. I wanted to publish an article on animal behavior,

163
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,620
so I was collecting data on Shogun's behavior.

164
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,520
Let us take a look.

165
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,810
In the footage, Ruby's owner happened to be
in the area where the Nefachin was found.

166
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,230
Shogun was there at the perfect timing.

are evidently malicious.

174
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:56,920

also had a part to play in their ploy.

The real motive of Mr. Honzawa,

176
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,350
was to make Mr. Woo So Ha,
who was living with Mr. Shirosaki, return to Korea.

177
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,810
And the reward for that, was a consulting contract
with Mr. Woo Gu Wan of WooRoA Group.

178
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,480
We have the evidence to prove this claim. Please take a look.

179
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,060
How did you manage to convince So Ha?

180
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:29,010
I'll do whatever it takes to become a great lawyer.

181
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,480
I guess I have to give it some thought.

182
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,930
Sir?

183
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,700
Your reward.

184
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,410
And why is that so?
[Date of witness examination]

185
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,670
The director invited Mr. Yumoto over to his clinic
several times to discuss something.

186
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,750
They always met outside office hours as well.

187
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,870
What the hell is she thinking, taking their side?

188
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,130
Based on the witness testimonies
and the evidence submitted,

189
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,730
it is clear that the defendants attempted to obstruct
the operations of Shirosaki Animal Hospital.

190
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,070
They damaged the hospital's reputation
and attempted to acquire its business.

191
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,150
It is also clear that Mr. Honzawa

192
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,600
had not been forthright in his motive
to clinch the consulting contract deal.

193
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,050
These actions have severely undermined
the plaintiff's credibility,

194
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,210
causing immeasurable damages,
both tangible and intangible.

195
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:35,850
We believe no be less than 50 million yen has been lost,
even at a conservative estimate.

196
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,010
Ms. Hanamura.

197
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,840
I'll admit. I have underestimated you.

198
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,280
It seems you will agree to all our terms?

199
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,860
In exchange, I hope you will not press criminal charges.

200
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,820
Indeed. Mr. Shirosaki does not wish
to pursue the matter further as well.

201
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:16,720
"Aim higher". If we do that just to make money,

202
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,450
that would be a terrible shame.

203
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,750
"A lawyer is a defender of justice".

204
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,130
If that is what you believe,

205
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,060
it's because I was the one bringing in the money.

206
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,280
When the leaders can make money,

207
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,920
it allows their subordinates to do the right thing.

208
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,960
You will come to realize this.

209
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,240
You'll find yourself believing the client's delusional claims
and going along with their lies.

210
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,410
When that time comes,

211
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,600
this phrase shall come to mind.

212
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,220
"Aim higher".

213
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,420
Good luck.

214
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,570
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

215
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,560
Wow... Mr. Shirosaki finally did it.

216
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
The situation has reversed in an instant!

217
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,110
Seriously, I felt so lost at one point.

218
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:11,380
Ms. Yuka, remember the insurance company
that wished to support us? They called.

219
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,730
Just in case, I had updated them on the trial proceedings.

220
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,400
So what did they say?

221
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,820
They hope to discuss with us again
about donating to the animal shelter.

222
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,550
Really?

223
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,810
This calls for a double celebration. Let's do another toast.

224
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

225
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,380
- This really is a happy occasion.
- We've finally proved our innocence.

226
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,580
- Say that again?
- W-What did you say?

227
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,840
I mean, I'm glad our hospital has finally proved its innocence.

228
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,950
- Yeah, and that's all thanks to your wonderful work, Natsuki.
- That's right.

229
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,930
- Yes!
- That's too reserved.

230
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:59,970
- When you're happy, shout it out loud! Do it with gusto!
- Do it with gusto!

231
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,840
Where's Mr. Shirosaki, by the way?

232
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,780
You're here.

233
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,710
I've been wanting to visit at least once.

234
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,040
I've been watching you all this time.

235
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,270
You always have someone at your side,

236
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,280
worrying about you, taking care of you,

237
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,410
and rooting for you.

238
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,800
The same goes for Yuka.

239
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,000
I thought I'd finally won.

240
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,970
But alas, the ending is always the same.

241
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,950
It's my loss.

242
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,210
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,000
You know, I kept thinking it was your fault.

244
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,570
I thought that what happened back then
was the reason why I started keeping a distance from others.

245
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,340
But then...

246
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,240
I realized that I should have properly talked it out with you.

247
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,050
Because we were friends.

248
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,800
Here you go. Careful, it's hot.

249
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,030
- Thank you.
- This is what you call "a celebration"?

250
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,850
I've got too many of these, so.

251
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:44,630
These are all my favorite ramen.
It's a scenery I've only ever dreamed of.

252
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,000
- Bon appétit.
- Digging in.

253
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,770
Thank you for the food.

254
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,950
Delish.

255
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,090
I'm so relieved.

256
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,760
I can finally focus on my work.

257
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,450
And I can go back to Korea with relief.

258
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,160
It's all thanks to you, Aiko.

259
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,150
Really, thank you so, so much.

260
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,100
No, I should thank you both as well.

261
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,090
I still have a lot cut out for me,
so I'll have to work harder starting tomorrow.

262
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,470
Are there any new cases coming in?

263
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,510
Not really.

264
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,630
If there's anything we can do to help, let us know.

265
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,530
Want to join me?

266
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,760
Pardon?

267
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,830
Be my partner.

268
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,690
"Partner"? What do you mean?

269
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,550
My company, WooRoA Logistics,
will be setting up a branch in Tokyo.

270
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,240
I'd like you to be our legal consultant.

271
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,790
I can hook you up with some work.

272
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,880
You can even come to Seoul if you wish.

273
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,040
I can't possibly ask you to do that.

274
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,430
I hope you can come with me.

275
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,170
I can provide you with whatever you need.

276
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,780
So come with me.

277
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,540
Give it some thought.

278
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,420
I've come to see you.

279
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,340
You want me to leave with you?

280
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,280
What, you're worried that
I won't want to go back anymore?

281
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,780
Have faith in your employer. You should be fired.

282
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,180
It's not that. I came to convey the president's words.

283
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,680
He got angry the other day
and couldn't really talk to you, but...

284
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,410
"I trust So Ha", was what he said.

285
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,930
"My carefree son doesn't listen to anyone,
but loves his family more than anything."

286
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,960
"I suppose one day, he'll come to rely on me."

287
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,050
"We should share some soju together some time."

288
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,020
That was what he said.

289
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,350
That's quite a day to anticipate.

290
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,220
Congratulations, Ms. Yuka.

291
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,320
Your dream is finally coming true.

292
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,730
You're finally getting the ideal home
for your beloved dogs and cats.

293
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,890
To care for pets is to care for life.

294
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,100
It helps us be more kind to people as well.

295
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,980
And it makes this world a better place to live in.

296
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,030
What a grand ambition.

297
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,720
If you dream, dream big!

298
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,170
Is there any way I can help?

299
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,820
I can do anything. Like, help carry things and stuff.

300
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,520
Let's see...

301
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:47,140
We transport donated items
every Wednesday and Sunday, so...

302
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,130
I can drive those over.

303
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,590
Kai would need an assistant
when he drops by for check-ups as well.

304
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,550
That'd be Tuesday nights, right?

305
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,720
I can do that.

306
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,200
Then after that, we can go out for drinks.

307
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,050
Then after that, maybe you can stay over?

308
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:19,530
And when we get this close...

309
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,790
we'll kiss.

310
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,340
This is what couples do when they're dating, right?

311
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,060
Kosuke.

312
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,520
I look forward to our time together.

313
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,790
Me too.

314
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,870
What? We're getting MRI equipment?

315
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,180
That's right. I managed to procure it.

316
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,860
- I'm so glad.
- Yay!

317
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,130
Having it in-house sure feels reassuring.

318
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,170
And the trial is finally over, too.

319
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,990
The shelter as well. Discussions are underway as we speak.

320
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,510
The day to your dream pet town is finally approaching.

321
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,560
- Shall we go for drinks tonight?
- Sure.

322
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,100
What?

323
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,720
P-Pigs are flying.

324
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,650
Are you that surprised?

325
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,690
The day has come.
We're finally having drinks with Mr. Shirosaki.

326
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,120
- It's come, hasn't it? Hasn't it?
- It has!

327
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
Things must be going well with Ms. Hanamura, too.

328
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,420
- That's right.
- That has to be it.

329
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,590
Or... maybe not?

330
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,360
- Ms. Ogasawara.
- Y-Yes?

331
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,870
- Let's prep for the dislocation surgery.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,970
- Natsuki.
- Yes?

333
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,350
Shall we sort out the inventory?

334
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,010
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.
- (Good luck.)

335
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,010
I have to go feed Platini.

336
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,900
[WooRoA Logistics
- Companies that spread their wings globally]

337
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,410
I hope you can come with me.

338
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,930
I've prepared the accounting template,
and registered our business profile.

339
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,370
These are the registration documents for the Bar Association.

340
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,420
- All it needs is your signature.
- Got it.

341
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,580
Right, your kitten. Rumiko, go ahead and clock out.

342
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,440
- I shall leave first then. See you tomorrow.
- See you.

343
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,410
Just so you know...

344
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,440
Don't worry about me.

345
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:23,770
No matter what choice you make,
I will give you my full support.

346
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,680
Thank you.

347
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,230
- Alright then, see you.
- See you.

348
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,330
Ready for home, kitty?

349
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,420
Be a good boy at the hospital tomorrow, alright?

350
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,000
I have to send So Ha off.

351
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,450
What's with that look?

352
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,220
Don't look at me with those eyes.

353
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,580
It's fine just like this.

354
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,550
Quiet down, Shogun.

355
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,700
So Ha is a good guy.

356
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,890
It's fine the way it is.

357
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,590
Shush, Shogun.

358
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,880
- Hello?
- Mr. Shirosaki, sorry to disturb you so late at night.

359
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,000
We've just received an urgent request to attend to Jiro,
one of the dogs at the shelter, tomorrow.

360
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Jiro?

361
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,930
He suddenly became breathless this morning.

362
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,940
Sorry, boy. Let me take a look.

363
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,920
His gums look pale.

364
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,450
- Is it anemia?
- Do you have an abdominal ultrasound machine?

365
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,000
Ultrasound?

366
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,200
We have an old machine over there.

367
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,660
Please watch over him.

368
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,110
There's fluid in the abdomen here, and a tumor in the spleen.

369
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,850
So it's an abdominal hemorrhage? A rupture?

370
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,200
I'm afraid so. That explains the anemia.

371
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,290
Can Jiro be saved?

372
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,330
Prep him for surgery right away.
We'll need to remove his spleen.

373
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,420
Remove it? Right here?

374
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,210
Morning, Aiko.

375
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,400
Good morning.

376
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:17,020
Good day. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

377
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,420
I'm saying them all at once, since today is my last day here.

378
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,930
Don't say that it's your last.

379
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:30,370
We'll see each other again in the future, right?

380
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:41,450
So Ha... Rather than relying on you
to bring in work opportunities,

381
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,920
I prefer to do it with my own effort.
I'll make my office thrive, however challenging it may be.

382
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,390
That's what I've decided.

383
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,640
So I'll continue to do my best over here.

384
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,090
Here, in Japan.

385
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,550
You're cool indeed, Aiko.

386
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,040
But what will you do about Kai?

387
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,210
- Draining the fluid.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,300
That's a lot of blood.

389
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,010
- If it doesn't stop, we can't measure his blood pressure.
- It's fine, Kosuke. Calm down.

390
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,890
Yes, sir.

391
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,650
Let's raise the IV drip rate.

392
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,630
So Ha, I recall something you mentioned once before.

393
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:44,200
About the wind, rain, rainbows...

394
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,110
That little "something".

395
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,880
All it takes is a little "something"
for a relationship to change, right?

396
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,030
I'm fine... with things as they are now.

397
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,970
Are you scared?

398
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,180
That it'll end the moment it begins. That it won't work out.

399
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,780
Are you afraid of that possibility?

400
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:32,960
In that case, I'll be your wind, rain, and rainbow.

401
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:40,260
I'll be that little "something" you need. So go, to Kai.

402
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,160
It's a wonderful thing to fall in love with someone.

403
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:19,290
Whenever I came across a dog or dorayaki,
you would come to mind.

404
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,200
It's been a while.

405
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,170
I don't know.

406
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,370
Maybe because it's you.

407
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,270
I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest.

408
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm glad that you're Dorako.

409
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,800
You're indeed special.

410
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,780
It's a gesture... to express one's love for the opposite sex.

411
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,650
It's an instinct.

412
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,620
It's finally over.

413
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,140
Good morning, Jiro. You did very well.

414
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,450
You did well too, Kosuke.

415
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,520
Everything's okay now.

416
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,440
Mr. Shirosaki, thank you so much for your help.

417
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,860
This is Mr. Kasahara and Mr. Ohata
from Leaf General Insurance.

418
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,500
They wished to see you.

419
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,610
Thank you for your interest in donating to the shelter.

420
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,580
We came here to observe your work.

421
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,650
I'm really glad that everything went without a hitch.

422
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,130
Mr. Shirosaki, that was truly amazing.

423
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,490
I was moved by your efforts.

424
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:31,380
We would be honored to support you
in making this place a safer environment for the animals.

425
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,240
Thank you so much for your support.

426
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,570
Mr. Shirosaki, weren't you going to send Mr. So Ha off?

427
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,720
I don't think I can make it in time.

428
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,200
You can head out first.

429
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,890
Got it. See you.

430
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,370
See you.

431
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,330
[So Ha]

432
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,380
Yes, hello?

433
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,700
Kai, where are you now?

434
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,880
Sorry, So Ha. It's not that I forgot the time.
I had an emergency surgery.

435
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,520
- I'll head over right now.
- No.

436
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,570
Tell that to Aiko.

437
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,140
Come again?

438
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,830
- He's not here?
- No. Mr. Shirosaki stepped out for an emergency surgery.

439
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,520
It was a strategy.

440
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,690
The reason why I said all that to Aiko,
was to get the two of you to realize it.

441
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,870
Also,

442
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,000
I became aware of my own feelings.

443
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,540
Oh, So Ha...

444
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,240
- Like I said, it's not like I...
- Cheot-sarang.

445
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,450
First love.

446
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,600
Aiko won't change even if I proposed to her.

447
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,040
Aiko has always been in love with you,
just as you've been, with her.

448
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,010
So there's no need for any lies.

449
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,040
What I mean is...

450
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,810
Go for it, hyung.

451
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,300
What are you doing?

452
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,910
Run!

453
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,040
Thank you, So Ha.

454
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,610
See you soon...

455
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,240
my brother.

456
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:29,050
Gosh, just look at him. He's so frustratingly endearing.

457
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,120
Hanamura.

458
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,290
You're finally here.

459
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,360
I told you that I was coming over,
and to wait at your office, didn't I?

460
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,250
But I was already here.

461
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,870
Then you could have waited for me at the hospital.

462
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,840
No way. Wait there just to meet you?

463
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,800
That makes me seem like I'm really into you.

464
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,550
But aren't you?

465
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,040
Would I have come all the way here if I wasn't?

466
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,040
I don't care if it's an illusion.

467
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,900
That was what I thought.

468
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,650
I came here based on my instincts.

469
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,510
Hanamura, you're the only one.

470
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:57,190
You're the only one whom I enjoy being with,
even though nothing about us seems compatible.

471
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,380
So... what I mean is...

472
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:10,650
I think... you're my first love.

473
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,210
As expected of you, Young Master.

474
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,930
But I'll have to say, what started out as
a simple retrieval of your grandmother's inheritance,

475
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,920
turned out to be an incredible journey.

476
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,980
It was fun.

477
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,980
It was, indeed.

478
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,950
Chingu...

479
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,740
The people whom I hold dear.

480
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,430
Dear So Ha.

481
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:44,040
Meeting you that summer
greatly changed the paths of many people.

482
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,420
Without a doubt, you are like the wind.
[Planned construction site]

483
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:57,670
I'm doing fine here with Sakura, Shogun, and Kai.

484
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,090
But people will always be complex creatures.

485
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:07,990
Even if we're careful around each other,
there may be times we get hurt in future.

486
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:13,750
But it's precisely during times like these,
that we should honestly express our love.

487
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,770
That's right. Honestly, like dogs do.

488
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,010
Hyung! Aiko!

489
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,240
Hey there, Shogun, Sakura.

490
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,490
Hi, Rocky.
[Fin]

491
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,890
Rocky.
