Come to think of it, ever since this morning...

5

It's finally the first date today.

You're a wonderful owner.

9

It's your first date with Shogun.

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,250
Not mine with that guy, get it?

11
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,560
Let's go.

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,340
- Morning.
- Good morning.

Hey, Sakura.

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,440
Good morning to you, Sakura.

15
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,580
- I'll take over from here.
- What?

16
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,450
I'll let them play together for two hours.

17
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,630
If you have other errands, you may leave first.

18
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,890
I don't have any important errands. In fact, this is my errand.

19
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,220
- Is that so.
- So of course, I'm tagging along.

20
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,660
Just to make sure Sakura does okay.

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,610
Sure. Then let's go.

Come on, kids.

23

Today is Shogun and Sakura's first date?

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,410
Feels bittersweet.

25
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,310
This can also be considered Ms. Hanamura's first date.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,480
With Mr. Shirozaki?

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,010
- Blood sample for your analysis, please.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,480
Mr. Shirosaki has never shown any interest in women.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,790
It's rare to hear him do this.

30
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,740
- Not interested in women?
- No way. Not with all the shifts he's been doing.

31
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,430
He's basically interested in nothing but animals.

32
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,600
Still, guys like him are exactly the type
to have a long-term girlfriend.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,900
- So does he have one, or not?
- That remains a mystery.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,970
Well, he's still a good guy through and through,

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,450
albeit a kind of ditsy one.

36
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,260
- But I find him cool!
- Depends on how you see him.

37
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,310

38
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,680
Sure. Thanks.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,810
Wait... slow down. Go ahead.

40

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,830
That's right. I already had a bad feeling about this.

A director of sorts?

My grandmother got separated from him
when on vacation in Japan.

We tried looking for him, and were about to give up

Thank you for taking such good care of Rocky.

56
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,290
You should have told me right from the start.

57
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,490
And would you have readily given Rocky to us?

and that you'll need time to think about it.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,680
Of course, we will pay you compensation.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,610

There was no police report made when they got separated.

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,920
I want to know what kind of place he'll live in
if I give him back to you.

No.

That won't be necessary.

So I don't foresee any major problems.

You had three months, in accordance with Japanese law.

78
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,460
Legally, a dog is considered as lost property.

79
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,380
If its owner doesn't claim it in three months,

80
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,300
ownership is transferred to the one who found it.

81
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,920
Even if you are the original owner,
you are not allowed to take matters into your own hands.

82
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,450
In other words, forcibly taking the dog back right now

83
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,020
would constitute as theft.

84
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,880

111
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,050
I should return him if the owner has been found.

112
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,450
You'll give him back just like that?

177
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,210
Of course, we will provide our full assistance.

178
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,090
- Ms. Hanamura, our dog-lover, will be at your service.
- Huh?

179
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,700
You and Mr. So Ha are close in age.

180
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,180
I'm sure you'll take care of him and show him around Japan.

181
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,120
Hear him out, will you?

182
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,390
But I know the other party as well, so there may be a conflict of interest...

183
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,970
Don't worry. You haven't taken on any other request, right?

184
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,560
And you're not handling this case as a lawyer anyway.

185
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,990
Shall we exchange contacts, Ms. Hanamura?

186
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,240
Give it to him.

187
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,570
Yes, sir.

189
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,540
Okay. Looking forward to your assistance, Ms. Aiko.

190

My pleasure.

191
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,480
Show him around?

192
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,970
Right. Things kind of turned out this way.

193
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,410
This is bad. What will you do?

194
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,140
Hey, Ms. Aiko!

195
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,170
What shall I do? We don't seem to click.

196
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,360
This is how the chief addressed Mr. So Ha.

197
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,450
V. I. P... Very Important Person.

198
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,700
Now go!

199
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,280
Not to worry. I'm good at driving.

200
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,500
I have a bad feeling

201
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,080
I was only checking the wipers.

202
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,050
So, where are we headed to?

203
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,810
For starters, let's have a nice chat while we drive around.

204
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,130
Where did you get this car?

205
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,970
I bought it, to drive around Japan with you.

206
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,040
You're kidding me.

207
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,270
And please tell me everything you know about Mr. Shirosaki.

208
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,520
What kind of person is he?

209
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,160
What exactly is it about me you "understand"?

210
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,050
I don't know him very well.

211
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,500
What?

212
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,440
One thing's for sure, he's a very competent vet.

213
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,710
He also has a great love for animals.

214
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,410
Allergic dermatitis?

215
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,590
This is Ms. Iguchi. She is due to foster Harry.

216
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,810
Doctor, what is "allergic dermatitis"?

217
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,390
Harry tested negative for feline AIDS and leukemia.

218
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,720
His stool test was normal as well.

219
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,900
Except... Sorry, I'll take over for a bit.

220
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,150
You can see a bit of a rash here.

221
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,160
I'll prescribe some medication to stop the itch.

222
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,410
There are also hypo-allergenic options for food and shampoos available, so do give them a try.

223
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,790
These are for your reference.

224
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,090
Will I be able to take good care of him?

225
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,870
You don't have to be an expert to do that.

226
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,400
He may be a little jittery, but he's an obedient boy.

227
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,660
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,880
No, I can't do it.

229
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,910
I'm so sorry!

230
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,970
I'm really sorry!

231
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,060
Ma'am, wait!

00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,610

[Fosterers Wanted]
[We are in need of loving "families"]

234
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,450
Sorry, Mr. Shirosaki.

235
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,970
I'm very sorry!

236
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,620
I made Harry's fosterer run away.

237
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,500
Don't be sorry. It was ultimately her choice.

238
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,470
Keeping a pet requires care-taking costs, vet visits,

239
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,230
and a secondary guardian if you're not around.

240
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,750
It's hard to keep one if you're not prepared for all that.

241
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,380
Hopefully, these furkids can find their forever homes soon.

242
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,680
Be it those that got separated from their families,

243
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,500
or those like Shogun, who have many families.

244
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,340
Mr. Shirosaki may look friendly at first,

245
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,880
but he seems somewhat distant.

246
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,100
It's hard for me to talk to him.

247
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,450
I can't figure him out.

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,520

You've mastered it well.

It feels nice, to sit like this in the breeze and

267
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,360
not care about what others think of you.

268
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,740

269
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,650

but I can do these things on my own.

281
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,820
I can pour water and take the wet towel myself.

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,560
This is basic etiquette, though.

would make for a better story to bring home.

303
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,870
In Korea, someone who eats with you
is considered chingu. A friend.

304

I hear that a lot, but I didn't really get it.

She doesn't need a new encounter anyway.

336

00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,910
Nope. Rocky was at my grandmother's.

355
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,070
What was he like as a pup?

356
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,820
He was absolutely adorable.

357
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,050
How did your family play with him?

358
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,980
Who will be the main person taking care of him?

359
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,660
Your family, or a dog-sitter?

360
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,350
Or will your grandmother be taking care of him?

361
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,010
Looks like I'm off form today.

362
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,380
I've got a text from So Ha's secretary.

363
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,290
So Ha is supposed to just take the dog and leave.
What's taking him so long?

364
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,100
Leave him be.

365
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,610
I'm sure he can handle a simple task like that on his own.

366
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,950
So, how are the preparations for tomorrow's meeting
getting along?

367
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,820
She left me on read.

368
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,840
In any case, I'd suggest we arrange a time
to meet So Ha's grandmother.

369
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,500
Yes, let's. Better if we can meet her face to face
and hand Shogun over.

370
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,880
My office will act as an intermediary.

371
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,420
Let me discuss with my director
and we'll arrange a meeting date.

372
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,700
Sure. I'll let her know.

373
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,740
Thank you.

374
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,130
Is it that case again?

375
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,120
The big one involving the rich heir and the dog.

376
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,840
Yeah, but something's bothering me about it...

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,500
Have you already met each other?

385
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:13,610
See, when you first decided to adopt Sakura...

386
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,640
I always assumed one of two outcomes would occur.

387
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,150
Either you'd live your single life to the fullest with your dog, or…

388
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,970
You'd meet your fated someone through your dog.

389
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,780
There's no fated someone...

390
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,810
But the person this heir is dealing with,

391
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,600
is that wonderful vet you know, right?

392
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,270
"Wonderful"? Totally not.

We have nothing in common.
I don't know what he's thinking.

394
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,800
He's more interested in animals than humans,
and will go through heaven and hell for his dog.

395
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,640
He's one eccentric guy.

because the shareholders' meeting has not been held yet?

417
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,860
- Announce... what?
- Ms. Hanamura.

418
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,260
Shogun's owner, Ms. Lee Mi Hee,

419
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,050
has passed away a month ago, hasn't she?

420
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,180
How did you know about that?

421
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,460

who said that was what he heard.

- Ms. Hanamura, you ー
- I apologize for not consulting with you earlier.

This may contradict office policy,

424

but our credibility may be in question

425

if we settle this while hiding important information.

426
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,430
I feel it is best to first ascertain

427
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,740
what will become of Shogun moving forward.

428
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,390
That is Mr. Shirosaki's only wish.

429
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,170
His owner

430
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,860
is already gone.

431
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,580
Then who's going to take care of him?

432
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,320
We are definitely discussing care options as we speak.

434

I may have run too fast.

449
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,580
And too suddenly ー

450
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,000
Shogun, sit down and wait for me.

451
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,520
Hope you don't mind.

452
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,120
It stopped.

453
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,460
Glad to hear it.

454
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,670
I learned that trick when someone once did it to me.

456
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,850

460
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,610
What did Mr. Kai say?

461
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,230
He's really not giving up the dog anymore?

462
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,090
You can say that.

463
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,120
I'm sorry. I figured we would have no chance

464
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,780
if I told him about my grandmother.

465
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,540
Mr. Shirosaki has a deep love for animals.

466
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,980
No amount of money can move him.

467
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,690
He believes in raising animals with love.

468

"Back then"?

470
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:58,800
You were friends with Mr. Kai since way back?

471
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:07,020
We weren't friends. I just knew of him, that's all.

- We'll discuss tomorrow.

- Quiet! Aiko will hear you.

478

- When I was little, I didn't like being at home.

- I can't. My parents will be mad.

505

I heard from our neighbors that his mom had remarried,
and they moved away.

516

He probably didn't remember me.

522
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,710
And I didn't feel the need to tell him.

523
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:30,600
So if you ask if I know him, yes, I do.

524

You're the first person I've ever told this to.

These furkids will be fine.

536
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,970
They'll make sure to love back the ones who give them love.

You mean, us?

545
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,950
We actually feel lonely, but we hide that loneliness.

546

We actually love someone, but we pretend we don't.

547
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,080
We try to suppress that feeling of attraction.

Humans are shrouded in layers and layers of emotions.

That's why no one wants to fall in love anymore.

These are photos taken from the tourist spots we visited today.

564
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,220
Since you couldn't take any more pictures halfway through,
I'm sending you some that I took.

Why's it suddenly blurry?

Jeez, they're so badly taken.

Not this one though. You look good here.

568
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,660
She's a strange lady indeed.

Bye bye, Rocky.
