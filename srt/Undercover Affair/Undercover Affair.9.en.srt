00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,940
Lingyi?

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:14,980
Lingyi?

19
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,100
This is quite bold of you
in broad daylight.

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,500
What are you afraid of?

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,380
My brother isn't here.

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,860
We have enough time
to enjoy ourselves for a while.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,140
How is this enough?

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,780
Do you think

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,220
I'll be satisfied with just this?

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,260
I know what you're thinking,

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,940

He even investigated his woman.

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,740

he doesn't trust him much, after all.

call Amy
and tell her we're coming over now.

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,900
Yeah.

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,740
Elena is a very suspicious person.

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,180
I'm calling her now.

51
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,460
Hello, Amy.

52
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,380
Hey, Lingyi.

53
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Didn't expect to get a call from you.

54
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,180

to new heights.

about me, have you?

56

I haven't.

57
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,220
I'm heading over to see you now.

Last night I was tired too,

78
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,260

It's been so long since we last met,

89
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,980
we really should catch up.

90
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,580
Come on,

91
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,580
take this.

92
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,300
I'll join you for a drink.

93
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,580
Bottoms up.

94
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,740
Lingyi.

95
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,180
What's going on?

96
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,140
Since we've had some drinks

97
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,460
and it's been so long
since we last met,

98
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,500
how about I sing you the song
you used to love the most?

99
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,340
How about that one?

100
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,540
- You know what I'm talking about.
- You know what I'm talking about.

102
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,340
Amy,

103
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,420
how about you and Lingyi

104
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,740
go out and catch up?

105
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,140
Lingyi,

106
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,420
let's step outside for a bit.

107
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,740
Sen and Madam
have something to say.

108
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,300

109

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,020
Lingyi,

111
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,820
we've known each other for so long,

112
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,380
and I've always considered you
like a sister.

113
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,500
There are some things
I have to remind you.

114
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,100
You and Sen

115
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,140
are different people.

116
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,300
Being with him

117
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
will only lead to two outcomes.

118
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,060
Which two?

119
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,020
It's either you die,

120
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,340
or you live in misery.

121
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,740
Amy,

122
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,740
thank you for telling me this,

123
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,900
and thank you

124
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,940
for taking care of me all this time.

125
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,620
But I...

126
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,060
I will find out another outcome for us.

127
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,940
Madam,

128
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,940
why did you come

129
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,380
to see me today?

130
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,620
No particular reason.

131
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,020
I was just bored at home,

132
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,500
so I came to see what you were up to.

133
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,780
I heard from Bai

134
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,300
that you went to the office today.

135
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,820
Oh,

136
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,780
Bai's always making things up.

137
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,260
Well,

138
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,780
if Kun isn't at the office,

139
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,140
why would I go there?

140
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,620
Right?

141
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,540
That's true.

142
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,100
It's been a while
since we had a drink together.

143
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,540
Come on.

144
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,260
Cheers.

145
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,780
Madam,

146
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,740
the two of us

147
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,580
are in the same VIP room,

148
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,660
if someone
suddenly comes in from outside,

149
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,620
they might get the wrong idea.

150
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
What wrong idea?

151
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,260
The idea that we're having an affair,

152
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,180
right?

153
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,260
Are you any good at dice?

154
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,420
Am I any good at dice?

155
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
I heard you're pretty good at this.

156
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,740
Oh,

157
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,380
you look pretty.

158
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,780
Come on,

159
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,060
have a drink with me.

160
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,740
I don't drink.

161
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,180
Lingyi.

162
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,060
Let me go!

163
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,580
Who are you?

164
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,180
Mind your own business.

165
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,940
What are you doing?

166
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,380
I'll kill you.

167
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,740
Amy.

168
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,580
Amy!

169
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,500
Amy.

170
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,540
Amy!

171
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,340
Madam,

172
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,940
sounds like
something's happening outside.

173
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,740
I'll go check it out.

174
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,620
What's going on?

175
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,620
Why are you screwing with a young girl?

176
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,420
Drink with me.

177
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,820
I'm doing you a favor, you know.

178
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,740
Let's go.

179
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,660
Sir, let me drink with you.

180
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,020
Get up first.

181
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,700
Are you okay?

182
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,740
I'm fine.

183
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,740
What happened?

184
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,660
As long as you're okay.

185
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,900
Well then,

186
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,340
I'll leave now.

187
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
Do you need to go to the hospital?

188
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,740
It's okay.

189
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,420
I'll go by myself.

190
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,540
Cong Rong,

191
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,780

192
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,620
Your hand is injured.
