76
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,540
Well,

77
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,140
today,

78
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,060
we have something extra to do.

79

Don't worry.

80
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,460
Sen,

81
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,970
I feel like I've gained
some weight recently

82
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,460
because you're getting me too much food.

83
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,340
You'll have a good mood
if you eat a lot.

84
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,460

85
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,060
when we first met?

86
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,420
I do.

87
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,660
At that time,

88
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,540
with a room full of people,

89
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,940
you were sitting alone in the corner.

90
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,460
I just felt

91
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,340
you were different
from the rest of them.

92
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,660
Later on,

93
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,020

in my life all along.

94
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,940

95

96
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,420
I was a leader
in the underworld, after all.

97

102
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,020
and he brought you
