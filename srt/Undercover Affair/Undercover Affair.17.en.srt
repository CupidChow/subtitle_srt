Sen.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,820
Finally, you are here.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,860
I've prepared a gift for you.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,860
You're definitely going to like it.

Sen,

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,460
I know you wouldn't let your woman

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,700
stay in that middle of nowhere.

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,140
So, I helped bring her back to you.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,940
I've been so nice to you,

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,700

with that evil woman, Elena,

32
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,900
can't you read the situation now?

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,300
Everything here now belongs to me.

34

It's mine!

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,340
You can treat me however you want,

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,100
just don't hurt her.

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,300
You want to say something?

Sen,

54
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,660
Elena is not a good person at all.

55
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,740
The way she's manipulating you

So,

72
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,300
there are too many things
to consider right now.

73
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,100
It's not necessary...

74
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,140
It's not necessary

75
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,500
to waste time on trivial matters.

76
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,740
That's the right mindset.

77
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,180
You get some rest soon.

The numbers on these photos...

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,420
What are you doing?

88
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,060
What else can I do?

89
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,300
I'm waiting for instructions

90
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,140

You did well today.

It seems that Sen does care about you.

94
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,220
However,

95
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,620
we still need to wait and see
his performance tomorrow.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,100
Nice working with you.

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,820

What do you all
think of the ideas I've provided?

99
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,820

to use your own resources

to solve the group's difficulties

101
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,020
is indeed worthy
of recognition and admiration.

102
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,860
However,

103
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,500
we would like to hear

104
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,060
Sen's opinion.

105
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,260
Sen,

106
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,900
it's time for you
to make your stance clear.

107
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,820
I'll choose...

108
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,020
Madam, of course.

117
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,380
Do you think you can outsmart me?

118
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,860
If I hadn't been prepared,

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,380
I would've been fooled by you.

120
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,900
You scum!

121
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,380
Sen,

122
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,380
it's just

123
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,580
a shame for that girl.

124
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,900
I announce

125
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,540
that the new leader

126
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,300
is Tai.

127
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,580
Tai, you are here.

128
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,900
Tai, you are here.

129
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,580
Bai.

130
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,460
Got it, Tai.

131
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,620
Tonight's tab

132
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,420
is on

133
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,540
my boss Tai.

134
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,020
Tai, that sneaky scum.

135
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,500
He's been pulling strings
behind my back.

136
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,100
I should have seen it coming.

137
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,180
Tai has taken control of the group,

138
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,980
he's definitely
going to weaken my influence.

139
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,860
It'll be hard for us
to turn the tables later.

140
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,420
What are you doing?

141
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,660
Hurry up and think of a solution.

142
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,100
Where are you going?

143
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,940
You are back, Second Young Master.

144
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,260
Judging by your triumphant look,

145
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,060
you must have been elected, right?

146
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,700
We

147
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,420
should definitely celebrate.

148
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,860
We?

149
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,780
Me being elected

150
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,180
doesn't seem
to have much to do with you, does it?

151
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,060
What do you mean?

152
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,100
Sen doesn't even care

153
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,020
about whether you are alive
or dead anymore.

154
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,260
He's completely obsessed
with that wretch Elena.

155

If I hadn't been prepared,

156
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,820
I would have been fooled by you two.

157
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,140
That's impossible.

158
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,620
