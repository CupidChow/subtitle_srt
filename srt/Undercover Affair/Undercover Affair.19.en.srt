15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,540
What are you thinking about?

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,980
I'm thinking

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,420
about what we should do next.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,100
Tai ran away,

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,340
and the group became an empty shell.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,420
I'm also thinking

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,700
about how to clean up this mess.

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,140
Hey,

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,020
didn't you promise
those shareholders before

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,940
that you could use your own resources
to save the company?

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,780
How about...?

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,500
No,

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,820
it's too risky.

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,300
Tai is still missing,

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
and it's a huge threat to us.

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,020
So,

31
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,340
we need to make him disappear
completely.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,740
Are you suggesting

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,460
that we need to find him
before the cops do?

34
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,020
Do you think Tai
will just give up like that

35
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,980
and disappear completely?

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,820
What we need to do

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,100
is wait.

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,820

are so suspicious.

53

Don't blame me for overthinking.

54
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,540
That figure just now
really looked like her.

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,860
Considering the time,

56
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,340
she should be out by now.

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,740
If the cops didn't get
anything out of her,

58
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,660
and Tai has escaped,

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,020

Just think about it,

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,940
would the police let her off easily?

65
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,740
Well, that's hard to tell.

doesn't come looking for you

138

Just compensating
for that batch of goods now
