Cheng Yuan,

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,300
take her away.

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,260
What are you here for?

19
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,460
How's your wound?

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,300
You unbutton my buttons
as soon as you see me.

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,060
Your wound opened up.

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,020
Of course, it will open up.

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,660
Since a man and a woman
being alone together in the same room,

24
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,060
it would be a waste of time
not doing anything.

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,500
But you're still injured,

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,380
so you'd better
avoid strenuous activity.

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,980
You should be more careful
in the future.

28
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,100
Am I wrong?

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,220
You are right.

31
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,860
What do you think about what I said?

32
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,740
Have you thought it through?

33
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,620
What are you waiting for?

34
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,860
Don't just focus on immediate comfort

35
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,300
and overlook the bigger picture.

36
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,500
I knew I was right about you.

37
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,060
Come back with me

38
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,180
and let's find a private doctor
to do some checkups.

39
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,220
It'll be beneficial for your injury too.

40
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,340
You there,

41
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,700
I'm taking Sen back with me.

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,980
Take good care of Sen's girlfriend.

Otherwise,

44
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,060
he'll be angry.

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,980
Actually, staying here isn't that bad,

46
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,900
right?

47
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,060
Tai has already taken control
of the group.

48
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,180
If we don't take action,

49
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,980
we'll just have to watch him
to take over the entire group.

50
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,540
Of course,

51
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,420
I'm used to calling the shots.

52
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,980
I didn't mean to give you a hard time.

53
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
Sorry about that.

54
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,820

55
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,780
I don't like people
who act on their own,

56
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,620

57
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,220

61
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,820
is based on everyone's support.

62
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,060
But now,

63
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,740
my brother has been set up by someone,

64
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,780
and my sister-in-law

65
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,260
has gone to the border,
not knowing if she's alive or dead.

66
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,020
There must be a leader

67
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,340
to take control of the Kuntai Group.

68
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,420
You're Kun's brother.

69
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,900

What are you doing here?

79
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,780
It's normal

80
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,460
that I come here
to take over the affairs of the group.

81
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,620
Normal?

82
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,140
Kuntai Group belongs
to my brother and me.

83
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,340
You, an outsider,

84
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,940
are not qualified.

85
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,940
Second Young Master,

86
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,660
please calm down.

87
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,620
Sen,

88
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,180
my brother's dead,

89
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,820
and you have the nerve to come back?

90
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,940
Maybe you guys don't know,

91
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,140
but

92
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,220
they have been messing around together
for a long time.

93
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,060
I even suspect that it was you two

94
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,700
who caused my brother's death.

95
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,860
And you, Elena,

96
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,940
you know better than anyone else

97
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,340
what you are thinking every day.

98
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,900
What do you do every day
besides hooking up with men?

99
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,620
Do you think you're qualified
to take over the group?

100
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,380
Then do you?

101
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,220
What did you say?

102
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,580
Have you ever accomplished

103
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,140
any of the tasks Kun gave you?

104
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,820
Everyone,

105
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,820
the company is now
at a life-or-death moment.

106
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,340
We need to quickly come up
with solutions.

107
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,340
Otherwise, will Ruan Adong

108
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,300
just let it go?

109
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,660
No.

110
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,140
Who will believe us?

111
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,260
Who?

112
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,300
How will the company progress?

113
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,380
What Sen said

114
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,180
makes sense.

115
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,220
The group is now in a crisis.

116
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,620
How about this?

117
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,340
Within three days,

118
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,260
whoever,

119
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,380
no matter it's Second Young Master

120
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,540
or Madam Elena,
whoever can propose a solution,

121
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,780
we will have this person

122
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,180
to be the leader of the group.

123
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,820
Are you all crazy?

124
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,220
Every one of you
just said you'd support me earlier.

125
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,980
Who's been paying you this whole time?

126
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,380
Don't forget,

127
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,460
it was me who helped your brother

128
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,980
rise to power back then.

129
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,500
Come on,

130
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,620
dance with me.

131
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,980
You

132
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,740
are really in the mood, aren't you?

133
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,340
Are you not happy
seeing Tai not getting

134
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,980
what he wants today?

135
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,260
While Tai didn't get what he wanted,

136
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,260
we haven't succeeded either.

137
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,580
Don't get too excited.

138
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,220
Don't worry,

139
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
I have a solution.

140
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,860
Second Young Master.

141
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,380
You seem to have been enjoying
a good life recently,

142
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,940
and you've already forgotten about me.

143
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,900
I wouldn't dare.

144
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,100
Sen and Elena actually teamed up
to mess with me.

145
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,020
Don't they know my temper?

146
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,500
If they push me too far,

147
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,540
they'll both end up dead.

148
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,020
You definitely don't want
to die with Sen, right?

149
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,300
Plus,

150
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,740
we've talked about

151
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,020
cooperating together.

152
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,140
Shh,

153
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,340
don't you ever
mention cooperation again.

154
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,380
Sen and Elena came back from that place

155
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,980
without bringing you along.

156
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,940
It shows you're not that important.

157
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,260
So, you're not qualified
to cooperate with me.

158
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,980
Besides,

159
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,420
it was you who brought up
cooperation last time.

160
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,020
You already threw away
the business card

161
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,500
I gave you, didn't you?

162
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,580
That's not true.

163
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,460
Since you sent someone
to invite me here today,

164
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,380
you must still trust me.

165
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,260
So,

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,700
give me another chance.

167
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,860
You will see

168
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,420
if Sen cares about me or not.

169
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,900

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,300

I'm not Lingyi.

Can't you recognize my voice?
