made me forgive
many things from the past

89
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,100
and helped me understand

90
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,700
why things didn't work out with others.

91
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,300
I don't resent you anymore.

Oh, right.

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,580
Someone called you just now.

94
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,420
I was worried
it might be something urgent,

95
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,220
so I answered it.

96
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,060
Where's my phone?

to the hospital.

105

106

107
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,460
I'll go buy something for you.

108
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,260
