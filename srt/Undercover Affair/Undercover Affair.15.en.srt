Lingyi,

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,980
there are many things
I can't tell you right now.

I'm sorry.

100
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,460
Why?

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,380
You've protected me all the time,

102
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,620
but the truth is, at first,

103
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,980
I intentionally got close to you.

104
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,260
I know.

105
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Actually,

106
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,460
when I went to your place before

107
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,540
and saw the photo of you and Luo Wei,

108
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,940

111
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100

112
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,900
It feels like many things
has happened over the years,

113
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,180
but luckily, I met you.

114
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,540
I really wish

115
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,940
time could stop at this moment.

116
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,340

what matters is now!

117
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,380
It's more important

118
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,660
than yesterday,

119
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,460
or any other day before.

120
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,660
Since the most beautiful moment is now,

121
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,300
let's enjoy it.

122
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,660
The wind is rising now.

123
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,180
She's already here.

124
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,820
This woman is even more difficult
to deal with than Kun.

125
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,700
It seems like you're fine,

126
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,340
so you can still flirt with your girl.

127
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,660
Madam.

128
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,340
Let's go.

129
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,500
Lingyi,

130
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,260
I'm afraid that you have
to stay here for now.

131
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,140
Okay.

132
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,100
It's good.

133
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,140
I'm fine.

134
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,260
No need to worry about me.

135
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,700
Okay then,

136
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,660
I'm leaving then.

137
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,460
It's been a while.

138
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,260
Have you missed me?

139
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,860
Sorry,

140
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,660
I haven't seen you for such a long time,

141
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
and I've missed you.

142
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,460
You must have something to do

143
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
with Kun's death, right?

144
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,940
It's meaningless to talk about this now.

145
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,100
Tai has already taken control
of the group,

146
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,900
putting me in a passive position.

147
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,420
Sen,

148
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,100
you're a smart man.

149
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,020
I don't want to keep you guessing.

150
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,340
Can you come back with me

151
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,980
and deal with Tai together?

152
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,660
Why do I feel like

153
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,460
you're using me?

154
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,420
Do you think Tai would spare you?

155
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,780
Do you have any other options?

156
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,260
You're injured.

157
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,260
Get some rest soon.

158
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,340
I'm also tired.

159
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,460
Think about it carefully.

160
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,140
Are you deliberately avoiding me?

161
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,220
Madam.

162
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,020
How old are you?

163
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,100
I'll be twenty-five next month

164
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,540

165
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020

166

is truly a good age.

167
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,660
At this age,

168
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,820
I met Kun.

169
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,140
You've got better taste than I do.

170
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,740
Do you mean

171
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,940
that you are envious of me?

172
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,620
To be honest, I don't hate you,

173
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,340
but Sen is a smart man,

174
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,940
his woman
