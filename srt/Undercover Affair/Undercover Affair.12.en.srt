No problem, don't mention it.

Sen,

25
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,980
can you

26
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,940
not go?

27
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,540
Get some rest first.

28

Madam,

39
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,940
is it only in this way

40
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,060
that you can trust me?

41
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,820
As expected of you, Sen.

42
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,060
You're so smart

He's gone out.

66

Gone out?

67
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,420
Did he go to see my sister-in-law?

68
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,860
How is that possible?

69
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,140
I just wanted to have some dessert,

70
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,060
so

71
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,820
I asked him to go buy some.

72
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,420
Buying desserts?

73
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,260
Oh, that's great!

74
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,540
There are five of us,

75
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,900
so tell him to get five more servings.

76
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,380
Just drop the act!

77
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,820
During my brother's absence these days,

78
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,340
he's constantly been going
to see my sister-in-law.

79
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,740
I think it's a no-brainer
what two people could do alone

80
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,220

81
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,380

Besides,

83
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,740
not everyone has the guts
to mess with Kun's woman.

Don't you agree,

Second Young Master?

86
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,780
It's okay if you don't want
to get us some desserts.

87
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,060
Ever since Sen

88
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,220
came to our place,

89
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,060
my brother
has been scolding me every day

90
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,340
and despising me all the time.

91
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,940
Since Sen seems to enjoy

92
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,180
stealing someone's love,

93
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
I'll make him get a taste
of that feeling too.

94
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,740
You...

95
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,500
Sen will get angry if you act like this.

96
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,140
Sen...

97
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,260
I don't care if he's angry or not.

98
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,780
Do you think I'm afraid of him?

99
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,660
Do you think I'm afraid of him?!

100
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
You all want to use Sen
to suppress me, huh?

101
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,020
Don't do this to me!

102
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,220
How about we cooperate?

103
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,900
Yes,

104
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,020
let's cooperate.

105
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,660
How do we cooperate?

106
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,260
I've changed my mind.

107
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,900
Sen is unreliable.

108
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,580
So,

109
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,900
I can help you monitor him.

110
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,300
Even though he hasn't told me
anything yet,

111
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,460
I'll be around him every day.

112
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,620
So eventually, I'll find out something.

113
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,060
As soon as something happens,

114
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,420
I'll let you know.

115
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,900
Okay,

116
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,900
I'll give you a chance.

117
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,620
I want to see

118
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,380
what value you can provide me.

119
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Having said that,

120
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,020
you better not betray me.

121
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,900
Otherwise,

122
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,140
I'll make you pay with your life.
