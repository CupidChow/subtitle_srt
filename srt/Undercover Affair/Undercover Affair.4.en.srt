Sen.

118
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,620
He was the one who started touching me,

119
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,180

122
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,180
What worries me has happened after all.

124
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,420
Since you've been taken advantage of
by someone,

125
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,300
you can't just let it slide, can you?

126
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,900
Think about it.

127
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,740
What do you want?

128
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,220
If you want anything, just ask him.

129
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,060
Sen.

130
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
Madam, wait.

131
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,220
Madam,

132
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,260
there are two hundred thousand
in the account.

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,300
You have to accept it.
The password is six zeros.

134
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,220
Consider it as compensation
for my mistake.

135
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,180
Madam, you must accept it.

136
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,540

140

I've never seen so much money before.

141
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,180
I don't even know how to spend it.

142
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,380

144
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,340

145
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,500
It's okay if you don't know;

146
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,620
