Tai,

she's not completely worthless.

I really appreciate

you're finally back.

I'm glad you're okay.

80

What do you mean 'okay'?

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,900
Of course, I'm fine.

82
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,620
I can't figure out

What's so hard to understand?

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,620
Scar got caught,

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,220
and he ratted Tai out to the cops.

87
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,100
It's pretty straightforward.

88
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,980
Plus, he gets a chance to plea bargain.

89
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,780
Could you two please come with us?

90
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,900
We need your cooperation
for an investigation.

91
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,300
Tai got away.

92
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,060
Scar ratted him out, right?

93
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,420
Yes.

94
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,500
Scar confessed that he and Tai

95
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,940
conspired to assassinate Kun.

96
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,060
We were trying to get in touch with you

97
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,540
while we were chasing Tai,

98
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,100
but we couldn't reach you.

99
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,740
Tell me,

100
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,580
what's the next step of the plan?

101
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,820
We've already sent people

102
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,580
to apprehend him

103
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,420
and conducted a search of his house.

104
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,060
And we did find something of value.

105
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,940
But...

106
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,620
But what? Tell me.

107
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,220
But we found out

108
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,900
that a large portion

109
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,820
of the cases
related to the Kuntai Group

110
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,540
were not orchestrated by Kun and Tai.

111
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,500
So...

112
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
So who could it be?

113
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,540
Elena.

114
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,780
She destroyed the evidence

115
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,700
before you arrived.

116
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Dang it.

117
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,740
Sen,

118
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,380
it looks like you'll have to go back

119
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,820
and continue searching for evidence
against her.

120
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,220
We'll definitely assist you
in any way we can.

121
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,100
However, she must be very cautious now,

122
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,940
so there probably won't be
any new transactions for a while.

123
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,420
If you need anything,

124
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,820
we'll definitely...

125
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,500
Kun is already dead,

126
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,980
and Tai has run away.

127
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,940
As for me,

128
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,740
have you ever considered my life?

129
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Get me a cigarette!

130
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
We are not allowed to smoke here.

131
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,220
I can at least have some gum, right?

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,820
After these years
of living on the edge,

133
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,220
your tastes have become refined, huh?

134
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,100
Once you finish your mission,

135
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,140
let's see how you can return
to a life of simplicity.

136
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,140
Here.

137
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Come on.

138
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,820
Leave it to me.

139
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,700
Hey,

140
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,460
but honestly,

141
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,900
I quite enjoy living this simple life.

142
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,340
I don't really want
that kind of wealth and luxury.

143
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,660
If...

144
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,540
if we could swap our lives,

145
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,580
would you be willing to do it?

146
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm off to solve the case.

147
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,260
Sen,

148
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,940
stay safe.

149
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,020
I didn't expect this opportunity
to come so soon.

150
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,580
Tai ran away,

151
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,180
and I've pinned everything

152
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,820
I could on him.

153
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,740
Let's go.

154
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,260
Here,

155
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,220
have some water.

156
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,460
Thanks.

157
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,860
You can leave

158
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,980
after completing the formalities.

159
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,340
Leave?

160
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,220
Yes, I'll leave.

161
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,420
You've worked hard

162
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,900
taking care of Sen recently.

163
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,500
Actually, I didn't do anything.

164
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,900
And I almost became a liability to him
several times.

165
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,740
What makes you say that?

166
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,820
Sen has always praised
how clever you are to me.

167
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,740
But now that Tai is on the run,

168
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,220
if we don't catch him,

169
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,500
none of us will be safe.

170
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,100
I'll be careful too.

171
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,260
