00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,420
Sen,

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,420
where should we put Lingyi's luggage?

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,220
Put it in my room.

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,100

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,380
Sen, I...

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,300
Sen,

21
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,620
I've put the luggage in your room.

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,620
If there's nothing else,

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,220
I'll leave you two alone.

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,220
Thanks, bro.

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,860
Go ahead and attend to other work.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,500
Okay.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,020
Sure.

No.

32

Thank you, Sen.

Don't worry,

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,780
I'll find a suitable time to move out
as soon as possible.

41

on the infighting,

I promise
I won't mess things up for you.

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,460

I don't know.

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,340
I was about to ask you, Kun.

71
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,140
I'll go by myself.

72
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,060
You're going by yourself?

73
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,460

As a key member of the company,

87
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,740
don't you need to figure out
a solution too?

88
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,540
You should leave first.

89
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,820
Sen, it seems you don't want
your girlfriend to get involved.

90
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,900
Guess you don't consider her
as one of us.

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,860
Lingyi,

92
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,260
Sen seems to treat you as an outsider,

93
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,860
but it's okay,

94
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,820
I'll make it right for you.

95
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,380
We lost a batch of goods

96
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,740
the other day,

97
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,660
and the losses were substantial.

98
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,260
I've been suspecting
there's a mole in our company.

99
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,020
Since you're so smart,

100
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,540
help me figure it out.

101
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,540
Who could this mole be?

102
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,780
Second Young Master, you jest.

103
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm afraid my IQ isn't high enough

104
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,660
when it comes to catching the mole.

105
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,980
But

106
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,740
do you play the game
'Legends of the Three Kingdoms'?

107
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,380
If you play this game,

108
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,180
I can help you catch the traitor.

109
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,660

110
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740

111
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,460
to go see him.

112
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,420
What's the matter?

113
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,380
Why do you have to be so mysterious
and talk to me over a video call?

114
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,540
Lingyi,

115
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,340

118
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,940
Remember,

119
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,740
don't let anyone know about this.

120
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,060
Keep it secret.

121
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,380

Hey.

125
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,700
He's always so mysterious.

126
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,060

127
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,060

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,100
How come you're here?

131
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,660
Weren't you busy and didn't have time?

132
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,340
Why is your phone turned off?

133
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,140
You asked me to turn off the phone.

134
