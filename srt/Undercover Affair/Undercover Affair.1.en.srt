Oh.

7
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,860
A newcomer.

8
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,500
Hello.

9
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,700
Thanks to this wound,

10
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,580
I can have my position
in the Kuntai Group today.

11
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,580
Hey,

12
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,420
I haven't seen you around before, Miss.

13
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,860
Hello.

14
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,300
Give me your WeChat.

15
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,660
Sorry,

16
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,540
it's against the company's policy
for me

17
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,460
to add people on WeChat.

18
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,060
Do you know who I am?

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,660
This place belongs to us.

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,220
Listen,

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,980
you'd better...

22
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,500
Bitch, how dare you!

23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,100
Who is it?

24
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,380
Sir.

25
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,660
Why are you hiding here?

26
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,860
You didn't answer my calls either.

They're in the innermost room.

30
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,020
I heard that the big shots

31
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,660
from the Kuntai Group are coming today.

32
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,980
Make sure you look good for them.

- Tai!
- Tai!

38
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,180
Tai,

39
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,020
a toast to you.

40
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,380
Listen.

41
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,780
This gentleman,

42
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,620
Sen,

43
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,700
you might not know this,

44
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,300
but Sen once suffered the cutting
for our boss Kun

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,260
and saved his life.

46
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,620
What does Sen mean to the Kuntai Group?

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,420
Bai.

48
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,300
Yes, Tai.

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,700
You mean

50
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,820
that it doesn't matter
for the Kuntai Group

51
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,940
to lose anyone but not Kun.

52
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:51,740
Is that right?

53
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,100
No, Tai,

54
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
that's not what I mean.

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,020
Tai,

56
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,940
I'm clumsy in speech.

57
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,020
Consider this drink

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,660
as my self-punishment.

59
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,060
Sen,

60
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
my brother

61
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,220
considers you as his own kin,

62
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,540
so you're like a real brother to me.

63
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,460
If you ever need anything,

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,860
just come to me,

65
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,020
alright?

66
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,860
Come on,

67
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,020
let's raise a toast to Sen.

68
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,100
- Yes, a toast to Sen!
- Yes, a toast to Sen!

69
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,060
Because of the Kuntai Group,

70
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
I've lost four years of my youth.

71
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,780
Now that I'm out of prison,

72
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,100
all I want is to live a decent life

73
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
and uncover the truth
of what happened back then.

74
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,340
Hello,

75
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,220
Amy asked me to come over.

76
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,100
We have some new wine,

77
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,500
and she wanted me to ask

78
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,700
if anyone would like to try some.

79
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,940
As for wine,

80
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,780
we'll take as much as you can offer.

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,780
But you have to stay

82
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,980
and have a drink with me.

83
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
Sorry,

84
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,220
I don't really drink.

85
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,380
Drop the act.

86
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,460
- Have a drink!
- Have a drink!

87
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,460
Drink.

88
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,820
This girl is quite interesting.

89
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,860
I'll take my leave, Sen.

90
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,860
Wait.

91
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,260
What did you just call me?

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,940
Sen.

93
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,980
Is it your first day?

94
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:17,940
Mm.

95
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,620
There's your Sen.

96
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,260
Sen,

97
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,140
she's a fan of yours.

98
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,580
Sir,

99
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,340
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,660
You don't even know me

101
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,260
and dare to come here to work?

102
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,540
Fine.

103
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,620
Since you

104
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,540
are so obsessed with Sen,

105
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,980
you're responsible
for keeping Sen company for me today.

106
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,260
Got it?

107
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,980
Don't act so shy?

108
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,980
Let me tell you,

109
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,780
there are benefits for you
if you can make Sen happy.

110
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,460
Understand?

111
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,540
Am I right, guys?

112
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,460
- Yes!
- Yes!

113
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,180
- Hey. -Yes, Sen.

114
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,380
Next time,

115
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,540
be a little gentler with girls,

116
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,580
otherwise, who will follow you

117
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,380
in the future?

118
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,300
Sen,

119
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm just used to it.

120
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,100
Girls

121
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,260
are delicate,

122
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,500
so even I only use a little power,
it will be too much for her.

123
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,140
You can't blame me for that, right?

124
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,420
Go have fun.

125
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,220
Okay.

126
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,980
Sen,

127
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,300
is she not your type?

128
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,580
You should have said so earlier.

129
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,420
Bai!

130
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,940
Yes.

131
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,940
Let's try the new one today.

132
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,580
Sure.

133
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,060
You are shy, Sen.

134
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,180
Arrange a place for Sen

135
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,660
to spend time alone with her,

136
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,860
understand?

137
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,660
Roger that.

138
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,820
Sen,

139
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,820
I will try my best to arrange it
for you

140
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,420
Please.

141
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,180
Sen,

142
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,380
this is all I can do for you.

143
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
Why are you still here?

144
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,340
Listen,

145
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,860
I'll only say it once.

146
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,660
My name is Tai.

147
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Got it?

148
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,060
Don't worry.

149
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,500
You know you can trust me
to handle things.

150
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,420
Alright.

151
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,300
I'll come to see you later.

152
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,060
It's him.

153
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,980
Don't be nervous.

154
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:39,980
Sit down.

155
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,260
Do you know who I am?

156
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,380
Sen.

157
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,460
Everyone outside

158
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,580
calls me

159
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,540
Sen.

160
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,820
People like you

161
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,180
can't fit in this kind of place.

162
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,780
You need to learn
how to act coquettishly.

163
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,940
Sen,

164
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,420
I don't want to learn
how to act coquettishly

165
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,300
or how to please men.

166
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,180
Let me go, please.

167
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,940
What are you waiting for?

168
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,740
Sen.

169
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,820
Sen, I'm sorry.

170
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Please.

171
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,460
Let me go.

172
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,580
Don't touch me.

173
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,940
Let me go.

174
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,860
Let me go.

175
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,900
Oh my.

176
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,620
Sen is pretty kinky.

177
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,700
Tai.

178
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,420
Did you see anything interesting?

179
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,420
I can't see anything.

180
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
I can only hear it.

181
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,980
Sen's making quite a sound there.

182
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,780
Does it sound fun?

183
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,460
Let me hear it too.

184
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,420
Keep screaming.

185
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,700
Scream louder!

186
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,260
Look at me.

187
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,860
Do you want to end it like this?

188
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,460
