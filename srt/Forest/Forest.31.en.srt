00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,420
Operation Room
Episode 31

2
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,480
Director.

3
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,290
The surgery went well, but he lost too much blood.

4
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,900
I think getting past tonight will be crucial.

5
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,910
Patient!

6
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,090
Patient, are you okay?

7
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,730
Are you conscious?

8
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,160
VIP Ward

9
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,920
Kang San Hyeok!

10
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,790
San Hyeok!

11
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,510
Patient Bong Dae Yong is awake and patient Kang San Hyeok is...

12
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,690
He can't seem to wake up from his sleep. I think it's psychological.

13
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:08,410
His CT scans show no abnormality. I thought he'd recover soon.

14
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,870
Well, Director...

15
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,420
Someone locked the hospital door from the outside and set the hospital on fire.

16
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,730
I'm sure it was payback for Kang San Hyeok whistleblowing the contamination case in Miryeong Village.

17
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,530
Kang San Hyeok is in danger. Please help him, Director.

18
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,240
The Miryeong Hospital was destroyed from the fire

19
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,480
and 200 hectare of Miryeong Mountain was burnt.

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,620
But fortunately, no fatalities occurred.

21
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,500
So where is the corpse?

22
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,340
I searched through the hospitals in the area just in case, but there was no patient by the name, Kang San Hyeok.

23
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,990
The probability of his survival is extremely low.

24
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,220
You never know. Search thoroughly.

25
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,100
You must confirm his death.

26
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,140
I understand, Managing Director.

27
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,230
Yes. Sleep as much as you can at times like this.

28
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:17,120
You lived feeling guilty about sleeping all this time.

29
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,460
Sleep well.

30
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,290
Rest.

31
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,360
And after that, look at me. Let's open your eyes.

32
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,990
All right?

33
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,250
It's unfortunate what's happened to the Miryeong Hospital, but I'm glad you're all safe.

34
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,050
You need to treat Miryeong Village residents. Until we rebuild the hospital,

35
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,740
you can work here.

36
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,700
I have prepared a separate office for you to look after Miryeong Village.

37
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,780
You all went through a lot in many ways.

38
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,270
He smiled at me.

39
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,700
Just because he's requesting this of me, does he think I'll stay on here?

40
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,530
It's too late, you know. Way too late.

41
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,340
In any case, the hospital can't run properly without me.

42
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,440
Hurry up and come. Our Miryeong residents are waiting for us.

43
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,270
The elevator is this way.

44
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,720
This is my turf. This one is not as busy, so it's faster.

45
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,510
We should get the heavy metal poisoning results first.

46
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,490
Executive Director

47
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,460
Yes, Executive Director.

48
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,700
Yes, I'm listening.

49
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,440
Yes, I got it.

50
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,620
It's me.

51
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,490
Are the heavy metal poisoning results on the Miryeong residents out?

52
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,390
[Blood Cell Heavy Metal Test]
Under the suspicion of heavy metal poisoning of the Miryeong residents,

53
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,500
all the test results show that the poisonous element was not detected.

54
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,720
[Heavy metal not detected in Miryeong Village residents]
The Miryeong county will continue to conduct the test quarterly going forward...

55
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,420
I'm sure Kang San Hyeok is dead.

56
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,010
Please forget our ill-fated relationship of the past

57
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,880
and give me the provincial forest development rights.

58
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,120
- He's here! He's here!
- Managing Director, is it true that the contamination in the Miryeong Village is connected to Taesung Group?

59
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,470
Is it true that you started the forest fire in order to cover up the contamination?

60
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,320
Please say a word!

61
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,710
That is not true.

62
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,890
Putting my father's honor on the line, I insist that I have nothing to do with this incident.

63
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,460
- Were you aware of the heavy metal poisoning in Miryeong Village?
- Director, did you know?

64
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,700
Director, one word, please!

65
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,290
San Hyeok! San Hyeok!

66
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,840
San Hyeok, it's me. Do you recognize me?

67
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,830
VIP Ward

68
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,200
Aside from the external wounds from the surgery, he's fine.

69
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,910
You went through a lot, Go Na Kang.

70
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,890
Thank you.

71
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,320
Go Na Kang? (Means Kang Toffee)

72
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,820
I changed your name and the date you were hospitalized.

73
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,600
You never know when the secret will get out. We should hurry and move you to a safer place.

74
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,100
People who were looking for Kang San Hyeok came by.

75
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,910
Jeong Yeong Jae was my protector?

76
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,820
Was?

77
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,500
I'm currently your protector and I'll continue to be your protector. What are you talking about?

78
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,320
Lean on me. I'll carry you.

79
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,680
You just stay safe.

80
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,540
Don't jump into the fire for my sake.

81
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,820
Just stay safe.

82
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,550
Promise me, okay?

83
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,260
Okay.

84
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,440
I promise.

85
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,930
Team Leader.

86
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,130
You finally pulled a big one. Crazy bastard.

87
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,850
- Team Leader, you're not normal either.
- Geez...

88
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,960
it hurts so badly.

89
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,210
Hey, you, don't even think about resigning, man.

90
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,380
I'll count all your unexcused absences, and you will only ride the rappel.

91
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,140
I got to see your sorry behavior.

92
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,900
Get out now.

93
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,600
It hurts so much that I want to cuss you out, man.

94
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,210
Director! Are you all right?

95
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,030
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae told me not to come by in case your identity might get revealed.

96
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,800
I was dying of curiosity all by myself!

97
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,580
Stop fussing around. Hurry up and get ready.

98
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,410
Get ready? You just got out of the hospital. Get ready for what?

99
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,220
Managing Director Kwon Joo Han of Taesung Group, likely to succeed as the chairman

100
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,050
Get ready to catch and kill Kwon Joo Han.

101
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,190
Wow. You take my breath away.. So cool.

102
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,520
Director, you're alive and well!

103
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,960
I thought the ground underneath our station is contaminated.

104
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,540
So why is the county office telling us there are no problems?

105
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,550
They said they didn't find anything on the soil test.

106
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,670
Geez, I don't know if they want us to believe that or not...

107
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,180
The elders who drank underground water have cancer and all kinds of diseases.

108
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,910
But they say the test didn't detect any heavy metals.

109
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,750
This is serious.

110
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,380
All our tests also said they didn't detect anything.

111
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,120
But that makes me feel more uneasy.

112
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,710
Geez, we need our team leader at times like this.

113
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,890
Hyung San Hyeok would be the expert at fighting against things like this.

114
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,230
- I wonder when Hyung San Hyeok will wake up.
- Hey...

115
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,190
Aigoo, aigoo!

116
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,050
What if someone hears you?

117
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,710
Why? Is my name taboo?

118
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,100
San... oh, S hyung!

119
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,940
What the heck? Why is S here?

120
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,450
I'm awake now. So you're excused from not mentioning my name.

121
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,610
You can bring back Kang San Hyeok and curse me to your heart's content.

122
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,720
Wow, you took quite a vacation.

123
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,950
So, you're coming back to the rescue team now, right?

124
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,460
- Who says we'll take him back?
- Aigoo...

125
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,060
Geez, you look cool now.

126
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,670
We'd know for sure if we dig the grounds of the rescue team headquarters.

127
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,690
But I think the superiors want to let this slide quietly.

128
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,840
I need evidence to support cause and effect.

129
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,320
Were there any cases of cancers or leukemia in the rescue team?

130
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm not sure. We take rotations on duty in different areas, so we don't hear of each other's condition too much.

131
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,350
From way before I started working here,

132
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,520
the rescue team started using tap water rather than underground water.

133
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,980
By chance, does paralysis count?

134
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,190
- Team Member Jang?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,740
He loved Miryeong Mountain. So he moved to Miryeong Village and worked here for ten years.

136
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,620
But suddenly, he started having paralysis in his legs.

137
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,220
In the end, he went out on a rescue mission, but couldn't move his legs.

138
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,020
So he got his leg amputated when a boulder fell on him.

139
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,900
If you look at it that way, don't you have more serious issues? You're from here.

140
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,070
I don't notice any problems myself. And my tests came out normal, too.

141
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,990
But then, I'm worried about my hyungnim. Did he get his medical exam?

142
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,720
You can't exert yourself yet.

143
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,810
The lesions and burn wounds are pretty serious.

144
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,610
Yes, scary Dr. Jeong.

145
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,430
Don't take this lightly.

146
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,210
If you overdo it, I'll take you and shut you in a hospital room.

147
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,560
See? Where? Where is it?

148
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,590
I'm okay. This is nothing.

149
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,960
I didn't know you'd be like this.

150
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,960
As soon as you woke up, you're chasing around the contamination issue in your condition.

151
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,620
- I think I misunderstood you a lot...
- Yeong Jae.

152
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,760
You didn't misunderstand me.

153
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,480
The night you packed up. You're correct about how you felt.

154
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,670
I was going to cover up the residents' poisoning issues and was going to start

155
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,730
the rare earth metals business.

156
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,150
The reason I'm doing this is completely for my personal revenge.

157
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,030
I don't have a sacred sense of duty like you're thinking.

158
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,850
Why don't you take a look at yourself again carefully?

159
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:34,910
Is Kang San Hyeok really that selfish?

160
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,190
Yes, I'm his son.

161
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,130
I wanted to know the result of the detailed medical examination that he took last time.

162
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,390
Pardon?

163
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,090
Did the test results come out?

164
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,640
As you instructed, I distributed fabricated test results.

165
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,360
And the real ones?

166
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,810
They're all here.

167
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,590
Blood Heavy Metal Test Results

168
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:18,420
They show 50% more than the safe level of arsenic in the residents.

169
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,580
Here you go. Hello.
Not detected

170
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,090
Everything looks normal.

171
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,840
You don't have to worry.

172
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,850
Detected

173
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:43,270
We, at Seoul Myeongseong University, must prove that we ordered the fabrication of the test results.

174
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,140
So, keep both sets of the test results secure.

175
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,870
I'll turn everything over to the Prosecutors' Office.

176
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,180
I understand, Director.

177
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,620
You asked to meet me but suddenly went awol.

178
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,030
Something urgent came up at my office.

179
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,120
Who is it?

180
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,950
The tiger cub who'd put the managing director in jeopardy if we don't kill him off right away.

181
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,450
But those guys who started the fire...

182
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,370
I thought they went to China.

183
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,910
But they came back and threatened me saying they'll reveal everything.

184
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,520
So, where are they?

185
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,400
I gave them some money and drove them out. No need to worry.

186
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,230
I saw them get on the airplane myself.

187
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,610
But it's so strange.

188
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,720
How could there me another fire as soon as that news comes out?

189
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,960
I guess you must've started the most recent fire yourself?

190
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,370
Why? Do you think I'd record you or something?

191
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,570
You'd better not try to pull anything.

192
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,660
I'm telling you that considering our old friendship.

193
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,520
Didn't you say you were going to build a resort?

194
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,520
When you told me to start the forest fire 25 years ago,

195
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,940
you said you were only trying to relocate the residents. That it's a simple task.

196
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,740
You completely deceived me. Right?

197
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,960
About those things being buried on our grounds.

198
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,750
Are you blaming me for what you did back then?

199
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,490
Don't you know me? I'm talking about money!

200
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,860
You deceived me when you bought the land with those expensive elements buried here.

201
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,360
You should pay me more.

202
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,690
I'll speak to the Managing Director.

203
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,200
He caused this illness for me. How dare he say he'll do another business?

204
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm sure he has no idea that the child who was in that fire was Kang San Hyeok.

205
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,350
The brother of the kid you guys killed.

206
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,470
Take it from that tiger cub, Kang San Hyeok.

207
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,250
Those bastards deserve to be fried in the heavy metal s*** water!

208
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,110
Hey! Hey, you! What are you doing here at this hour?

209
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,060
How long have you been standing there?

210
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,010
Hey!

211
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,110
Why couldn't I think of that? Now that I think about it,

212
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,860
we were struggling to have three meals a day. But we suddenly got rich

213
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,810
right after the Miryeong forest fire 25 years ago.

214
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,420
What should I do, Father? Should I yell and scream and say how could you do such a thing?

215
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,520
Should I ignore it since the statute of limitation expired already?

216
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,370
What do I have to do?

217
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,480
Hey, if I turn myself in at the police station,

218
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,050
will you forgive me?

219
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,730
If you'd forgive me. If my Chang can live without being tormented all your life,

220
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,120
I'll... I'll do anything. Just say it.

221
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,660
Why do you live like that, Father? Don't you have your own life?

222
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,040
What did you gain by not having a life of your own?

223
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,960
What are you left with, but a sick body?

224
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,790
You... Do you know about my cancer?

225
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,740
You... I'm not scared of dying!

226
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm your baby. The one you gave birth to with your aching belly.

227
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,870
No matter what you did, I'm always on your side.

228
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,010
Why don't you know that? Why don't you know that like an idiot?

229
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,710
- Father, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Let go.

230
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,770
I'm sorry I made you that way. I'm sorry...

231
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:31,190
I'll get better.

232
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,160
I don't have any pain. I'm fine.

233
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,200
The entire grounds of the rescue team have been contaminated? I also have arsenic poisoning?

234
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,860
The reason you were having frequent memory lapse is not due to alcoholism,

235
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,880
but it could be from arsenic poisoning.

236
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,430
So I didn't only lose a friend in that forest fire from long ago.

237
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,610
Back then, your friend had gone in to rescue a little girl, right?

238
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,880
By chance, did you see anything strange?

239
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,460
The sound of an helicopter.

240
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,850
Not the rescue team helicopter. But I heard another helicopter.

241
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,890
But strangely, the portion about the helicopter got deleted in the rescue journal.

242
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,420
What's going on? Why are you being so serious unlike you?

243
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,900
I think kneeling will be too dramatic.

244
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,860
Even if I were to say, "How much money do you want?", you already have more money than I can compare.

245
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,570
I have no answer no matter how much I think about it.

246
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,590
What the heck is he saying?

247
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:25,460
The reason I have no answer is because I don't think I can ever forgive myself.

248
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,140
My father did something that's not forgivable.

249
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,710
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

250
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,900
To you, Kang San Hyeok, and to your little sister...

251
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,310
I'm so sorry that all I can say is sorry.

252
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,960
Let go.

253
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,370
Yeong Jae might misunderstand if she saw us.

254
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,510
You shouldn't say the word, "Forgiveness," so carelessly.

255
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,590
I'll talk to your father directly.

256
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,880
The governor seems to be avoiding our calls.

257
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,290
All right.

258
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,600
He reappeared, huh? Kang San Hyeok is alive.

259
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,160
I'll take care of him myself immediately.

260
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,500
No. Seeing how well he is going around interfering with my work,

261
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,480
I'm sure he's prepared for that.

262
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,300
Then how should we proceed? There are only a few days left until the Chairman's deadline.

263
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,720
Then we should draw our last card.

264
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,680
The hostage card that we hold.

265
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,350
It's a list of Miryeong residents who were cremated since the 1994 forest fire.

266
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,010
1994 - A List of Deceased People in Miryeong Village (Cremated)
I met with every single chief mourner of their family.

267
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,760
All of them?

268
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,750
I was right.

269
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,040
I was suspicious since there was no record of funeral payment at the county office.

270
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,500
As expected, they all contacted a different party.

271
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,690
Deokin Foundation Social Contribution Team
Someone came out from this organization

272
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,390
and paid them a funeral fee only after confirming the cremation. Saying it's a welfare fund.

273
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,690
Deokin Foundation?

274
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,720
He helps us out with our hospital's medical services.

275
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,110
He's Director Jo Kwang Pil of the Deokin Foundation.

276
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,110
It's nice to meet you, Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae. I've wanted to meet you.

277
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,720
I looked into it and found out that there is no Deokin Foundation among the foundations that are registered nationally.

278
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,980
A fictitious organization has been paying the funeral cost for that long length of time.

279
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,010
Director Jo Kwang Pil

280
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,430
The number you dialed does not exist.

281
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,380
Please confirm and dial again.

282
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,890
There you go. Make sure to take your antibiotics.

283
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,650
- Is something wrong?
- Huh?

284
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,670
No, nothing.

285
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:47,450
By chance, do you know someone named Jo Kwang Pil through this contamination case?

286
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,980
How do you know Jo Kwang Pil?

287
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,920
He took my signature stamp saying he's building a trauma center.

288
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,970
I wasn't suspicious at all since he was introduced to me by the hospital director in Seoul.

289
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,750
It looks like the Deokin Foundation paid for the deceased Miryeong residents' cremation.

290
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,890
Why would he take my signature stamp?

291
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,520
I'll take care of it.

292
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,680
What are you going to do?

293
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,370
I'll take care of it. So, don't worry.

294
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,810
No. This is my business.

295
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,300
You can't be in a bind or compromise with them because of me.

296
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,510
- I got it. So, you just...
- This is my business.

297
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,940
Don't do it your way.

298
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,770
People who ignore evil are evil, too. I will never compromise.

299
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,120
If he's plotting something, I'll face him to the end.

300
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,710
Don't butt in with my business.

301
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,580
All right, I got it.

302
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,500
Deokin Foundation Executive Director, Jeong Yeong Jae

303
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,210
This is Kang San Hyeok.

304
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,010
I believe it's time we meet again, Managing Director Kwon Joo Han.

305
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,610
I guess being in love is an amazing thing.

306
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,490
You knew full well that you'd die here, yet you came voluntarily.

307
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,130
First, keep your promise.

308
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,180
Are you talking about this?

309
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:13,350
The proof of embezzling the slush funds that Executive Director Jeong Yeong Jae signed off.

310
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,200
I should give it to you.

311
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,120
If you can take it with you.

312
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,720
There's a question I get asked very frequently.
