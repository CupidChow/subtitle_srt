00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,330
Episode 21
Don't go far from me.

2
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,790
Stay with me.

3
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,090
You are, you are someone who only focuses on your own goals.

4
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,410
The obvious result is ... I'm afraid.

5
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,260
Be my goal next to me.

6
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,810
I need you.

7
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,790
Are you up?

8
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,410
Are you put makeup on?

9
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,180
No.

10
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,580
I think you did.

11
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,910
Come. Let's have breakfast together.

12
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,090
You made all this from stuff form the mountain? You did it this morning?

13
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,160
They are all common on the mountain in back.

14
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,400
The wrap is made with gondaeseori. (taro leaves, the doewnjang (fermented bean paste soup) has day lilies in it, some leafy vegetables.

15
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,860
Try it. It was easy and it's good.

16
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,320
Yum. The scent!

17
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,640
That's why we eat wild greens. Because they have a fragrance that can only be held in the deep forest.

18
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,860
But don't you usually just have a simple cup of coffee for breakfast?

19
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,980
I always like stuff like this better.

20
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,270
I haven't made it because I didn't have anyone to eat it with.

21
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,350
There is now.

22
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,900
I want to buy this robot. On an installment plan? 360 months.

23
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,700
As if ...

24
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,290
It's a 3,600 months plan.

25
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,050
Does that make 300 years?

26
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,210
♬ Oh at the sound of a whistle ♬

27
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,480
♬ I hum without realizing it ♬

28
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,220
♬ Drunk on a cup of coffee ♬

29
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,800
♬ I also don't realize ♬

30
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,980
♬ I'm sitting and thinking of you

31
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,600
♬ I try saying anything. ♬

32
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,920
♬ Rather than what you want ♬

33
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,470
♬ Listen to the answer I've prepared ♬

34
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,980
♬ By the time the sun sets ♬

35
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,980
♬ We will sit and face each other blankly (I'm in love, I'm in love) ♬

36
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,360
♬ We can fall in love ♬

37
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,880
♬ (Yeah. We can fall in love.) ♬

38
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,100
♬ Even doing nothing at all I feel good ♬

39
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,930
♬ Anytime with you ♬

40
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,940
♬ (Whoa) That is what you will say. ♬

41
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,820
♬ That is what you will say. ♬

42
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,220
♬ Only you in my heart ♬

43
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,750
♬ Only you always in my heart ♬

44
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,380
What shall I do?

45
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,190
- That's okay.
- You don't need to do that.

46
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,160
- Ill do that.
- It's alright.

47
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,510
I can wipe it though. I'll do it.

48
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,780
It's okay, I'm done.

49
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,000
When did they get so close?

50
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,050
- Take a walk every day. It's a must!
- I will.

51
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,850
All right.

52
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,540
- Bye.
- Bye.

53
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,040
Here. Look at this.

54
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,690
What's this?

55
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,850
You like to study.

56
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,880
These are the medical records I didn't organize. Just a few.

57
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,900
- Ten years' worth.
- Ten years?

58
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,420
You want me to organize them now?

59
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,360
Even if I want to help, what kind of help can a has-been like me give?

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,150
You are a rising star who was already invited to an international scientific society meeting, aren't you?

61
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,070
But, why are you suddenly doing this?

62
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,340
Don't you know they are already in the electronic system?

63
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,540
No. Miryeong Hospital and Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital are not compatible with the electronic system.

64
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,980
File attachments like x-rays have to be manually entered.

65
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,720
While I was busy treating patients, I fell a little behind.

66
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,060
Gangwon Medical Center wants them to be submitted.

67
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,680
Do it, wherever.

68
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,800
That's what I said. Every time I told you to submit them.

69
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,300
I think a person should take care of his own business.

70
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,440
Did you hear that? Then you do it!

71
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,640
Was that meant to be funny?

72
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,090
Somehow I don't have a way to get you to say "Yes".

73
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,340
I ask you do something but you refuse.

74
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,220
How can you refuse the request of your far higher superior?

75
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,770
That's not so. That's exactly what you said.

76
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,210
I am busy with other things, so Dr. Jeong, newbie at Miryeong Hospital, take care of it.

77
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,620
My decision on how you should think of me will depend on how you take care of it.

78
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,650
Really.

79
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,980
Actually, it's not that I asked to be sent to the academic society meeting.

80
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,480
Is dragging me down connected to the ten years of records?

81
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,770
Yes, Professor.

82
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,020
Did everything work out for the urgent patient you had yesterday?

83
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,660
Yes. I'm sorry it was so sudden.

84
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,070
Not at all. I'm fine.

85
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,100
Then, anyway, could you come to Seoul?

86
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,080
Excuse me, Professor. Could I ask what this is about?

87
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,230
I don't know the details

88
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,360
but the Director of the Hospital wants to see you.

89
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,960
I think it's an important task, so this time make sure you keep your promise and come.

90
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,840
Understand?

91
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,120
Yes. I will. Yes.

92
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,140
Important task?

93
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
What about the "love letter"?

94
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,490
All done. I am about to send it.
Shareholder Resolution

95
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,020
Are the "fireworks" ready?

96
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,990
Yes. They will explode as soon as they are dispatched.

97
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,630
Do a good job.

98
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,990
Our Director Kwon who has never been surprised in his life

99
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,820
is letting my heart experience some fun.

100
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,520
When you sign the MOU  (Memorandum of Understanding) Taesung guarantees to provide

101
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,810
the basic infrastructure for the IT industry and an international city.

102
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,660
We will provide all integral parts.

103
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,010
Activist's Future Fund, Crown Prince Jeong Jo Jun

104
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,650
Acquires 29% Interest in Taesung High Tech Future Fund

105
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,830
In expectation of a management rights dispute. Taesung stock increases 7.44%

106
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,040
I left the High Tech task entirely up to you as the managing director

107
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,290
so what is happening?

108
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,650
A stockholder resolution? This is the first I have experienced.

109
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,130
Haesung Precision's Chairman Hwang secretly set up a fund and has been acquiring shares.

110
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,510
It happened out of nowhere so suddenly I couldn't respond.

111
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,950
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,930
They are demanding the selection of directors recommended by the Future Fund to improve management transparency.

113
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,170
They are demanding that I give up management rights.

114
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,490
I leaked information to the press as soon as the shareholder resolution was issued.

115
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,270
It's obvious they are seeking a profit due to the stock purchases to defend management rights.

116
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,370
I am asking you the reason, not the purpose.

117
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:53,090
Why are they coming after High Tech, out of all companies, now, out of all times?

118
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,230
That ... that is ...

119
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,380
"We demand the disclosure of the reason for the Miryeong Forest Resort,

120
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,610
its progress and all expenses."

121
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,420
This is not an attack by Chairman Hwang.

122
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,410
Find out who designed and proposed the fund.

123
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,190
I'm thirsty after we trained to exhaustion today.

124
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,670
Shall we all have beer?

125
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,620
I'm leaving work.

126
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,970
Is this what you would call the "out the door at 6"?
[Leaving the office right on time]

127
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,160
San Hyeok is acting strange today. Seriously strange.

128
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,350
Did you see him smile earlier today? I almost mistook him for Choi Chang.

129
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,290
It's giving me the goosebumps. Geez.

130
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,620
What are you doing here?

131
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,110
I'm waiting.

132
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,760
How do I look?

133
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,590
You're pretty.

134
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,440
100 Questions and Answers for Couples

135
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,560
100 Questions and Answers?

136
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,690
I told you I'd make an effort. But I've got to start somewhere to do that.

137
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,310
A very good attitude.

138
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,760
You must fill in yours too. Got it?

139
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,860
Let me see.

140
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,280
"What would you do if a good-looking man/woman asked for your number, saying you were their type?"

141
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,430
Will this question also help you 'make an effort'?

142
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:03,350
Of course it will. It's part of my effort to fully understand what kind of person Jeong Yeong Jae is.

143
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,320
Give an answer, hurry.

144
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,790
I'd treat them the same way Kang San Hyeok would treat another woman.

145
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
"What do I fear the most?"

146
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,190
Swimming, going underwater.

147
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,510
I've got another one, lightning and thunder. Gosh, they scare me so much.

148
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,950
You're not a child, seriously.

149
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,780
"The nickname you've saved my number under?"

150
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,810
Why, what is it?

151
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,290
- Why?
- Let me see.

152
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,640
It's nothing.

153
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,210
- Let me see
- No!

154
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,020
Hand it over— what did you save me as?

155
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,670
The mutt that...

156
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,590
The mutt that lives next door

157
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,420
The  mutt  that lives next door?

158
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,550
I was going to change that, I completely forgot to.

159

I did that when we weren't so fond of each other, that's why...

Then what about you, San Hyeok? What did you save me as?

161
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,310
- D-don't.. don't call it. Don't call it!
- Well, well.

162
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,710

Smurf? Pomp?

[Devil's Hell entered the chat.]

204
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,960
Today's quite a difficult day.

205
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,930
Try to write the 'patience' characters three times on the palm of your hand.

206
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,770
It'll do wonders.

207
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,230
I don't know how to write that character.

208
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,580
I suggest beans that are known to help suppress male hormones.

209
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,630
Fried beans, soy sauce beans, bean soup

210
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,220
Beans?

211
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,430
To make 10 go down to 9, I'll need to consume at least 5 sacks of beans.

212
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,470
I'd rather look at pictures of my ex-girlfriend.

213

Great!

I'm not having hard time...

The press is talking and we must hold the shareholders' meeting.

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,700
The one who's behind all of this.

229

Who the hell is Kang San Hyeok?

230
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,200
He's the director of investment at RLI who intercepted our Miryeong Forest project.

231
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,580
I can't even move forward on my project due to a mere director from an investment firm.

232
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,650
And you're telling me I'm even having to endure this humiliation right now?

233
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,140
Director, what have you been doing till now?

234
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,970
I'm sorry.

235
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,110
I had no idea Kang San Hyeok would dare do such a thing...

236
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:42,960
Director. I must get my father's approval to acquire the funds to secure the shares.

237
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,760
You're well aware what that means to me, Director.

238
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,680
My apologies, Managing Director.

239
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,620
I'll take care of it right away.

240

Director, you've always been on my side for the past 20 years,

and you're like my family.

242

How are things going with Director Kwon?

246
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,760
They've hurried to go and secure their shares.

247
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,990
However, I think they're lacking the funds as you anticipated.

248
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,150
Due to the anticipation that the values of the shares will go up, the shareholders aren't being forthright.

249
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,540
In any case, they're psychics.

250
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,850
How did you ever find out that the Crowned Prince was totally broke?

251
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,070
Can't you tell by how he plays in a corner store like High Tech to escape his father's nagging?

252
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,920
I'm sure he has to get any large amount of money from his father.

253
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,090
Like an elementary kid at his age.

254
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,900
What should we do with President Choi Jeong Mok?

255
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,180
We should purchase all the land from the townspeople while Kwon Joo Han is preoccupied.

256
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,480
But he's insisting that the real president meets with him.

257
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,320
Pull up all the info you've gathered on President Choi on the monitor.

258
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,970
Yes, sir.

259
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,830
Choi Jeong Mok, Male, 61 years old, Graduated from Miryeong Elementary School

260
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,950
That kid...

261
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,050
Was his last name Kim?

262
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,910
Or was it Kang?

263
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,960
You were out, sir.

264
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,200
What brings you here now?

265
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,870
Didn't you ask to meet me?

266
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,100
Ever since you joined the rescue team,

267
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,530
Naseong Development started to roam around this neighborhood wanting to purchase all the land.

268
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,590
People who want to build a resort in Miryeong.

269
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,810
CEO of Naseong. Park Hyeong Soo.

270
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,690
As expected of President Choi Jeong Mok.

271
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,350
The real owner of Naseong came to see you as you requested.

272
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,530
So, shall we get down and discuss our business?

273
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,390
If you intend to negotiate, I'm sure you wouldn't have asked to meet me.

274
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,240
Please tell me what you're asking for.

275
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,850
No, you should tell me your conditions.

276
00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:02,810
Well, if I hand over an agreement from the townspeople that they stand together,

277
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,200
what will you give me?

278
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,910
For your information, our neighborhood is different than any other neighborhoods.

279
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:15,710
We almost all perished in a mountain fire. Yet, we all survived it together.

280
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,870
We always discuss everything together and we act on them together.

281
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,360
Well, you'll be wasting your time no matter how you poke them around.

282
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,530
I know that.

283
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,520
Also that you're the leader of the group.

284
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,640
That's why...

285
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,010
I brought this here.

286
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,550
What's this?

287
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:46,740
With your influence in the area, I'm sure you would've become a local politician already.

288
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,220
But you couldn't.

289
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:55,740
Why? Because the fact that you only graduated from the elementary school held you back.

290
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,080
Of course, there is no educational requirement, but it must've been tough to get the party nomination.

291
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,620
I'm sure you were looked down upon.

292
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Money can't fix that. But I'll take care of that for you.

293
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,430
I will make you a district assemblyman.

294
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:25,370
After that, I'll support you to enter the national assembly.

295
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,630
This is fake for now. But you'll soon put on a real gold badge.

296
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,340
How could that be done? To the national assembly?

297
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,430
I'll bring you a recommendation letter from the governor right away.

298
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,070
I'm sure you know that Jo Kwang Pil would never do this for you.

299
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,750
To ensure your livestock works for you, you pull out their teeth.

300
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,610
You don't give them more teeth to bite you.

301
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,990
National Assembly

302
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,430
Choi Jeong Mok took the bait.

303
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,420
Of course. We just need a signature on rescue team relocation papers.

304
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,530
I need some time to work on that. So, we must stall with High Tech.

305
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,610
I'll make sure to tighten our grip on them during the shareholders' meeting. So, make sure to be prepared for that.

306
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,380
Yes, sir. I'm on my way to Naseong to prepare.

307
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,550
Did you find out what Managing Director Kwon and Director Jo are up to?

308
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,360
Any changes there?

309
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,990
Yes, not yet.

310
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,790
Naseong Development

311
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,260
Episode 22 will be starting shortly.
