1
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,360
Final Episode

2
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,370
S***load #3, don't step on that.

3
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:10,770
You shouldn't step on the name belonging to the ultimate beauty in the universe.

4
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,170
Director!

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,080
How dare you step on her name!

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,350
How dare you!

7
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,350
Hyungnim!

8
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,230
My underling made an error.

9
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,530
Please forgive me.

10
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,420
We should follow your orders, huh?

11
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,790
What are you doing?

12
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,710
Yes, sir!

13
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,470
Hyungnim.

14
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,410
Let go!

15
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,220
Hyungnim!

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,550
Let's go. Go!

17
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,390
All right then, have a nice time, you two.

18
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,340
You'll go to prison. I found all the evidence.

19
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,170
But your crimes are too grave to send you off to prison in one piece.

20
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,440
So, I spent some money.

21
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,680
The sin of thinking you're the only one with money.

22
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,680
The sin of provoking anger that calls for all types of payback, yet you have no idea why.

23
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,410
That's the reason...

24
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,880
you'll get beaten to a pulp.

25
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,570
You trashy a**hole, how can you just stand there and watch a child die in fire? How?

26
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,810
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

27
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,660
Someone who'll make you live in hell without dying.

28
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,790
I'm a superhero...

29
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,210
who'd make your life a living hell until you breathe your last.

30
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,820
San Yoo!

31
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,150
Oppa!

32
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,580
San Hyeok!

33
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,810
San Hyeok!

34
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,720
This is for my San Yoo.

35
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,760
How do you feel?

36
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,770
Please say a word!

37
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,160
How do you feel?

38
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,250
How do you feel right now?

39
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,110
One word, please.

40
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,530
What do you think about your charges?

41
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,680
I will say that I will cooperate with the Prosecutors' Office investigation.

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,940
I apologize for creating problems.

43
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,120
Please say something!

44
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,790
Taesung Group's managing director Kwon Joo Han who is facing charges of arson

45
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,220
to cover up the heavy metal contamination in the Miryeong Village
[ Taesung Group's Managing Director Kwon Joo Han Called to the Prosecutors' Office]

46
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,770
was summoned to the Prosecutors' Office.

47
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,430
Director Kwon Joo Han is denying all charges,

48
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,730
but the video clips of him ordering murder and arson

49
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,020
are being distributed on the internet quickly.

50
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,350
There is no choice but to cover the issue with a bigger issue, right?

51
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,220
Let's make a great night.

52
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,740
Taesung's Kwon Joo Han orders arson and murder, yet he denies everything

53
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,780
Managing Director Kwon liked to videotape things and keep them as mementos.

54
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,930
I'm ready.

55
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,360
There is no choice but to cover the issue with a bigger issue, right?

56
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,020
The Prosecutors' Office seized upon the fact that Taesung High Tech which Kwon Joo Han represents

57
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,930
put 300 billion won in company fund toward Miryeong Mountain development project.

58
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,490
They're conducting search and seizure on Taesung High Tech.

59
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,960
If the charges are proven, Director Kwon Joo Han will be charged with arson,

60
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,720
ordering murder, and embezzlement additionally.

61
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,020
The result of his upcoming first trial on the 5th

62
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,400
is expected to be unfavorable for him.

63
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,410
Kang San Hyeok buried Soon Ae and his sister in the Miryeong Forest in their remembrance.

64
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,600
Jeong Soon Ae, Kang San Yoo's grave

65
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,460
Here he comes!

66
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,890
Ask for forgiveness, evil corporation Taesung!

67
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,560
Case number 2019 Gohap 1775.

68
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,080
We'll commence the trial.

69
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,580
Defense

70
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,140
Witness
At the arson location where Kwon Joon Han started the fire 25 years ago,

71
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,120
I witnessed Kwon Joo Han.

72
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,810
And due to that fire, I lost my sister.

73
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:51,730
And most recently, I almost lost my life from the fire Kwon Joo Han started.

74
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,590
To cover up the contamination caused by the excavation, I clearly state that

75
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:02,500
all this began from the decisions made by Managing Director Kwon Joo Han of Taesung Group.

76
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,990
This is the helicopter flight record from the day of the fire 25 years ago.

77
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,630
Helicopter flight journal

78
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,410
The pilot who quit the rescue team

79
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,320
and started working for a private sector sent me this.

80
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,780
As you can see, Kwon Joo Han flew from Seoul to Miryeong in an helicopter at that hour.

81
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,620
When the forest fire was at its peak, Kwon Joo Han was there.

82
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,130
I drank underground water for a long time.

83
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,690
One day, I started having paralysis in my leg all of a sudden.

84
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,410
He said he'd pay us more if we cremated the body without telling anyone.

85
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,300
I drank the water from the mountain longer than any other families in the area.

86
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,830
Now, I can't use my legs.

87
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,550
Kwon Joo Han told me to do everything.

88
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,460
I only followed his orders.

89
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,550
To get what he wanted, Kang San Hyeok didn't hesitate to blackmail. Of course, he bribed.

90
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,260
Could you believe the words and the evidence such a person submitted?

91
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,600
I never received any types of orders from Managing Director Kwon Joo Han regarding Miryeong Village.

92
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,660
It's not true.

93
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,020
Managing Director Kwon Joon Han never ordered such a thing.

94
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,210
Your Honor, I bring in my last witness.

95
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,520
I don't have many days left to live out.

96
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,710
I came here because I felt that I had to ask for forgiveness before I die.

97
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,120
To bid farewell to my son without shame,

98
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,140
I thought I had to say these words.

99
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,520
25 years ago...

100
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,620
I started that forest fire on Miryeong Mountain.

101
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,730
- Oh, my world...
- Even if I had ten mouths to speak...

102
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,430
I have no words.
Judge

103
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:26,100
I'll receive my punishment in due time. However, I'll reveal the truth from that day.

104
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Witness, is the person who ordered you to start the fire in this room?

105
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,430
Objection, Your Honor!

106
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,130
Defense, be quiet.

107
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,350
Continue, Witness.

108
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,140
Well, this guy, Taesung Group Managing Director Kwon Joo Han

109
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,990
paid me to start the fire.

110
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,470
What nonsense is this!

111
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,590
I've worked with trees all my life.

112
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:04,580
I did all the carpentry work in his office.

113
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:14,430
Prosecutor, please show what's in the blueprint that I gave you.

114
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,490
Take a picture of this.

115
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,600
Where the star mark is.

116
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,670
Taesung High Tech, Taesung Group...

117
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,590
1994 Miryeong Special Rescue Team

118
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,010
It's not clear...

119
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,140
Nice.

120
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,800
Oh, my God!

121
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:12,080
You have to capture stuff like this. A village that's about to disappear and tragic children.

122
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Isn't this meaningful?

123
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,620
You deserve to die!

124
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,910
Please stay calm!

125
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,340
Everyone, calm down!

126
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,830
Please sit down!

127
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,360
Have a seat!

128
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,790
Ask for forgiveness, Kwon Joo Han! / Evil corporation, Taesung Group!

129
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,510
I'm sure you'll get out with the power you have. Then, I'll put you back there again.

130
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,410
If you get out again, I'll find something else to put you behind bars.

131
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,550
If you get out again then, I'll put you back there again.

132
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:09,540
The power of money. I have enough to drag you to hell.

133
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,060
So try it.

134
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,910
I'll go only after you my whole life.

135
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,800
Kwon Joo Han.

136
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,750
San Hyeok should get some rest after going through such an ordeal.

137
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,290
He's going to report to Team Leader Bong the trial results

138
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,100
and discuss the underground contamination beneath the rescue team headquarters.

139
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,750
But is it okay for you to be here and not be at the fire school?

140
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,080
- Do you want some water?
- Yeah, sure.

141
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,980
Here you go.

142
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:22,390
I had a question all my life.

143
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:32,070
Your parents who bore you and raised you so well until you were nine years old...

144
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,890
Did they really try to harm you?

145
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,920
Why do you bring that up out of the blue?

146
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:51,310
Dr. Yoo from the NIS came to give a special lecture at my fire school and spoke of the incident.

147
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:57,660
Since I adopted you after that incident, he had just put it away.

148
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,410
About your birth parents.

149
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,970
Don't tell me. I don't want to hear it.

150
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,660
He said your parents were trying to save you.

151
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,620
Retrace your memory carefully.

152
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,530
When I went to rescue you,

153
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,950
you were still breathing in the back seat in the spot where the water didn't fill up, right?

154
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,490
These are crime scene photos that Dr. Yoo gave me.

155
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,920
Here, look at it carefully.

156
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,450
The window of the front seat is open this much.

157
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,140
But if the window was open from the start,

158
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,530
you couldn't have survived by the time I got there to rescue you.

159
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,860
The water would've filled up inside the car.

160
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,330
That means the window opened later.

161
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,590
Then who do you think opened it?

162
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,220
No...

163
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,950
You're saying this because you don't know.

164
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,620
I'm sure... I'm sure they tried to...

165
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,250
This is a photo of your parents' palms.

166
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:38,030
The straight line that was indented while opening the car window.

167
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,800
Both of them had that.

168
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,550
When you settle down a bit, take a look.

169
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,250
They did throw themselves into the water to die together.

170
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,010
But seeing their beloved daughter die

171
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,560
made them realize what they were doing.

172
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,650
So they opened up the window with all their might in order to save you

173
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,790
and pulled you into the water to push you out through the window.

174
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,090
Yeong Jae, they made a wrong momentary choice,

175
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,830
but they tried to save you.

176
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,190
No...

177
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,250
You don't know, Dad.

178
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,920
I don't know.

179
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,080
Yeong Jae.

180
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,510
Yeong Jae.

181
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,310
Even if that may be true, I can't forgive them.

182
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,540
I can't forgive you as your daughter Ji Soo.

183
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,290
But as Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae, I want to say something.

184
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,360
Mom. Dad.

185
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:32,810
In the next world, I'll be your mom to both of you.

186
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,470
As a mom, no matter what hardship I may face,

187
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,050
I'll never give up and stay by your side.

188
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,630
If one door closes, another one opens.

189
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,770
As long as I endure and withstand, there's another door that's waiting to open for me.

190
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,980
I'll show you through my life.

191
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,590
Yes, Father. Did Yeong Jae go somewhere?

192
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes.

193
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,270
Yes.

194
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,220

♬ Always ♬

♬ Always ♬

205
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,890
If you curl up and stay still, you'll float slowly.

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,390
♬ the memories of being around you. ♬

207
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,480
Then you become a leaf.

208
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,390
You spread out your body as if to say, "hooray."

I rescued myself.

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,320
Thanks to you.

227
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,690
Yes. Jeong Yeong Jae is like that.

228
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,060
♬ Just stay there and wait for me ♬

229
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,970
That's how you'll be.

230
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,240
Now, you rescue me.

231
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,010
♬ On a bright day, hug me, dear ♬

232
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,070
I love you.

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,560
I love you too.
♬ Because I will love you ♬

♬ Always ♬

240
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,280
- Hurry up and come!
- Hey.

241
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,450
You try to be sick and see if you can walk as fast as I'm walking.

242
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,300
I know you're doing that because you don't want to go in.

243
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,350
You've tried all kinds of great therapies

244
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,200
that your cancer didn't spread and you're in great condition.

245
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,420
Hurry up and let's go, Dad-in-law.

246
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,490
Dad-in-law? Not yet.

247
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,820
I didn't approve of you yet. And you call me Dad-in-law out in the open already.

248
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,790
Yes, yes, my Dad-in-law is coming.

249
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,230
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey!

250
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,970
Mr. Choi Jeong Mok is walking.

251
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,620
How is the graduate school going?

252
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,100
I'm dying here.

253
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,850
Endure through it.

254
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,270
You said you'd study psychological counseling and cure all our trauma.

255
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,240
You were so confident saying that.

256
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,040
If Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae was going to do this, I didn't have to enroll in a graduate school.

257
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,250
- That guy...
- Hey...

258
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,150
What's with him?

259
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,890
That's also a type of trauma. So, you should cure him, Hyungnim.

260
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,740
That's your major.

261
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,010
Geez...

262
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,890
Sanyoo Hospital and Miryeong Forest / Groundbreaking Ceremony for Trauma Center

263
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:36,400
Here is Dr. Park Jin Man who has been appointed to be the director of Sanyoo Hospital.

264
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,970
And he donated his entire assets for Miryeong Forest and environmental restoration for the rescue team.

265
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,590
Here is Mr. Choi Jeong Mok of Miryeong Forestry.

266
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,040
Now, for Miryeong area residents' and 911 special rescue team's

267
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,260
illnesses and trauma treatments, he established Sanyoo Foundation and Sanyoo Hospital.

268
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,610
Here is team member Kang San Hyeok.

269
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,080
♬ Oh at the sound of a whistle ♬

270
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,300
♬ I hum without realizing it ♬

271
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,060
♬ Drunk on a cup of coffee ♬

272
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,600
♬ I also don't realize ♬

273
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,210
How is a psychiatry internship going for you?

274
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,150
Of course. Being colleagues with much younger juniors

275
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,900
makes me feel so young. It's nice.

276
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,170
I'm so happy that I get to study what I wanted to study.

277
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:28,740
Great. I'm happy as long as you're happy.

278
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,480
♬ We will sit and face each other blankly ♬

279
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,860
You only get to see me on weekends. You're still happy when you don't get to see me?

280
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,720
♬ We can fall in love ♬

281
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,820
♬ Even doing nothing at all I feel good ♬

282
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,090
♬ Anytime with you ♬

283
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,250
♬ That is how I want just you ♬

284
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,880
What a pervert.

285
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,300
Come here.

286
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,290
Come.

287
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,050
♬ Only you in my heart ♬

288
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm kidding.

289
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,250
I think you mean it.

290
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,120
- Come here!
- Don't come.

291
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,630
I'm going to get you!

292
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:10,390
♬ Only you in my heart ♬

293
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,560
♬ Wu - - Ah - ♬

294
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,270

♬ I try saying anything. ♬

301

♬ Rather than what you want ♬

302
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:54,420
♬ Listen to the answer I've prepared ♬

303
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,780
♬ By the time the sun sets ♬

304
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,790
♬ We will sit and face each other blankly ♬

305
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,790
♬ We can fall in love ♬
