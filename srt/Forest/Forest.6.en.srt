1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,880
It belongs to the head of Gangwon Hospital

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,120
Use the furniture and whatever and be comfortable.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,200
He didn't want to rent the place out, but he gave in when I mentioned that you're an special rescue crew.

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,110
The hospital director built this house to live with his son and daughter-in-law.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,510
It's one house but it is divided into two houses.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,990
Someone is living on the left so be sure to lock the door.

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,580
It's been a while since I've seen her like that.

8
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,330
The rude woman, she hasn't ever said hello to us.

9
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,440
What are you going to do if you receive her greetings?

10
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,550
- She works at Miryeong Hospital!
- Does she?!

11
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,640
What? Miryeong Hospital?

12
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,130
It's obvious there is no gap...

13
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Ah I'm hungry.

14
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,860
I don't want to eat them anymore...

15
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,150
Food delivery won't do either.

16
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,750
♬ Where are you anyway? ♬

17
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,720
♬ is this the way you make me fall apart ♬

18
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,380
♬ fall apart ♬

19
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,640
♬ I'm torn apart ♬

20
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,180
♬ I'm torn apart ♬

21
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,220
♬ I'm torn apart ♬

22
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,650
♬ I'm torn apart ♬

23
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,980
♬ is this the way you make me fall apart ♬

24
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,610
- What is this?
- What is this?!

25
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,330
So, this is company housing? This place?

26
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,950
How did you get in here?

27
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,180
Did you not know that a woman lives alone here?

28
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,680
I didn't know. If I knew, you think I would enter?

29
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,820
Also, this isn't a house a woman lives alone in. There is two separate individual homes.

30
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,500
In any case, I have to work at Miryeong Hospital. So, you move out.

31
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,560
What nonsense are you saying? Don't you know I am part of the special rescue team?

32
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,480
So, why are you? It doesn't even suit you. Why do I have to run into you here?

33
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,770
First, let's think about this with some basic rules in place here.

34
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,310
Don't come out on the terrace in your underwear.

35
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,070
Ah... for the first time in my life, I wanted to buy eyes that didn't see that...

36
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,280
Ha, who is speaking nonsense! Can you just walk around naked like that? Are you serious?

37
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,810
Second, never open that door there

38
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,730
I'll lock the door anyway. Even if there is something bothering you, if you want to say anything, come to the front door.

39
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,330
What I want to say

40
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,970
thirdly. Is that speaker's sound.

41
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,280
How does a person have a brain structure that pursues such loud music and bad gestures?

42
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,670
Whatever noise you make, it should not enter that side.

43
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,000
Never.

44
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
You should watch out, Kang San Hyeok. What a boring person, along with your music...

45
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,610
Never wanted to buy new eyes, what are you--

46
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,890
Go to sleep!!

47
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,600
My fortune said I'd meet an enemy from my previous life. It must be about that moron.

48
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,610
Boring?!

49
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,370
How could he show up over and over wherever I go! Hospital Director, seriously...

50
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,880
What? Bad gestures?

51
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,330
I mean, coming here to play and getting some vegetables,

52
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,170
There is a penalty? What do you mean penalty?!

53
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,360
So I want you to open your backpack to see if there is some or none.

54
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,400
If you show me, that will be it.

55
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,300
Oh, are you going to do this to the neighborhood?

56
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,260
Young woman, Is this going to be a civil complaint?

57
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,780
It is not young woman but enforcement officer.

58
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,470
You're not a resident of Miryeong.

59
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,900
Villagers pick vegetables from their own local forests and never use a sickle.

60
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,450
Because the plants that have been cut die off like that.

61
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,300
If what I said is wrong, open your bag and prove it.

62
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,460
Open up, quickly.

63
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,550
What the young woman said I can't do.

64
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,830
- You want to give it a try, huh?
- Perfect...

65
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,170
Put that down.

66
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,010
You shouldn't use a weapon against a woman. Then that is a person who behaves very crudely.

67
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,560
It is not woman, but officer. I am sorry, sir, but please stay out of this.

68
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,070
- What?!

69
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,060
Sir, you illegally harvested forest products from a provincial forest.

70
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,260
and used weapons to interfere with the efforts of an officer enforcing the law.

71
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,530
- What is this?
- What is doing on?

72
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,740
I'm arresting you both on the spot!

73
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,350
What

74
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,890
You have the right to remain silent. What you say can and will be used against you in court.

75
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,980
You have the right to an attorney

76
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,220
What is this?!

77
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,350
Quickly! Why aren't you untying us?

78
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,030
You are right, I will not untie you.

79
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,760
If you were to use a weapon against not only a woman but a person, you would be a crude person.

80
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
- Let's go.
- Look over here...

81
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,140
Hey, hey!

82
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,790
Why are you dragging us?

83
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,100
Please come.

84
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,810
Why can't you be flexible?

85
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,230
Officer! Officer?

86
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,220
All right, hop in.

87
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,490
Just talk to us...

88
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,690
It's too small in here.

89
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,940
The car is too small, huh?

90
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,900
Now I close the door!
Use words, just words ...!

91
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,270
No, no...

92
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,180
Please hear us out.

93
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,880
Give me money!

94
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,460
Omg, you startled me. Money? What money?

95
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,090
Man, I asked you to take care of the assemblymen yesterday.

96
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,750
I gave you the advance bonus, yet you didn't even go and took off.

97
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,820
At my age, because of you... I had to take them out and all. Do you know how much I suffered?

98
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,700
- Give it back, man!
- Come on...

99
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,290
Calm down, Hyungnim. Getting upset is terrible for your prostate.

100
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,730
How happy would you be even if you get the money yet damage your prostate?

101
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,320
This child... Calling his father older brother?!

102
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,340
- Give it to me.
- Hey!

103
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,090
I got an emergency call to report. What was I to do, Hyungnim?

104
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,630
How can you keep mentioning money in the face of emergency dispatch, the noble act of protecting citizens?

105
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,580
It makes you look bad.

106
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,290
That's right, you punk. Just think about inheriting your father's assets.

107
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,870
And you didn't listen. Why did you join them? I don't need you.

108
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,720
Give me the money!

109
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
Hurry!

110
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,220
I know that you know that I don't have it. If someone saw you doing this for the first time ...

111
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,360
I think you're so freaking cute.

112
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,650
Okay. Okay! I'll pay you with my body. Catch me next time, Hyungnim.

113
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,030
Who is it?

114
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,670
Will you?

115
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,990
Do your best this time.

116
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:10,190
A new person came to the Miryeong-gun office, a level 7 civil servant.

117
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,440
Do your best to convince that person to join our family.

118
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,420
And...don't waste your money.

119
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,750
Look, man! Do you think money grows on trees, punk?

120
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,220
I understand, I understand.

121
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,020
I said not to rinse off the wet tissue. Wet tissues are disposable.

122
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,260
If you do it like this, then I have no other choice.

123
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,240
Let's do in, Hyungnim!

124
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,730
Oh my god.... that's my boy but....

125
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,960
But you are such a crazy man!

126
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,670
You are!

127
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,010
Choi Jeong Mok

128
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,730
Certificate of Completion

129
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,890
Choi Jeong Mok

130
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,360
What Oh Bo Mi. Are you not getting off work?

131
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,950
Team Leader, who is this person?

132
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,760
I mean, he has been a forest fire watcher for 25 years.

133
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,930
Chairman of the Prevention of Forest Blight Committe , Chairman of the Lumber Committee,

134
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,250
the head of the Village Protection Association

135
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,570
There's no document without his name in connection with our county office.

136
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,350
This is a total monopoly.

137
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,700
Who is this? Employee Choi Jeong Mok from Miryeong Forest?

138
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,560
Team Leader?

139
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,140
Are you leaving?

140
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,100
He's annoying me so much....

141
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,680
I'm home alone, and I have to be fully clothed. What is this?

142
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,850
Professor of Surgery

143
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,020
Yes, Professor.

144
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,380
Yeah, well, I am getting by...

145
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,980
Excuse me?!

146
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,850
Mountain Management Act.

147
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,970
Golden mountain thrush...

148
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,860
How do I recognize it...?

149
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,770
You know there's a publishing ceremony for the foundation's chairman's autobiography, right?

150
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,130
It's a day when everyone in the hospital gets together, so come and see me.

151
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,880
You have to let others know that you are there if you want to come back to Seoul soon.

152
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,910
Big news! Dr. Cha Jin Soo is getting married!

153
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,030
To our foundation's niece.

154
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:41,130
I heard they are going to make a formal announcement at the publishing ceremony tomorrow. Isn't that amazing?

155
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:46,190
Only if I didn't have to work the night shift tomorrow night, I'd go and yell out, "Cha Jin Woo is my man!" and make a scene.

156
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,710
Scops owl...

157
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,030
It isn't possible.

158
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,260
A bush warbler.

159
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,120
It's going well in the forest?

160
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,780
It is going smoothly according to the plan.

161
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,340
I wanted to talk to you about it, but I wanted to see you this weekend.

162
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,390
The right to develop a ski resort will be an obvious benefit and we need to find the right businesses hidden in it.

163
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,000
Chairman, I need your consent.

164
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,730
Such as...?

165
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,140
I'm going to start with a facilitating agency.

166
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,950
It's a for-profit business where we can utilize the investments as we see fit, under the guise of managing the overall development process.

167
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,600
Please give me 50% stake in this facilitating agency and other related subsidiaries.

168
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,780
If there are profits to be made, I'll not miss any opportunities to seek out

169
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,220
and bring them to you.

170
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,300
That's very like you... I don't even to think about it.

171
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,690
Do as you want to then.

172
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,830
If you can't relocate the special rescue team, have you thought of any alternative?

173
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,150
Have you ever seen me take a step without alternatives?

174
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,080
If it doesn't work... I have to make it happen.

175
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,070
That's why I'm there, the special rescue team.

176
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

177
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,630
It's been a long time.

178
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,520
- Have you been well?
- Yes, I have been doing well.

179
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,530
You look great.

180
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,780
Oh, thank you.

181
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,590
- Then... see you inside...
- Yes, go on ahead.

182
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,500
I guess she's doing well after getting kicked out.

183
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,750
Hey, isn't she on the Iron Man level? She's got such a thick skin.

184
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,100
Executive Director Yoo Min Sik Publishing Party

185
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,170
Congratulations. I look forward to your speech.

186
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,240
- Hello, Director.
- Congratulations!

187
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,590
Professor Park, long time no see.

188
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,990
- You're doing well, right?
- Of course.

189
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,700
- Are you well?
- Yes.

190
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,720
- Professor Kim...
- Congratulations.

191
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,470
Nice to meet you.

192
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,470
Professor.

193
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,540
- Oh, you came!
- Yes, Have you been well.
- Of course.

194
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,780
W-wait a moment.

195
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:07,350
Director, this is the surgeon, Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae, who is now at the Gangwon branch.

196
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,020
Hello, Hospital Director.

197
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,710
Its been a while, Ms. Jeong. How is branch life treating you?

198
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,620
Yes, well...

199
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,070
She's at a small branch where they perform surgeries.

200
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,580
- Hello, Director.
- Oh welcome.

201
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,310
Welcome.

202
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,420
Chief Oh.

203
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,080
I get to see you here.

204
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,860
How have you been?

205
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,740
Please don't call me in front of people again. I will not come next time.

206
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,080
I was very worried...

207
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,680
I know I'm such a bastard...I know it well.. but...

208
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,490
Even then, I have been so worried about that I felt like dying.

209
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,620
Wondering how things are there. Wondering if you're surviving on cup ramen... or if you're scared at night...

210
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,230
Every moment of every day was painful. Because I am thinking about you.

211
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,710
You really deserve to die, don't you?

212
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,680
When you were with me, you thought of that woman. When you were with her, you thought of me.

213
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,560
That's what they call, "affair" or "ethically wrong." But meaning "wrong," Ryoon meaning "ethically." Not humane!

214
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,560
Go. I don't want to talk to you anymore...

215
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,020
Don't get me wrong. I'm not on your scale.

216
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,820
A woman who already has a fortune that many would expect to work for a lifetime to earn.

217
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,990
When you choose that woman, I was no longer on your level.

218
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,060
So if you like to compare things, you should do it alone.

219
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,650
I mean, never touch my body again. Alright?

220
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,520
If you touch me one more time, I don't know what I'll do to you.

221
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
What if I regret it?

222
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,820
What if it's hell to live without you?

223
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,900
The time we spent together... What if I said I miss those times more as days go by?

224
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,740
I think I'm going to experience hell ahead of me anyway.

225
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,920
Because you say a lot of nonsense, you will be going to hell.

226
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,220
Hello, I am from Miyeong Hospital--

227
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,550
Here's our niece's husband to be, Dr. Cha Jin-woo

228
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,380
Congratulations!

229
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,430
Congratulations!

230
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,620
- Really.
- They look so good together.

231
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,400
Congratulations, Chairman!

232
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,720
Oh, Director Kang! Welcome.

233
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,950
Best VVIP in our foundation and hospital!

234
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:06,140
Yes, sir. Here is a surgeon who has been dispatched to a remote rural hospital called Miryeong Hospital and is doing medical service.

235
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,610
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae.

236
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,970
With me, we are living in one house.

237
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,150
What? Did you get married?

238
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,120
Now I have to.

239
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,490
I'm going to do it.

240
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,600
You crazy? What the heck?

241
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,070
Oh, congratulations, Branch Manager Kang.

242
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,030
Congratulations, Branch Manager Kang.

243
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:38,820
I can't say I'm not glad you're paired up with our doctor.

244
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,930
As I was saying, I'm here with Kang San Hyeok, head of R.L.I.

245
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:48,090
She's the fiancee.

246
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,300
She's a surgeon at our hospital.

247
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,020
- No, I...
- This is Doctor Jeong Yeong Jae.

248
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,590
Please take care of our Doctor Jeong.

249
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,640
She's currently working at Miryeong Hospital.

250
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,410
It's lacking a surgery facility.

251
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,680
Although she's a surgeon.

252
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,840
Anyway, we are going to go the same house, are you just leaving?

253
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,270
Have you gone crazy? What are you doing? She's a fiancée, you know!

254
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,860
What am I supposed to do if they're mistaken?

255
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,770
We do live in the same house. We are going to get married.

256
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,540
What?

257
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,650
Do you prefer the single life? You are planning to marry.

258
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,960
Each of us. Separately, let's do it.

259
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,770
Are you kidding me? Is everything funny because it's someone else's business?

260
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:51,100
Don't you ever think about what's going to happen to me in the hospital?

261
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,410
Are you like this because of that man?

262
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,040
I'm afraid that hell destined man might misunderstand. Is that what you're afraid of?

263
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,120
Otherwise, I don't understand how angry you are.

264
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,950
You really deserve to die, don't you?

265
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:33,380
When you were with me, you thought of that woman. When you were with her, you thought of me. It's called an affair.

266
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,180
- Yeong Jae.
- Don't get me wrong. I'm not on your scale.

267
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,190
A woman who already has a fortune that many would expect to work for a lifetime to earn.

268
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,090
When you choose that woman, I was no longer on your level.

269
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,080
What the hell happened to her?

270
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:16,410
She wouldn't be waiting... Kang wouldn't do such a thing...

271
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,800
Go to sleep.

272
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,110
Go to sleep.

273
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,930
Where have you been?

274
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,100
Why are you embarrassing me in front of people!!!

275
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,580
What kind of romance movie are you filming? You showed up in front of my ex-boyfriend who cheated on me?

276
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,090
You don't think people didn't know?!

277
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,700
Yeah, they didn't know.

278
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,570
Didn't you see how people reacted differently?

279
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,170
People are desperate for connections. Why can't you use me when you've got me right next to you?

280
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,180
I'm doing everything I can to achieve my goals, so why don't you just let me down?

281
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,120
Then how are different from him?

282
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,330
He hitches a ride for free on a train someone else built! It means I'm no different from him!

283
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,400
At least, he'll get to live with the owner of the train.

284
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,850
Why should I take advantage of you for?

285
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,360
You should also live with a train owner.

286
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,660
In your eyes, I am that amusing?

287
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,620
o you want me to say anything in this situation?

288
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,640
I mean, don't take it seriously.

289
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,570
It's better for you to laugh lightly.

290
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,460
I'm glad it's easy to buy things.

291
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:08,650
There's nothing heavy about having so much.

292
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,350
Everything's funny.

293
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,900
You will never know.

294
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:26,550
The woman who took my man. No matter how much I try, I could never get ahead of that woman.

295
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,700
The feeling of my hands trembling....

296
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,570
Maybe she didn't take away your man but she took away trash from you.

297
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,570
Now I understand.

298
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,930
I can't go back to Seoul.

299
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,360
I saw her yesterday and knew why I had to face this punishment.

300
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,210
Should we date? There isn't anything do anyway ...

301
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,020
I think I've done several wrong things.

302
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,270
You'll have to take responsibility this time.

303
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,150
♬ The dizzying circumstances in front of me ♬

304
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,630
♬ All the different stories ♬

305
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,070
♬ I listen, at times without breathing ♬

306
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,510
♬ I come closer to you ♬

307
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,910
♬ The hope I see far away ♬

308
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,460
♬ There are no sweet words of encouragement ♬

309
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,930
♬ They are scattered apart ♬

310
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,550
♬ They are fading away ♬

311

Kiddo!

What is your relationship to her?

315
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,750
We're dating.

316
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,000
A house call?

317
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,190
At this rate, no one will come to use no matter how long we wait.

318
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,290
I think it's about time you get rid of such a dirty habit.

319
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,930
I'm low class?

320
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,330
Let's do the rescue point analysis today.

321
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,990
To familiarize ourselves with rescue points, we must enter the prohibited area.

322
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,940
It's tough to create something that's nonexistent. To get rid of something that exists already is pretty simple.
