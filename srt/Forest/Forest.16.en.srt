Episode 16
Jeong Yeong Jae.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,810
Jeong Yeong Jae.

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,580
What is it?

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,810
It's a short circuit. The electricity cut out.

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,870
What?!

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,750
It's perfectly fine here, but why is over there...

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,950
What are you doing?

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,010
I am looking for it. Where is it coming from?

9
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,300
But, it's late. Will you be able to find it?

10
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,040
Without any short tester?

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,230
When I see it, I will know.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,660
Why are you dressed like that at home?

13
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,330
Is this a water park or something? Should I get you a flamingo tube?

14
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,560
Why are you so annoyed? It's because I am in my own home.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,620
It's late so hurry up and go. I have a lot of work to do.

16
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,100
I found the short circuit. My place isn't the problem. Your place is.

17
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,010
What the heck? You have electricity.

18
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,670
I turned it off before.

19
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,550
I'll go back to my room and sleep. I'll just shut off the power.

20
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,250
You can't. It's dangerous.

21
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,560
Before I call the electrician tomorrow for inspection to find out the problem,

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,550
stay here.

23
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,670
You should put away useless delusions such as me wanting to cuddle with you on this sofa.

24
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,480
I am wondering about a lot, though.

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,770
Throughout your place and mine, this spot is the only spot where I did a thorough inspection.

26
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,850
Don't mind me while you study. I will drink some wine and go to sleep after.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Why a short circuit out of the blue?

28
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,290
But you know... haven't you had enough to drink?

29
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,400
The smell of alcohol.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,210
Let's say this is for falling asleep fast.

31
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,750
Should I say I'm carrying Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae on my back?

32
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,220
How did it come to be that way?

33
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,890
Did you recall that cliff?

34
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,380
No. I wouldn't recall since it wasn't my memory to begin with.

35
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,190
It's not your memory? Then the drawing on that ttakji...

36
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,350
I found it.

37
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,840
It's not mine.

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,060
My phantom pain came on because of the feeling that the fire had occurred there. But it has nothing to do with me.

39
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,730
All right. If you say no, it's not.

40
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,340
It's your memory after all, right?

41
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,610
What are you doing? Aren't you studying?

42
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,160
Since I haven't studied in so long, it's difficult.

43
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,880
There's this patient at the hospital.

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,460
But he's not getting better at all.

45
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,340
I don't think it's his physical body, but a trauma issue.

46
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,870
There's nothing I can do to help since it's not my specialty.

47
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,380
Is it your hobby to take on a burden you can't handle?

48
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,290
Shouldn't you know that ignoring is also a talent by now?

49
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,960
Who knows?

50
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,300
Should I say it's somewhat of a camaraderie?

51
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,340
You've heard of the term, "inner child," right?

52
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:19,660
A child who is hunched up inside your mind at the moment of getting hurt, at that age.

53
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,500
If similar hurtful situations occur,

54
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,460
the child pops out of you and expresses his sadness and anger.

55
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,200
Doesn't everyone live with an inner child like that in their hearts?

56
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,490
Perhaps that's why, I keep thinking about him.

57
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,820
That patient.

58
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,910
The ten-year-old child who took away your memory.

59
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,690
Don't you wonder what he wants to say?

60
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,650
There is nothing to talk about.

61
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,150
That ten-year-old child doesn't even exist.

62
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,390
I'm curious about that child who doesn't exist.

63
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,480
I started getting curious about everything regarding Kang San Hyeok.

64
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,320
What is going on? It's raining!

65
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,390
What kind of unnecessarily scientific yet flimsy house is this?

66
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,840
Oh, my gosh. This rain...

67
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,530
Seoul Myeongseong University Hospital HTP Screening
Kang San Hyeok

68
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,880
Kang San Hyeok, this is...

69
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,170
Why are you looking at this?

70
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,660
How did you get the psychological drawing I did at the Myeongseong University Hospital...

71
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,710
I didn't know my ID at the Psychology department was still valid.

72
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,720
I was able to view it.

73
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,350
So why are you viewing my test results?

74
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,500
Is this what you were studying today?

75
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,720
That patient is me?

76
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,060
Don't be curious about anything and just listen to me.

77
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,770
- I was just--
- You were just doing what?

78
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,700
Did you want to research me?

79
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,690
Did you want to collect data on a fragile man who said his arm is burning?

80
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,470
Is that why you threw bait at me talking about the "inner child" and whatnot in so many words?

81
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,950
Kang San Hyeok.

82
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,630
Do you know me? Are you some kind of relationship with me?

83
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,480
Why? Why? Why didn't you just ask?

84
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,780
You looked at my defenseless nakedness.

85
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,590
Without my permission.

86
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,760
I am sorry. That was wrong of me.

87
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,640
- But...
- But you!

88
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,830
I'm just a patient.

89
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,130
As you said, from the first time you met me up until now,

90
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:11,030
Jeong Yeong Jae saw me as a patient she needs to protect.

91
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:17,690
The feeling you have toward me. That's actually what it is.

92
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,810
What? Isn't it?

93
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,700
So tell me.

94
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,160
The Yeong Jae who is with me tonight, the Yeong Jae in front of me right now.

95
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,150
Are you a doctor or a woman?

96
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,710
What do you want me to be?

97
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,740
I don't need them both.

98
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,950
The townspeople are thrilled about the plan to develop Miryeong Forest

99
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,120
Gangwon-do Governor believes in the success of Miryeong Development Project

100
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,460
Miryeong Forest development brings about the creation of tens and thousands of new jobs

101
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,840
The springtime has come to Miryeong finally! / Governor, you're awesome! / We've been waiting for the development of Miryeong for a long time.

102
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
The highly anticipated biggest resort in Asia, / Cool Miryeong, growing into a global location.

103
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,210
Miryeong is with the people of Miryeong!

104
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,070
This should be enough of a reason.

105
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,200
The transfer of rescue team headquarters will be possible based on your files as well.

106
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,280
I'll push forward the permit for Miryeong Forest development starting today.

107
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,390
How is it going with Director Jo?

108
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,480
He must've gotten scared after getting caught with the hidden camera. There's not much movement there.

109
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,750
They'll enjoy the jail food for sure.

110
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,240
Isn't something strange though?

111
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,470
The news has been featured all over the place and things are moving right along. But it's too quiet.

112
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,990
They were so persistent coming after us.

113
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:37,350
They must be in hiding already realizing it's game over. What could Director Jo do at this point?

114
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,160
Miryeong Forest is in the palm of our hands.

115
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,830
Should I prepare for your return to Seoul?

116
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,840
You don't need to remain at the rescue team any longer.

117
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,460
You've been gone too long.

118
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,560
Director.

119
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,080
Yeah. I should go back.

120
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,760
- Prepare right away.
- Got it.

121
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,890
Drawing the roof lines repeatedly signifies fear or anxiety.

122
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,280
Several of large knots on the tree trunk.

123
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,560
The branches are bent terribly which signifies big wounds.

124
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,860
The fruits are falling off the tree. Guilty conscience.

125
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,250
The body is frontal, but the face shows the profile. Avoidance.

126
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,700
He's hiding his arms behind his back.

127
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,750
Guilty conscience.

128
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,200
Excuse me? A conference?

129
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,090
It's a conference that happens occasionally. This time, the theme is medically alienated regions.

130
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,250
We're accepting report results and improvement suggestions.

131
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,250
Since you're at Miryeong Hospital, why don't you do a presentation on your treatment experiences with the villagers?

132
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,170
But shouldn't Dr. Park Jin Man do that?

133
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,950
Dr. Park will prepare something on his own.

134
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,330
I'm sure he'll submit the same thing as he's always done anyway.

135
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,390
Nothing is firm yet. So, write up some paper, Dr. Jeong.

136
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,850
But I don't have much to present...

137
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,010
You must have some memorable case studies on the villagers.

138
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:36,620
What you saw and learned in Miryeong. I'm getting curious, too.

139
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,150
Resignation Letter

140
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,690
What could Director Jo do at this point?

141
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,060
Miryeong Forest is in the palm of our hands.

142
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,360
I'll cut to the chase. What should I do with my land?

143
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,080
If you don't want me to hand it over to those guys from Naseong Development,

144
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,960
you know that only the cost of the land won't cut it, don't you?

145
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,260
If you don't give me an answer, well, I guess I should visit him myself.

146
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,180
We had worked together on a huge deal.

147
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,020
There's no way our managing director would turn me away at his front door.

148
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,230
President Choi, during the ancient times...

149
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,740
people weren't allowed to say the gods' names, so they called them by aliases.

150
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,950
They believed that they would be punished greatly if they spoke the gods' names.

151
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,520
Are you saying the director is some kind of god or something?

152
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,530
At the least, I think he has someone to punish in his place.

153
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:17,350
In any case, I only have one condition of terms. Same as before.

154
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:23,830
Through this opportunity, Miryeong Forestry should become a corporation and not stop at being a corner store.

155
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,950
There's something you must do for us first.

156
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,220
Lumberjack Mr. Choi.

157
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,850
Who is it?

158
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,230
Hello?

159
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,300
No, I'm glad you called.

160
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,350
But, is something wrong?

161
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,840
I'll take a look.

162
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,610
Are you saying your knee isn't getting better but is getting more and more swollen?

163
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,560
- The pain isn't going away?
- Aigoo...

164
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,060
That guy doctor gave me some medicine to settle my stomach,

165
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,990
but it only worked temporarily.

166
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,020
Grandma!

167
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,750
Long time no see.

168
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,730
You're here.

169
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,710
You're working hard as usual. I'm not sure if you're working or just all over the place.

170
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,820
You're working hard, too. I don't know if you're treating or just being a poser.

171
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,710
What a nag. She's here again.

172
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,210
Grandma, did you plug up the groundwater pipe?

173
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,170
I told you not to use it anymore.

174
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,800
You can't just use water that comes down from the mountain.

175
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,560
You must report and get a permit.

176
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,570
What permit? It's not like I'm the only one who used it. All the neighboring homes used it.

177
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,010
Why all the fuss now?

178
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,820
So I'm saying, it's been okay thus far, but not any longer.

179
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,270
Use the water from the water supply.

180
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,370
How can you drink the water without the water quality inspection?

181
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,880
Leave that alone!

182
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,510
Why would I pay for water when I can get it for free?

183
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,690
Grandma, does Mr. Heo Choon Sik also use groundwater?

184
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,650
Of course. There are tons of people who drink water from the mountain.

185
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,450
That's natural mineral water, you know.

186
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,720
Move.

187
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,270
What brings you here?

188
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,520
I came because I heard you're on your rounds in this area.

189
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,700
I came by to give you a memo since you're off work now.

190
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,200
Give me a memo?

191
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,270
I asked you before. If it's okay to see you with clear distinction between work and personal affairs.

192
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,780
Let's see each other on a personal level.

193
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,760
I'm saying I'd like to do things that are very personal as much as possible.

194
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,690
With you, Oh Bo Mi.

195
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,340
Pardon?

196
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,450
Things that are very personal?

197
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,930
But before I hear your answer, I must tell you this.

198
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,830
I'm actually Choi Jeong Mok's...

199
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,670
Let's talk next time.

200
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,610
I'm going to miss my timing at this rate.

201
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,580
Fine. Let's go together then.

202
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,090
Why are you leaving the path and going this way? What are you going to do?

203
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,810
How can we use the normal path when we're sneaking up on them?

204
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,970
If we want to secretly catch them we must use the unpaved path.

205
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,520
Sneak up on them? Who?

206
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,710
Miryeong Forestry.

207
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,650
Miryeong Forestry?

208
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,870
Miryeong Forestry monopolized the forest cultivation business around here as well.

209
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,180
At a price much lower than the fair cost.

210
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,030
Would the money crazed President Choi Jeong Mok run a business at a loss?

211
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,870
What if it isn't at a loss?

212
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,870
He's making up the difference through another route.

213
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,430
By illegally cutting down protected trees he shouldn't be cutting down.

214
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,340
The fine for illegal logging is high so I'm sure they will work at night.

215
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:25,230
We can stake out here and catch them in the act.

216
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,870
As a witness, make sure to watch with both eyes wide open.

217
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:33,140
The axis of evil of Miryeong Forest. I will make sure to rid of them this time.

218
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,690
You two over there.

219
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,230
What are you doing here?

220
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,790
I'm an enforcement officer.

221
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,840
The two of you are under arrest for allegedly destroying provincial fores–

222
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,550
You guys are so dead!

223
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,140
There are tons of people who drink this water.

224
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,950
Isn't it spring water?

225
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,050
Spring water?

226
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,140
Mister! Mister, wait a minute!

227
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,950
Wait up! Mister!

228
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,230
Stop right there!

229
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,340
Stop right there!

230
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,430
Rescue Officer Choi!

231
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,670
Are you okay?

232
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,640
What is this?

233
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Rescue Officer Jang Application. Letter of Recommendation
Applicant: Jang Jae Hyeon, DOB: 9.26.1975

234
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,700
Recommender: Bong Dae Yong, Team: Miryeong 119 Special Rescue Team, Position: Fire Brigade

235
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,960
"Rescue Officer Jang Jae Hyeon suffered an injury at the rescue site

236
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,350
and had his left leg amputated.

237
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:24,190
Therefore, I would like to recommend him as a recipient of the medical assistance program.

238
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,140
Recommender, Bong Dae Yong."

239
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,470
Taesung Group

240
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,990
Taesung? Taesung Group?

241
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,140
Taesung Group has a medical support business?

242
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,850
This is why Team Leader Bong met with Director Jo?

243
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,530
How is Taeseong involved with the rescue team?

244
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,720
And using a troubleshooter like Director Jo?

245
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,090
Fire dispatch! Fire dispatch! There is an active fire at Mount Miryeong at site 23.

246
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:02,520
Villagers witnessed Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae of Miryeong Hospital walking up the mountain.

247
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,940
Here! Here!

248
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,760
Here! I'm here!

249
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,910
Person in need of assistance spotted

250
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,430
- Rescue Officer Yang Cheol Sik, prepare to descend on the hoist.
- Got it!

251
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,540
I'll go down.

252
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,470
It's in the middle of a fire. It's too dangerous for someone inexperienced.

253
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,820
- Get ready.
- I'll go.

254
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,920
Let me go.

255
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,550
Here! There is a person here!

256
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,780
Here...

257
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,920
Starting now, I'm going to make advances at you.

258
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,660
Kang San Hyeok, your heart skipped a beat, didn't it?

259
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,600
Kang San Hyeok, whenever you're in pain I will run to you.

260
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,430
Jeong Yeong Jae!

261
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,000
Where are you, Jeong Yeong Jae?

262
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,720
Jeong Yeong Jae!

263
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,880
Kang San Hyeok!

264
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,930
Kang San Hyeok, I'm over here!

265
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,370
I'm over here.

266
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,680
You're okay. You're okay now.

267
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,100
Kang San Hyeok!

268
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,700
Kang San Hyeok, get a hold of yourself!

269
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,040
Kang San Hyeok!

270
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,910
Kang San Hyeok, get a hold of yourself!

271
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,390
Kang San Hyeok, what's the problem? Kang San Hyeok, answer me now!

272
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,120
Kang San Hyeok!

273
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,710
Kang San Hyeok!

274
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,350
There's been an emergency situation. We will bring up the victim first.

275
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,910
Kang San Hyeok. Kang San Hyeok. Kang San Hyeok!

276
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,550
Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok!

277
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,230
I...

278
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,680
Kang San Hyeok, get a hold of yourself!

279
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,190
- The village...
- Kang San Hyeok!

280
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,810
I burned it.

281
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,190
♬ The chaos which unfolds in front of me ♬

282
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,380
♬ In countless stories ♬

283
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,790
♬ While listening, sometimes holding my breath, ♬

284
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,150
♬ I approach closer. ♬

285
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,710
♬ The hopes which can be seen in the distance ♬

286
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,320
♬ Without a word of sweet comfort ♬

287
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,280
♬ Just scatter ♬

288
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,700
♬ Just scatter ♬
Forest Preview

289
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,890
Was the culprit a child?

290
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,020
All the villagers know.

291
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,250
She was here?

292
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,860
There's something fishy about this case.

293
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,370
This is the last courtesy.

294
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,920
Does Kang San Hyeok have another profession?

295
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,850
Don't you want to know what happiness is?

296
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,320
I will succeed and won't be swayed by anything else.

297
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,670
So, I'm going to stop here.

298
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,060
Find Kang San Hyeok's weakness.

299
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,930
Yeong Jae!

300
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,290
Promise me one thing.

301
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,880
I won't respond to you, so you don't respond to me either.

302
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,490
Get out.

303
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,840
♬ Take me now ♬
