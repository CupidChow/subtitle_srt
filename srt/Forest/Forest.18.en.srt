00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,210
Episode 18

2
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,370
Doctor, you're spilling water.

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,780
From your symptoms, it looks like you ruptured your muscles again.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,010
- You can take the medication. But if there's no improvement, you should go to a larger hospital and take an MRI.
- I see.

5
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,290
Rescuer Yang, why do you think you exercise so excessively?

6
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,900
The rupture from last time didn't even heal completely yet. But there's another muscle rupture in another part.

7
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,260
When do you think you started to obsess about exercising?

8
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,080
There was a mentor of mine, Rescuer Jang.

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,870
But during a rescuing effort a few years ago...

10
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,940
his leg was crushed by a boulder and had to be amputated.

11
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,880
I think it was since then.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,970
If I don't exercise, I get anxious.

13
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,580
PTSD List of Symptoms
Don't feel too pressured and try this out.

14
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,120
You can't keep missing out on hearing the dispatch siren.

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,070
All right.

16
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,910
4

17
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,280
A trauma management system?

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,600
I think trauma and stresses are much higher than other occupations.

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,160
The local government used to send out a psychiatrist to see us.

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,800
But if there are budget issues, those things are the first to go.

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,190
Then how do you work with the team members who have psychological issues?

22
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,170
Do you pay for treatment yourselves?

23
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,060
Well, there are such members, but...

24
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,250
they usually don't realize that they have problems.

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,400
They fall from climbing rocks several times a week or witness bloody injuries all the time.

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,860
How can they take care of all of that stresses every time?

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,860
But why do you bring up issues of trauma? Are there any of our members who are struggling with that?

28
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,020
By chance, is it Kang San Hyeok?

29
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,090
Kang San Hyeok? What about him?

30
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,020
Never mind then.

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,840
I looked into the medical sponsorship business that Team Leader Bong is involved in. And it's very suspicious.
[Information on Miryeong City Medical Sponsorship Program]

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,060
It says that the department in charge is Societal Contribution Team in Taesung, but there are no such departments in Taesung.

33
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,770
And they accepted applicants only from Miryeong Special Rescue Team.

34
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,890
Not the entire Miryeong city, but only from the Miryeong Special Rescue Team?

35
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,900
Yes.
[Information on Miryeong City Medical Sponsorship Program]

36
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,230
The announcement didn't even go out to the city hall and townspeople.
[How to apply: When, Who, Required documents]

37
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,980
It was sent only to the Miryeong Special Rescue Team.
[The procedure and how to apply]

38
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,250
From the start, they targeted Miryeong Special Rescue Team

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,710
and developed a medical sponsorship business?

40
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,790
What brings you all the way here?

41
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,870
There are CCTVs inside the rescue headquarters, right?

42
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,930
Please review and look for those people who ran away at the hour of the mountain fire or anything else suspicious.

43
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,140
On the city hall CCTV, I only saw them running away in their car.

44
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,610
Nothing on the city hall CCTV?

45
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,830
I already looked and didn't see anything here.

46
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,920
Those guys are interesting. How could they run away without being captured on camera at all?

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,730
There's something to this case.

48
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,270
That vehicle is unregistered and there are lots of suspicious aspects to it.

49
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,310
If you find out anything, please give me a call right away.

50
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,400
All right then.

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,600
Are you turning me down?

52
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,350
You didn't answer my calls at all.

53
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,920
You don't like me asking you to see me on a personal basis?

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,970
Choi Chang

55
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,410
What do I do? Choi Chang...

56
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,820
What do I do?

57
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,880
Honey, don't answer the call.

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,490
Disappear for three days.

59
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,870
Act like a player.

60
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,490
Act cool.

61
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,580
Be chic about it.

62
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,250
Oh, that?

63
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,480
I don't like to talk on the phone when I'm focusing on work.

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,580
If you're cool with that, sure. Let's see each other then.

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,310
- But if I'm Miryeong Forestry...
- That you're the son of President Choi Jeong Mok?

66
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,990
You knew?

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,920
What do you take me for? You had mentioned all that a couple of days ago. How would I not know?

68
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,850
Well, you know...

69
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,550
I'll tell you in advance, but us seeing each other has nothing to do with Miryeong Forestry.

70
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,190
Even if it's your father, I won't stand for it if he does something wrong.

71
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,930
We're doing this for fun anyway.

72
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,800
Fun?

73
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,190
I thought my heart was going to burst!

74
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,020
What do I do? Oh, no, no! Chang!

75
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,430
He's so handsome!

76
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,010
I should've given him a kiss.

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,560
When would we kiss?

78

Oh, hi.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,260
There's a rescue team member who has PTSD. So, I ran a PCL.
PTSD: Post-traumatic stress syndrome / PCL: PTSD Checklist

84
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,370
He scored 65 points. What do I do?

85
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,660
- His symptoms are that he exercises...
- Hey, hey...

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,340
- Hey, I'm being paged. I'll call you back.
- Hey, hey!

87
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,370
Yes, this is Jeong Yeong Jae.

88
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,970
Excuse me? I attend the conference?

89
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,160
Okay, I understand.

90
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,400
Okay.

91
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,990
Happy?

92
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,050
Pardon?

93
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,450
That's right. That's how life is.

94
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,660
I wanted to go to a conference once a year.

95
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,590
Yet a newbie is ruthlessly ditching the old-timer.

96
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,630
Good luck.

97
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,940
Well, that's...

98
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,470
The hospital director seems like a nice man, huh? A natural and easy-going person.

99
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,900
Go ahead and trust him. See how he treats people.

100
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,600
For your information, while he was the youngest director of Seoul Myeongseong University hospital,

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,450
his nickname used to be the Butcher.

102
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,190
As soon as he became the director, he fired people left and right including his enemies.

103
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,480
Even then, he wouldn't let you get close to him unless you're on his side.

104
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,620
If you don't believe me, look into it yourself.

105

Why are they making me to go the conference all of a sudden? They're putting me on the spot.

108
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,080
You were asking all kinds of questions last time.

109
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,960
How come you're so quiet today?

110
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,730
You look young.

111
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,520
As you ladies said, it's about someone else's neighborhood.

112
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,470
It has nothing to do with me. Why would I bother?

113
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,840
I'm not interested anymore.

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,980
Oh, no! My goodness!

115
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,200
Does your knee hurt again?

116
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,100
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yeah...

117
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,870
This is no good. Let's go home.

118
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,190
You can't work today.

119
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,680
- Ma'am, where is your house?
- Over there.

120
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,560
Hold onto me.

121
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,940
What kind of sins did I commit in my previous life that

122
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,360
all my bones are so perfectly healthy?

123
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,980
Will you be all right here?

124
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,190
Why don't you lie down in your room?

125
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,230
It hurts more if I lie down.

126
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,880
I'll sit here for a while and go inside. You can leave now.

127
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,060
Thanks a lot.

128
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,120
All right then.

129
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Why do you keep asking about what happened in the past?

130
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,370
Don't ask. No one will tell you.

131
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,400
A person died. Who'd want to recall that?

132
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,470
- A person died? There was a fatality?
- Aigoo.

133
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,830
I don't want to think about it either.

134
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,930
Leave now.

135
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,300
Ma'am, this...

136
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,460
When was that photo taken?

137
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,790
That man. Was he here?

138
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,200
Of course, he was.

139
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,620
He built a community center, installed television, laundry machine...

140
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,360
He threw a party for our town.

141
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,550
Saying Taesung's young master is here for us. People were in a frenzy wanting to take a picture with him.

142
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,530
Why would he come to a small rural village? There's no reason for him to visit here.

143
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:46,230
Why wouldn't he? He's the one who put the special rescue team over there.

144
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,580
Everyone knows about it since we all helped out when he built it.

145
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,300
That he funded the rescue headquarters construction.

146
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,860
He came to visit often.

147
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,200
Construction of 119 Special Rescue Team Headquarters

148
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,110
Miryeong Special Rescue Team.

149
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,730
Director Kwon Joo Han of Taesung built it.

150
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,980
Excuse me? Managing Director Kwon did?

151
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,390
If it happened 25 years ago, he must've been a young employee who just started working for Taesung.

152
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,260
Why would he be interested in the special rescue team when he should be learning how to manage a corporation?

153
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,860
We must find out the reason.

154
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,890
That's probably the reason Taesung is jumping for our project

155
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,780
or is starting up a suspicious medical sponsorship program.

156
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,590
Spread out everyone looking for information.

157
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,650
Yes, will do.

158
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,480
Huh?

159
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,140
I got it.

160
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,390
Miryeong Mountain that suffered a huge mountain fire five years ago
[Another fire at Gangwondo Mt. Miryeong

161
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,710
is once again on fire.
[ Miryeong villagers are against relocation of the special rescue team]/i>

162
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,070
This is Taesung's preemptive strike.

163
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,630
They clearly made sure the public opinion stands against the relocation of the rescue team from this fire. Geez.

164
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,480
RLI
Red Line Investment

165
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,750
We can't move forward with the rescue team headquarters relocation due to townspeople's opposition.

166
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:37,160
Come up with a solution as soon as possible if you need to relocate them.

167
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,840
What happened? Why are things happening this way?

168
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,390
I think Taesung got involved.

169
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,350
For some reason, Director Kwon Joo Han is obsessed with Miryeong Forest Project.

170
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,120
You intercepted a well-known workaholic, Director Kwon's project.

171
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,690
Didn't you anticipate this much of a counterattack?

172
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,880
You may have to get back to the starting point despite all the work you've done thus far.

173
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,040
Chairman, I'm overseeing this project.

174
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,970
Have you ever seen any of my project go back to the starting point?

175
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,420
Please watch me.

176
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,820
As to how I recover your time and money.

177
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,930
You haven't forgotten that you promised me a three-month period, have you?

178
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,450
Whether you recover it or whatnot, you must relocate the special rescue team.

179
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,870
That's all the time I can give you.

180
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,980
I understand full well.

181
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,380
Did you find out which subsidiary of Taesung is funding the Miryeong Forest project?

182
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,930
Yes, it's Taesung High Tech. They produce electronic parts.

183
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,640
Taesung's Director Kwon Joo Han is in charge of the company.

184
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,500
An electronic parts company is interested in a resort business?

185
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,100
According to my informants, Director Kwon Joo Han hates his father Chairman Kwon's meddling.

186
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,490
So the company he started is this Taesung High Tech.

187
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,360
All of Director Kwon's projects start out at Taesung High Tech.

188
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,460
And they funded them as well.

189
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,350
So it's Director Kwon's playground. How about the shareholders?

190
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:23,090
Of course, Director Kwon Joo Han is the largest shareholder. And other organizations and investors are listed as second largest shareholders with similar ratios.

191
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,980
Among individual investors, is there anyone worth looking into?

192
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,060
It's Chairman Hwang Seok Ho.

193
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,980
Chairman Hwang Seok Ho...

194
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,170
That Chairman Hwang of Haeseong Precision?

195
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,250
Yes. His company is worth two trillion won and hasn't gone public.

196
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,910
He owns 100% of the company shares.

197
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,000
He has the most cash and can lend a huge amount of it quickly in our country.

198
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,880
And he prefers high-risk and high yield investments. He's quite aggressive.

199
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,480
He's a perfect person for our goal.

200
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,870
- Set up a meeting right away.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,480
Chairman Hwang is attending an investors forum in Philippines.

202
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,580
A sick leave?

203
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,380
You said not to hide anything from you even if it's a small thing.

204
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,110
I think I was a bit traumatized from the last mission.

205
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,700
I'd like to take a few days off and shake it off.

206
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,060
A rescue team member who needs to go on missions can't feel that way.

207
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,960
Take a break. Feel back to normal.

208
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,200
Thank you, Team Leader.

209
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,300
Rescuer Kang, you have a visitor outside.

210
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,210
- A visitor?
- Yes.

211
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,410
Hello, Director.

212
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,190
I'm sure you know me already even if I didn't introduce myself.

213
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,310
It's my honor to meet someone so famous.

214
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,560
You're doing wonderful work.

215
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,760
A director of RLI is working as a special rescue team member?

216
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,460
I don't have much time. Please get to the point.

217
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,730
Why don't you turn over Naseong Development? You're an outstanding man, so I'm sure you know.

218
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,030
That you'll suffer greater loss even if you hold out this way.

219
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:37,690
If you let go now, I'll take over and pay you everything you put in thus far.

220
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,240
You will do me a favor by taking over?

221
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,650
You must've developed only your fist and not your brain.

222
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,920
How can you even make such a suggestion to me?

223
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,430
It's my last consideration.

224
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,990
You should accept it when I'm being this considerate. I'm telling you out of concern.

225
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,280
Once we move onto the next phase of our plan, you'll struggle.

226
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,670
Please leave.

227
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,310
Leave and whether you move onto the next phase or install a hidden camera in my house...

228
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:20,330
Do whatever you want. But you'll have to brace yourself.

229
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,970
Your opponent is Kang San Hyeok.

230
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,540
Whatever you do, you'll be struck for sure.

231
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,220
- Dr. Jeong.
- Yes.

232
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,150
- The water quality analysis results are out.
- Oh, yes.

233
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,780
Everything is normal.

234
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,410
What a relief.

235
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,320
Daewon Bio

236
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,430
Daewon Bio...

237
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,660
I can't move out right away. I'll have to stay a few more days.

238
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,210
I'll be out for a few days anyway. Do whatever you need to do.

239
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,320
A few days?

240
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,990
Are you going somewhere?

241
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,820
Director Kang San Hyeok, no important files inside the house

242
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,930
Obvservation, nothing special happening before and after work hours

243
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:18,860
Kang San Hyeok. Find out what his crucial weaknesses are.

244
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,540
Yes, sir.

245
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,980
Manila

246
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,950
KAD

247
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,280
Chairman Hwang refused to meet with us?

248
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,730
Yes, that's understandable.

249
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,830
Chairman Hwang has nothing to lose at this point.

250
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,760
If he's got nothing to lose yet, we should make sure that changes.

251
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,720
It's so nice.

252
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,620
Oh, well. I feel bad toward Dr. Park a little bit.

253
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,590
Let me enjoy some culture and comfort for once.

254
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,800
Why am I seeing things?

255
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,280
Yes, absolutely.

256
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,500
You were here, Chairman.

257
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,860
Who... Do I know you?

258
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,970
I promised to pay you a visit. I'm Kang San Hyeok of RLI.

259
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,530
It's an honor to meet you, Chairman.

260
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:03,100
As for the meeting, I clearly refused it.

261
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,570
Thank you.

262
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,300
I flew from Europe for 12 hours just to meet you, Chairman.

263
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,690
Please give me five minutes, Chairman. Five minutes will do.

264
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,040
What exactly is it that you want to discuss with me after flying for 12 hours?

265
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,570
It's about Taesung High Tech.

266
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,760
Do you believe that the owner is running Taesung High Tech properly?

267
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,470
And if he's not doing a good job?

268
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,390
You should change its owner.

269
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,950
Replace him with someone who can manage the company well and maximize the profit. With someone like you, Chairman.

270
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,790
It looks like you wasted 12 hours.

271
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,340
I don't have time to listen to your absurdity.

272
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,580
Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health in Philippines

273
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,490
Yes, sir. Nice to meet you.

274
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,620
Nice to meet you, sir.

275
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,610
51 st Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health in Philippines
June 7-10, 2019

276
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,430
Did you prepare it?

277
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,670
Yes. It will be delivered to his room.

278
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,830
Proceed as I have instructed. He's wise, so I'm sure he'll respond right away.

279
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,850
Yes, I understand.

280
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,450
Jeong Yeong Jae?

281
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,990
What's going on? What is a rescue team member doing here?

282
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,390
Who is this, Director? She's a total beauty.

283
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,420
Ow, what, why?

284
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,570
Why is there a fly in a hotel?

285
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,210
Director?

286
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,240
That's what we call each other between friends.

287
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,030
We both prefer to be formal. So, I'm called director and he's manager.

288
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,950
Isn't that right, manager?

289
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,370
Since we're such buddies, we took our days off and came to vacation together.

290
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,820
Yes, yes, yes. That's right, sir.

291
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:24,040
I ought to. This guy likes me so much.

292
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,550
You fool, you only like me.

293
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,810
So, what brings you here?

294
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,270
You said you weren't going to be home for a few days. You were coming here?

295
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,030
Wait a minute. "You weren't going to be home?"

296
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,520
It's an expression that's possible if you're constantly living together. What's up with that, friend?

297
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,890
- By chance, are you two...
- She lives next door.

298
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,800
It's nothing less nothing more. A woman next door.

299
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,460
That's right. I'm just a woman next door.

300
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,140
Then, enjoy your trip, you two.

301
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,300
What the? Why did you come here, Jeong Yeong Jae?

302
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,610
Jeong Yeong Jae! Jeong--

303
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,360
51 st Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health in Philippines

304
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,310
You hid such a beauty next door to you and you never said a thing.

305
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,760
- Look at this guy.
- Shut up.

306
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,550
I felt some resentment when you pinched my cheeks.

307
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,580
Watch it.

308
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,150
What an idiot.

309
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,320
Take days off to vacation with a friend? Dressed like that?

310
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,780
- You said you'd call me back. Why didn't I hear from you yet?
- Huh?

311
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,700
You haven't gotten a call yet?

312
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,590
I passed it onto a PTSD specialist.

313
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,030
A PTSD specialist?

314
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,950
Yeong Jae!

315
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,460
Yeong Jae?

316
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,330
Director.

317
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,820
Director?

318
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,280
I never thought I'd run into you here.

319
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,390
I know.

320
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,030
Seong Il called me out of the blue and told me you were here.

321
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,970
He asked me to help you.

322
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,010
Of course, you'd probably refuse my help.

323
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,520
No. You're a PTSD specialist as Seong Il said.

324
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,660
There's no reason I'd refuse your help.

325
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,170
Help me out if you could.

326
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,790
I think you've changed.

327
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,080
Really?

328
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,220
Since neither of us has our files with us,

329
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,980
let's meet up after the conference and discuss it.

330
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,890
I'll bring over materials that will be helpful to you.

331
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,470
All right then. Thanks.

332
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,580
Meet Cha Jin Woo? That Cha Jin Woo?

333
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,780
Does this woman have any self-respect at all?

334
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,810
How could she meet up with the guy who betrayed her again?

335
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,760
Inner peace...

336
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,090
Inner peace...

337
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,420
And wear that dress? Is that for hitting on guys?

338
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,090
And how come she looks so pretty today? So unnecessary.

339
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,230
Should we have dinner together? For the last time for real?

340
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,910
Are you kidding me? I have plans.

341
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,670
Then should we grab a drink? For the last time for real?

342
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,040
Do you want to get punched? For the last time?

343
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,630
I'm blocking you from texting.

344
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,280
Chairman, you have a flower delivery.

345
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,230
Flowers?

346
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,040
Learn from the old, create something new. Daeyeong Auto

347
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,120
It worked, Director. Chairman Hwang will give us ten minutes.

348
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
We gained ten minutes of time.

349
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,800
Where do you think you're going at this hour?

350
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,990
By chance...

351
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,290
Get off.

352
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,840
Kang San Hyeok.

353
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
Don't misunderstand me.

354
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,660
I just feel bad to see you making mistakes as your caring neighbor.

355
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,010
That's all there is to it. Get off.

356
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,570
Get lost.

357
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,360
♬ The chaos which unfolds in front of me ♬

358
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,810
♬ In countless stories ♬

362
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,740
♬ Without a word of sweet comfort ♬

363
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,020
♬ Just scatter ♬

364
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,420
♬ and disappear. ♬

365
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,380
♬ My feelings loneliness my Silence depression ♬

Forest Preview

381
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,180
Are you trying to get back together with Jeong Yeong Jae now?

382
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
I plan to do that.

383
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,010
I'll stop that with my eyes wide open. Don't even think about it.

384
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,510
Miryeong townspeople aren't willing to sell the land as a whole.

385
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,780
Do you remember that guy's name?

386
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,710
I'll negotiate only with the real owner.

387
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,360
I don't think we should keep going from this point on.

388
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,290
You got caught. So it's time for you to run away.

389
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,090
What are you saying?

390
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,810
I don't want to speak further with someone whose every cell in his body is filled with lies.

391
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:51,650
If you can't trust me, just pity me. Don't fall away from me.

392
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,000
♬ Please take me now ♬
