00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,930
Episode 10

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,060
Something is fishy.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,420
Something very dirty.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,560
It feels bad.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,630
Team leader, is there any reason to enter a restricted other than gathering wild greens?

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,960
Enter a Restricted area?

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,700
Hey, that case is handled by the prosecution.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:36,140
He was fined on a charge of illegal entry and had to pay for the damage to the barrier.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,710
Why do you hold on to something that has ended?

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,890
He doesn't feel like a person who searches for wild greens.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,940
There were nothing like vegetables at all in the car.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,290
He was on his way to get them.

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,180
You meet all walks of life in the mountain.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,930
Some people are even in disguise,

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,680
There are people who enter dressed up in suits.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,740
What about the secret code for the barrier?

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,790
The barrier was raised and the car definitely came out.

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,540
Do you know whether the password was leaked?

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,410
Aigoo, I see a detective.

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,260
The barrier can be opened when you press some random numbers.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,060
The password card is only distributed to our team and

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,430
the Special Rescue team. Leaking the password is ridiculous.

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,860
Special Rescue team?

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,990
In light of the event saving our member's life

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,380
and considering we need a medic on scene,

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,690
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae shall be

27
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,920
appointed a medical doctor of Miryeong 119 Special Rescue Team.

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,560
Jeong Yeong Jae! Jeong Yeong Jae!

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
Jeong Yeong Jae! Jeong Yeong Jae!

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,270
Jeong Yeong Jae! Jeong Yeong Jae!

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,100
When Mr. Kim Soo had the accident,

32
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,500
we could visually confirm an open femoral fracture.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,320
In a case like that, you must first check here to see if the femoral artery is severed.

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,220
Doctor Jeong!

35
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,860
I have a difficulty breathing, don't you think you should do CPR?

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,610
It's obvious for you to have difficulty breathing.

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,180
That's a sign of good health which you can ignore.

38
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,470
Why don't we listen to the lecture?

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,780
Why don't we stop?

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,880
Hey there, would you please keep quiet so I can lecture?

41
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,010
Me?

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,180
Ms Yeong Jae!

43
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,920
- Come here.
- Sure.

44
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,190
Thanks.

45
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,190
The rescue team has a delicious meal plan.

46
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,300
Right?

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,710
We should visit Lightning Restaurant with Ms Yeong Jae, once again!

48
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,790
Anytime! As long as it's Mr. Chang's recommendation, I am in.

49
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,300
You can’t do it. Because you need me by your side.

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,620
What's the nonsense?

51
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,680
Am I wrong? Then who was the one that hung onto me and cried yesterday?

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,700
That’s because of the lizard...

53
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,420
Forget it. I’d never cry because of you.

54
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,800
So please don’t worry, please don’t!

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,060
I forgot to bring water.

56
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,330
Sit down, Ms. Yeong Jae, I’ll get it for you.

57
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,770
I’ll go. I want to get more stir-fried potatoes.

58
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,840
Lightning...

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,230
Are you two obsessed with food or something?

60
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,900
Anyway, don’t forget that I’m watching you.

61
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,820
And you, who live together with Ms. Yeong Jae, whether she’s safe or not,

62
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,440
I’ll check every day.

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,640
First of all, she’s not yours.

64
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,750
Second. when it comes to something dangerous. I am more dangerous.

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,540
She keeps asking me to date her.

66
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,830
Our Hoobae Kang is coming out exactly as I expected.

67
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,200
Is that so? Is that how you see her?

68
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,390
All right!

69
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,910
I’ll wipe it off. Our Hoobae's bloody tears.

70
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,250
Not much is left?

71
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,680
Bloody tears?

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,020
- I’ll be off then.
- Yes. Bye.

73
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,570
- Bye.
- Yes, bye.

74
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,100
Bye. Go safely.

75
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,450
- What are you doing here?

76
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,830
Well really, I'm not at all curious. Whether you have business here or not.

77
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,300
I'll say. Whether you do or you don't.

78
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,930
- Really
- Enforcement Officer Oh!

79
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,100
What are you doing here?

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,670
Password card?

81
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,330
I think the password was leaked in this case, so I am here to check.

82
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,280
Are you taking precautions with the password card?

83
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,660
You're saying it was leaked ...

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,590
It is supposed to be kept in your uniform pocket at all times.

85
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,710
Yes.

86
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,450
Have you seem me somewhere before?

87
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,810
I don't think you are unique enough to be remembered.

88
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,900
No ... you clearly saw me.

89
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,910
Mr. Kang San-hyeok 850425...1...0...0

90
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,930
That time!

91
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,690
But, are you a rescue crew member?

92
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,640
Why are you pretending not to know me? Because you remember.

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,150
I gave you a fine and took you to the hospital.

94
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,620
I see it was you that day.

95
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,340
You don't have a very impressive face, so I couldn't remember you.

96
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,510
May I see your password card?

97
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,380
I'm in the rescue crew.

98
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,660
What are you doing now to a rescue crew member?

99
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,380
I am sorry but I must check.

100
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,360
You're wearing your rescue uniform so it should be in your pocket. Please show it to me.

101
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,050
Will this satisfy you?

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,250
He's a member of my team.

103
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,450
Other that for dispatch and training, there is no reason for us to go into the restricted area.

104
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,290
So let's stop, Enforcement officer.

105
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,350
Yes, sir, sorry for intruding.

106
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:51,060
Don't treat the cards carelessly and in the future please pay attention to and monitor them.

107
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,450
Then ...

108
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,220
Yeah. Because I still haven't gotten access to the documents, I don't have any information on the prior Special Rescue Team.

109
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,380
I'll send you a picture. I will get to know him. He's a professor ...

110
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,890
He's written several columns about the noise in Miryeong Forest from the helicopter.

111
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,260
It's strange because it was written that there was no problem. Hurry and look into it

112
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,740
Document Library

113
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,080
Why are you there?

114
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,710
Before the time signal is sounded, you can't enter the archives.

115
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,640
Did you know that?

116
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,890
Even though I know that, It's something I must pointlessly attempt because my pride was hurt.

117
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,680
Is the psychology similar to your uselessly picking a fight with me that you can't win?

118
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,630
What is she doing here alone at this time?

119
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,270
It's going to be dark soon.

120
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,100
You're using a good GPS.

121
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,770
What are you doing here?

122
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,300
What are you doing here so late in the day?

123
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,950
Are you getting familiar with the trees in the forest?

124
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,540
You came into the forest to learn each tree, right?

125
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,460
Did you major in forestry? You knew at a glance what this is.

126
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,990
A lame graduate can't even offer a business card.

127
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,240
- Be on your way.
- If you just go, you will be lost.

128
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,610
- What?
- The GPS pointed there.

129
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,290
But that is blocked so you will take a detour that way.

130
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,530
But if you go that way. you will never be able to find your way back here again.

131
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,250
What?

132
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,920
- To here?
- Follow me.

133
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,790
It's there.

134
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,770
Follow me.

135
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,130
This is where it's been hiding.

136
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,420
In this area, when a tree vine is blocking the forest like a rock face, we call it a "Hiding Rock".

137
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,640
There is another one on the opposite side, so unless you are really familiar with Miryeong Forest, you won't be able to find it.

138
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,860
You are probably the only person from the district conservation team who has entered this place.

139
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,230
Oh, but how do you know about a place like this?

140
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,830
When it's not even labeled on a map?

141
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,840
It's because when I was younger, I used to spend my play time exploring the forest with some kids.

142
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,420
Going specifically to the places the adults told me not to go.

143
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,500
Please let me know if you need to go to other areas.

144
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,570
Miryeong forest is so primeval that a Hiding Rock can be found at a couple more...

145
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,420
Wait.. when it comes to selling standing trees...

146
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,660
Whatever. It's time for time for him earn less.

147
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,400
Excuse me?

148
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,100
What did you just say?

149
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,310
It's okay. Don't panic. I'm here.

150
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,230
I'll take care of it. Just stay put and don't panic.

151
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,850
Aigoo, this baby is well raised and chubby.

152
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,720
- Aww, this is pretty right.
- Aren't you scared?

153
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,440
This is cute, nothing to be scared of. It's not even poisonous.

154
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,020
Oh, picture, please.

155
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,830
Please take a picture of me, now!

156
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,870
Okay.

157
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,080
Oh Bo Mi.

158
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,540
One more, please.

159
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,980
Oh Bo Mi.

160
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,910
Done.

161
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,080
Let's wait and see, these punks.

162
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,400
I'll show you who is the top of the top from the Oh Family.

163
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,320
Good job. Go home, now.

164
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,250
- These punks?
- Ah. I mean the elderly punks.

165
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,930
They brag as if they're the man.

166
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm sure no one has ever taken a picture with a snake.

167
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,710
Everyone should kneel down before me.

168
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,030
I'm nervous. I'm dead meat if I get caught.

169
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,490
He must be at work yet.

170
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,550
Have you been looking for me? You brat.

171
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,760
When were you going to stop slacking off? Until when?

172
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,920
Slack off? I didn't have a second to visit you.

173
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,760
Is that so? You come here, brat.

174
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,080
Are you conning your own father? This ...

175
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,290
What are you going to do with this? Do you know how much they are past due?

176
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,840
My Hyungnim, did you have to pay the penalty?

177
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Good job. You did a fabulous job, Mr. Choi Jeong Mok.

178
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,140
What? Good job? I've missed the date.

179
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,990
I'm all screwed having nothing to sell. You're saying 'good job'?

180
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,790
You brat,

181
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,770
where is it?

182
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,060
Your vehicle is confiscated.
That's nonsense.

183
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,430
How can I commute to work and rush to the scene in an emergency, Dad?

184
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,200
Don't do it. Quit.

185
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,960
I was going to see my only son have a successful career.

186
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,590
So I sent you abroad for studying. Then you join a rescue team?

187
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,500
The blood pressure level has not gone down since then.

188
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,920
You'll be doomed, if you say such things.

189
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,590
This lumber here, if there were a fire, what would you do it it's all burnt?

190
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:47,080
The village and forest of Miryeong are safe because the rescue team is always on stand by.

191
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,200
Don't you remember we lost the house because of the forest fire?

192
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,770
Why do you rake over the old ashes? I don't even want to think about that.

193
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,820
I'm going to get the penalty out of your paycheck. Don't even dream about getting your car back until then.

194
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:08,670
When I think about getting ticketed by Oh Bo Mi, the young punk,

195
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,700
Let's wait and see. Wait and see.

196
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,660
Father, give me my car back. Hyungnim!

197
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,030
If you act like that, then your son would..

198
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,050
use the spare key instead.

199
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,850
Hello?
Are you Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae? I'm the doctor of the patient, Kim Man Soo.

200
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,740
Hello. Did something happen?

201
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,890
I'm wondering what to do with the documentation when Kim Man Soo is moved to Myeongseong University Hospital.

202
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,010
Excuse me? Seoul?

203
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,580
There is no rehabilitation department. He would get the treatment in a better facility.

204
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:13,040
Haven't you heard his medical expense will be covered by a generous donor?

205
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,630
I wonder if it's okay for me to sign the paper as you're the operating surgeon.

206
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,380
Sure, you should sign as you're his doctor, now.

207
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,630
Proceed as planned.

208
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,350
Okay, I'll do that.

209
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,590
The donor would like to remain anonymous.

210
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,790
The patient thinks the hospital is sponsoring him, instead.

211
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,100
I think you should be aware of it.

212
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,760
Okay.

213
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,480
Donor?

214
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm above the law. Law is to be exploited.

215
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,610
Only when you approach this law with that attitude can you read between the lines of the laws.

216
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,710
Money lives in between those lines.

217
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,850
Get to the bottom to find out the loopholes!

218
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,580
Assistant Manager Kim's team will be assigned to Forest Protection Law.

219
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,230
Assistant Manager Park's team will be assigned to Forest Development Law.

220
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,850
Assistant Manager Yoo's team will be assigned to Environmental Law.

221
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,470
Now it's a matter of how fast we do it. Everyone put effort into it.

222
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,740
Get me everything related to the development of Miryeong Forest.

223
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,010
Yes, sir.

224
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,110
You have arranged the meeting with the professor?

225
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,550
Yes, I told him we want to ask his advice on the development of Miryeong Forest and he accepted.

226
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,830
Let me take you there directly.

227
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,700
Nice to meet you. I'm Park Hyung Soo from Naseong Development.

228
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,330
Nice to meet you.

229
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,910
Yes.

230
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,630
Kang San Hyeok is with the professor now.

231
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,260
Let me take care of it.

232
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,720
You've written a few columns about the helicopter noise of the Miryeong Special Rescue team.

233
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,150
Do you have any particular reason for your interest in Miryeong Forest?

234
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,450
That's because I work close to that forest.

235
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,940
What specific thing would you like me to consult with you about the resort business?

236
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,500
You said that the noise of the helicopter doesn't affect the village residences

237
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,880
Do you really think so?

238
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,060
It's not my thought, it's a result of the study.

239
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,990
I believe Naseong wants the same conclusion.

240
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,230
Excuse me...

241
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,580
Director!

242
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,500
Are you okay?

243
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,100
What is he doing?

244
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,930
You're alive. I thought that you must be dead from a critical injury.

245
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,890
Injury? What do you mean?

246
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,860
Haven't you had your cheekbone muscle injured?

247
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,480
Those cheekbones never seemed to come down at all.

248
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,050
I thought you've had a cheekbone augmentation surgery.

249
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:07,400
Only if you don't twist words, I'd be willing to do the same surgery for you.

250
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,560
Is there any reason to speak sweetly to someone who says they won't cry if I'm gone?

251
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,580
To someone who won't cry if something happens to me?

252
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,780
Do what you like.

253
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,330
No matter what happens to Mr. Kang, there will be no reason to cry.

254
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,290
See you later.

255
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,720
What? Will you be there too?

256
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,740
Who am I, after all? The holy one who takes responsibility for so many lives...

257
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,260
- Cheekbone augmentation.
- Cheekbone ...

258
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,160
This drill was assigned to every regional air rescue team.

259
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,100
It is a competition only for new crew members.

260
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,290
Scouts only have handheld GPS units and coordinates.

261
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,260
You have to follow your course to find your own destination.

262
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,120
The one who arrives at the destination fastest will be the victor.

263
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,080
Please distribute the GPS units.

264
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,260
Fighting! Fighting!

265
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,790
Is it ok to let newbie Kang San Hyeok participate?

266
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,850
He hasn't had any GPS training.

267
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,740
The other rescue teams have veterans, not novices.

268
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,790
You want to be drafted with a novice badge?

269
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,030
If a novice like me takes the first place, our team would get extra points.

270
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,630
Please let me go. I'll bring back the first-place badge.

271
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,940
Rank isn't important.

272
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,830
Soon Tae is going to go so don't say another word.

273
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,970
I don't know about rank but points matter.

274
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,140
If our team becomes the best team, we'd be eligible for equipment.

275
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,710
Wouldn't it be easier to request for an improvement of working conditions?

276
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,770
I'll get extra points.

277
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:51,950
If I get those points, please acknowledge me as an official crew member.

278
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,460
Instead of the pathetic entrance card,

279
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,690
please give me the real pass as well as the right treatment.

280
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,470
Yes, sir.

281
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,380
Welcome, Doctor.

282
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:14,410
I asked you to be on stand by with us in case of an accident.

283
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,290
Sure, you need a medic, considering the scale of the drill.

284
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,120
That's right.

285
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,640
Mr. Kang San Hyeok?

286
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,050
Get ready!

287
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,740
Get ready!

288
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,050
Fighting!

289
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,330
Fighting!

290
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,060
- He is fast.
- Yes, he is.

291
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,090
I don't believe it.

292
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,710
He is fast!

293
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,690
As I expected, Hyung San Hyeok is the fastest one.

294
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,190
He is.

295
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,160
He's been troublesome.

296
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,640
Oh yeah, he is really fast.

297
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,850
He has great stamina.

298
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,360
What's that?

299
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,450
That's a valley.

300
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,160
Who jumped into a valley?

301
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,450
That punk.

302
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,100
What's that?

303
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,110
What's that? What's happening? What is it?

304
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,290
Mr. Kang San Hyeok...

305
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,070
It’s a hidden trail.

306
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,050
If we go through there, we can quickly get home.

307
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,530
Rescue team, go to area C19.

308
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,970
Stand by next to the helicopter. Go now.

309
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,940
- I will go with them.
- You cannot.

310
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,830
Since the rescue team has already left, they'll be back soon.

311
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,670
I'll be leaving with a defibrillator.

312
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,100
If the crew goes, it will be faster. Doctor Jeong, please stay here.

313
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,650
I will go. I know what I am doing.

314
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,730
The finish point... is there!

315
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,260
There!

316
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,420
Rescue Squad

317
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,950
Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok!!!

318
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,950
You should show up. Show up!

319
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,070
Kang San Hyeok?

320
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:10,510
What's that? Are you pulling a crying face because of me?

321
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,720
♬ The chaos which unfolds in front of me ♬

322
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,070
♬ In countless stories ♬

323
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,520
♬ While listening, sometimes holding my breath, ♬

324
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,060
♬ I approach closer. ♬

325
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,500
♬ The hopes which can be seen in the distance ♬

326
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,090
♬ Without a word of sweet comfort ♬

327
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,400
♬ Just scatter ♬

328
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,720
♬ and disappear. ♬

329
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,530
♬ My feelings, my loneliness, ♬

330
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,470
♬ My silence, depression ♬

331
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,400
- Ms. Yeong Jae!
- It’s an emergency!

332
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,120
Hurry and take a look.

333
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm going to live, too. I plan to proceed like that.

334
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,770
When I was young, did I live in the Gangwon Province of Miryeong?

335
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:06,560
Kang San Hyeok joined the rescue team for the very same reason.

336
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,290
Will you just let this happen?

337
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,880
I’ve started everything.

338
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,020
Stop pretending that you care for the residents here.

339
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,770
You need permission to cross other’s boundaries.

340
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,260
Do you think we even have a shot at dating?

341
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,390
Your heart says I’m right.
