00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,550
Episode 3

2
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,380
How can you drive on this road with only one hand on the steering wheel?

3
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,190
Someone might think I begged you to get in the car.

4
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,590
If you're going to continue asking such rude questions, then get off now.

5
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,700
I don't have the patience to transport someone who questions me.

6
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,800
Well, it's...

7
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,880
I was saying you were an expert at driving.

8
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,600
How is it possible? To drive down this road with just one hand?

9
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh! Unbelievable.

10
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,210
But, what are you doing in a remote place like this?

11
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,200
Why are you in a cast?

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,020
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae, what are you doing in a remote place like this?

13
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,080
Did you screw up?

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,540
Did you kill someone during surgery?

15
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,060
Are you always this negative? Isn't it obvious?

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,160
I am offering my sacred medical services to this place that lacks medical care.

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,330
So you were fired.

18
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,260
I wasn't really fired... Oh!

19
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,910
Here, here. It's right over there.

20
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,770
But wait, the road going up was going down?

21
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,830
Is this a haunted road?

22
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,890
Why the abrupt stop?

23
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,830
What happened to the person who said he drove unbelievably well with only one hand?

24
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,400
Did he have an out-of-body experience? Excuse me!

25
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,830
Excuse me?!

26
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,530
Will you be quiet.

27
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,760
If someone didn't act like a nut job,

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,090
this never would have happened.

29
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,190
Ouch. I'm in pain.

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,500
What?

31
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,900
What? Why are you looking at me with that expression?

32
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,800
Pretend this is a medical procedure to protect your patient.

33
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,120
Excuse me, this is not a hospital.

34
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,230
Unless I've lost my mind, why would I push the car when I can just walk?

35
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,190
Thank you for the ride, although it was uncomfortable.

36
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,340
Offer your medical service?

37
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,730
I know. I closed the window in case you might catch a cold.

38
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,210
So holy.

39
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,930
Anyway, thank you!

40
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,020
Continue with your nonsensical and cool driving.

41
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,920
He doesn't let anything slide.

42
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,830
But really. How did I meet that person here?

43
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,140
Miryeong Hospital

44
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,960
Really.

45
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,470
Really.

46
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,220
Miryeong Hospital

47
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,360
How can a hospital be in a place like this...

48
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,930
It's cold.

49
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,960
Don't worry.

50
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,000
The heater isn't working. Why is it so cold?

51
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,700
Excuse me? Is anyone here?

52
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,850
Excuse me? Anyone?

53
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,660
Someone is here!

54
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,180
You don't look like a villager. Where are you from?

55
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:51,240
Hello. I'm Jeong Yeong Jae from Myeongseong University Hospital in Seoul.

56
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,850
Room number one.

57
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,060
Are you the nurse?

58
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,220
Where is room number one?

59
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,820
Exam Room 1

60
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,350
♫ Beautiful ♫

61
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,160
Excuse me.

62
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,750
Pull the thread.

63
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,900
Easy, easy, easy!

64
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,220
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

65
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,380
I'm late. I'm late. Jeez.

66
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,160
Tyrannosaurus.

67
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,540
Put your paper down and fold it into a triangle. Ta-da!

68
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,930
Tyranno... Tyrannosaurus Rex.

69
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,950
I'm the best hunter.

70
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,000
Are you the neuroscientist?

71
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,330
This is called the ice-cream fold.

72
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,940
It looks like ice cream, right?

73
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,000
Nurse Kim, why did you send in a patient without informing me over the intercom.

74
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,720
Traveler? What do you need?

75
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,430
What prescription do you need?

76
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,750
I'll introduce myself.

77
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm surgeon Jeong Yeong Jae from Myeongseong University Hospital.

78
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,680
Seoul Myeongseong University Hospital.

79
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,030
You really came!

80
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,690
What is there to gain in the boonies like this? Especially a surgeon?

81
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,290
What?

82
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,790
There is nothing much about life.

83
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,880
Try working here then.

84
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,730
It's not like you'll end up dying here.

85
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,400
- What's your dream?
- What?

86
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,830
By dream, you mean...

87
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,840
I should be a respected surgeon

88
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,200
and saving people's lives.

89
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,860
Forget about it. This isn't a place to have dreams.

90
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,940
Don't cause problems. No-mind and no-thought, do you understand?

91
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,430
How can you let the exam room become like this?

92
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,990
Because there was no doctor.

93
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,760
There was no one to exam patients, so there was no reason to upkeep the exam room.

94
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,360
Why didn't you hire a doctor for so long?

95
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,690
Not as if anyone would have volunteered to come.

96
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,660
There is so much dust!

97
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,620
Yes, so you're wasting your time.

98
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,440
This is all...

99
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,020
A waste of time?

100
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,270
Why should you dust things off when it will only collect dust again?

101
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,990
- Right?
- What?

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,670
Facing southeastern is best and the snow melts the fastest in the winter.

103
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,410
It isn't good for a ski resort.

104
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,070
Since it's near a creek, the cost to make man-made snow is low. Pass.

105
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,500
The forest is dense and has been preserved well.

106
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,210
If it ranks high on the environmental impact scale, it will be hard to develop. Fail.

107
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,610
There's enough space to build a hotel and buildings.

108
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,770
The cost of landscaping the mountains will be saved. Pass.

109
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,240
Rescue

110
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,860
That's what I'm saying. I want so badly to make my father's wish come true.

111
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,900
But my car is lacking. What should I do?

112
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,250
Anyways, I'll put my life on the line for the Hospital Director's orders.

113
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,370
So, I'm getting a new car.

114
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,460
Aaah. I love you, Dad. I just saw you but I want to see you again.

115
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,380
I should do it. I should escort the punk who can't find his way home alone.

116
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,080
Thanks for switching my car already.

117
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,120
Jeong Yeong Jae.

118
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,080
What is this, some haunted house experience?

119
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,540
I was dragged to some remote location and it looks like zombies will come of out the hospital.

120
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,480
The general physician and nurse here are loony too.

121
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,570
Forget patients, there isn't even an ant.

122
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,380
What do I do?

123
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,050
Clear my mind, my ass! I feel like I've been exiled.

124
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,250
Exiled to the mountains!

125
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,800
Relax, relax. Think positively, friend.

126
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,940
If it's a mountain, the air must be wonderful!

127
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,180
Hey, aren't tigers going to come out? A tiger?

128
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,130
You'll be forced to upgrade your life.

129
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,370
You jerk! I'm dying here!

130
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,890
Hey, did they already hire someone for my position?

131
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,280
Who came?

132
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,320
Look at you still hung up on this place, when you're the one who ruined it for yourself.

133
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,950
I saw someone new walking around with the surgeon team so I asked who it was. They hired someone.

134
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,400
Hello? Yeong Jae!

135
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,190
I don't know, I don't know!

136
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,780
Was it good enough for a resort?

137
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,250
Just. Not bad.

138
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,450
What about Taeseong? Why do they want to build a resort in just a "not bad" forest?

139
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,780
I'm trying to collect all the information but...

140
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,850
I haven't found a person who knows about it.

141
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,850
You have to give credit to Director Han, he penetrated the airtight security and found out this information.

142
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,100
Director Han is such a crafty guy.

143
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,130
What about the CEO? Is he going to approve the 100 billion won?

144
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,880
The power of Taeseong Group is hair-raising.

145
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,710
The CEO never even looked in Director Han's direction, but he approved of this deal from the start.

146
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,380
Sir.

147
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,970
Come in.

148
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,960
How is your injury? Is it all right?

149
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,650
I'm well enough that I even forget I have a cast.

150
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:40,080
I almost lost the top star in this industry by wanting to acquire Jang Logistics.

151
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,910
Don't you have something to say to me?

152
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,940
Are you speaking of Director Han intercepting the Union deal?

153
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:54,780
Allowing the industry top star who earned you major profits for years to be a victim of this shady business tactic,

154
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,160
is this what you are speaking of?

155
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,470
That chicken-hearted man will not have been able to do this without your approval.

156
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,090
You're right. You just had to pass out in front of a client, of all people,

157
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,360
and almost lost a project worth billions of won. That is what I'm talking about.

158
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,070
The chicken-hearted Director Han managed to persuade the client,

159
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,020
why would I say no?

160
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:27,200
Whether it's you or Director Han, my only instructions were to bring in major profits.

161
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,620
Have you forgotten?

162
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,740
Of course, not.

163
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,100
I did all sorts of dirty work to follow your instructions.

164
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,080
Of course.

165
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,200
That is why I like you Director Kang. You are like me.

166
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,770
So take a breather now. It's about time.

167
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,890
Stop doing irrational things

168
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:57,330
and look after your health, so you don't do anything to lose a client's trust.

169
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,600
President.

170
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,990
There's still time for the meeting.

171
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,520
What does he mean by 'take a breather'?

172
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,110
Did he really ditch you for Director Han because of that one unforeseeable situation?

173
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,460
How much did you make for him? This is nonsense.

174
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,620
It is not nonsense. Don't you know that CEO is more than capable of this?

175
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,490
He changes his mask dozens of times a day.

176
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,330
So is he really going to support that project? Will Director Han get approval?

177
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,470
He won't get approval when I'm here.

178
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,730
He screwed over Director Na. He should not get approval for the sake of justice.

179
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,340
Go bring the thing.

180
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,450
What? Thing?

181
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,800
Our insurance in case something like this happened.

182
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,880
Go bring the insurance documents. Just the Taeseong Group ones.

183
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,750
What? Insurance?

184
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,520
Okay.

185
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,480
How could there be such a hospital? This place is a dream.

186
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,190
However, a doctor like me should train under you for a bit longer...

187
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,980
at Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital.

188
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,430
I must emphasize Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital.

189
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,360
Hospital Director!

190
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,070
Did you arrive safely?

191
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,660
I've prepared something special since I heard Dr. Jeong was coming here.

192
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,130
There's a person to guide you too!

193
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,810
I have great expectations for you!

194
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,520
I will look after Miryeong, Dr. Jeong.

195
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,030
He should just look after the hospital.

196
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,860
Who did he send and why aren't they here yet?

197
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,360
It's been a while since I've been off the clock.

198
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,200
Excuse me?

199
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,330
Excuse me!

200
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,440
Yes?

201
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,010
Are you here to pick me up?

202
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,480
I would love to but I'm not.

203
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,090
I'm here to pick up a doctor,

204
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,100
probably not a beauty like you.

205
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,750
Mr. Park has left work.

206
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:45,030
Do you work here, too? You, the nurse, must be new to here, right?

207
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,340
I'm waiting for Dr. Jeong...

208
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,230
Please get in.

209
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,280
You must laugh a lot.

210
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,320
My mother says she accidentally consumed poison laughing mushroom while she was pregnant with me.

211
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,840
She says I was laughing when she gave birth to me,

212
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,060
instead of crying.

213
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,270
I understand your upset expression, it's inevitable since you came to Miryeong Hospital.

214
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,130
Do you know about Miryeong Hospital?

215
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,230
I do know that none of the villagers go to that hospital.

216
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,760
They don't go there? No one?

217
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,730
Besides me, all the villagers are elders. There are no chairs in the lobby

218
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,580
and there is loud idol music blaring from the TV.

219
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,820
The heating is turned off so it feels like Siberia inside. Do you think the elders would go there?

220
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,640
Is it because of Dr. Park?

221
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,990
Your reality is Miryeong Hospital, but keep your head up.

222
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,700
I'll bring you some laughing mushroom.

223
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,280
Do you live in Miryeong Village?

224
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,960
It's surprising, isn't it?

225
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,260
It's hard for me to try to live like a New Yorker, but what can I do?

226
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,300
This is where my hyungnim lives?

227
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,320
Hyungnim?

228
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,200
My old fogey.

229
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,880
Thank you.

230
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,000
Go safely!

231
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,720
If you have any emergencies, call me.

232
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,580
Don't struggle on your own.

233
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,150
Miryeong 119 special rescue team, Choi Chang?

234
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,230
What an unusual structure...

235
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,620
What's that over there?

236
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,390
Greenhouse?

237
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,390
I don't know.

238
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,420
What is this?

239
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,070
Korean salarymen's fantasy: Tae Seong Min.

240
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:50,530
I don't know how you got to tell the company's confidential information but...

241
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,770
It's a gift since I think you better switch teams to work with me.

242
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,990
I think you made a mistake.

243
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,150
I don't know about that.

244
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,950
Director Kim?

245
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,270
Do you know which skin is the softest on a person?

246
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,310
It's the back.

247
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,050
Every person has a weakest spot.

248
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,980
If you put a fishing hook in that spot, it's game over.

249
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,490
Who do you think let me know that spot?

250
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,960
Director Han?

251
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,450
These are photos from Director Han's office.

252
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,880
Looks like you have a lot of affection for your old college sunbae.

253
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,560
You even took these photos.

254
00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:00,580
Are you confident you won't be betrayed by someone who secretly made this photographic evidence?

255
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,460
Are you sure you haven't been caught already?

256
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,490
What is the reason why Taeseong is trying to make a resort in Miryeong forest?

257
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,920
From now on you just need to give me information about Taeseong.

258
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,960
And give Director Han false information.

259
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,370
I will pay you double what Director Han was paying you.

260
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,930
Taeseong

261
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,540
This is why we buy insurance!

262
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,620
No need to ignore the fast route.

263
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:58,820
Now that you've bribed all of his informants, Director Han is screwed.

264
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,830
Check over there first.

265
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,880
Taeseong fired the executive who was in charge of the Miryeong project and sent someone new.

266
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,320
He isn't an employee of Taeseong Group but an outside recruit.

267
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,900
We have little information about that person but...

268
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,400
Any project he touches succeeds.

269
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,070
I knew our CEO is a walking calculator.

270
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,870
There was a reason behind his supporting Director Han.

271
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,310
We can't let Director Han have a gold-mine like this. No way.

272
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,920
But it is really nice.

273
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,400
Wow, look at how thick that tree is.

274
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,020
What about that side? Did you check there?

275
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,510
There is a restricted area. I didn't know it was there, I didn't see it on the map.

276
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,760
What should we do?

277
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,390
We must leave now if you want to look into the urgent matters.

278
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,410
Go up first with the employees.

279
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,460
We can't come again so I'll finish looking around.

280
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,980
Over there, come out!

281
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,110
The person with the khaki jacket, come out!

282
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,660
How did you come here, Sir?

283
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,230
You're not allowed to be here, Sir.

284
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,850
Did you not see the sign coming in?

285
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,240
I'm a photographer. I didn't see the warning sign.

286
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,740
You're subject to a fine. Let me see your ID.

287
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,650
Excuse me? A fine?

288
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,130
Oh Bo Mi

289
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,830
Special Judicial Police Officer?

290
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,550
I am Oh Bo Mi, Enforcement Officer of the Forest Environment Division of Miryeong County.

291
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,640
As the person in charge of the Miryeong environment, I have the honor of being the special judicial police officer.

292
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,730
Since you've trespassed on the restricted property,

293
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,980
based on the environmental protection article 57 paragraph 5,

294
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,150
you will be fined 200,000 won.

295
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,250
This isn't a court.

296
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,220
I just got on the wrong road. Isn't this too much?

297
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,980
Yes, give me your ID.

298
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,010
It seems like you're really enjoying your role as a police officer.

299
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,250
I'm just doing my best for society.

300
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,360
Kang...

301
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,430
Oh, it was perfect up until that!

302
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,110
Do you have a pen?

303
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,490
Well, Goon Ryeong Mi (reading backwards)...

304
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,540
I don't have a pen, and I'm busy, so.

305
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,660
Kang San Hyeok... 850425...

306
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,720
10850425-10...0...
