1
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,350
Assemblyman, please help us contribute to the resort complex business

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,200
in the breakthrough development of your district.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,610
You are offering to help our district get the best of both worlds, what reason would there be for me to decline?

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,330
It's just...

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,950
it won't be easy since it's a provincial forest and the special rescue team is stationed here.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,750
That is why I've come to see you.

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,510
Developing land for the country is not something just anyone can do.

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,600
I will make sure to relocate the special rescue team.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,090
Assemblyman, please be our business partner and not just someone who helps us get the development permits now.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,060
But what you need right now is a justification.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,530
Without that, I can't move rapidly either.

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,180
Don't worry about that.

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,630
We've started taking measures to ensure that it will be impossible to get a level 1 rating in the environmental impact assessment.

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,500
We've prepared everything for all the subequent steps also to ensure this.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,380
I will show you clear results very soon.

16
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,160
I knew he would look for a justification first.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,280
If there is a justification, it's the beginning and end of the story for the media.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,260
Have you scheduled all the meetings?

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,190
Yes. You can head straight there.

20
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,700
Once Miryeong Forest gets developed, imagine the positive impact it would have on the local economy.

21
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,550
A respected reporter like you, Mr. Kim, must be a part of this.

22
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,430
Isn't that so?

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,550
Do you know how many jobs a single large resort complex creates,

24
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,930
Reporter Jeong?

25
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,460
Shouldn't the citizens know how much the income per household will increase?

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,360
Reporter Park. Parking lot B1.

27
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,880
Have you worked everything out with the other reporters?

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,100
Yes, all the articles will be released in order tomorrow.

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,140
An agency to respond to comments will start working at the same time.

30
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,880
Once the article is released is when the game starts.

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,120
We must create a justification and change public opinion to favor the development, so make sure everything goes smoothly.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,620
Don't worry, Director. It's not new for us to be manipulating the comments.

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,320
Nurse Kim, the shade of Onsan mountain has gotten darker.

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,630
The shade must have gotten darker because it's time for it to get darker.

35
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,490
I can't tell that time is going by when I'm here.

36
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,520
What is it? What is it now?

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,850
Share with me, your connections.

38
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,240
Connections?

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,900
What connections?

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
This is the only bag I have.
The spelling for connection in Korean is the same as bag.

41
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,100
Look here, Dr. Jeong.

42
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,500
Since I'm stuck in a place like this, I must look like an idiot to you.

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,030
But what do you know?

44
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,820
The Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital controller and general manager are all friends of mine.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,250
I hear it was the work of your sponsor?

46
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,270
Sponsor?

47
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:13,740
Look at your acting! It blows Hollywood out of the water! That's what you call method acting. So shameless!

48
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:21,370
The patients on the shuttle, I know they were sent by your sponsor, not the hospital chief!

49
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,760
What are you talking about, Dr. Park?

50
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,430
Don't beat around the bush and say it straight. What sponsor?

51
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,300
Are you going to continue denying it?

52
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,110
There were no plans of sending a shuttle here, to begin with!

53
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,800
But some sponsor offered to pay for everything so to continue sending patients here! That was the deal! Why all of a sudden?

54
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,210
Why would someone with all that money be interested in Miryeong Hospital? Why?

55
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,570
You were so antsy about not having any patients here, so wouldn't you know?

56
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,530
Wouldn't you, who was so excited to have patients here know why?

57
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,170
Listen up, Dr. Jeong.

58
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,980
Don't make things hard for me because of the show you're putting on.

59
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,700
Just ask your damn sponsor to transfer you to the hospital in Seoul!

60
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,900
Stop pretending that you care for the residents here.

61
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,220
You're just trying to do everything you want with the power of your sponsor. So pretentious.

62
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm going to continue to be pretentious.

63
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,310
What?

64
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,050
Requesting the shuttle bus or whatever has nothing to do with me.

65
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,770
If I were going to grab a sponsor and do things my way,

66
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,720
I wouldn't have wasted my energy bickering with you, who interferes with everything I do and makes me lose my temper.

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,430
Regardless, I'm going to continue putting on a show.

68
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,020
Although I'm unsure if it's pretentious or not.

69
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,800
First Aid Box
Miryeong 119 Special Rescue Team

70
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,470
Mountain seaweed soup?

71
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,260
I'm curious what that would taste like.

72
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,900
5th sale of trees announcement

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,260
Winning bidder: Miryeong Forestry

74
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,900
Enforcement officer Oh!

75
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,910
Why are you coming out of there? And you're not in uniform.

76
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm off duty today, but I'm here since you asked to see me.

77
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,020
Miryeong Forestry.

78
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,800
What about Miryeong Forestry?

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,330
Miryeong Forestry won another bid in the tree sales. With the highest bid amount.

80
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,530
It's only natural to win the bid if they bid the highest amount.

81
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,030
What's... wrong with that?

82
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,460
That's because the bid amount is not profitable.

83
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,290
I looked through the documents and not only this time,

84
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,370
but all the bids that Miryeong Forestry has won have produced ridiculously low profits.

85
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,440
Why would they conduct business at a loss?

86
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,870
Do you know where they're making a profit?

87
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,470
I was on my way to go fishing, so I'll see you next time Enforcement officer Oh.

88
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,560
Let's go together, then.

89
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,800
Pardon?

90
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,530
So,

91
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,970
the reason Miryeong Forestry can buy at such a high amount

92
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,310
is because they hire elderly workers at a low wage.

93
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,710
Where would the elders be able to find work?

94
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,230
Miryeong Forestry is winning bids and giving them work.

95
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,970
That can't be the only reason?

96
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,310
There definitely is something else.

97
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,370
You don't happen to know why and are hiding it from me, are you?

98
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,560
Ouch. That hurts.

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,870
Enforcement Officer, you're whipping me with your eyes again.

100
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,240
Hide what? I don't know anything.

101
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,900
There's something...

102
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,670
I can smell it.

103
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,880
Enforcement officer Oh, why are you so obsessed with Miryeong Forestry?

104
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,330
Because I like it.

105
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,360
What? You like it?

106
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,140
I enjoy pursuing and catching culprits, things like that.

107
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,290
It makes my heart race. When I arrived in Miryeong

108
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,700
and saw the suspicious documents of Miryeong Forestry, I thought, "This is it".

109
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,450
I will find out the source of this smell!

110
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,470
There's nothing to really call a source. You're going to be disappointed.

111
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,840
Pardon?

112
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
Hit!

113
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,910
Oh, keep!

114
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,830
Nice. It's a big one!

115
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,640
Got it!

116
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,710
Wow. Daebak!

117
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,870
Wow!

118
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,970
What are you doing right now?

119
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,830
Why would you release your catch?

120
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,020
In fly fishing, you're supposed to release the fish you caught.

121
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,810
What?

122
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,600
Then why would you work so hard to catch the fish? It's in vain.

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,030
So I can release them.

124
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,370
Because of the in vain feeling when I release something I've worked so hard to get my hands on.

125
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,540
What?

126
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,570
It may sound odd, but it relieves my stress.

127
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,270
When I tried so hard to catch something I didn't know this,

128
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,770
but it becomes nothing when I let it go.

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,180
So that's why you got addicted? For the satisfaction of letting go.

130
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,350
I'm addicted to the satisfaction of letting go and you're addicted to the satisfaction of having something in your grasp?

131
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,720
Are you okay?

132
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,100
Yeah, something urgent came up.

133
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,120
I'll be back after I take care of this so make sure everything is ready.

134
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,540
Aren't you a bit old to be playing in the water?

135
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,840
Aren't you a bit young to be acting like an old fogey?

136
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,620
You'll come to regret your crude manners in which gratitude is nowhere to be found.

137
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,430
- Inside this...
- Thank you–

138
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,600
What are you doing? You didn't even see what was inside.

139
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,310
Why does your greeting feel like you're picking a fight?

140
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,170
Jeez. So probing.

141
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,560
Probing?

142
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes, I'm smiling like a lunatic all thanks to you sending a shuttle bus full of patients.

143
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,660
I thought it was done with my strength, not money, and I felt like I had achieved something like some idiot.

144
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,290
Yeah. But then, so what?

145
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,850
Why should I be grateful for a gift that I didn't ask for,

146
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,540
and be nagged at for playing in the water?

147
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,580
Are you close to me? Do we have some kind of relationship?

148
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,560
Why are you meddling in my business? Why are you acting as if you know me?

149
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,580
You have a severe inferiority complex. There's something you're mistaken about,

150
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,390
but not all people give something because they want something in return.

151
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,960
So you don't have to react so sensitively because you can't give me something in return.

152
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,740
That might be a compulsive stance like saying,

153
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,210
I'm different from that loser who left me for the rich girl.

154
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,470
How funny.

155
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,960
You provide an unasked for favor will and then mistake it for progress in a relationship.

156
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,150
That typical barbarity is exactly what you're doing right now.

157
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,900
Excuse me, Mr. Narcissist, know it all.

158
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,180
You should meddle in someone else's business when they approve of it.

159
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,770
You and I aren't close enough for you to say what you just said.

160
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,710
Don't assume things, when you don't know anything. Do you understand?

161
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,860
You're the one who asked me out.

162
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,160
I don't want to date you. You're not my type!

163
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,870
I am so baffled right now.

164
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,150
I'm not your type? I'm not?

165
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,430
I am so baffled.

166
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,720
I found a large wetland,

167
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,620
I'll send you the photos so look into it and take care of it.

168
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,800
Are you okay?

169
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,260
Can you think straight?

170
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,870
Yes, I'm okay.

171
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,940
Did you see a wild animal or something?

172
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,890
Why would a young man

173
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,260
be so shocked as if he's seen a ghost or something?

174
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,460
You must be a tourist. If you don't know your way around here, then head back down now.

175
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,270
Don't cause any problems.

176
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,720
Do you live in the Miryeong Village?

177
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,480
Do I live there?

178
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,480
Yes, it would be best to target Choi Jeong Mok's son first as well.

179
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
Choi Chang?

180
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,140
Do you happen to know where rescue team member Choi Chang lives?

181
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,090
If I had known that Chang would have a guest, I would've made some rice cakes.

182
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,900
What a shame.

183
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,950
It's all right. Sunbae Choi isn't home so I should get going soon.

184
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,700
You see...

185
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,560
My son Chang doesn't have a heavy butt, so he never sticks around the home on his day off.

186
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,540
This is the first time a rescue team co-worker has visited our home.

187
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,030
He's like a paper windmill.

188
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,160
Drink your tea.

189
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:35,140
Rumor has it that Sunbae Choi is a devoted son. I can see it's because he has an admirable father.

190
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,090
There are no young people in the village, yet he doesn't leave the city.

191
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,510
I know. I keep telling him to go live abroad,

192
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,460
but he only wants to work on the special rescue team.

193
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,960
I'm breaking apart inside.

194
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,040
He's always putting himself in danger.

195
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,040
What am I saying in front of a fellow rescue team member?

196
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:06,460
If you want to send Sunbae Choi to the city, shouldn't you move first?

197
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,650
Sunbae Choi is such a devoted son that if you don't move out of Miryeong village,

198
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,180
neither will he.

199
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,010
Since Miryeong Forestry is here, I can't just move away.

200
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,240
That's complete nonsense.

201
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,280
It is, isn't it?

202
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,170
I already know, but I can't help saying such a nonsensical thing because I feel unfortunate about Sunbae Choi.

203
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:42,000
Sunbae Choi excels as a rescue team member so he always takes charge in dangerous situations.

204
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,650
Recently, a sunbae of mine fell off a cliff and nearly died.

205
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,060
There are times I'm worried that something like that will happen to Sunbae Choi.

206
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,200
To my Chang?

207
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,260
What the heck, Kang San Hyeok?

208
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,090
What?

209
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,750
Why did you go to my house yesterday?

210
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,250
Because I missed you. As a fellow villager, I was wondering what you were up to on the weekend.

211
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,680
Is something wrong with that?

212
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,800
Sure you did. You blabbed your mouth to my dad about useless things like our job being dangerous

213
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,040
and caused an uproar. You're screwing with me.

214
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,560
Because you want me to suffer.

215
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,110
Sunbae, you're quite twisted.

216
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,950
Distorting my pure fellowship as a co-worker like that.

217
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,950
I really, seriously, went there because I missed you.

218
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,400
I've grown attached because of all our bickering.

219
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,070
This is the first time meeting someone who is more of a weasel than I am.

220
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,210
Just thinking about Hyungnim nagging at me to quit the rescue team... Jeez!

221
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,420
You carcinogen.

222
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,940
Collapse accident, dispatch now. Collapse accident, dispatch now.

223
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,160
C07 zone. The cabin is in danger.

224
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,780
One 76-year-old male is stuck inside.

225
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,900
It's collapsing.

226
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,890
Sir, open the door now!

227
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,850
I don't need your help. Nothing is wrong with this cabin, so leave!

228
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,720
I'll take care of it! I'll do it!

229
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,950
Please look at me! Put that down!

230
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,160
Sir, we have to get out of here!

231
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,450
I can't leave. How can I leave this cabin behind?

232
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,550
This place was left unscathed when everything else was burned down in the Miryeong Forest fire.

233
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,510
Choi Chang!

234
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,840
Hospital

235
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,830
- Doctor.
- Noona.

236
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,710
Emergency patient!

237
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,030
Kang San Hyeok!

238
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,720
Chang!

239
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,560
- It's nothing.
- It's okay. It's okay.

240
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,420
Move them inside. Hurry!

241
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,150
I gave you an anesthetic.

242
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
I gave it to you.

243
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,490
I know it doesn't hurt because of the anesthetic.

244
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,440
I see that you're both awake now.

245
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,280
Luckily, the main blood vessels weren't damaged, so I just stitched up the wound.

246
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,950
You will have to finish the painkillers and IV fluids,

247
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,520
and stay for another few hours so we can monitor you to ensure there aren't any other problems.

248
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,480
Please check their vitals every half hour.

249
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,270
Yes, Doctor.

250
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:50,710
Yeong Jae, it hurts so much. Is something wrong?

251
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,900
I think one of my blood vessels burst? Isn't this an emergency? Take a look, now!

252
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,800
I am more urgent! Me first! Me first!

253
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,190
I said I'm first! Do you think a blood vessel is a joke?

254
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Doctor.

255
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,490
These patients don't look so good,

256
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,850
so I will personally give them their shot.

257
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,860
Both of you pull down your pants.

258
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,530
Why did you do that? Now I'm indebted to you.

259
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,850
I'm already regretting it.

260
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,890
You're such an odd character.

261
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,410
You keep doing things you would never do.

262
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,760
During Hyung Man Soo's accident and then today...

263
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,600
You're undercover, aren't you?

264
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,740
A strategy to hide your overwhelmingly dark life?

265
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,670
Why?

266
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,650
You said you'd never believe me, are you wavering?

267
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:32,390
Well, you've probably never met such an unbelievably perfect role model before.

268
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,470
It's no wonder you'd waver.

269
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,780
I understand.

270
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,520
I feel sorry for that mouth of yours.

271
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,200
It's forever responsible for the shit that comes out of that mouth.

272
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,510
Don't even dream about it.

273
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,760
My only role model is my father.

274
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,670
Your father seems like a good person.

275
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,470
Do you really think that? Really?

276
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,740
You're the first person who has a good first impression of my father.

277
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,440
Did your father raise you alone?

278
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,880
Has his business always done so well?

279
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,690
When I was younger my nickname was Choi Cheong.
Korean term for incubating and creating the perfect environment for a silkworm to break free from it's cocoon.

280
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,600
My mother passed away from difficulties while giving birth to me.

281
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,220
And my father literally raised me by begging for breast milk...

282
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,720
Then he went to the mountains to be a beekeeper... with a child on his back.

283
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,220
You were born to be a cringe ball. Everything you do makes me cringe.

284
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,010
You're definitely not my style.

285
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,130
So what if I'm not your style? What are you going to do about it?

286
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,130
You're the very type I hate as well!

287
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,060
What is it?

288
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:39,420
This hospital is so high-tech. There should be a button to press when the IV fluids are finished.

289
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,160
You're fine. You can go home now.

290
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,590
Are you still here because of me?

291
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,700
Leave with me. I'm sure walking alone at night is scary.

292
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,340
To be precise, it's not because of Kang San Hyeok,

293
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,200
but because of Kang San Hyeok and Chang that I'm still here.

294
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,360
Chang still has one IV fluid left so I can't leave yet.

295
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,020
Also, as an escort, Chang is much more gentle,

296
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,710
fun, and better than you. So don't worry and go home.

297
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,390
You must have read quite a few dating self-help books,

298
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,990
but if you're trying to make me jealous you have the wrong target.

299
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,710
I'm not a common class.

300
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,730
Okay, I'll give you a point for caring.

301
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,440
I have to go remove Chang's IV fluid.

302
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,430
That punk left. When I awoke, he was already gone.

303
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,260
Until when are you going to be like this? What is so wrong?

304
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,570
As a result, it worked out well for everyone so why are you so upset?

305
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,130
Then what about you?

306
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,280
You just did as you pleased, so why are you so bothered?

307
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,400
Why are you so obsessed about my reaction? Shall I tell you why?

308
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,070
Because I'm not reacting as you wanted.

309
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,190
I should repay you by being happy and grateful, but I'm doing the opposite.

310
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,180
Am I wrong?

311
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,670
I'm not upset because you sent a shuttle bus.

312
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,250
I do feel indebted to you, but like you said it's good for everyone.

313
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,290
I can handle the unsettling feeling.

314
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,570
But you deceived me, watched me,

315
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,240
and overstepped boundaries that I didn't allow.

316
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,150
All because you wanted to.

317
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:56,680
How can a relationship between two people be at the same speed and tolerance level?

318
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,750
Everybody is different, how can two hearts be the same?

319
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,810
That is why people match their footsteps.

320
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,980
They ask for their partner's opinion and try to walk at the same pace.

321
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,750
Forget it.

322
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:20,150
I'm positive you've never properly loved someone.

323
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,880
Are you comparing our relationship with dating?

324
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,390
I'm speaking of friendship and kindness.

325
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,640
So I said let's stop here. I refuse your friendship and kindness.

326
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,810
You should take back your opinion that I've never been in love.

327
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,920
Because that's a serious misunderstanding about me.

328
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:21,360
You've... never been in a real relationship...

329
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,890
No. You don't what a real relationship is.

330
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,590
Liar.

331
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,770
You're lying.

332
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,870
Your heart is telling me that I'm right...

333
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,140
♬ The chaos which unfolds in front of me ♬

334
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,320
♬ In countless stories ♬

335
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,890
♬ While listening, sometimes holding my breath, ♬

336
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,210
♬ I approach closer. ♬

337
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,830
♬ The hopes which can be seen in the distance ♬

338
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,340
♬ Without a word of sweet comfort ♬

339
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,210
♬ Just scatter ♬

340
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,460
Forest Preview
♬ and disappear. ♬

341
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,200
You're a woman who requires a lot of care.

342
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,290
Your heart sounded like it was on a roller coaster.

343
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,810
Are you sure you won't pass out?

344
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,000
Our helicopter air rescue team has a fatal flaw.

345
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I will sacrifice my body for Miryeong forest.

346
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,990
For Miryeong forest and not the rescue team?

347
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,280
Why is this drawing with Kang San Hyeok's belongings?

348
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,600
Let’s go after him.

349
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,950
All the people who interfere with the development are found dead by suicide.

350
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,490
I'm the only one who can save me.

351
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,040
Stop hurting yourself. I, who can't let you be alone in pain, am here beside you.

352
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
♬ Take me now ♬
