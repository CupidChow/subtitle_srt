1
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,640
Here! I am here!

2
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,830
A person in distress has been found.

3
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,400
I'll go.

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,560
Please let me go.

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,600
Here! I am here!

6
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,780
Jeong Yeong Jae!

7
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,870
Kang San Hyeok!

8
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,470
It's done. It's okay now.

9
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,350
Kang San Hyeok, pull yourself together!

10
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,890
Kang San Hyeok!

11
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,270
Kang San Hyeok!

12
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,130
What did I...

13
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,220
Kang San Hyeok, pull yourself together!

14
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,570
What did I do to the neighborhood...

15
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,250
Forest

16
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,130
Episode 1

17
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,540
Surgeon Jeong Yeong Jae, Surgeon Jeong Yeong Jae,

18
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,090
please come to Operating Room 3 immediately.

19
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,200
Excuse me, doctor!

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,630
What are you doing? Please come out, now.

21
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,610
Excuse me, doctor!

22
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,850
I can do it.
Hurry up, Doctor!

23
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,160
I can do it.
Doctor!

24
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,690
I can do it.

25
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,250
What's the condition of the patient?

26
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,850
Professor, the BP is dropping.

27
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,080
That's not an issue. Just concentrate.

28
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,970
Manila, Philippines

29
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,450
Union is a blue chip company which is growing fast with high profitability.

30
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,960
If you acquire it now, when it's undervalued, you will have a high ROI.

31
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,890
It will also lay the groundwork for dominating the Asian market.

32
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,960
In Soo, after the merger is complete, will Mr. Kang wrap it up?

33
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,700
Will you be doing the lay-offs after the merger and acquisition?

34
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,520
Lay-offs are my speciality.

35
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,280
I'll take care of it.

36
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,800
Very good. No problem.

37
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,840
I think so.

38
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,890
Okay.

39
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,520
Mr. Kang!

40
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,270
Director!

41
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,740
Are you alright?

42
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,400
Director! Director!

43
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,130
An Americano is ready.

44
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,060
Wasn't the Americano mine?

45
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,730
I gave it to you. Didn't you get it?

46
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,620
There was no other order.

47
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,220
Really?

48
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,030
Excuse me.

49
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,450
I think that coffee is mine. Are you sure you ordered one?

50
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,620
Would you just give it to me?

51
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,460
I don't have any money.

52
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,200
Excuse me?

53
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,230
I beg your pardon.

54
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,170
I really need coffee at this moment.

55
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,380
I'm Jeong Yeong Jae, a surgeon.

56
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,290
Please bring the cost of the coffee to the desk later.

57
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,190
I don't like giving it away for free. Do you understand?

58
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,820
Mr. Kang!

59
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,240
Are you okay? What are you doing here? Let's go back.Hurry.

60
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,600
Don't touch.

61
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,050
I have something important inside.

62
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,170
Okay, I'm not touching.

63
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,370
Come with us, Mr. Kang.

64
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,570
Is he your patient?

65
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,610
Psychosis?

66
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,990
No, that's not the case.

67
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,240
He is still under the influence of midazolam.

68
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,560
We could not keep his pain in check, so had to put him to sleep, but he was gone.

69
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,610
The hospital director asked to take extra care of him.

70
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,990
- Water.
- Yes, I will go.

71
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,500
My arm is on fire.

72
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,360
Bring water.

73
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,010
Okay, I'll put out the fire.

74
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,740
Let's put out the fire.

75
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,690
There is no particular problem.

76
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,140
Are you talking about the same thing again?

77
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,730
You have no physical issues that could lead to this kind of pain.

78
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,730
We took a blood test, x-ray, EMG, and MRI, but the results were all normal.

79
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,350
So what?

80
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,360
So, am I crazy?

81
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,140
I'm feeling my arm burn when there is nothing wrong.

82
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,070
You're saying that I am not sane at all.

83
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,190
It's so-called phantom pain.

84
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,590
It's similar to a person who has his arm cut off, but still feels the pain.

85
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,440
When you don't have any part of your body burned,

86
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,070
you still feel a burning pain around your arm.

87
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,240
This may have come from your memory related to a fire from the past.

88
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,720
This is more related to psychological health than your physical health.

89
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,830
No.

90
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,160
I'm sure there is something wrong with the nervous system around my arm.

91
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,140
I'd rather take a through examination in the neurology department.

92
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,540
Haven't you done everything you could?

93
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,360
Every time you passed out, we've had the same results.

94
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,100
It'd be better to find a root cause this time, instead.

95
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,830
Professor?

96
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,860
There are two kinds of human being in the world.

97
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,190
For one kind, the mind rules the body. For the other, the body rules the mind.

98
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,280
If you're looking for the latter who are weak, you've come to a wrong room.

99
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,000
Get me discharged.

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,190
I don't have to stay in the hospital any longer, the doctor has given me a clean bill of health.

101
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,360
So soon?

102
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,470
Why don't you take more tests?

103
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,320
- What if--
- How much do I make money a day?

104
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,160
Are you going to fill in for me?

105
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,290
Okay, I'll get you discharged within 30 seconds.

106
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,910
Please calm down.

107
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,130
We can't proceed with the meeting in this way.

108
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,730
How can you call this a meeting? This is just an one-way notice.

109
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,610
What do you mean by giving you guys management power?

110
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,030
You're trying to take away management.

111
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,510
You have no idea how we've grown the company.

112
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,910
What exactly have you done?

113
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,310
By engaging in criminal activities?

114
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,960
According to Article 125 of the Capital Market Act,

115
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,310
if securities purchasers suffer losses due to a significant false statement in the prospectus,

116
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,950
the seller shall be held liable for the loss and may be sentenced to a minimum of 3 years.

117
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,650
Here is the IR report from 2016 until now.

118
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,220
IR (Investor Relations): Investor relations provides investors with an accurate account of company affairs.

119
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:55,790
None of you had any idea that most things in this report are not true.

120
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,990
What do you mean by 'most things in the report are not true'?

121
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,530
Do you have proof that the IR is wrong?

122
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,410
Proof?

123
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,230
I have proof on my feet.

124
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,750
Who is conscientious enough to check it out?

125
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,660
Do we really need to do this?

126
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,070
I've told you.

127
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,990
Don't trust numbers, but your feet.

128
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,150
Numbers don't tell you the truth. You can only get the truth on your feet.

129
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,090
Geochang Distribution owns 52 centers nationwide.

130
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,520
Each center deals with 15,000 packages a day.

131
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,850
Centers handle 780,000
packages nationwide a day.

132
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,750
It comes to 284,700,000
packages nationwide a year.

133
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,300
On average, each delivery person
handles 150 packages a day.

134
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,230
There are 5,200 couriers in Geochang Logistics worldwide.

135
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,000
Thus, an estimate of 7.8 million deliveries per day.

136
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,200
284.7 million in a year.

137
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,840
The estimates match!

138
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,090
But, in the IR, last year, operating profit was 150 billion won.

139
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,990
With that amount, you should have processed 855 million express packages in a year.

140
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,720
This tripling in numbers,

141
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,720
Investors and creditors, how would you explain that?

142
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,530
President Choi Sung Sik

143
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:37,690
Has been ruining the company through negligence in management and personal diversion of funds. The company is collapsing.

144
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,290
And the loss is extreme with IR fraud and stock manipulation.

145
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,290
He's a criminal.

146
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,570
Do you still want to follow President Choi Sung Sik?

147
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,490
As an investor who invested 40 billion in Geochang Logistics,

148
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,060
Do you want to just watch the company collapse like this?

149
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,580
Give me a chance, just once.

150
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:10,160
My RLI is authorized by creditors, I'm just here to lead.

151
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,340
If you want to save this company and its countless employees together, please stay.

152
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,630
If you still want to follow a criminal,

153
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,070
You can leave.

154
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,760
Total Revenue

155
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,740
Now, let me teach you what the real IR is.

156
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,280
Oh~ Jeong Yeong Jae~, does being a surgeon feel good?

157
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,230
Look at your smiling face, how annoying.

158
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,190
What? Do you want to see how chubby I am now?

159
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm gaining weight because I don't have to see you.

160
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,590
Seriously, I think you are the only one in our department who is left, what a traitor.

161
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,050
Ugh, just stop already! This story is not old beef broth that you warm up over and over.

162
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,730
That's exactly what I want to say!

163
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,790
Aish, really?!

164
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,450
Don't you remember that you wanted to go into psychiatry?

165
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,850
You were arguing that's the only place that you want to go,

166
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,000
refusing rotations to any other department.

167
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,090
Jeong Yeong Jae, the crazy wacko.

168
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,350
Do you have a death wish?

169
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,700
You will find out if you change the concept.

170
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,800
You need a beating, first.

171
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,360
What's wrong?

172
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,890
I've got a cramp.

173
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,930
Why all of a sudden?

174
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,820
I can’t believe your love is that passionate.

175
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,350
I love you forever, my little nerd!

176
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,400
Good morning, sir.

177
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,460
Good morning, sir.

178
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,640
Mr. Kang, Union in the Philippines wants to change their M&A partner.

179
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,380
What do you mean? Is there a new investor?

180
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,650
No, they want Han Ji Yeong head of Investment Department 2.

181
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,560
Who?

182
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,530
They said they are worried about the delay in schedule after seeing you collapse.

183
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,800
But I guess Han Ji Yeong intervened.

184
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,410
They can't stop nit-picking at everything we do, and tried so hard to win against you. Now this?

185
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,770
How could you take the business of a director from another company—

186
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,160
Get out.

187
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,800
What?

188
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,120
What brings our successful Director Kang to such a humble place?

189
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,990
I heard they've done it again. They're bad at hunting, but want the meat.

190
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,190
As expected, it is a thin big hyena.

191
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,230
I can't tell who it is you're talking about.

192
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,480
How much is the Union merger worth? It's a project so how can you collapse before it?

193
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,430
If you're unwell, why don't you take this opportunity to take a big break?

194
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,720
Stop harming the company's image.

195
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,940
I would love to but there's no one to replace me.

196
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,090
My team which contributes to 70% of my company's revenue is

197
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,420
too valuable to be handed over to a loser.

198
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,490
Kang San Hyeok!

199
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,930
I feel sorry for defeating you all the time.

200
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,060
Take Union.

201
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:39,330
It's a present of a sympathy to you...

202
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,900
who have always lost because of the competent person who I am.

203
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,230
I'll let this one slide.

204
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,100
But if this kind of thing happens again, you better watch out.

205
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,410
You must already know that your 30% performance was only possible because I let it happen.

206
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:13,090
I mean if you are going to provoke me, make sure you can handle the consequences.

207
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,960
My friend.

208
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,440
Director Han recently has been excited about something. Find out what project is heating up.

209
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,430
I've got to show him what happens when you rattle my cage.

210
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,720
Yes, President.

211
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,060
You've made a good decision to get treatment.

212
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,000
That's the wrong choice of words. I'm not getting treated, but a check-up.

213
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I need to find the cause so that I won't go into a seizure at an important moment.

214
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,610
I'm not a patient.

215
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,980
You often use the word 'important moment'. What do you mean by that?

216
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,080
An important deal that's worth a large sum of money.

217
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,820
I'm not a fool to mean more than that.

218
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,000
Fortunately.

219
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,290
You mentioned that you don't have any memories before age 10.

220
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,320
Yes, I don't.

221
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,970
Would you mind closing your eyes?

222
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,860
Take a look into your own memory, not the story you heard from your deceased grandmother.

223
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,640
Close your eyes and let's see.

224
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,780
No thoughts about the fire come up at all?

225
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,310
None.

226
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,560
Can you look for the memory when you almost burned your right arm?

227
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,870
Think back carefully.

228
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,060
Is there anything that comes up?

229
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,220
No, nothing.

230
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,430
Is there something you thought of?

231
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,120
No...

232
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,870
Nothing.

233
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,840
In the end, I have no thoughts about the fire.

234
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,640
Here's your Americano.

235
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,950
Oh, wait, wait, wait for just a second!

236
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,590
What is it?

237
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,560
People can change this easily?

238
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,910
You don't remember me?

239
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,870
I guess you don't... You should though?

240
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,100
I really need to get that money back though.

241
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,260
Ah-- Hello, over here?

242
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,010
This person, you remember this person, right?

243
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,630
This person was the one that took my coffee, you saw it right?

244
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,590
Of course, I remember! He just took your coffee.

245
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,390
And didn't pay...

246
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,310
Did you hear that? Ah, how neat.

247
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,910
So now you've paid me back.

248
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,890
What is this?

249
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,080
Doctor Jeong Yeong Jae, I should be asking you that.

250
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,710
You say I asked you for coffee? Me?

251
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,020
I mean you were out of it at the time--

252
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,670
Why don't you clean your eyes to see?

253
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,440
Someone this unimaginably handsome asked you?

254
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,510
You should say things that actually make sense.

255
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,470
What are you doing right now?

256
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,130
You were standing over here, doing this...

257
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,690
This is a habit you have, you know that right?

258
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,720
You did that with my coffee last time.

259
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,750
I don't need to explain further, right? So--

260
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,330
You've heard of me, haven't you?

261
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,020
I'm a very busy person, more than you can even imagine.

262
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,630
Ah-- you can't remember anything, huh...

263
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,390
Fine, let's not go crazy over this one cup of coffee.

264
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,020
Drink it well, then!

265
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,750
Ah, hot!

266
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,210
Ow, so hot...

267
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,320
What... what was that?

268
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,150
Ah, it's fine, I'm okay, just go!

269
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,750
Ugh, so gross!

270
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,200
A person's hurting right now, but all you're thinking about is how it's gr--

271
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,290
Oh gosh, are you okay?

272
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,540
It must be so shocking, this dirtied coffee!

273
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,070
Oh no, my spit!

274
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,070
Ugh, spit--!

275
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,700
Oh, why are you throwing it away? I'd save it, especially now.

276
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,330
Even if it's hard to be a good person,

277
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,380
Don't be a sewer beetle. Just for a cup of coffee.

278
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,470
Wh- sewer beetle?!

279
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,810
Excuse me, excuse me!

280
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,880
What happened?

281
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Oh, doctor-- There was a traffic accident. Seems to be a father and his son.

282
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,450
The son's oxygen saturation is at 90% and falling. BP is 70 over 40,

283
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,150
And his pulse is 120.

284
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,430
Move him to an Operating Room immediately.

285
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,930
Oh- but we haven't done a CT scan on him yet?

286
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,650
Quickly, it's a liver rupture!

287
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,070
Ah, yes, I'll do it right now.

288
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,990
Professor! We have a patient with intraperitoneal bleeding!

289
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,230
He has a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm, he's not in good condition.

290
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,350
His son has massive bleeding from a liver rupture.

291
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,720
We're going to do both surgeries at once.

292
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,170
Professor. The police are here, requesting a doctor's note.

293
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,800
Why? Is there a problem?

294
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,720
According to the CCTV, it seems like the dad tried to kill both himself and his son.

295
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,850
Poor kid...

296
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,180
Do it after the surgery.

297
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,330
Yes, understood.

298
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,970
Ah!

299
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,360
Ah, I'm sorry!

300
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,340
What are you doing, aren't you going to stop the bleeding?

301
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,810
Yes, sir.

302
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,500
Don't get nervous, carefully, carefully--

303
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,860
Hey Jeong Yeong Jae, is your head up in the clouds?

304
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,090
Since everyone's raising you up, calling you an ace, you just want to mess around?

305
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,450
Of course not, sir.

306
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,650
Get your head on straight, huh?

307
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:55,280
Don't get so easily upset and cause accidents like these and get yourself together, okay?

308
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,620
Yes, I will.

309
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,440
The child is alive!

310
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
The child is alive!

311
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,190
Just hold on for a little longer!

312
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,950
What are you doing here? You surprised me!

313
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:53,080
Wow, my boss' nuclear fist is just like Mayweather's.

314
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,070
Ah... but babe, aren't you on duty tonight?

315
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,650
Well, I told Seon Gil to do it to pay a debt off.

316
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,190
But yes, I have to go back soon.

317
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,810
You didn't have to come all the way over here then...

318
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,910
I was planning on meeting both of you this weekend.

319
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,490
Why does that fellow act like that?

320
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,840
Did you make a mistake?

321
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,530
I should just hit him like hwak--

322
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:28,120
Come and sit. You've been longing for this restaurant's marinated crab for days.

323
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,370
I bought my pretty girlfriend

324
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,280
soup and side dishes and everything you could imagine.

325
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,430
Sit down.

326
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,280
What is it? You can't escape from this oppa's deadly charm, hm?

327
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,520
You just can't get your head on straight, can you?

328
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,920
Just shut up and stay still for a minute.

329
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,500
What's wrong? Did something happen in the operating room again?

330
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,680
No, your deadly charm just made my heart flutter, that's all.

331
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,380
Then say it.

332
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,870
Ah, I don't want to.

333
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,560
It's just three words! Three words are that hard to say?

334
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,420
Come on, I love y--

335
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,640
Ah, stop it! It's so cringy!

336
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,940
My rough little baby...

337
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,300
My baby!

338
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,500
Stop it!

339
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,020
Ah, my back is going to break!

340
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,250
My daughter, are you doing well?

341
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,820
Your dad's super upset!

342
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:58,160
If you keep staying away from home, I'll send the dark energy from my athlete's foot right between your toes!

343
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,780
Do well, my daughter!

344
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,270
What did you just say?

345
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,190
Take a closer look at your rejection of your unconscious.

346
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,400
It's possible that because the memories are so hard to handle,

347
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,780
You don't want to remember them.

348
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,810
It sounds like you'd be better at writing a novel, then being a psychiatrist.

349
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,190
Who cannot handle what?

350
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,970
Sir! When would you like to schedule the next appointment?

351
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,840
There will be no next appointment. As I expected, it was a meaningless experience.

352
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,860
Wait, I mean--

353
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,050
When I was hospitalized to be examined,

354
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,190
did something bad happen that I don't know about?
