Episode 27
Investigation Report

2
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,050
Is it true you kidnapped patient Heo Choon Sik?

3
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,390
No! I didn't take him out on my own accord! I got his guardian's consent beforehand!

4
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,130
Well the guardians are saying they never gave any consent.

5
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,630
The doctor in charge specifically said so!

6
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,080
What are you thinking, taking the patient out without the guardian's consent?

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,940
Call them then!

8
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,240
He needs to hurry and get more testing!

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,310
Wait a moment.

10
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,650
It's patient Heo Choon Sik.

11
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,990
Yes. Understood.

12
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,040
The guardian approved. You can take him.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,720
Ask the doctor in charge, whether it's the truth or not.

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,030
The doctor says he never said such a thing.

15
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,730
He testified that while he went out to call the guardians, you took the patient and disappeared.

16
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,050
How absurd! What kind of absurdity-

17
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,980
Yeong Jae!

18
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,220
San Hyeok!

19
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,760
What's going on? How dare you take this doctor who was caring for the patient and investigate her?

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,940
What's your relationship?

21
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,820
I am Jeong Yeong Jae's guardian. Why is she here?

22
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,960
Ms. Jeong Yeong Jae transferred a patient to another hospital without the guardians' consent.

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,860
In circumstances where the patient's status is critical,

24
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,990
the doctor can transfer the patient to an advanced hospital without the guardians' approval.

25
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,010
Don't you know this?

26
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,720
Let's go. There's no reason for you to be here.

27
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,200
What to do~ There's another reason why that doctor needs to stay here.

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,340
Have a seat! Sit down.

29
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,070
The deceased patient Heo Choon Sik's family is suing you for involuntary manslaughter.

30
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,520
Involuntary manslaughter??

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,820
Right before his death, you gave him an injection.

32
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,480
I never gave him an injection!

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,230
I didn't have a syringe and there was no time-

34
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,190
The paramedic who was in the ambulance with you testified.

35
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,800
That he saw you put in the injection.

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,570
The police are not conducting the investigation properly.

37
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,710
This came out of the ambulance.

38
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,410
Tell the truth,

39
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,360
Cytarabine, a medication injected into the spinal cord, and Vincristine, which must be injected into a vein

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,040
you switched the two up and injected them, right?

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,330
That's why the patient's condition suddenly worsened and resulted in death.

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,070
Those medicines are anti-cancer drugs!

43
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,100
Who in the world carries around anti-cancer drugs??

44
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,590
It's not true. Everything you said isn't true!

45
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,120
The planner behind this scheme

46
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,790
what did he ask the prosecutors to do?

47
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,550
Let's go.

48
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,060
I'll take care of this.

49
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,290
I'll take care of this issue, so don't worry.

50
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,110
Jeong Yeong Jae fell into Kwon Joo Han's trap.

51
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,090
She's being held at the police station and even has prosecution investigation to follow.

52
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,670
What? Why would Taesung go after Doctor Jeong??

53
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,340
It's because of the pollution of Miryeong Forest.

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,660
Since Jeong Yeong Jae was trying to uncover the secrets behind the pollution, they're threatening her to make her stop.

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,530
Hurry up and find out what I sent you. We don't have much time.

56
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,750
No matter the cost or methods, we must find out.

57
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,730
We must.

58
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,800
Signed by Gangwon Province Governor

59
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,530
Just like the rumors, you are quick in making your decisions.

60
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:53,410
I was going to sell the resort after building it anyway. Since you offered to pay in full,

61
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,420
there's no reason for me to hold on to it.

62
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,640
Although I am concerned about Kang San Hyeok, who even went undercover to get the job done

63
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,590
Since it's true that he messed with your plans, he must deal with the consequences.

64
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,450
What a wise and rational judgement.

65
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,290
Now you are part of my family, Chairman.

66
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,790
Yes, yes.

67
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,630
Seeing as how they covered everything up in one night, they must have been in a hurry.

68
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,040
You asked for substance analysis of this liquid sample, right?

69
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,190
Yes. However, they said no matter how much money we offered them, it still takes at least a week for the results to come out.

70
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,940
No way. In that time, Jeong Yeong Jae will be handed over to the prosecutors.

71
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,660
We need to find out ASAP.

72
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,340
What this red liquid is. What Taesung was trying to do here. We need to find out and counterattack.

73
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,830
What should we do? They say it'll take at least two weeks to do the soil analysis even after drilling.

74
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,470
Also, there's no more land to drill because Nasung Development was handed over to Taesung.

75
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,830
It's ridiculous.

76
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,830
When I went to Nasung to get my stuff, Jo Kwang Pil's henchmen opened the doors.

77
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,230
Wow, I almost cursed at them!

78
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,110
It's a good thing we pulled out all important documents after the safe was robbed.

79
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,890
Well, I knew the Chairman was that kind of person, but this is going too far!

80
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,860
After we went through that much trouble to get Miryeong forest, he stabbed us in the back!

81
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,050
How could he do that to you, Director, of all people?

82
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,400
Who made RLI!

83
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,100
The one who was tossed out is me. You, go back to the First Team.

84
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,670
Ah, I don't want to! First Team s getting placed under Director Ham. To be under that sly bastard-

85
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,360
Anyhow, I've lost all respect for the Chairman.

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,590
So let's get revenge, Director!

87
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,830
Ah, those thugs! How could they, to innocent Dr. Jeong?

88
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,560
What in the world is buried under there?

89
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,600
You said there's a professor that Taesung Hitech gave the most research money to, right?

90
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,770
Detailed expenditure report

91
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,800
Lee Seok Woo

92
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,000
Hangook University Professor Lee Seok Woo, Establishes Agreement

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,930
To Conduct Research in Collaboration with India's National Smelting Research Team

94
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,080
Miryeong Village Water Quality Analysis Report

95
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,320
Miryeong Village Survivors

96
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,840
Miryeong Village Deceased

97
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,740
Yesterday, I was dumbfounded by everything that happened.

98
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,960
But today, I feel more awake.

99
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,950
I don't know why those people are lying, but I need to think logically.

100
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,330
in order to get through this ridiculous situation.

101
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,730
I'm going to get you out within today, so don't worry-

102
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,870
I'm not worried.

103
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,530
I'm on vacation! At a hotel where the interior decor looks like a prison.

104
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,560
I'll be hold down the fort here, so don't you worry.

105
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,660
I won't lose to this ridiculous trap.

106
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,790
Um..

107
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,430
Just get to work! Why'd you call?

108
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,090
What?? The police station?!

109
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,260
I can't talk for long. About Hwang Yeon Bok, the grandma from Miryeong

110
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,360
she needs to hurry up and get tested for heavy metal poisoning.

111
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,840
They said she's at her son's place. You should be able to find the guardian's phone number in her chart.

112
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,620
It's an emergency, doctor. Please hurry!

113
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,680
Professor Lee Seok Woo?

114
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,370
I already told you I don't know! Go back.

115
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,590
What are you doing?

116
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,840
This is the current state of Miryeong Forest.

117
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,910
After Taesung secretly did something, the forest became this way.

118
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,780
Taesung Hitech, which supplied you with large amounts of research money.

119
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,610
This has nothing to do with me. Get out.

120
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,150
If you don't leave, I will call security!

121
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,390
These are pictures of people from the village.

122
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,240
This person died from high fever and pulmonary complications. And this person had lung cancer.

123
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,800
This person due to cancer. Also due to cancer.

124
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,580
And this person, just yesterday

125
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,430
passed away from leukemia.

126
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,150
A world-renowned geologist participated in killing people.

127
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,710
This document which lists the research money that Taesung gave you

128
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,690
can I send it to the reporters right now?

129
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,760
What is in Miryeong forest?

130
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:42,790
It's an unofficial mining method used by a few nuclear weapons states.

131
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,890
They place pipes around the mountain

132
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,690
and stream acid solutions through the pipes and extract the minerals.

133
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,670
But it pollutes the soil so badly that nations don't use that methodology.

134
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,260
To think they tried this method.

135
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,880
Rare earth metals..

136
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,980
There are rare earth metals in the soil?

137
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,590
According to Professor Lee's files, an estimated reserve of 1,407,500 tons.

138
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,150
The potential value is estimated at 55 trillion won.

139
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,720
If the quality is rated high, it's impossible to calculate its value.

140
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,380
I can't believe it's rare earth elements that I've only heard of.

141
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,260
So that's the reason why Taesung tried so hard to get Miryeong Forest!

142
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,150
They were afraid the land value would spike. So they lied saying it's a resort project, moving it forward hiding like a cockroach.

143
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,260
It's not only because of the land value. They pursued a resort business 25 years ago

144
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,560
and a goblin fire appeared at night right around that time?

145
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,500
Goblin fire?

146
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,370
It's time to get Jeong Yeong Jae out.

147
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,120
Long time no see, Director Jo.

148
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
I must have grown fond of you, it's so nice to see you!

149
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,190
This agenda doesn't call for you to step in.

150
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,530
You got excited when my director ask you to meet him, huh?

151
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,070
That fellow is pretty busy.

152
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,750
Trying to make Kwon Joo Han and Jo Kwang Pil prison cellmates.

153
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,850
It's been such a long time, huh?

154
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,400
You mined secretly 25 years ago because you were afraid that the residents would oppose the mining development, right?

155
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,420
And when China sold rare earth elements at a low price,

156
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,080
it wasn't profitable. So, you just covered it all up.

157
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,930
Without taking measures to prevent pollution.

158
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,840
It doesn't even cost that much to do that. So cheap.

159
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,050
What are you going to do now?

160
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,770
The 25 years ago atrocity committed by Taesung's crown prince

161
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,790
will be aired live on the 8 o'clock evening news.

162
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,750
If our Director goes on television, the ratings will explode with that face of his.

163
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,210
It'll be the top searched news immediately.

164
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,810
Do you want to die?

165
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,950
Do YOU want to die? It's Kang San Hyeok.

166
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:45,200
Do you think Kang San Hyeok will let you guys live after you sent his person to jail?

167
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,200
Now, I need to go buy popcorn.

168
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,280
It'll be amusing to see Director Kwon Joo Han's funky face on the news.

169
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,740
Miryeong Village Water Quality Analysis Report

170
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,820
Agreement

171
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,390
I, Kang San Hyeok, regarding Miryeong citizens' heavy metal poisoning

172
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,170
will remain silent.

173
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,940
The doctor in charge changed his testimony saying he believes there was guardian consent.

174
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,160
The paramedic also said he did not directly see you injecting the patient.

175
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,340
He said he thinks it was used on the previous patient.

176
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,700
Yeong Jae!

177
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:17,570
What's this? Are you about to cry because of me?

178
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,190
Let's go!

179
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:44,240
That grandpa patient's state was not severe enough to develop sudden heart issues.

180
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
His vitals were stable...

181
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,720
Stop thinking about it. It was bad luck.

182
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,060
It's not luck! The timing was weird.

183
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,360
After we found out his arsenic level was over 200, grandpa passed away

184
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,010
and the people at the nursing home told crazy lies. Isn't that weird?

185
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,970
The lawyer strongly protested against the police's unjust arrest

186
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,280
Which is why the prosecutors strictly questioned those two.

187
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,840
Because they were scared, they must have realized their mistake.

188
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,590
No, that's not it.

189
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,860
Right after discovering that weird hole in the forest with Oh Bo Mi, it disappeared

190
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,600
and water quality inspection had the wrong results.

191
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:31,160
I think Miryeong forest has been polluted by some big power.

192
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,180
That power is moving right now.

193
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,570
I wish that you would stop taking interest in other people's business.

194
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:44,830
This incident also wouldn't have happened if you didn't go look for that grandpa.

195
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,380
How can a paramedic (you) say something like that?

196
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,330
He was my patient and I found out the cause of his illness was something else,

197
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,360
how can that not be my business?

198
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,710
Currently, I'm also a citizen of this village.

199
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,920
It sounds like a conspiracy theory that puts two separate events together.

200
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,110
Well, it'd be a good thing if it were a conspiracy theory.

201
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,000
When I read through the files, it seems like the pollution has been ongoing for a while.

202
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,920
It's truly evil if they left it alone this whole time while knowing that.

203
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,990
If that the case, I'll find out to the end and I'll make him pay for the crime.

204
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,660
I got it! Look at me.

205
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,050
We were apart for two whole days! Are you going to keep talking about other things?

206
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,500
Then, my thoughts will end here today.

207
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,490
Wow, the color is so pretty!

208
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,580
It's pansy tea. It'll help with your sleep.

209
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,090
You're here! What happened?

210
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,900
What's going on? The police station?

211
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,530
It just happened that way. It's too complicated to explain.

212
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,430
- Everything has been taken care of.
- Aigoo...

213
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,890
- What a strange turn of events.
- I know.

214
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,600
- You went through a lot, Doc.
- Oh...

215
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,200
how about Hwang Yeon Bok? Did she get tested for heavy metal poisoning?

216
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,570
I called her guardian and she was hospitalized from her leg pain.

217
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,560
I said she needs to be tested for heavy metal poisoning. And he said yes. That he'd get her tested there.

218
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,430
Really? Which hospital is she at?

219
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,860
At Seoul Myeongseong University Hospital.

220
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,770
Ever since Taesung started sponsoring Miryeong Village, if the ailment calls for going to Seoul,

221
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,330
everyone goes there from here.

222
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,000
But you know, my friend's newspaper company tells me this isn't worthy of a story.

223
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,320
What? How come? With all this evidence?

224
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,900
It's lacking solid facts since it was tested only in one lab.

225
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,610
And they're saying the causality of the deaths of villagers from heavy metal poisoning

226
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,220
isn't clear enough to jump to that conclusion.

227
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,370
I mean, we want to write up articles in order to reveal the causality. What are they talking about?

228
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,920
That's what I'm saying. I was so shocked when I heard that this isn't newsworthy.

229
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,380
The environmental group refused the story as well.

230
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,420
They can make their move only after the presence of heavy metal elements is clearly proven.

231
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,310
How did the pollution issue in Miryeong Village wrap up?

232
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,850
I reported to the upper management and got their reply saying that they'd look into it. Why?

233
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,080
I feel uneasy about how things are going.

234
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,840
You know, would you tell the deceased Heo Choon Sik's family

235
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,410
that the body needs an autopsy?

236
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,150
I don't think they'd listen to me.

237
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,450
Okay. Thanks.

238
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,890
Approval of the use of the provincial forest?

239
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,530
Are you out of your mind?

240
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,640
You asked for the relocation of the special rescue team. Now, you want the use of the forest?

241
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,630
If you continue with this, I'll back out of everything.

242
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,700
Rare earth elements are buried in the Miryeong forest.

243
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,430
Rare earth elements?

244
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,440
1,407,500 tons.

245
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,650
Our country imports 3,000 tons every year.

246
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,600
It's an amount that can last our country for about 50 years.

247
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,160
The current estimated value is more than 55 trillion won.

248
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,800
Depending on international politics, the value can go up. I'm sure you know.

249
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,710
The resort is nothing by comparison.

250
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,890
Governor, please give me the permit to mine the forest.

251
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,920
The next national assembly election might be too soon.

252
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,690
But you should aim for the top for the election season following that, don't you think?

253
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,930
While you're going for the presidential election,

254
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,600
I'll make sure you won't have to bow down for money.

255
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,090
There's no way that the governor would also stab us in the back and hand over the forestry permit to Taesung, would he?

256
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,890
He knows better than anyone that Taesung is supporting Assemblyman Kim.

257
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,830
He'd never do something to fill up Assemblyman Kim's tummy, his enemy.

258
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,620
Perhaps we might be able to get to work before Taesung does.

259
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,010
Be sure to prepare all the documents regarding permits.

260
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,950
Assemble a list of experienced mining companies.

261
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,660
So we can get to work right away as soon as we receive our permit.

262
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,810
Yes, I got it.

263
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,840
Let's get him drunk. Only alcohol will do the job.

264
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,330
No, no. He'll heal if he exercises hard.

265
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,070
The latest fashion. If we get him a new coat, I'm sure he'll feel all better.

266
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,250
Let's go fishing.

267
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,990
What?

268
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,960
You also struggled after seeing your first fatal victim.

269
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,720
But you got better after going fishing together.

270
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Now that I think about it...

271
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,340
I'm for it! Angling is also a form of exercise.

272
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,640
I agree, too. We can go and drink together.

273
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,050
Then, we're agreed on going fishing.

274
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,640
- Okay.
- Go.

275
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,360
- Decided.
- Okay.

276
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,960
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

277
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,620
Okay. Great.

278
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,320
Let's go.

279
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,010
We go fishing for team unity every year. You're going, too, right?

280
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,040
- I'm out.
- Come on...

281
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,760
What do you mean you're out? Everyone agreed to go. Right?

282
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,400
Of course.

283
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,560
I'll chastise anyone who doesn't come. Chastise.

284
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,660
It's next Sunday. Don't even think about missing it.

285
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,260
We'll begin the equipment training in ten minutes.

286
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,190
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,860
- Let's get ready!
- Yes.

288
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,290
Team Leader.

289
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,820
Letter of Resignation

290
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,640
Something came up. I'll have to now...

291
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,680
What's wrong with you, man?

292
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,210
You're well aware of the basic number of rescuers required for emergency dispatch. What are you doing out of the blue?

293
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,340
Don't you know what happens to the rest of us if you pull out?

294
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,120
Take it back.

295
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,850
I'm going back to Seoul. I'm sorry.

296
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,420
Was this planned from the get-go?

297
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,240
Is this why you joined the rescue team?

298
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,820
You want to leave after your plan and goal has been achieved?

299
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,900
I knew you were no good as a person. But I thought you were becoming a rescuer, at least.

300
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,490
I don't know who you are. But you're no good for your colleagues who considered you a fellow rescuer.

301
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,980
Take it back.

302
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,910
I'll be leaving as of this moment.

303
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,210
Please order your disciplinary action.

304
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Miryeong Hospital

305
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,390
You'll get hurt. Be careful.

306
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,760
Where's your car?

307
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,880
I don't have it.

308
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,370
I wanted to take a walk with Jeong Yeong Jae.

309
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,810
What in the world? Are you already suffering from separation anxiety just because we were apart for two days?

310
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,280
I want to do something with you.

311
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,360
- Do something?
- Yeah.

312
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,240
Okay, repeat after me. Say, "ball" first.

313
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,470
Ball.

314
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,160
Next, "leaf."

315
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,090
Leaf. What is this?

316
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,020
How to float.

317
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,520
If you fall into the water, you become a ball.

318
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,850
If you cuddle and stay still, you'll float slowly.

319
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,140
Once you float to the surface, you become a leaf.

320
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,660
You spread out your body as if to say, "hooray."

321
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,360
A ball and a leaf next.

322
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,130
You can't forget it.

323
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,030
Why are you teaching me this?

324
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,210
It's insurance for when I'm not around.

325
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,250
You won't be by my side? How come?

326
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,060
It was only for a short time, but you were alone in the police station, too.

327
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:32,430
I'm just preparing for a time like that. Just in case you get hurt.

328
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,120
Well, I'm sure such a thing won't happen again in your lifetime.

329
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,210
Because Kang San Hyeok will always protect Jeong Yeong Jae.

330
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,080
♬ A soft sound that calls out my name ♬

331
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,400
Should we stop?

332
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,380
♬ I walk this street ♬

333
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,350
♬ Because of the memory that passes through my heart ♬

334
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,620
No. I want to go deeper.

335
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:26,420
♬ I cried for a moment while smiling ♬

336
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,520
♬ Through the night, without anyone knowing ♬

337
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,820
♬ You walked with me behind me ♬

338
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:46,400
♬ When I would give up and sit myself down ♬

339
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,710
♬ You held my hand ♬

340
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,820
Yeong Jae.

341
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,780
I like you.

342
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,880
I found out this time around.

343
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,180
How precious you are to me.

344
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,950
I really like you.

345
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:13,640
♬ I will wait for you, I will stand right here ♬

346
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,870
♬ You're the only one for me ♬

347
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,770
Me, too.

348
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,490
I really like you.

349
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:29,230
♬ During that time, while I was all alone ♬

350
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,750
♬ Please hold me now ♬

351
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,090
♬ Just like that day ♬

352
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,710
Stop.

353
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,620
- Up to here for today.
- Okay.

354
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,060
All right. Let's do that.

355
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,880
All right. Good job.

356
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,620
You're amazing, my Jeong Yeong Jae.

357
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,230
Episode 28 will air soon.
