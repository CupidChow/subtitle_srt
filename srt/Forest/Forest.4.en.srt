1
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,590
Mister.

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,920
Mister, are you okay?

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,050
Mister?

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,090
I will go to Seoul.

5
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,530
I will not go.

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,270
I will go.

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,830
I will go!

8
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,300
And if I don't go? What am I going to do?

9
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,870
And if I go? What about my license? Do I give up on Myeongseong Hospital?

10
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,460
It shows that I will go, right? So I should go.

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,970
I was planning to quit when I said that anyway. It's not the end of the world.

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,340
What? Would you like one?

13
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,150
You eat it all until you get facial paralysis in the winter.

14
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,200
When do you think room 2 is going to leave?

15
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:42,120
I bet my wrist that she'll leave today, and crying on her way out.

16
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,330
Why don't you just bet your neck? Then I'd accept that bet.

17
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,510
Doctor! Doctor!

18
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,310
- Nurse Kim, a patient is here. Where does it hurt?
- Hurry.

19
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,370
Oh, your arm–

20
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,680
Jeong Yeong Jae. Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae!

21
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,940
- What is going on?
- Well, I'm–

22
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,100
Jeong Yeong Jae! Jeong Yeong Jae, hurry up and come out!

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,860
I'm on fire.

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,970
Kang San Hyeok?

25
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,710
Kang San Hyeok, what is wrong?

26
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,680
My arm. My arm is burning.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,890
It's on fire.

28
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,470
He's like that because he's on midazolam. We couldn't control his pain and I gave him a sedative injection, but he disappeared.

29
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,900
My arm is on fire. It's on fire!

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,640
- Midazolam. Do you have Midazolam?
- Do you think we would have it?

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,470
What about ketamine? Any kind of sedative injection?

32
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,360
If a patient needs that they would go to Gangwon Hospital, not here.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,710
And if a patient is in pain you use painkillers, not a sedative injection.

34
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,830
Kang San Hyeok?

35
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,090
Jeong Yeong Jae?

36
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,620
Are you all right?

37
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,720
You're going to be okay.

38
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,100
Diazepam: is a medicine of the benzodiazepine family that typically produces a calming effect.

39
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,220
Now that you've been sedated, you will feel better once the medication kicks in.

40
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,450
Hang in there.

41
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,660
Did you go to the forest?

42
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,720
Before the pain started were you stimulated in any way?

43
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,360
Is a surgeon trying to play a psychiatrist?

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,800
Honestly, if you're not a specialist yet you aren't a real doctor.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,300
It looks like you know you're having psychological problems?

46
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,390
You must be feeling better now that you're running your mouth. I'll be leaving then.

47
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,580
I don't want to explain.

48
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,720
I don't want to tell someone new what is wrong with me.

49
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,470
Don't make me explain to someone else.

50
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,950
Just watch over me. Stay here.

51
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,440
Well, since I have some free time since there are no patients,

52
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,220
I'll do that especially for you. With a holy sense of devotion.

59
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,270
Jeong Yeong Jae. Why must I meet her here?

60
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,410
Especially on the historical day of my first day on the job as an enforcement officer.

61
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,050
I'm back. Hello.

62
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,020
Violation Notice Form

63
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,440
I didn't have this on me!

64
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,290
Put this here.

65
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,980
Violation notice. Kang San Hyeok.

66
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,230
Hey! What is that? What are you writing?

67
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,760
Are you already going around fining people?

68
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,600
What do you mean already? It's been a few days since I've come to the county office.

69
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,970
Yeah, a few days. It's only been a few days

70
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,960
so I told you to walk around and familiarize yourself with the area and get to know the residents.

71
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,860
Who is going to like it if you're already going around handing out fines?

72
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,590
Who -Who is going to handle all the complaints?

73
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,390
What you're saying sounds quite odd, Team Leader.

74
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,070
So are you telling me that I have to turn a blind eye to the laws being broken because we're afraid of complaints?

75
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,930
How can you perform your duties if you loosen the rules?

76
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,910
Would it be possible to be fair and act with integrity?

77
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,990
You are driving me insane. Your team is in for some trouble.

78
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,490
Team Leader, wait!

79
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,600
List of fire watch agents. I am in charge of this so why do you have this?

80
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,960
This is how we've run this place until now. It's nothing new, so don't make things complicated and let it go.

81
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,620
I can't do that. I'm the one who has to take full responsibility as the person in charge.

82
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,710
I'll review it and return it back to you. I'll be going by the book, not convenience.

83
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,700
Enforcement Officer Oh, what are you doing right now?

84
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,640
Give it here.

85
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,970
Hey Enforcement Officer, give it here right now.

86
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,640
Look here, Oh Bo Mi. Get up.

87
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,980
What was that noise?

88
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,030
532-3835.

89
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:26,000
What is this smell? I'm so dizzy.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,700
What? By myself?

91
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,920
I just got here yesterday.

92
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,310
I don't even know my way around the neighborhood, let alone this hospital building.

93
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,860
How can I do the night shift all by myself?

94
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,450
It's a tiny hospital what is there to know about your way around here?

95
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,720
If you can't do it then just send the patient home.

96
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,640
He is still knocked out from the sedative how can I send him home?

97
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
That is why I'm telling you to cover the night shift.

98
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,490
The patient only asks for you anyway.

99
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,390
I'm ordering you to take care of your own patient

100
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,790
what is the problem here?

101
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,590
Nurse Kim, can you please stay just for today?

102
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,470
I have a seminar in Gangwon.

103
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,890
There won't be anything particularly difficult.

104
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,520
You will hear a few wolf cries and maybe some wild boars might wander in,

105
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,280
but that is all.

106
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,090
Good luck during your first night shift, Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae.

107
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,290
Fighting!

108
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,400
Dr. Park? Nurse Kim?

109
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,470
You can't move yet.

110
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,500
You might faint because the sedative hasn't worn off yet.

111
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,740
I have to go back to Seoul.

112
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,610
You can't drive anyway.

113
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,440
You are sensitive to sedatives,

114
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,970
so you might show signs of delirium.

115
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,400
How many sedatives did you give me?

116
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,220
Are you sure you administered the proper dosage?

117
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,620
Excuse me, I can't go home right now because of you.

118
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,090
Say one more thing and I'll kick you out and go home. So lay down and go to sleep.

119
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,950
Whe-Where are you going, leaving your patient all alone?

120
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,140
Did you hear that?

121
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,100
It looks like you're having anxiety but you will be all right.

122
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,750
Once the sedative wears off you'll be okay.

123
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,660
This...

124
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:49,260
I heard a thumping noise coming from the restroom so I opened the door but there was no one inside.

125
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,150
Then a set of eyes popped up out of nowhere

126
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,880
and said, "Hello".

127
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,190
Are you sure it isn't that ghost?

128
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,330
- Stop it.
- Isn't it?

129
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,530
Enough already!

130
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,380
If not,

131
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,280
the one that is always in the library

132
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,170
studying with the chin resting in their hand like this.

133
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,010
And when I call the ghost, it says,

134
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,140
"Why?"

135
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,980
Then it goes like this and runs towards you.

136
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,330
Is it not that ghost?

137
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,620
Stop it! Stop it!

138
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,900
No, if not... If not... If not...

139
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,960
A stepmother who killed her stepchild gave birth to her own child.

140
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,650
Once the child learned how to talk,

141
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,480
it said, "Mom why do you always carry that strange kid on your back?".

142
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,830
Jeez. I can't even go out for a cup of water because of what you said.

143
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,670
This is an advanced technique.

144
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,300
You're the one who gave me the injection, not me.

145
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,690
It's hard to approach me if it isn't a situation like this,

146
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,350
so you used a high dosage of sedative so you can stay by my side. I see what you did there.

147
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,420
Wow. Your symptom is so bad. So very bad!

148
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,300
But the stories you told are such old tales,

149
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,610
you must have played telling those stories when you were a child.

150
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,020
Do you know the 'Jack Rabbit' song?

151
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,320
- Are there people who don't know that song?
- No.

152
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,710
"Where are you going while crying moo", do you know it?

153
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,130
The jackrabbit goes moo?

154
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,070
Jeez. I need to use the restroom. What do I do?

155
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,750
Jeez. That mouth just calls for a sedative.

156
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,280
Thump. Thump. Thump.

157
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,320
Your car is blocking part of the road so I am leaving this notice.

158
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,300
Your violation notice will be mailed to the address on your ID card.

159
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,570
Where are you off to without saying goodbye?

160
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,270
This is what you call lying in the bed you made. I drop you off and pick you up.

161
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,170
I am getting off of work late thanks to you, so you should take responsibility.

162
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,480
The Seoul branch is saying they desperately need me,

163
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,620
and are waiting for me with doe eyes. What can I do?

164
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,460
I have to forfeit this laid back life and go back.

165
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,970
Were you hurt?

166
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,060
Oh, yes, when I was young.

167
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,420
People normally cover up their scars but it looks like you don't.

168
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,810
Because I'm not ashamed. It's not like it's my fault.

169
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,010
Kang San Hyeok, are you ashamed of your phantom pain?

170
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,940
Is having phantom pain your fault?

171
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,430
Do you know how to sell a business with a bad wrap?

172
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,380
Excuse me?

173
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,100
You put yourself in the limelight.

174
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,280
People have a tendency to believe that what they see frequently is worth more.

175
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,610
You hold an event and frequently expose it to the news.

176
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,940
You make word spread by word of mouth so many people will attend.

177
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,930
Whether you get a good evaluation or make rounds at the local markets,

178
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,330
you will only reduce it's worth.

179
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,850
My self-worth, I should make sure to get a proper evaluation.

180
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,920
Why are you telling me this?

181
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,420
Let's say it's repayment for not making me tell my story to somebody else.

182
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,650
You know the physician who used DC cardioversion on a patient?

183
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,930
Oh, Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae?

184
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,420
She wasn't dispatched to Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital but to some no-name lowly place.

185
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,030
Really? What a shame.

186
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,280
If the news article wasn't released, she wouldn't have had to go.

187
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,060
I know, right. She was only trying to save the kid.

188
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,850
Wait a minute.

189
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,270
Can you stop the car?

190
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,360
You are wrong.

191
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,950
About having to be in the public eye to get a proper evaluation.

192
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,700
That is not true worth, it's an illusion.

193
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,490
The eyes of others are not needed to determine my true self-worth.

194
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,110
I have to recognize it.

195
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,270
You can create an illusion by word of mouth

196
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,410
but you can't create self-worth that you yourself recognize.

197
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,900
You left that out.

198
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,260
I need to go find what I've forgotten.

199
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,880
Have a safe trip back.

200
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,490
I've been to that place before.

201
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,250
Jeong Yeong Jae?

202
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,950
It has been reported that K, the star M&A expert of a domestic investment firm

203
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,860
has used corporate merger and acquisition information as bait

204
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,340
to collect private information on influential businessmen.

205
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,850
This is what has been reported in the tip.

206
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,530
K, who is the Director of company R, created his own dedicated information team

207
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,770
in order to exchange private information.

208
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,140
He is currently under investigation by prosecutors for the manipulation of stock prices–

209
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,110
I told you to take a breather.

210
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,680
Company R's Director and star M&A expert.

211
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,270
All of your clients must already know.

212
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,580
Let's leave it up to Director Han to wrap up the acquisition of Naseong Development.

213
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,020
Director Kang, you go work in the Philippines headquarters for the next six months.

214
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,800
Your phantom pains or whatever,

215
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,910
just go and get some rest.

216
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,110
Company Acquisition Contract

217
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,930
What is this? Why do you have the Naseong Development papers?

218
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,670
If you don't sell it to me, I will pay all the companies who loaned money to Naseong Development

219
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,830
a huge fee in order to get the promissory notes.

220
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,620
What would you like to do?

221
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:52,100
Will you sell Naseong Development to me for 100 billion won or will you file for bankruptcy?

222
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,790
The Miryeong forest contract price that continued to go up due to Director Han being dragged around by Taeseong Group, I obtained it.

223
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,210
Give me this project.

224
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,610
Hey, Director Kang.

225
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,930
Miryeong Forest is not a piece of land that can be developed while sitting behind a desk like someone here.

226
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:16,310
This project relies heavily on this.

227
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,800
Inadequate

228
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,870
In the past 20 years, numerous development request applications were submitted for Miryeong Forest.

229
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,460
However, not once were any of the applications approved.

230
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,360
That is because a major national facility, the Miryeong 119 special rescue is there.

231
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,780
Having personally measured the distance, height, and noise decibel of the helicopter,

232
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,840
the result was that the noise levels are beyond the legal levels to build a resort or anything for that matter.

233
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,710
So, in order to develop Miryeong Forest,

234
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,530
you must relocate the special rescue team to another location.

235
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,200
I can relocate the Miryeong 119 special rescue team to another location.

236
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,460
I will relocate them.

237
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,610
Give Miryeong Forest to me.

238
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,400
Kang San Hyeok!

239
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,400
That detestable Director Han! I feel so relieved.

240
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,440
What is the method to relocate the special rescue team that refused to move for the past 20 years?

241
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,980
Team Leader Park?

242
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,760
I told you business isn't done with your brain but with what?

243
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,940
It's your feet, of course.

244
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,730
Business is done with your feet.

245
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,160
Isn't that right?

246
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,520
If we want to relocate the special rescue team, we must use our feet to go where?

247
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,980
Director, that's the special res–

248
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,300
Wait a minute. No way.

249
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,340
To join the special rescue team, you have to pass the civil servant exam.

250
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,730
I know.

251
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,650
Prepare for the exam.

252
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,280
Air rescue?

253
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,840
Director!

254
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,370
Director, this is absurd. Jumping out of a helicopter on a rope is insane.

255
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,650
Director, why are you doing this to me?

256
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,450
Director, answer me now! You're pissing me off!

257
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,480
Director!

258
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,890
Please move out of the way you dead worm.

259
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,580
♬ The dizzying circumstances in front of me ♬

260
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,080
♬ All the different stories ♬

261
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,390
♬ I listen, at times without breathing ♬

262
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,930
♬ I come closer to you ♬

263
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:06,330
♬ The hope I see far away ♬

264
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,950
♬ There are no sweet words of encouragement ♬

265
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,410
♬ They are scattered apart ♬

266
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,410
♬ They are fading away ♬

267
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,680
♬ My feelings, my loneliness, my silence, depression ♬

268
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,980
♬ Are filled in my heart ♬

269
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,900
♬ Even if I struggle to get closer ♬

270
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,410
Forest Preview
♬ You coldly push me away ♬

271
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,370
How is it on the air rescue team?

272
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,390
I'm going to watch and see if you have an ulterior motive.

273
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,300
You can't seem to distinguish who you can and cannot mess with.

274
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,580
Keep it up and I'll kill you.

275
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,270
Where are you staying that you can get here in 10 minutes?

276
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm going to make him a grade 7 civil servant. We have to bring her to our side.

277
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,590
I found out why I received such discipline.

278
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,060
Were you married?

279
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,320
We are planning to get married.

280
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,410
It's an emergency situation!

281
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,820
We will never risk our men. Get out of here.

282
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,070
Do you want to date? It's not like we have anything to do here.
