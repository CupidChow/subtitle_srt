1
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,800
Episode 5

2
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,510
Stop!

3
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,850
Naturally, it is the sense of duty.

4
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,270
The sacred mission to protect the safety of the people!

5
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,350
Isn't that the basis of the 119 Special Rescue Team?

6
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,900
69!

7
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,250
70!

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,740
What is this? Why....

9
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,210
You don't know?

10
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,970
You can't enter in here during helicopter training.

11
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,930
It's dangerous.

12
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,080
Helicopter training?

13
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,200
Are you not going to Seoul?

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,610
No, what is this going on right now? What is the meaning of this?

15
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,660
"Gangwon Fire Department Special Rescue Team"

16
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,560
Special Rescue Team?

17
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,750
Let's pretend, shall we?

18
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,570
The moment I save you in front of freshwater from a helicopter is the first time we met.

19
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,050
Did you say the first time?

20
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,400
Of course, it won't be easy to erase a VVIP as myself.

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,480
But try, for the sake of the people.

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,530
The people?

23
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,570
The citizen of this country? Those people?

24
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,130
Kang San Hyeok! Member, Kang San Hyeok!

25
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,160
Member?

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,100
Well, I am busy with national affairs so for now....

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,930
I am going up. I am going up.

28
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,000
Sacrifice for a cause? Kang San Hyeok?

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,420
I don't think that is it. There is no way, that human.....

30
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,760
By any chance, did he hurt his brain a little when he collapsed?

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,170
Hello? Are you playing Won Bin right now?

32
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,000
I told you to take care of safety of the valley plane. After going somewhere, it flopped over.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,200
Wearing useless goggles. Are you filming a movie here?

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,850
Eyes forward! Don't glare at me! You guys are just hanging around!

35
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,280
New guy. Is training a joke?

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,020
It's not a joke. I'm sure I followed instructions.

37
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,060
There were civilians around the valley so we took safety measures. As per the ground crew manual.

38
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,270
Crew member? Who said crew member?

39
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,770
Now that's the most important subject of training for the newly appointed.

40
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,040
With what nerve are you attaching the name "crew member"?

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,860
Do you think the aviation rescue team is some kind of baby gymnasium?

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,310
I don't trust kids with shells like that.

43
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,910
From the flustered look on your face, we're going to have to rescue a rescue team member.

44
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,630
Haha you want to be a hero? It seems that way.

45
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,340
Of course, there are exceptions like your shooter, Choi Chang.

46
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,250
With that face, he is from the Special Forces.

47
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,590
I don't know, It seems, with my face, you can trust me as well.

48
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,970
Anyway, I became a public servant because it was my late grandmother's wish.

49
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,330
And as you can see, I've already got more than enough class.

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,210
Because they are in the Special Forces, everyone seems to have a sense of superiority.

51
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,200
But in this world, there are people out there that you cannot imagine.

52
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,500
The body and the brain are both transcendent.

53
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,500
It is uncommon to be on a team like this. You're lucky to have me..

54
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,530
His character is amazing...

55
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,190
Is that so?

56
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,430
To have such a great man as my subordinate is an honor, right?

57
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,720
Is it an honor to the family?

58
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:23,120
So, with that handsome mouth, let's see how you will jump and fly at our next training.

59
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,140
The basic principle of the rescue crew

60
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,050
is to descend to the rescue scene by rappel from the helicopter..

61
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,360
Even those who fly on the ground, when you tell them to jump out of a moving helicopter, they're all trembling.

62
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,190
Before training with the helicopters, first, try to develop the feeling and posture.

63
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,330
Grab the line!

64
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,850
Yes, grabbing the line. Rope Secured.

65
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,320
- Secure!
- Secure!

66
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,160
A rappel -textbook precise L-shaped posture.

67
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,900
So, we're the only rescue team in the world that's not special forces, but selected by examination.

68
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,190
Let's see what that transcendent powers can do.

69
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,790
- Next, get ready.
- Next, getting ready.

70
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,670
Don't hold onto the line tightly saying that's scary. The rope burn will skin your palms completely.

71
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,120
When you land, don't forget to apply the brakes with your hands.

72
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,230
Crew Member Kang San Hyeok, Rope Secured!

73
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,390
- Down!
- Down!

74
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,640
Maintain the L Shape. The center of gravity should be your butt!

75
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,160
- Didn't I tell him that?
- Yes.

76
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,990
Come down quickly!

77
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,660
I also want to go down soon.

78
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,230
Our transcendant newest member, you must be very scared.

79
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,530
If you put the brakes on too soon, this is what happens.

80
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,080
Don't tell me. Did you pee in your pants?

81
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,260
Falling.

82
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,420
Make your position correct!

83
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,880
Again.

84
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,990
Again, you did it wrong.

85
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,670
Down!

86
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,460
What is that?

87
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,360
Oh my, it's lunch time

88
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,730
If you aren't actually saving lives, don't miss a meal.

89
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,770
Well, let's go.

90
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,760
Let's stop joking.

91
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,130
Untie it quickly.

92
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,040
Mmmmm, the spicy stirred fried pork smell came all the way here.

93
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,070
Team Leader, quickly untie it.

94
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,890
Team Leader? Kim Sunbae?

95
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,530
HEY! Over there!

96
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,100
Thankfully, it isn't fractured. Ahh, why is it like this again?

97
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,490
You just...you just twisted your ankle

98
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,640
I'll give you prescriptions for an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxant.

99
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,550
So take the medicine and don't put any stress on your ankle for the time being.

100
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,880
Don't forget applying ice packs.

101
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,390
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

102
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,050
Yes, please go safely.

103
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,800
Nurse, please submit a request for an x-ray reader.

104
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,570
You can hit it. Hit it here and there a few times

105
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,090
I'm saying that this won't do.

106
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,180
Anyway, it's time to change it because it is too old.

107
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,380
It's a patient. He happened to go mountain climbing. There have been a few injured hikers.

108
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,090
What do you mean a new X-ray?

109
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,590
Just use it.

110
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,920
Speaking of which, why isn't there a chair in the lobby?

111
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,700
This is why no grandfathers and grandmothers come, you know? Because it is uncomfortable.

112
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,390
While putting in a requisition, also request lobby chairs.

113
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,590
Never mind, I'll do it. I'll ask the Hospital Director directly.

114
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,050
There's a temple across the mountain.

115
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:58,960
It's isolated in such a rough terrain. The persons who donate meals change daily.

116
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,950
Do you know what the new donor does every day?

117
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,430
He works in the kitchen.

118
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,080
He works at an uncomfortable sink. A different one, if he can, works on construction. It needs a bigger refrigerator.

119
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,950
And then after a month building, he runs away because he can't take it.

120
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,430
Do you think it is right for the chief monk to continue construction?

121
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,030
Do you think it is right?

122
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,730
Right now, are you telling me to continue using broken equipment?

123
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,230
It's about responsibility,

124
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,460
Are you confident you will use the new equipment for a long time?

125
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,140
Driven to ask for things like this and all other offerings.

126
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,110
There seems to be a lot here.

127
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,560
Request the newest reader

128
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,300
and comfortable sofas that if the elderly sat in their spinal disks won't hurt like those wooden chairs.

129
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,450
The responsibility is to get the patients to come first, then we will talk.

130
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,190
The chairs, did you know Mr. Park removed them?

131
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,860
We'll talk about it again. I will talk to Mr. Park.

132
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,590
Please apply for them.

133
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,000
I understand, Doctor Jeong Yeong Jae

134
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,790
Let me explain.

135
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,960
As a team leader, he agreed to and assisted the members, not preventing them from committing unfair acts.

136
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,190
In short, something like this would be called group harassment.

137
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,960
Something like that would be called emergency training.

138
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
There wasn't even prior notice; what do you mean by emergency training--

139
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,260
During abseiling (controlled descent off a vertical drop with a rope wrapped around the body),

140
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,350
What if a problem occurs on the ground and you have to wait in air?

141
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,190
Do you know how many unexpected circumstances occur when you're in action?

142
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,290
You must want to learn what emergency training is by the books, considering the fact that you got in through testing,

143
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,620
but I'll teach you one thing:

144
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,650
the people whom you think so lowly of have all completed their survival training at the military

145
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:36,080
and spent at least a couple of years there. They don't wait, and they won't let you take it easy.

146
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,080
I'll teach you something about survival.

147
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,830
I'll politely decline anyone offering to wait for me or let me take it easy.

148
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,420
Should I let you know a fact?

149
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,750
This is just the beginning.

150
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,510
You have to repeatedly go through the process of your skin tearing and new skin growing

151
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,270
in order to be able to jump off a helicopter without hesitation.

152
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,360
Would that day ever come for you?

153
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,750
Do you know the most common mistake that people who feel inferior and want to be competitive for no reason?

154
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,800
They don't know where to stop.

155
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,460
They can't tell the difference between people whom they shouldn't mess with and people whom they can mess with.

156
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,940
You're going to die while messing around.

157
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,100
I guess our newbie is competitive and feels inferior, right?

158
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,870
You are completely wrong.

159
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,100
I guess it could be burdensome as it is difficult to convince me.

160
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,130
Many things came out. Would you like me to explain?

161
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,250
You didn't even know what this place was until just now.

162
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,830
You were taking photos and disrupting our training.

163
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,960
I wonder how you got here.

164
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,350
At least I didn't come here after falling for someone like you.

165
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:24,390
I'll just say that on that day I thought,

166
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,430
"Wow, I didn't know that there's a job where you have to train so harshly in order to save another life."

167
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,450
You believe that?

168
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,890
You bring around brand-name shirts that have barely been released, and you're talking about other lives?

169
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,800
I don't think you're in any place to criticize me.

170
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,060
I heard that you're from a rich family in the countryside.

171
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,690
So you're okay with being spoon fed all your wealth, but not okay with me working my way up?

172
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,100
- A rich boy from the countryside?
- At least I fit in.

173
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,270
You're just all country--

174
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,350
Don't wear them!

175
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,560
At least you have good taste.

176
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,230
You really just have to ruin everything.

177
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,580
Anyway, I have an important meeting, so I'm going to get going.

178
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,700
I'm going to keep my eyes on you to make sure you don't do anything.

179
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,930
If you show any signs of strange behavior, that diamond or whatever is going to be crushed into pieces.

180
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,900
If you ever mess with me again,

181
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,860
I can grind the shooter or whatever you are into a fine powder.

182
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,940
Okay. It's not like we're going to be seeing each other for that long anyway.

183
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,860
Keep messing around, you baby.

184
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,630
An important meeting?

185
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,450
I told you I was going to pick you up. Why'd you ride your bike again?

186
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,820
Were you planning on rescuing me after you received an emergency call like last time? No, no thank you.

187
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,420
I'm going to take care of things with my two strong legs. Plus, it's exercise.

188
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,620
But still, I felt so bad. I wanted to buy you delicious steak and pasta.

189
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,050
No, I don't like Western food. I have so much bread, bread, bread all the time.

190
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,200
I need to chew on some rice for dinner.

191
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,000
- You like bread, don't you?
- Well, I wouldn't say I like it, but...

192
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,260
Oh, you said that the director of Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital is your dad's friend, right?

193
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,340
I wouldn't say they're friends, but it's more like they share a mutually beneficial relationship.

194
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,580
Why?

195
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,910
There's something that I just can't understand.

196
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,580
Hey, you know Dr. Park, right?

197
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:17,210
Do you know the doctor is running the hospital into the ground because he doesn't want patients to come there?

198
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,590
If you look at the operational records, you'll see why. Why just watch and wait?

199
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,370
But he hasn't run away though.

200
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,460
What?

201
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,870
Miryeong Hospital isn't a for-profit hospital anyway.

202
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,180
It is a symbol of maintaining a cooperative relationship with local governments.

203
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,240
That means even if you run a deficit, you can't get rid of it.

204
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,590
On top of that, Miryeong Hospital was specially built by the hospital director.

205
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,720
He used to live in a village called Miryeong.

206
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,510
Doctors are running away from that hospital

207
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,020
and you have no choice but to ignore it.

208
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,680
I don't know, but... Yeong Jae, are you expecting to change the atmosphere at the hospital?

209
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,850
I don't know what to say.

210
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,680
By any chance, is there a new air rescue....

211
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,630
Never mind. What will knowing do?

212
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,970
- Wow, it looks delicious.
- Isn't that too much, Auntie?

213
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,930
Our young gentlemen Chan is here so I must give it to you.

214
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,020
Did you catch a local Korean chicken?

215
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,070
Young gentleman?

216
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,650
Eat up before it gets cold!

217
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,870
This is the best Baeksuk (Korean chicken soup) in the world.

218
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,340
It tastes so nice!

219
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,420
I really enjoyed that chicken today!

220
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,690
But... we have to split the bill starting next time. I don't want to be treated for no reason.

221
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,730
There are more than enough reasons.

222
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
Go in.

223
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,270
Did you check if there's any problem in security system?

224
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,560
Wait, no. I will do that by myself tomorrow.

225
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,250
You know that I'm much faster than the police. Just call me directly if you find anything strange.

226
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,890
I'll be here just in one second. Do you understand?

227
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,940
I'm not that weak but... okay I got it.

228
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,620
Goodbye.

229
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,420
I'm so worried about you so lock the door while I am here.

230
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,040
- What?
- Will you go in now and lock the front door?

231
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,770
As you can see, the entire area is owned by local governments.

232
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,040
These yellow regions are Naseong's privately owned forest.

233
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,440
Here, the area surrounding Miryeong village is owned by residents.

234
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,180
We will be able to have a road there if we get rid of the village and the special rescue team.

235
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,190
It also solves the problem of accessibility.

236
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,340
Get it started from now.

237
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,100
Didn't you say there is someone who specializes in land development?

238
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,130
- Bring that person here.
- Yes, I will be ready to do so.

239
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,100
Are you enjoying the air rescue team?

240
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,570
- Do you really have to do that?
- You're so noisy,

241
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,150
Did you intentionally fail the exam, didn't you?

242
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,790
What are you saying?

243
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,420
You are the freak who passed the exam with less efforts.

244
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,050
It's normal to not able to pass that.

245
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,940
Anyway, I have been recording all of that.

246
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,540
Try anything again, and next time it'll be the French Foreign Legion, M & A.

247
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,230
It is this guy's ultimate job! To be Kang San Hyeok's right-wing man!

248
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,100
Are you sure you are my right hand man?

249
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,610
Am I not?

250
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,570
Who else if not this Park Hyeong Soo?

251
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,810
Well...

252
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,570
Believe whatever you want to.

253
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,590
Where are you going?! It's a sensitive matter!

254
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,500
Sir! Do you have someone else than me?

255
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,970
Keep your eyes on Taeseong group.

256
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,100
Sir!!!

257
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,640
Such a mean guy...

258
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,720
The your value doesn't have to be acknowledged by others.

259
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,440
I will acknowledge that.

260
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,370
I have to go back for what I forgot to bring.

261
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,030
So please go safely.

262
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,730
She doesn't seem to be too empty headed ...

263
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,410
Here.

264
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,630
To the end...

265
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,430
It comes down to the end. To the last minute...

266
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,530
This is Kang San Hyeok.

267
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,070
What are you doing? It's an emergency!

268
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,400
Be here in 10 minutes!

269
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,560
You, what is this punk?

270
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,410
We have to get a helicopter out there, why aren't they here yet!

271
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,350
What? Are you here now?

272
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,800
It would be like this.

273
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
Take a shower, everyone! Hurry.

274
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,060
I'll do the the paper work.

275
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,730
I told you don't have to come.

276
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,700
I didn't expect it.

277
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,850
Of course, because the fire will only pick up during Kang San Hyeok's work hours.

278
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,490
- I came as fast as we could—
- How long is a helicopter's golden time?

279
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,700
This is a test, punk. What is the time!?

280
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,500
It's... 30 minutes.

281
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,450
You have to be there in 30 minutes but

282
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,810
it takes 1 hour and a half from your home. Are you out of your mind, punk?

283
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,160
You adamantly refused to live in the official housing when I told you to. Now look at you!

284
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,920
It's not my fault that there is not enough official housing.

285
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,200
I cannot accept sharing housing with other crew members..

286
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,490
Clear out your locker. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished.

287
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:26,190
What if the fire was big? You, do you know how much work the crew had to do?

288
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,660
Because of inconsiderate people like you.

289
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,380
I can't put my men at risk. Get lost.

290
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,670
To your royal palace.

291
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,130
How about here?

292
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,230
Mireung-ri Sales Shop

293
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,750
There isn't any. There isn't any.

294
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,810
I feel sorry about this. Oh my.

295
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,000
There also isn't any pensions?

296
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,290
Costs don't matter so please find somewhere I can live.

297
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,260
It should be close to 911 special rescue team.

298
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,920
Special rescue team?

299
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,430
There's a right place in Miryeong village...

300
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,360
But... I'm not sure it's for rent....

301
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,780
Just for one or two months...

302
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,960
I have to go now. Where is it that you are talking about?

303
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,100
This way, this way.

304
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,590
Please, put everything this way.

305
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,020
Yes there!

306
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,230
What is it so noisy?

307
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,810
Put it there, please!

308
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,330
Yes, right there.

309
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,160
Wow, it's a neural reader!

310
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,550
It will be twice as good.

311
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,390
You, Seoul-to-Busan. I told you not to go overboard.

312
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,560
Don't you see it well?

313
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,720
I'm not going overboard. I'm doing my work. Can't you see?

314
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,010
That's why. Don't do anything.

315
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,100
Whatever you intend on doing, I said not to do it. I told you.

316
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,730
Can you afford it all?

317
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,920
If I can? What would you do then?

318
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,400
Oh, how bothersome

319
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,850
Put everything back together and take it back.

320
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,120
Put it there. Right there!

321
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,010
With physical labor like this, you think you'll be able to go to Seoul. You won't go. You know why?

322
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,440
No one is interested in this countryside village!

323
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,240
There's no one cares even if you do something!

324
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,190
Understand?!

325
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,880
Bring them all back.

326
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,090
Whatever...

327
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:10,020
Doctor Park, do you know what girls who don't date have in common?

328
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,330
Green light or not.

329
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,600
They are so concerned about men's feelings.

330
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,320
It allows men to seize the initiatives.

331
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,920
I am not interested in men.

332
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,080
I'm the one to decide whether I'm going to seeing him or not.

333
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,460
Miryeong Hospital... well...

334
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,130
I don't want to be here forever.

335
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,400
But also I don't want to waste my time to know
if Myungsung hospital is green light or not.

336
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,070
Not at all. Do you understand?

337
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,050
I decided by myself!

338
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:56,080
I've been studying to be a doctor so I'll be a doctor.

339
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,300
If you, Doctor Park, don't like it, just watch me.

340
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,260
That will do, no?

341
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,170
Please put this chair here!

342
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,580
- Over here.
- Yes.

343
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,850
Yes, thank you.

344
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,950
A crazy person has come. A crazy person!

345
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,710
Yeah, that is right. Please put it over there.

346
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,120
As we can see,

347
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,750
More than 90% of pine resin is terapene, a highly volatile substance.

348
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,330
As soon as it catches on fire like this, it becomes a major fire.

349
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,740
These fires are called hydroponics.

350
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,500
The pine tree itself becomes a nuclear bomb.

351
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:55,120
That is why for needleleaf trees and normal broadleaf trees causing hydroponics, we approach different extinguishing methods.

352
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,050
For needleleaf trees, which are susceptible to forest fires, the starting point is at the crown.

353
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,270
Fire transmission can easily occur.

354
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,480
This is because in the spring, leaves are found on the trees.

355
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,530
Sunbaenim Kim.

356
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,860
I heard that the air rescue party can enter the no-trespassing zone in the Miryeong Forest.

357
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,680
How do you enter?

358
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,140
The no-trespassing zone? We only go there if we have to determine a fly position for a helicopter. Why?

359
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,210
Because photography is my hobby. I just thought that place could get me many things to shoot.

360
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,080
I do have the card key to the crossing gate, but we're only to use if for training or corresponding circumstances.

361
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,090
You are not allowed to go in without any permission.

362
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,330
Where are you going to stay by the way?
How could you be here in 10 minutes?

363
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,090
There's a decent place near here.
