2
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,380
I'll endure it.

3
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,420
I won't fall asleep, but find out why I feel this way.

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,470
Don't choose to suffer, Kang San Hyeok.

5
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,230
Please.

6
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,750
Please.

7
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,630
Please tell all the family of the deceased to come in.

8
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,820
This is it.

9
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,510
Please take a look at the deceased for the last time

10
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,450
and pray for her to go to a good place or

11
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,590
Oh, sir. Sir!

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,980
What's wrong with her nails?

13
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,300
Please, do it cleanly and pretty.

14
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,350
No, I'm okay.

Jeong Yeong Jae pasta

19
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,770
Jeong Yeong Jae doesn't like ground pepper. So leave it out.

20
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,620
Jeong Yeong Jae has a child's tastebuds, so tons of parmesan cheese.

21
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,550
Forget all this. Just throw away this useless recipe.

22
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,730
You asked to go out with me.

23
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,990
I won't date you. You aren't my type.

24
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,000
Not my type?

25
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,170
Jeong Yeong Jae has no taste and has eyes that are bottomless.

26

119 Special Rescue Team Daily Task Report

27
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,570
What is bothering you so much, Kang San Hyeok?

28
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,450
What is this?!

29
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,720
Are you awake?

30
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,740
What's with this noise?

31
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,830
Why are you programming the speaker in my house?

32
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,210
To let that expensive speaker play only the same type of music is to waste its capacity.

33
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,180
I'm sure it's happy, too.

34
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,830
The choice of your music really sucks.

35
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,430
Wh... what, sucks?

36
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,020
So, why are you trespassing so confidently?

37
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,000
You're pushing your way in so naturally this early in the morning.

38
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,830
I know. All my energy was sucked out of me yesterday that I got so hungry this morning.

39
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,600
You have something to eat, right? Something great.

40
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,330
- Hey, is this the food court at the mall or something?
- Gosh...

41
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,320
here you go again, being a cheapskate.

42
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,090
You have all kinds of goodies.

43
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,510
Let's get married, me and you.

44
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,640
- What?
- This is truffle oil. The truffles.

45
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,530
The world's three delicacies.

46
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,540
I, too, know.

47
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,810
For you, Kang San Hyeok...

48
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,880
I made a special pancake.

49
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,000
Look. It's salty pancakes!

50
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,880
It's expensive salt.

51
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,920
Black pepper pancakes!

52
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,270
Black pepper pancakes!

53
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,780
Thanks for the food. I will eat well.

54
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,040
You're left-handed.

55
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,900
Why?

56
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,630
Can't believe you're copying me.

57
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,490
I don't have any.

58
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,380
You have some there. What are you saying?

59
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,910
I didn't see. Sorry

60
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,300
Here, have one.

61
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,780
There.

62
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,950
It's the hospital director's bike. He said I can use both, so I'll lend you one.

63
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,650
Who said I'd ride it?

64
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,020
Why throw a tantrum? Let's go exercise together.

65
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,290
The weather is nice, too.

66
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,850
Yes. I see the same weather every day.

67
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,960
Follow me. I have to show you something.

68
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,150
I wanted to show you this. This smell.

69
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,360
Because of this scent that I can smell only at this exact time,

70
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,380
I can't give up riding my bike.

71
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,930
The smell of early morning dew evaporating in the morning sun.

72
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,120
The rocks, dirt, grass, and trees where the dew landed.

73
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,380
The smell of moss and leaves that explodes with the moisture at once.

74
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,850
Isn't this wonderful?

75
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,400
I didn't even know that such a scent existed.

76
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,340
I wanted to experience this smell again.

77
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,820
It was so amazing to find out that I can actually experience the scent.

78
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,970
You're continuing to overreact this morning.

79
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:29,520
I got angry at you for hitting on me. But would you cuss me out if I did it to you?

80
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,430
Chew me out now if you want to. I'll listen.

81
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,320
Then I'll start hitting on you now, Kang San Hyeok.

82
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,390
Why, today?

83
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,430
Why are you hitting on me today, of all days?

84
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,780
Because of yesterday?

85
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,700
Because you witnessed that a man who thinks so highly of himself isn't all that?

86
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,820
Is your nosy nature telling you to have pity on this weak man?

87
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,530
I think you're mistaken.

88
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,390
You were a weak man from the first time I met you.

89
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,300
Did you forget? How you appeared in front of me every time we met?

90
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,380
Can't you just give it to me? I don't have any money right now.

91
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,580
Jeong Yeong Jae. Come quickly, Yeong Jae!

92
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,460
To me, Kang San Hyeok

93
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,740
You were never the hero from the comics who runs through bullets and jump ropes with a metal rod.

94
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,000
Why don't you take off the superpower shell of yours?

95
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,850
I'll just hang around you, but I don't expect anything back in return.

96
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,690
Don't try to respond.

97
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,390
Let's just enjoy this smell together.

98
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,670
It will disappear momentarily.

99
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,550
You clearly said you don't want anything in return.

100
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:19,890
♬ In spite of my struggle to get closer, you coldly push me away ♬

101
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,060
♬ Please take me now ♬

102
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,230
♬ Please take me now ♬

103
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:37,630
♬ Towards the light which shines on me ♬

104
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,460
♬ Please take me ♬

105
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,470
♬ Please take me ♬

106
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,410
♬ Please take me now ♬

107
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,970
Oh, my gosh.

108
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,400
Oh my, welcome!

109
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,700
Did you have a hard time coming here? Please come in.

110
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,780
This way, please. I'm Park Jin Man. Aigoo, sir, you went through a lot.

111
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,680
I'm Park Jin Man. Move.

112
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,160
Yes, go in. I'll open the door for you. Welcome, welcome.

113
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,960
You can't take this medicine with your blood pressure medication.

114
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,200
You have to take this one or two hours after you take your blood pressure medicine. You must, okay?

115
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,690
Please go well.

116
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,930
Grandmother, why are you like this again?

117
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,080
Is your stomach not doing well?

118
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,230
I keep dry heaving.

119
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,680
Since when are you like this? Besides this, is anything else making you uncomfortable ?

120
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,580
Please go out this way.

121
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,260
Grandmother, oh my goodness.

122
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,030
You should come to me. I'm an expert in vomiting.

123
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:27,670
Cut the crap. I'll only see this lady doctor...

124
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,960
Aigoo, look at you. You have to get medicine from a pharmacist, treatment from a doctor.

125
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,290
She's not an internist.

126
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,770
The only internal medicine specialist at Miryeong Hospital is this Dr. Park Jin Man.

127
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,080
Let's go this way. Be careful.

128
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,760
- Why is he like this all of a sudden?
- There must be an event.

129
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,590
- An event?
- The fact that Dr. Park is behaving like a doctor

130
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,260
means he heard something from Gangwon Hospital.

131
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,300
Leave him be.

132
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,300
He'll get disappointed fast and come back to his senses.

133
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,430
Gangwon Hospital?

134
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,720
Rescue mission! Resue mission! Miryeong Mountain location C221 area, rescue mission!

135
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,570
Yang Cheol Sik, why aren't you rushing?

136
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,950
Crew Member Yang!

137
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,550
A hiker in his 50s suffering from exhaustion while hiking down. Emergency transfer.

138
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,910
Are you okay, sir?

139
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,340
Sir, have you drank alcohol?

140
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,830
Mr. Kim! Bulgwangdong...

141
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,750
Bulgwangdong. I'll pay double!

142
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,560
Give me a break.

143
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,370
There is no one to rescue, so we'll retreat, sir.

144
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,140
- What are you saying?
- We can refuse to transfer for a fake report.

145
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,920
Please walk down.

146
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,110
If you're well enough to say you're exhausted when you're drunk, I think you're more than capable.

147
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,260
Aigoo, our particular newbie. You're pissed. But...

148
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,080
- we have to take him with us.
- Follow the regulations, Sunbae Choi.

149
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Can't you tell that he got tired of hiking from drunkenness and called the helicopter?

150
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,460
It's great to follow the regulations. But he won't be able to go down before sundown.

151
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,160
What do we do? If we go down and there is an accident?

152
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,220
Then it's his fault for getting drunk while hiking. Why should I prevent an individual's misbehavior?

153
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,630
Not "I" but "we." It's not "Kang San Hyeok" but our rescue team will prevent that. Why?

154
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,370
Accidents usually happen when those misbehaviors occur.

155
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,140
I became a rescuer to prevent accidents. I guess not for you, Kang San Hyeok?

156
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,860
Confirmed the victim. Prepare the hoist.

157
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,480
47.

158
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,120
Why is it so slow?

159
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,480
Mr. Kim! Step on the helicopter accelerator!

160
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,270
Please go well.

161
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,910
Yes?

162
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,780
Member Yang.

163
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,450
I see you have been working out very hard.

164
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,200
Your bones and ligaments are fine. I think you injured your muscles.

165
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,460
Please to take medicine and rest a bit.

166
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,490
Thank you.

167
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,130
By any chance...

168
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,760
is there hearing loss that occurs only under certain circumstances?

169
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,790
Hearing loss?

170
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,040
In what situations, can you not hear noises?

171
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,180
When I work out.

172
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,440
When I work out, I can't hear well.

173
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,520
- You must be busy these days.
- With what?

174
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,560
You just seem that way.

175
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,170
Kang San Hyeok, are you going to be like this?

176
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,400
Stop paying attention to unnecessary things and mind your own business.

177
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,150
Yes, this is Bong Dae Yong.

178
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,540
Oh, is that so?

179
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,590
Yes.

180
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,270
Tornados, floods...

181
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,000
Team one, research geographical flaws of Miryeong special rescue team headquarters.

182
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,760
Find out all the climate susceptibility of the Miryeong base such as wind gusts.

183
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,540
Team two, based on the golden time for fires and life-threatening incidents,

184
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,130
calculate and propose new locations for transfer that are better than Miryeong Forest.

185
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,720
Both teams should recruit the best experts in their respective fields who can shape public opinion

186
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,220
and bring me the information and have some articles written.

187
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,940
I repeat. Our speed will determine our success or failure.

188
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,480
All hands on deck, everyone at headquarters.

189
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,160
Yes, sir.

190
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,230
The Miryeong project is taking its shape now. Shouldn't you return to Seoul?

191
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,920
Meetings via video will be tough going forward.

192
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,690
Your job as a special rescue team is tough, too.

193
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,450
This office is soundproof and secure against wiretapping, right?

194
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,440
Yes.

195
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,090
As you can see, the walls and ceilings are soundproof

196
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,720
and it's perfectly secure against wiretapping and hacking.

197
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,850
Never mind Director Jo, not even the CIA will be able to get through this office.

198
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,950
Are you taping an ad for apartment sales?

199
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,270
- How is it going with Choi Jeong Mok?
- Well, I guess he's really going to put his foot down.

200
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,710
No matter how much I offer to negotiate, he flat out turns me down.

201
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,280
This sneaky old snake...

202
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,400
Should we become Director Jo copycats?

203
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,890
- Copycat?
- I looked into how Director Jo of Taesung laid his foundation in the development world.

204
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,600
He doesn't just threaten people who refuse to sell their land.

205
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,220
An Achilles' heel.

206
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,840
For example, if the target is Choi Jeong Mok and since he's completely into his son...

207
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,350
His son.

208
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,580
Either have him followed and drive him to the edge with anxiety and fear.

209
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,970
Or ruin his son's career.

210
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,550
Make that person go through an ordeal he never wants to face.

211
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,940
This, this, this guy.  Choi Chang.

212
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,880
Geez, Kang San Hyeok, this guy... why does he go out for lunch so often?

213
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,780
I told him to write up the rescue report and even signed it for him. But he didn't turn it in. Where did he put it?

214
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,530
Here it is.

215
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,700
Park Hyeong Soo of Naseong Development?

216
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,940
Who was that?

217
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,350
Just a pup.

218
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,120
What?

219
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,500
Naseong Development CEO Park Hyeong Soo?

220
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,910
Those bastards are trying to eat up Miryeong Forestry?

221
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,960
What are you doing with my jacket?

222
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,390
Why didn't you submit the rescue report?

223
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,370
You eat out often these days.

224
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,010
As a rescuer, what kind of meal are you having besides our team meal?

225
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,060
This mannerless person, where did he go?

226
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,660
Sir, please hear me out...

227
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,370
The ones from the helicopter just now, where are they?

228
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,780
Please calm down and listen to me.

229
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,250
What is the matter?

230
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,640
That's right. It was you.

231
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,260
You bastard. I'm glad I ran into you. You!

232
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,190
- It pisses me off!
- Sir, what are you doing? I'll let this go and we'll talk.

233
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,860
I am trying to come to my senses.

234
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm speechless. As a rescuer, you don't rescue people, but mock a citizen?

235
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,820
What? Because I was drinking and hiking, you called for a helicopter?

236
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,470
You punk.

237
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,090
Sir, you must feel very upset.

238
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,990
That must it. So talk to me, calmly.

239
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,530
You found a drunk and unconscious patient who needs urgent care at the cliff

240
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,680
and were going to abandon me! Whoa!

241
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:44,660
This is my first time meeting such an evil rescuer in all my 30 years of hiking!

242
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,780
Please remember this all.

243
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:51,090
For an urgent patient who was out of it, aren't things way too clear for you?

244
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,660
What, what? Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

245
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,300
You, come here. Come here!

246
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,930
My goodness. My god!

247
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,900
Please forgive us, sir.

248
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,110
Sorry, sir.

249
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,030
This happened because I didn't train my subordinates well.

250
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,920
Please forgive me.

251
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,540
Team Leader, he's afraid he'd get fined

252
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,990
and that's why he's doing a pre-emptive strike.

253
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,240
- He's trying to avoid the fine...
- A rescuer

254
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,680
must at all times look out for a civilian's safety.

255
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,270
Regardless the reason, he should've looked out for your safety, sir.

256
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,410
It's my mistake. I taught him wrong.

257
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,270
Team Leader!

258
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,060
You all! are part of the Rescue Team! So do your work properly!

259
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,480
You live on the taxes that I paid with my blood and sweat.

260
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,340
How arrogant! Aigoo! Geez!

261
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,890
- Aigoo!
Oh, that's not it.

262
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,510
- Goodbye, sir.
- Geez!

263
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,720
Gosh, today is a day of complaints.

264
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,070
- Why?
- Because of the helicopter.

265
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,750
They say sand flew into their kimbap. They're asking me to pay for it.

266
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,220
Are you acting like totem poles?

267
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,130
Why are you all standing around? You should go home.

268
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:25,070
- You all have worked hard.
-Thank you for the hard work.

269
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,880
Eat a lot. What a waste.

270
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,130
Here!

271
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,570
So yummy.

272
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,620
♬ Okay, now. From the beginning ♬

273
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,030
Take the mic away.

274
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,460
You're the best.

275
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,290
Wow, today our Team Leader was cool!

276
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,270
"It was my mistake. I taught him wrong."

277
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,480
- So sexy! Sexy!
- You just found out?

278
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,580
Man, because I was wearing the uniform. Had I been wearing regular clothes,

279
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,730
I can't even walk 10 meters. Because women scream, "Oppa, Oppa!"

280
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,850
Gosh, of course. The average age of Miryeong village women is 76 years old.

281
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,680
76 years old!

282
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,200
Hey...

283
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,930
You did well. You should say what you need to people who complain viciously.

284
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,000
Of course, you did well. Good job.

285
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,270
Hey, hey, don't even bring up complaints. Seriously.

286
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,290
There's a person dying, yet they won't let us fly the helicopter saying we're scaring the calves.

287
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,760
At times, I wonder why I'm doing this risking my life.

288
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,680
Makes me think I'm missing something.

289
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,390
But I still love what I do.

290
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,370
Whether they curse me out or they wrong me, I just like rescuing people.

291
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,030
There's nothing more profitable than this.

292
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:36,140
You can see with your eyes how one life can save many lives.

293
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,230
- Agreed.
- Hey, Yang Cheol Sik.

294
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,470
How can you say that after going through that incident?

295
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,830
You saw your fellow rescuer lose his leg right in front of you...

296
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,000
Why are you bringing that up?

297
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,930
Geez, goosebumps. Why are we so serious?

298
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,160
- I'm just doing this because it's a full-time job.
- What?

299
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,670
Yeah, yeah, Soon Tae is right.

300
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,820
If it weren't for making a living, I'd quit it right away.

301
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,170
So sick of it. I'm so sick of it.

302
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,530
What did you say?

303
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,580
- Kang San Hyeok, what do you think?
- What?

304
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,770
How do you feel about this rescue team?

305
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,610
What does it mean to Kang San Hyeok?

306
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,350
To me

307
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,070
Live or die.

308
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,710
I live for the rescue team and I die for the rescue team.

309
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,140
I put my life on the line for the Miryeong Rescue Team.

310
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,570
Really?

311
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,290
Then I'll put my life on Kang San Hyeok.

312
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:43,890
I'm all in for the rescue team. It's the same thing if I put my life on the line for Kang San Hyeok, isn't it?

313
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,640
Whatever Kang San Hyeok does or wherever you go, I'll always be by your side.

314
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,700
