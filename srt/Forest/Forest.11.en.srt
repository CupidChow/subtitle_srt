1
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,290
Miryeong 119 Special Rescue Team

2
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,720
Member Kang San Hyeok.

3
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,320
This concludes second quarter joint training!

4
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,330
Good job, everyone.

5
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,400
Do you only think about taking shortcuts?

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
I am focused on how to win, and I won.

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,150
There's no reason why you can't fulfill your promise.

8
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,970
No. This win is invalid for me.

9
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,050
You didn't use the proper route, so you never reached the destination.

10
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,860
- Team leader.
- The air rescue team is not somewhere where taking a detour around logic is winning

11
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,280
The only logic is to save people.

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,490
Your beloved competitiveness doesn't mean anything here,

13
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,710
You are defective material for this program.

14
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,460
There are two types of people in this world.

15
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,570
Those who dream of badges, and those who earn them.

16
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,790
Although I may not know true value of the badge in my hand like this which you deny that I earned,

17
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,320
let's say that's true.

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,400
If it makes you feel better to say I'm defective, go ahead and do that.

19
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,310
This is a present from someone who has never lost a badge before.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,780
I mean, why?

21
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,240
Whether he goes floating down the water or not, why are you alarmed, why?

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Really.

23
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,400
Anyways, this aggravating human... Terrible nosiness...

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,680
What is it? Like someone caught spying?

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,090
Spying... What am I lacking that I would spy?! Seriously.

26
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,270
Of if not

27
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,660
- What we have to talk about--
- Don't you know who I am.

28
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,150
I'm part of a special rescue commission, a commission!

29
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,410
An emergency happened right in front of me, so of course I'm surprised.

30
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,370
You expect me to just watch irresponsibly and see whether they die or not?

31
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,970
What are you saying?

32
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,930
- We definitely...
- No, we're not!

33
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,680
I didn't have even 0.1 degree of any emotion outside of work. Why are you like this? Seriously

34
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,010
What's going on? What is this?

35
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,450
Didn't we agree from the start?

36
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,270
Not to put out laundry where it can be seen

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,720
When I come home tired from work, that sort of unsightly view greets me...

38
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,950
I can't accept or understand it. Please clean it immediately, the sun is going down.

39
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,260
It's not messy; that's just life and reality.

40
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,670
Anyways, I'll clean up as I promised

41
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,350
What were you expecting, Commission?

42
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,150
Was I supposed to be interested in whether or not you were thinking about work?

43
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,190
Commission?

44
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,850
Oh, that's a relief.

45
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,100
I was worried that you would misunderstand and expect things on your own.

46
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,470
Oh, how refreshing. That's how you should be, since you're knowledgeable.

47
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,420
OK, no going overboard!

48
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,080
That's what I should say. Let's be prudent.

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,550
Delusions are forbidden!

50
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,210
The only thing waiting for me on a vacation day

51
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,590
is just cleaning that I'm behind on.

52
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,520
What can I do, gotta clean it.

53
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,630
The garage is empty again.

54
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,160
Where is he going every single break?

55
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,470
What is that? Is it the thing from last time that got its tail cut and ran away?

56
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,110
Get out! Get out!

57
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,940
Yes, Aunt. There's something I needed to ask you.

58
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,920
By any chance when I was young, did I ever live in Miryeong in Gangwon-do?

59
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,520
Oh really? Did I ever vacation there?

60
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,890
I understand, Aunt. Yes.

61
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,500
When you come to Korea, please call me.

62
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,170
I'm going to keep it in here.

63
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,350
Why didn't I ever think of spending a day off here?

64
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm grateful to the lizard...

65
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,710
It's the tree from before.

66
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,380
It's so big!

67
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,290
Why is only this one white?

68
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,790
Birch?

69
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,080
That's right, I saw this in an illustration.

70
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,470
White, where the bark comes off - a birch tree.

71
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,800
It makes a crackling noise when it burns.

72
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,910
Where is the end of all that ignorance?

73
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,730
What?

74
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,440
The garage was empty from this morning, so you were here?

75
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,500
Do you think if they're white they're all birch?

76
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,570
Come look at this.

77
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,310
Birch trees don't have many branches so they look straight

78
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:49,020
But this has so many branches it looks like fingers spread out, right?

79
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,310
It's an Erman's birch tree.

80
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,810
Erman's birch?

81
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,990
It's in the birch family but a different species.

82
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,670
If you look closely, it's more grey than the birch.

83
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,970
It really...

84
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,120
looks like you're spreading your fingers like this.

85
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,260
So where does this smartypants disease end?

86
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,110
You have to put everything in your brain to make yourself feel safe, right?

87
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,270
Because you have to be the only smart one in this zone.

88
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,770
Well, it's clear the smartypants here isn't Dr. Jeong.

89
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,070
Don't you know it's not a smartypants disease, it's just being smart?

90
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,660
Pure natural. Very rare.

91
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,250
Ah, yes. Then please keep going down the natural path you're headed on.

92
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,200
I think I said delusions are forbidden.

93
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm going down the path I was going down, so if you're uncomfortable you change paths.

94
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,320
Although, it doesn't look like you have the ability to find a different path.

95
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,810
What flower is this?

96
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,540
Is it a mini-lily?

97
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,060
It's so pretty.

98
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,360
It’s an Asian Fawnlily. It’s a perennial that belongs to the lily family and symbolizes jealousy.

99
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,510
It's a natural tonic, good for diarrhea and vomiting. You can boil it with vegetables and eat it.

100
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,480
The soup has slippery feeling so it's sometimes called mountain seaweed soup.

101
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,810
Who asked?

102
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,130
Mountain seaweed soup?

103
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,700
I am curious what that would taste like.

104
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,310
This is really unique!

105
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,510
Do you this, too? What is it?

106
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,490
What about that? Or that?

107
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,850
What about that white flower? What is it? What?

108
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,570
If you look closely, you look like a person who forgot they have a head.

109
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,070
Do you see? Violets.

110
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,640
What the heck... You just knew because of a cell phone app?

111
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,400
Don't you know homo faber? It's a person who uses tools.

112
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,910
The important point is that you have knowledge.

113
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,190
Oh, this opens up like this here!

114
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,670
I was part of Korea's top 1% luxury.

115
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,840
I was living in a place like this, I was.

116
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,440
But there is no valley. So how is there a lake at the top of the mountain?

117
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,830
Fascinating...

118
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,790
What is this?

119
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,840
Oh, wow! Isn't this a clam?

120
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,210
It is a clam!

121
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,150
How does a clam live on a mountain?

122
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,900
Aren't you going to take a picture?

123
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,630
It's true... I don't want to take a picture.

124
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,610
It's too impressive to press the button as usual.

125
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,430
I just want to store it in my mind.

126
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,630
This is why you joined the aviation rescue team, isn't it?

127
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,050
Phantom pain.

128
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,230
You haven't had any pain since you joined the rescue team, right?

129
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:27,640
People talk about economic value, but in reality this feeling is the natural state.

130
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,260
I'm right, right?

131
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,240
You may be a surgeon but you can't help the emotions.

132
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,490
Well let's just say that's so.

133
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,250
Do you Dr. Jeong think this is your natural state?

134
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,290
Your panic attacks. Do you think they'll be ok?

135
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,040
Earlier in the office I saw the lizard without a tail.

136
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,830
I'm not sure if it's the same one as last time

137
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,230
but it climbed the wall well and ran away. It looked ok.

138
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,690
It lived like that.

139
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,890
I'm going to live, too.

140
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,010
If I have to cut it out to live, I plan to proceed like that.

141
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,900
For some reason I feel like I can do it.

142
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,230
Even though I'm afraid.

143
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,260
Next, the details of sales of products from national forest land trees.

144
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,900
The land is located in Miryeong-gun, Miryong-li, mountain 21, 37.6 hectares.

145
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,300
The species of trees consists of 15,214 units of Pitch Pine,

146
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,440
12,563 units of Larch,

147
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,810
8,871 units of other broad-leaved trees,

148
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,350
a total of 36,648 units.

149
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,270
Thought my whole life of tree sales

150
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,000
I've never seen such mistreatment.

151
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,830
That means as soon as she was transferred here, she laced up her hiking boots

152
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,590
and went around counting each tree.

153
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,300
She must have been counting the number of trees.

154
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,620
Mr. Choi, are you just going to sit and watch?

155
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,570
She must have accounted for all the trees in the garth as well. (garth: A clearing in the forest).

156
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,120
Which idiot taught her how to do that?

157
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,740
Just wait until I get my hands on who did.

158
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,750
I should pinch the mouth.

159
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,960
I'm so pissed. Pissed!

160
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,200
Thank you, sir.

161
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,300
I don't know how you found out about the garths,

162
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,480
but this is wrong. It's conventional that you leave some food for the swallows.

163
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,720
That's what I'm saying. I would think that if I saw a magpie but

164
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,470
I only see fatty snakes who've eaten all the swallows.

165
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,330
I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.

166
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:18,690
Your career as a public service worker won't be smooth if you make the lumbermen your enemy.

167
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,250
That's what I want; not having everything go smoothly.

168
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,430
If I did everything by the book and things are not going smoothly, that means something is festering and must be cut out.

169
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,530
I will take my tweezers and squeeze pus out. Wow!

170
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,630
Isn't it too exciting and worthwhile?

171
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,020
Thank you for giving me a hint.

172
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,720
I will keep my fixed on it, going forward.

173
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,960
What is she saying?

174
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,530
Enforcement Officer Oh, it's not good to be so brash.

175
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,190
You know, Miryeong Forest is the first target for the tweezers, right?

176
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,070
Wait for it. I'll make the best out if it.

177
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,230
Crazy punk.

178
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,820
Miryeong Village starts with Choi Jeong Mok and ends with Choi Jeong Mok.

179
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,430
As you can see, most of the Miryeong village residents own small parts of the Miryeong forest.

180
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,840
But, if we can just get Choi Jeong Mok on our side, the rest of the residents will follow.

181
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,090
They say, one word from Choi Jeong Mok and all the residents follow.

182
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,560
What about the residents' children?

183
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,000
Even if we target the older residents, none of them will sell.

184
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,390
It might be faster persuading their children who have moved away.

185
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,850
Yes, it would be best to target Choi Jeong Mok's son first as well.

186
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,890
He lives with his father in Miryeong village.

187
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,910
Was there a young man living in Miryeong village?

188
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,860
Yes, their address is the same.

189
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,800
Choi Jeong Mok, Choi Chang.
Choi.

190
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,440
Choi Chang?

191
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,460
Do you know him?

192
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,080
Name: Choi Chang, DOB: 11/10/1988
Address: 112-2, Cheongseo-ro, Miryeong-eup, Miryeong-gun, Gangwon-do

193
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,820
The rural golden spoon...

194
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,970
Director, the car the suspicious kids were driving was an untraceable car.

195
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,920
- The owner of the vehicle was a random person.
- What about the professor?

196
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,160
He changed his number, took a leave of absence from school, and has gone into hiding.

197
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,390
Who did you say was the assemblyman most likely to be directly involved in the development permit?

198
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,130
Assemblyman Kim whom I told you about last time, is easy to approach and most suitable.

199
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,080
Schedule a meeting right away.

200
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,720
It's time for my shift so I have to return to the rescue team,

201
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,000
send down two of your teammates who are quick on their feet.

202
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,070
Yes, Director.

203
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,790
Nurse Kim, I'm going on a house call.

204
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,960
Bye.

205
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,910
House call... who would even be waiting?

206
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,850
So funny.

207
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,720
What is it?

208
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,000
That shuttle...?

209
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,110
This must be the place.

210
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,290
It's here, it's here...

211
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,910
It's here?

212
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,080
Hospital?

213
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,600
Yes, this way.

214
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,840
What is this like a bolt of lighting?

215
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,900
Something's wrong!

216
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,410
- This must be a shuttle going somewhere else!
- We'll see you in order.

217
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,230
Yes? The hospital director's special order?

218
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,380
The hospital director?

219
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,910
Yes, I understand.

220
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,930
Yes!

221
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,540
Hospital director!

222
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,800
- The shuttle arrived, right?
- Yes.

223
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,630
What is all of this, so suddenly?

224
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,640
It's not suddenly.

225
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,920
Miryeong Hospital was created to increase the accessibility to medical treatment for local residents.

226
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,170
It's time for the hospital to start functioning properly.

227
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,840
We turned the shuttle from Gangyeong Line to Gangwon Hospital, so

228
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,110
Dr. Jeong, take responsibility and take charge.

229
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,770
Me?

230
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:24,700
I think you are more than capable. 
So, I will observe how well Miryeong Hospital revives.

231
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,090
Hospital director!

232
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,900
I mean, how does he expect me to be responsible for this shuttle...?

233
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,050
Oh, you're dying of happiness! Dying!

234
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,070
It's the face of someone who's taken responsibility for the whole world's patients.

235
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,320
Well, let's see how long that face lasts.

236
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,720
With this many patients, where do you think you're going?

237
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,030
Do you think I'm your assistant?

238
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,470
He said for Dr. Jeong to take charge, so figure it out on your own!

239
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,430
I don't know.

240
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,030
OK. But the responsible person needs to write reports.

241
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,910
Do you want me to correctly report that you ditched the patients?

242
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,470
Well, if that's what you want... Aigoo

243
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,730
Does it feel like you've been recognized by the hospital chief? Like he would do anything for you?

244
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,530
Keep this in mind. Even if that's the case, this place is just Miryeong Hospital.

245
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,530
Not Gangwon Hospital.

246
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,290
What is he saying?

247
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,940
Breathe in.

248
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,630
You have an inflammation in your bronchus.

249
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,510
♬ knowing that I am ♬

250
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,900
You have indigestion.

251
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,500
Oh, right there!

252
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,980
♬ Should I try talking to you? ♬

253
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,380
Please come back in three days to disinfect the wound.

254
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,680
♬ Rather than what you want ♬

255
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,540
Bye bye.
♬ Listen to the answer that I prepared for you. ♬

256
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,720
♬ Around the sunset... ♬

257
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,700
♬ We can talk facing each other, ♬

258
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,070
♬ we can fall in love ♬

259
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,520
Are you escaping reality?

260
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,100
Pretending to be overly youthful.

261
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,410
You're a bit late today.

262
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:40,340
Isn't that more of a comment for someone sharing a room?

263
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,860
Did something good happen? Enough that you can't contain your excitement?

264
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,040
It's not excitement.

265
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,050
The reason of existence for Dr. Jeong!

266
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,920
That reason has run into my arms! Right into my arms!

267
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,860
I'm feeling good! I'll buy!

268
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,030
You'll buy? What?

269
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,480
Just follow me before I change my mind.

270
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,720
It's not every day that I open my wallet!

271
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,090
Bam!

272
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,030
Thank you!

273
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,240
The visual is daebak! I'm salivating!

274
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,050
Let's eat, let's eat, let's eat!

275
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,630
It's so good.

276
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,790
What happened for your adrenaline to be exploding like this?

277
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,680
Yes, something did happen.

278
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,060
Something very rewarding happened.

279
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:58,320
Anyway, since I've come to Miryeong Forest, today is the first day that I'm glad I came here.

280
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,830
Jeong Yeong Jae! You did a good job putting up with everything!

281
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,420
You have to devour everything before it gets cold.

282
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,760
What is she doing?

283
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,240
Hot, hot, hot!

284
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,560
Just this once?

285
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,460
Let's toast since it's hot!

286
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,120
♪ Drink up! Drink up! ♪
♪ Drink, drink, drink, drink♪

287
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,180
♪ Until when are you going to make my shoulders dance ♪

288
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,190
♪ Look at my shoulder, it's been dislocated ♪
Stop. Please, stop.

289
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,450
♪ Dislocated, dislocated, dislocated, dislocated ♪

290
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,470
I'm... not naturally gifted,

291
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,210
so studying to become a doctor is very difficult for me.

292
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,550
I'm giving it my all and barely keeping up.

293
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:01,270
Since it's so difficult, money or status alone doesn't reward me.

294
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,870
I'm being of help to others.

295
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,820
I'm helping someone live instead of dying.

296
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,340
That feeling has helped me continue this difficult work.

297
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,850
I felt that way today and it's been a very long time.

298
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:36,640
And as far as I can see, Kang San Hyeok joined the rescue team for the very same reason.

299
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,760
I'm sure of it.

300
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,180
If not, why would a VVIP come to this place? Am I Right?

301
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,760
You act very coyly, but Dr. Jeong can see through everything.

302
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,290
Kang San Hyeok doesn't satisfy his personal needs,

303
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,640
but here.

304
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,720
He's a person that wants to satisfy his soul.

305
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,360
That's why the two of us...

306
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,350
Your heart skipped a beat, didn't it?

307
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,420
Have you never dated? For your pupils to quiver during psychological counseling like this.

308
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,220
So unexpected!

309
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,300
How badly do you want my heart to skip a beat for you to mistake this boredom as my pupils quivering?

310
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,660
At any rate, your self-admiration is out of this world.

311
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,830
Anyway, it's late so let's get going.

312
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,170
- I'm sleepy.
- No...

313
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,960
Your heard did skip a beat...

314
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,100
This is!

315
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,140
What?

316
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,060
- One more song?
- What?

317
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,970
- One more song.
- Again?

318
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,280
How many times has she played this...

319
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,640
♬ Igual en el mundo la cosa está corrupto ♬

320
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,620
♬ Tan delicado, al paso caminado encaminado, a lo campo minado ♬

321
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,850
♬ Se ve que el gobierno nos controla, nos tiene hipnotizados ♬

322
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,220
♬ Es un juego mental ilimitado, nosotros como ser humano nos dejamos ♬

323
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,530
♬ No quieren que seamos ♬

324
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,040
♬ Quieren mantenernos controlados ♬

325
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,540
♬ Los que quieren el poder, el futuro en sus manos. ♬

326
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,420
♬ El mundo que está cambiando ♬

327
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,680
♬ Cruel humano jala la tapa del microchip que le han implantado ♬

328
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,780
♬ Baila muchachita, baila muchachito. Baila abuelo, baila abuelita ♬

329
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,580
♬ Cambia tu ritmo... ♬
