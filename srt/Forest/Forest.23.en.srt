1
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,070
Orange color.

2
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,920
Episode 23
It's high... My God!

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,940
My God!

4
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,660
What brings you here, Director...

5
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,020
Didn't I tell you, Dr. Jeong?

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,600
That I'd be seeing you again real soon.

7
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,420
You must've been up to something interesting.

8
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,750
Interesting? It's just something I was studying.

9
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,230
But what brings you here without calling first?

10
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,830
My sweetie

11
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,130
At Miryeong Hospital?

12
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:00,780
Including the trauma center you proposed, I'm planning on a business to provide great support for all the village residents.

13
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,300
If we expanded this place and brought in the latest equipment, I think it will be a great medical center for Miryeong County.

14
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,150
You came here at this hour to tell me that?

15
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,920
Thanks to you, the foundation finds the project meaningful and is moving forward swiftly.

16
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,590
It was worth making my hasty trip down here.

17
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,750
The hospital site is spacious and I even got to see you studying.

18
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm glad that the trauma center will be built so fast. But I'm not sure about the medical center.

19
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,900
There's already Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital and isn't this area too out of the way for the county residents?

20
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,750
That's why it's even better.

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,140
The neglected area like Miryeong is being reborn as a symbol of medical welfare.

22
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,630
Is Miryeong your hometown? Or is it the foundation's executive director's?

23
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,310
It seems like you love Miryeong County very much.

24
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,930
It's all thanks to you, Dr. Jeong.

25
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,710
You changed Miryeong, Dr. Jeong.

26
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,420
Jeong Yeong Jae!

27
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,350
Yeong Jae!

28
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,620
Gosh, you scared me!

29
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,620
I thought you were running late. What brings you here?

30
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,680
I went home, but you were there. I kept calling, but you didn't answer.

31
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,010
It was on silence.

32
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,140
Did you see a patient at this hour? I saw a car I didn't recognize drive by.

33
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,190
He looked around the hospital saying he'll expand the hospital.

34
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,280
So, why did you call me?

35
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,150
My God!

36
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,420
I found it on my way over.

37
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,790
I guess you've seen that somewhere.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,830
- Let's go. To our home.
- Okay.

39
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,160
You have to let me go to go home.

40
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,010
I don't want to. Let's go like this.

41
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,790
Let's go, shorty.

42
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,180
What are you doing?

43
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,600
But you know, you yelled out, "Yeong Jae" earlier.

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,440
So what? You're mine, so I'm calling you by name.

45
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,350
You're so funny. Who says I'm yours?

46
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,620
Aren't you? Who do you belong to then?

47
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,710
Will you really be okay?

48
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,830
Sleeping alone?

49
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,350
No!

50
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,280
Without you, Oppa, Yeong Jae will...

51
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,340
will be so, so scared.

52
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,700
Did you think I'd say that?

53
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,010
Hurry home and go to bed. I have lots of work to do.

54
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,800
This place is good. Where is this?

55
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,210
I won't be scared at all since the rain stopped. Right?

56
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm going to bed first.

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,750
The rice cake is the best during summer. Don't you think?

58
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,420
Geez, so dry.

59
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,780
So dry, so dry...

60
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,260
Yes, this is Jeong Yeong Jae.

61
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,490
I'm sorry to call you so late, Dr. Jeong.

62
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,250
Our foundation would like to have you as the director of the medical center.

63
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,310
Me?

64
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,250
Why me?

65
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,260
For what you symbolize.

66
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,540
We want to use your pure intention as the medical center's marketing point.

67
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,500
So, I wanted to ask you if you could send me a document

68
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,810
on a specific area of study that you're interested in.

69
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,970
A document?

70
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,110
It's a formality to produce a profile on the medical center director. You can make it simple.

71
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,680
For example, what you were studying earlier...

72
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,270
Well, things like that.

73
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,960
I'm only a resident now. What do you mean a medical center director? That's over the top.

74
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,750
There are specialists at Miryeong Hospital who have worked there for a long time.

75
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,190
I'll discuss that with the foundation.

76
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,820
In any case, I need some information on your profile. So, please send me that document.

77
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,560
Okay, I'll do that.

78
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,070
Why does he want me to write up a document?

79
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,420
And he called me about that at this late hour?

80
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,080
About AQU6 Test Kit

81
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,750

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,300
Test kit – About arsenic substance

83
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,310
Director, a doctor from Miryeong Hospital requested a water quality analysis report.

84
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,380
Miryeong Hospital?

85
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,860
Take care of it as per usual.

86
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,510
Find out what Kang San Hyeok's critical weakness is.

87
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,910
It's Kang San Hyeok's fiancée.

88
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:16,130
And they live in Miryeong village together. It's the same doctor who requested a water quality analysis report from Miryeong Hospital.

89
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,800
The managing director wishes to donate quietly behind the scenes.

90
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,420
I ask that you move forward with everything under the foundation name without revealing the managing director's name.

91
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,530
Hello, Director. Long time no see.

92
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,820
- We've been waiting. Have a seat.
- Yes.

93
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,390
Jeong Yeong Jae.

94
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,810
Miryeong 119 Special Rescue Team is celebrating its 25th anniversary today.

95
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,440
To recognize our team members' hard work night and day for the safety of the people...

96
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,740
Move, I can't see him.

97
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,230
He's a bad boy.

98
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,120
For the past 25 years consistently,

99
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,390
the village residents have lived side by side with our rescue team.

100
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,650
And we've prepared this celebration with gratitude.

101
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,500
For a helicopter, especially behind the helicopter...

102
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,030
You can't stand behind it.

103
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,730
You can't see the propeller rotating on its tail end.

104
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,410
- Something terrible will happen.
- So scary...

105
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,210
Team Leader.

106
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,830
I think the trauma management system will be worked out.

107
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,780
Trauma management?

108
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,960
You had asked me about it last time for your team members.

109
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,940
When did we talk about that? Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?

110
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,650
It was you, Team Leader.

111
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,880
No way. I'd remember it if it were me.

112
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,070
I see...

113
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,830
Ma'am!

114
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,690
Her mom and dad had already drowned.

115
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,760
And the little girl was not moving.

116
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,670
Yeong Jae!

117
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,320
Yeong Jae!

118
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,290
It's okay. It's okay.

119
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,000
It's okay.

120
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,950
What are you doing here?

121
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,540
You're up.

122
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,210
The tranquilizer was about to wear out. I didn't think I should leave you alone.

123
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,180
Are you okay?

124
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,350
I'm okay.

125
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm proud of you, Jeong Yeong Jae.

126
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,530
You must've been scared. But you're awake now.

127
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,750
I'm so proud of you.

128
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,770
I'd like to be alone.

129
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,510
All right. Do that.

130
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,750
100 Questions and Answers for a couple

131
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,560
Jeong Jeong Jae, Birthday, Schools attended...

132
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,960
I'm not going to value.

133
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,220
I'm not going to value.

134
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,770
I'm not going--

135
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,230
What's this?

136
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,760
You're such an expert. The best.

137
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,980
"What I want to do most: Camping." That's what you wrote.

138
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,460
It's the weekend. Get in.

139
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,430
- Go camping? Now?
- Yeah.

140
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,930
You don't have to prepare anything. Just go like that.

141
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,040
Hurry. Hurry up.

142
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,760
Wait. Just a moment.

143
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,220

- So pretty.
- You could eat it.

157
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,460

♬ That is how I want just you ♬

162
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,450
♬ In my heart, it's only you ♬

163
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,580
So sour.

164
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,770
♬ Only you in my heart ♬

165
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,840
♬ Only you always in my heart ♬

166
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,850
Whoa...

167
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,500
♬ Will you come to me? ♬

168
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,090
What color is the tree then?

169
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,910
♬ Sometimes on rainy days ♬

170
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,790
♬ we remember together walking together ♬

171
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,110
♬ An intimate ending ♬

172
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,720
Really?

173
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,760
You've never taken a nap?

174
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,530
Don't you feel guilty if you lie down during the day?

175
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,660
There are so many people who are trying to catch up with me. How could I sleep?

176
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,810
What do you mean how? You just close your eyes.

177
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,710
Try it and see if the world collapses or not.

178
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,510
I guess you don't understand my position.

179
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,920
The size of the investments I'm managing...

180
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,450
♬ We will sit and face each other blankly ♬

181
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,470
♬ We can fall in love ♬

182
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,650
♬ Always ♬

183
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,190
Geez, I can't take a nap.

184
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,640
♬ Only you in my heart ♬

185
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,760
Fireflies.

186
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,950
It's my first time seeing them.

187
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,880
They're so pretty when you see them in person.

188
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,970
Thank you.

189
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,530
It would've taken me a long time for me to come out of it.

190
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm paying you back.

191
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,150
When I wanted to hide behind the wall,

192
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,760
you barged right in and made me laugh.

193
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,750
I owe you a lot.

194
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,460
To that pretty person.

195
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,840
You know...

196
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:51,600
I... when I was nine years old...

197
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,800
You don't have to struggle to tell me. I know already.

198
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,350
No.

199
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,320
I want to tell you.

200
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:36,260
That day, with those hands that used to stroke my head and embrace me every day

201
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,030
and the hands that held me underwater

202
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,540
and seeing them float limply in front of my eyes...

203
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,430
Their last.

204
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,820
Whenever I think about that,

205
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,740
I hear a whisper in my ears.

206
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,340
"You're cursed."

207
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,710
"You're cursed, so you're miserable."

208
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,300
I keep whispering that to me.

209
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,190
That's how I was.

210
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,570
But I have the confidence to fight, thanks to you.

211
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:44,820
You're the proof that I'm not cursed.

212
00:21:52,910 --> 00:22:02,630
♬ Suddenly, like a tree that has grown, you're always there ♬

213
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,570
♬ Always ♬

214
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,200
♬ Always ♬

215
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,370
♬ Only your warm breath ♬

216
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:22,040
♬ fills me up ♬

217
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,880
♬ Because I will love you ♬

218
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,670
♬ Like a day that will never come back to me ♬

219
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,190
♬ Because I will love you ♬

220
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,780
♬ I love you ♬

221
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,570
That devil.

222
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,850
♬ Always ♬

223
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,470
♬ Accidentally, the times you face me, ♬

224
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,380
♬ I will seep into your heart ♬

225
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,640
♬ Always ♬

226
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,890
♬ Always ♬

227
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,210
♬ Yes, with your warm breaths, ♬

228
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,270
I'll go.

229
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,610
♬ you fill me. ♬

230
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,420
♬ Because I will love you ♬

231
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,520
♬ I love you ♬

232
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,230
♬ I love you ♬

233
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,290
♬ As always at that spot ♬

234
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,780
♬ Always ♬

235
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,280
♬ Always ♬

236
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,230
Description of incident: I, Bong Dae Yong, holding the hoist...

237
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,790
Good morning, Team Leader.

238
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,040
Oh, good morning.

239
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,780
Team Leader, about yesterday's accident...

240
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,210
The hoist adjuster must put away the rope after the training.

241
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,400
But why was it left out dangerously and got tangled with our visitor's foot?

242
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,420
I forgot. It was my mistake.

243
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,110
Why did you make a mistake?

244
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,770
Good morning!

245
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:31,400
You could've told me to put the rope away. But you even forgot that as well.

246
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,500
You've worked as an aviation rescuer for 25 years.

247
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,720
How could you have forgotten that?

248
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,670
By chance, did you measure your alcohol level yesterday morning?

249
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,850
What are you doing, Kang hoobae? It's not necessary.

250
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,210
It's not unnecessary. I'm trying to prevent an even bigger incident.

251
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,310
After the incident yesterday, you couldn't give out any orders. You were acting strange, Team Leader.

252
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,960
Did you measure your alcohol level?

253
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,030
- Two nights ago, I...
- Team Leader!

254
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,320
- Team Leader, wait, Pilot Jeong is looking for you.
- Give me a moment.

255
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,220
You know, he's in a huge rush due to his flying schedule.

256
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,090
Where have you been? I've been looking for you all over. Hurry, hurry.

257
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,170
Hurry, hurry!

258
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,470
- Two night ago...
- I was looking for you all over.

259
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,790
Why couldn't I get in touch, Team Leader?

260
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,940
When will you be done with all the files?

261
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,430
I'm almost done. I have a little bit more.

262
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,520
What do you mean you're done? You have this much left. Why bluff?

263
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,900
That's all done. I just have this much.

264
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,330
You've done this much already? Does that make sense?

265
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,640
I took them home when I had to. I even pulled all nighters.

266
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,180
I'll finish them today. Please wait.

267
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,680
You pulled all nighters?

268
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,680
What choice do I have? My high and mighty sunbaenim asked me to do this.

269
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,530
I should do it right away.

270
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,760
Sunbaenim?

271
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:11,580
Sunbaenim, I'm not good at kissing up to people.

272
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,940
I know my weaknesses very well.

273
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,740
But you know, I don't play dirty to steal someone else's cake.

274
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,700
I went to the conference only because the higher-ups told me to go.

275
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,270
I'm doing my best to undo an unnecessary misunderstanding.

276
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,020
The shuttle bus doesn't come today. So I'll organize everything and hand them over to you quickly.

277
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,470
Whatever! Then do that.

278
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,930
Let's do this.

279
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,150
Director, I'm going in to catch the rats.

280
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,160
You made sure to set the trap, right?

281
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,370
I planted infamous experts.

282
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,950
You don't have to worry.

283
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,830
There will be an introduction by the Director Kwon Joo Han as the chair of the shareholders' meeting.

284
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,460
Hello to all the shareholders whom I respect. I'm Kwon Joo Han.

285
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,960
As a result of the audit, Taesung High Tech's finances and

286
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,570
accounting, there were no corruption nor important issues relating

287
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,020
to the breach of the corporate by-laws.

288
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,560
Wait a minute! Wait!

289
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,430
Please be quiet!

290
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,960
For a company that manufactures electronic parts,

291
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,790
I see evidence of planning a resort business.

292
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,170
What do you mean there were no important issues?

293
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,670
How did you get to start the Miryeong Forest Resort project

294
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,130
and how is it moving forward?

295
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,000
Please explain, so the shareholders can understand.

296
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,610
I address you respectfully, shareholder.

297
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,050
I don't know why such a rumor is going around.

298
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:20,570
But I have never been involved with a resort project.

299
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,930
You've never done that?

300
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,270
You hired a fixer named Jo Kwang Pil, a former gangster,

301
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,870
and order him to move forward with the business.

302
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:36,820
The flow of the funds to that Jo Kwang Pil's service company is clearly shown here.

303
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,770
Will you continue to deceive the shareholders?

304
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:54,600
Respectfully, shareholder, I don't know someone by that name.

305
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,560
Who's spreading false information? Provide proof!

306
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,740
There's a photo.

307
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,590
Melanoma?

308
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,320
Particularly in this village...

309
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,130
And this village has a history of manufacturing pesticides.

310
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,770
Lung cancer.

311
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,820
Deceased.

312
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,460
Sepsis.

313
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,370
Deceased.

314
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,800
Why is this stupid vending machine so slow?

315
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,380
Dr. Park, why did you keep the photos of these patients?

316
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,240
What are you talking about?

317
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,290
Among the records from last ten years, you kept only these two patients' photos.

318
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,490
- Why did you do that?
- Geez...

319
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,580
Who are they?

320
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,860
Well, just because. It felt weird to me.

321
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,580
What was strange about them? Their skin condition?

322
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,790
This grandma had a bad cold, but

323
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:54,590
she had these blood clots, bruises, and dark spots. So, I took some pictures.

324
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,650
But she passed away in a week with high fever and sepsis.

325
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,040
This grandpa was diagnosed with lung cancer. And he had a strange melanoma on his back.

326
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,160
But what about these pictures?

327
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,460
Their addresses are both Miryeong village.

328
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,690
By chance, do you know if they used underground water for drinking?

329
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,790
How would you know that, Dr. Jeong? By chance, are you thinking that's it?

330
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,010
Metal poisoning?

331
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:21,900
How do you know about that, Dr. Park? Did you figure that out then?

332
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,140
See? You should've pressed the issue.

333
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,230
Back then, Dr. Park thought it was strange.

334
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,930
But nothing was detected through water quality analysis

335
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:38,060
and they passed away pretty quickly. So, he just let that go.

336
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,460
So what else could I do? I was demoted to this tiny hospital.

337
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,730
They'd look down on me for saying something ridiculous.

338
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,070
It's not ridiculous, Dr. Park.

339
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,370
They found arsenic in the analysis.

340
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,990
What!

341
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,270
What's going on with this situation?

342
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,560
Then why wasn't anything detected on the water quality analysis?

343
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,620
There's something strange going on in Miryeong village.

344
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,400
