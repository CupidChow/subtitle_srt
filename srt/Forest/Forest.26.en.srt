Episode 26
Kang San Hyeok, come to your senses!

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,990
Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok!

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,350
Wake up!

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,850
Kang San Hyeok, come to your senses!

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,590
Rescuer Kang!

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,070
Kang San Hyeok...

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,790
Kang San Hyeok, come to your senses!

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,410
Are you awake?

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,740
It's okay. It's me.

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,550
It's me.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,280
It's nothing serious.

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,860
It was a light shock. Your vitals are normal. You're okay.

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,010
Don't be shocked.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,610
How about that child?

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,550
Did that child survive?

16
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,850
It's your first time witnessing such a situation on your rescue, huh?

17
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,480
It must've been a huge shock since it was a young child.

18
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,010
I understand. I'm sure you were in a huge shock.

19
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,670
Talk to me.

20
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,710
What you felt then. Your emotions from then.

21
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,420
You can pour out to me.

22
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,890
I'll listen to everything you have to say.

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,600
Before...

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,230
you asked me if I knew the song, "Mountain rabbit."

25
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,990
Do you remember?

26
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,140
Did I ever sing that song?

27
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,420
When you came here with your phantom pain...

28
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,180
♬ Mountain rabbit, rabbit ♬

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,490
♬ Where do you think you're going? ♬

30
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,710
Why? Did you remember that song?

31
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,540
If...

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,030
If I...

33
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,120
Nothing.

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,370
It's nothing.

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,320
That's right.

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,750
Don't force it.

37
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,330
Just do as your heart pleases.

38
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,800
But you know...

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,620
let's move forward at some point. To look for the mountain rabbit.

40
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,430
And let go of that memory.

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,140
I'm here.

42
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,620
When you smile, I smile, too.

43
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,530
I'm always by your side.

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,650
- Hello.
- This is Chang. Someone who used to use the surname Choi.

45
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,150
You're totally losing it, man.

46
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,800
- Where are you right now?
- Why do you want to know where someone else's son is?

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,250
I've been abandoned by my father. I use a tree as a roof over my head and newspaper as a blanket.

48
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,470
I'm living out in the wild among the hungry animals.

49
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,460
Stop messing around, man! Come home when I'm being nice to you.

50
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,010
- Are you ready to apologize to Bo Mi?
- What nonsense!

51
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,520
Don't you dare even speak of that psycho Oh.

52
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,620
I had a great time all this time, Mr. Choi.

53
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,020
Hello? Hello...

54
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,380
Geez, what a menace!

55
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,550
He's my only son. So, I can't even be that harsh...

56
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,250
Geez! Seriously. You're dead this time.

57
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,380
- This. Looks fun, huh?
- I'm not playing video games.

58
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,770
What the heck? We're off together. I scheduled everything for us.

59
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,160
- Where are you going?
- Are you here for fun? Why are you scheduling?

60
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,990
Get out before I come back. I clearly said you can sleep over one night. But how many days has it been?

61
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,750
Geez, you're so heartless. Here.

62
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,540
I don't want to play this game. No, no.

63
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,700
Start playing today. It will help you to focus elsewhere.

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,410
I suffered from pretty bad aftermath after witnessing my first corpse.

65
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,400
Who wouldn't? Everyone goes through that.

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,420
Try it. You have to do something to focus on, in order to forget about it during that time.

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,710
Where did you get this?

68
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,900
Wow, it's exactly the same.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,360
Do you know what that is?

70
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,290
Don't you know? It's for hunting. Calling animals with the noise.

71
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,920
You said it was exactly the same just now.

72
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,210
Did you see something that looks just like this somewhere?

73
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,290
My father. It's exactly the same as the one my father made.

74
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,650
Did you find this? Where did you find this?

75
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,150
Your father?

76
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,720
- Yes.
- I'm done.

77
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,030
- I'll come over.
- I'm at the door. Just open the door.

78
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,430
- Hey, go to the sunroom.
- Why?

79
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,430
I want to be alone. Go to the sunroom. Hurry, go.

80
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,890
Jeez - so particular.
- Go, go, go.

81
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,950
Jeez, I'm going already.

82
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,690
What brings you all the way here? Without a notice?

83
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,890
I'm done with everything. Why wait? We'll just take care of business.

84
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,870
Here. The land sales contract. Including mine.

85
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,280
It's all of Miryeong village.

86
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,800
Nomination

87
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,510
You're sure about the district assemblyman position, right?

88
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,840
Just get ready to put on a gold badge.

89
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,810
- Good work.
- Then...

90
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,180
I'll be waiting.

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,960
All right.

92
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,660
All right then. Goodbye.

93
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,250
What does he do? Coming into our neighborhood...

94
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,280
It's exactly the same, no matter how I much I think about it.

95
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,550
You didn't leave yet?

96
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,390
So childish. I'll leave.

97
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,430
- But I'll be back.
- Huh?

98
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,440
What? Living among the wild animals?

99
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,740
Why? Why don't you come home?

100
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,050
Who are you that you're telling me to go home? Do you know me?

101
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,070
Who? Who am I?

102
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,550
You're so frustrating! Hey, you!

103
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,200
How about that child? Did that child survive?

104
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,650
I get nervous if I don't exercise.

105
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,250
Why is it that I can never forget a gruesome scene?

106
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,160
Why is it that my memory becomes clearer rather than gradually fading away?

107
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,540
Yes, Director. The trauma center you mentioned. I'll take the position.

108
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,870
Please build it for us.

109
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,640
RLI
Red Line Investment

110
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,420
The relocation of the special rescue team headquarters which was the biggest obstacle to building the resort has been confirmed.

111
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,630
And we purchased all the land belonging to the townspeople.

112
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,910
Real estate contract
The only thing remaining is the district land. But it can't be sold.

113
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,170
Gangwondo
We have agreed to use it with a permit.

114
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,240
Now, RLI owns the entire Miryeong forest.

115
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,450
You did it in the end.

116
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,130
I knew it. But you're quite something.

117
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,220
Good job.

118
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,560
I plan to choose a developer right away and start the construction.

119
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,410
We're short on manpower. We'll have to set up a subsidiary.

120
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,800
We should. We'll have to rush.

121
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,240
It's all completed now. You should come back to Seoul now.

122
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,300
I should.

123
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,220
You seem a little different. Should I say strangely sentimental?

124
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,320
There's no way.

125
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:08,650
You're heartless when it comes to money. That's also your capability and charm.

126
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,960
Yes.

127
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,520
You can go now.

128
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,250
Yes, sir.

129
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,710
Yes, please go ahead.

130
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,460
What do you think?

131
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,180
It's pretty.

132
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
Let's go in a little deeper.

133
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,230
Why? Are you scared?

134
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,200
Going underwater is scary for everyone. For me, too.

135
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,550
But when you win that fight and come up above the water, there's definitely joy in it.

136
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,130
A kind of satisfaction knowing that I rescued myself?

137
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,420
Are you trying to help me overcome my trauma with water?

138
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,810
For me to feel the satisfaction of rescuing myself?

139
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,740
No.

140
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,490
You don't need to rescue yourself. You have me.

141
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,980
No matter how fast you get swept away by rapid currents or disappear into strong waves,

142
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,240
I'll find you no matter what and rescue you.

143
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,950
♬ When I sink to the ground ♬

144
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,430
Just remember that.

145
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,280
I'll never let you die alone.

146
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,480
♬ I walked down the rainy path ♬

147
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,770
♬ Without an umbrella ♬

148
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,420
♬ I want to go to you even though I can't see you ♬

149
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,910
I found a jewel.

150
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,930
It's my foot.

151
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,370
Gosh, seriously!

152
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,410
♬ If the rain stops, if the tears stop ♬

153
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,960
♬ I think you'll be dreaming ♬

154
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,790
Don't you want to go back to Seoul?

155
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,700
I don't think I can go back to Seoul even if I'm told to do so.

156
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,660
How can I live there leaving a place like this behind?

157
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,500
On top of that, I have an important business here.

158
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,100
Important business?

159
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,930
Well, I think Miryeong mountain has been contaminated by heavy metals.

160
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,170
Heavy metals?

161
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,110
I want to open it up for public discussion. So, I'm looking into it.

162
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,690
I wish it came out negative. It's such a beautiful forest.

163
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,190
Heavy metals...

164
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,120
If you sold my car, I can just use your car, Mr. Choi Jeong Mok.

165
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,230
I heard the collectors are after you for your debt. Did you take care of it all?

166
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,990
Hey, hey, don't even mention it.

167
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,230
If it weren't for the forest fire that happened recently, I'd be in big trouble now.

168
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Bo Mi, I found them.

169
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,120
- The arsonists.
- What?

170
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,410
Where is that?

171
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,610
At Miryeong Forestry.

172
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,080
I'll be right there.

173
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,600
Don't tell anyone and wait for me. I'll arrest them myself.

174
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,220
Father.

175
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,050
What do you mean arsonists? What are you talking about?

176
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,940
You didn't know, right, Father?

177
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,620
You didn't know that the Miryeong forest fire arsonists were our forestry workers, right?

178
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,020
Who are you calling?

179
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,180
Who are you calling without answering me?

180
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,170
Hurry up and tell me! What are you doing, Father?

181
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,070
Is this Miryeong Police?

182
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,990
There are forest fire arsonists here. Come and get them.

183
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,950
At Miryeong Forestry.

184
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,370
You moseyed onto Kang San Hyeok. Why are you calling me, lumberjack, Mr. Choi?

185
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,720
The arsonists were arrested.

186
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,460
I did tell them to keep quiet, but I'm sure it won't last long.

187
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,710
Please speak to the Managing Director.

188
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,560
The moment you started working with Kang San Hyeok, our deal ended.

189
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,690
Well, if I get arrested, the Managing Director will be in a bind.

190
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,310
Would it be okay if I mentioned what happened 25 years ago to the police?

191
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:13,120
The young master of Taesung Group had personally ordered me to do it with such a gentle voice of his.

192
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,780
Everything that had happened at that spot, I haven't forgotten anything. I remember it all.

193
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,060
Should I tell every detail of what happened to the police?

194
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,830
I'm sure you know what happens if you dare threaten Managing Director.

195
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,430
You choose.

196
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,340
Will you protect me or not?

197
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,650
I'll help you

198
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,950
You take care of the rest.

199
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,970
Soil heavy metals test results

200
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,720
What the heck is this?

201
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,640
The arsenic level is at 1,250g per liter?

202
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,940
That's more than 200 times the standard.

203
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,740
Why is the level so high in the soil?

204
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,900
It increased so much since the water quality level last time.

205
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,680
This is no good. Forget the research. Report it to the county office.

206
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,720
We need to report this to the environmental group and also newspapers.

207
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,940
- We should. I'll report this to the county office tomorrow.
- Yeah.

208
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,630
I have a friend who works for the local papers. I'll take care of the media side.

209
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,970
- I'll look into the environmental group. I know someone through Myeongseong University Hospital.
- Wow...

210
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,240
this isn't just about not drinking underground water.

211
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,120
What exactly is the cause for this?

212
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,760
I'll step out for a moment.

213
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,110
The money is going in, but no results.

214
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,980
But the R&D funds are increasing every year.

215
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,610
This is the man who donated the most for the R&D funds.

216
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,740
He's a geology professor at Hanguk University.

217
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,490
He worked at the Geoscience lab in China up until last year.

218
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,690
As a technology advisor.

219
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,870
A technology advisor at the geoscience lab?

220
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,860
Lee Seok Woo...

221
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,000
Professor Suri Prov of Jawaharlal Nehru University in India.

222
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,740
Professor Kevin Miller of Texas University.

223
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,440
They're all scholars of geoscience.

224
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,960
Do you think there is some kind of problem with Miryeong Forest?

225
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,870
If not, why would they go through such an extent to conduct geological research for a resort?

226
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,280
Managing Director Kwon Joo Han is overly obsessed with the Miryeong land

227
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,050
and poured money into researching that land.

228
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,140
Get ready to go see the chairman.

229
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,080
Excuse me? Right now?

230
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,300
We need to request more R&D funds, too.

231
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,170
I'll have to dig into that land.

232
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,300
Dig into the land?

233
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,970
Mr. Huh Choon Sik was transferred to Myeongseong University Hospital in Seoul a few days ago.

234
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,460
To Seoul?

235
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,550
Yes. His guardian wanted him treated there.

236
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,300
Okay. Thank you.

237
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,280
Good day. I'd like to speak to the primary doctor of patient Heo Choon Sik who was transferred from Gangwon Hospital.

238
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,280
At a nursing home?

239
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,270
He's an ICU patient who needs chemo in an aseptic room. But he was moved to a nursing home?

240
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,980
Where is that?

241
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,650
RLI
Red Line Investment

242
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,010
What's going on?

243
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,900
What the heck?

244
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,160
My ID card isn't working. Hurry up and come out...

245
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,010
What did you say?

246
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,840
Director, our Team One has been disbanded.

247
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,450
What?

248
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,010
Chairman

249
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,850
The call is not going through. After the beep...

250
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,170
I think Miryeong mountain has been contaminated by heavy metals.

251
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,370
Why would they go through such an extent to conduct geological research for a resort?

252
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,830
It's not about the resort.

253
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,050
It's the Miryeong Forest. There's money buried in that land.

254
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,460
You can't go inside. Only the family can enter.

255
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,200
I'm Mr. Heo Choon Sik's doctor. I'll just take a look at his condition.

256
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,980
Heo Choon Sik

257
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,760
Grandfather!

258
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,020
Grandfather, Grandfather, can you hear me?

259
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,420
You can't do this.

260
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,190
What are you doing right now?

261
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,810
I'm Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae from Seoul Myeongseong University Hospital surgery department.

262
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,910
You must transfer patient Huh Choon Sik to Myeongseong University Hospital right away.

263
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,890
Pardon?

264
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,360
His condition has deteriorated.

265
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,570
His vitals are stable. So, there shouldn't be any problems with the transfer.

266
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,030
Please call the ambulance.

267
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,050
What are you talking about right now?

268
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,260
Why would you move the patient without the guardian's agreement?

269
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,750
Please call then.

270
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,030
There's no problem, right?

271
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,350
It's v-fib. Defibrillator, please. Hurry!
V-fib: a type of cardiac arrhythmia

272
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,890
Ready.

273
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,890
- Ready?
- Yes.

274
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,710
Again. Are you ready?

275
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,630
Yes, ready.

276
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,210
- Pull over.
- Grandfather...

277
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,920
Come on, pump.

278
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,860
Please.

279
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,240
Pull over!

280
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,010
Pull over!

281
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,340
Pull over right now!

282
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,660
Pull over!

283
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,990
Jeong Yeong Jae, you're under arrest for kidnapping.

284
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,040
When that bird cries, a goblin fire starts to appear far over there in that mountain

285
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,060
and that's why the townspeople started calling it a goblin bird.

286
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,370

Forest Preview

291
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,530
No, it's not true. None of it is true.

292
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,860
I wish you wouldn't get involved in other people's business.

293
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,650
I'll find out to the end and make him pay for the crime.

294
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,840
What is inside the Miryeong forest?

295
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,500
Did you plan this from the beginning?

296
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,110
Why is this...

297
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,500
Did you hide it?

298
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,460
Can't you fix your eyes on me?

299
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,950
If I oppose it, could you give up on this project?

300
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,970
I warned Kang San Hyeok. Should I carry it out in action?

301
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,330
Let's eat him up.

302
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,510
