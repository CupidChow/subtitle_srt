00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,090
Episode 8

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,480
Are you going into refuge?

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,880
Can't you enjoy that expensive meat while gobbling it up?

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,880
When you can eat such meat, you have to eat as much as you can

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,680
since I never know when I will have such a luxurious home meal again.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,730
The smell of expensive meat.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,590
You can make and eat meals.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,260
Why in the world do you eat cereal every night?

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,130
I, since I was in high school, I haven't been good at studying.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,010
I barely managed to get into med school. Oh, my God.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,210
Those amazingly smart people even had such great stamina.

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,580
They'd work in great internships losing sleep, yet they'd get perfect scores on their exams.

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,140
So what can I do? Besides not eating and sleeping...

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,460
A poor student doesn't have the time to cook or eat.

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,040
But quickly eat cup ramen and get back to studying.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,610
Doctor Jeong Youngj Jae, are you livestock?!

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,710
What?

18
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,320
You don't enjoy the taste or crave anything. You just stuff it in your stomach due to the fear of falling behind in the competition.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,570
How is that a meal?

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,190
That's just food for the livestock being raised for farming.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,910
Are you eating animal fodder? You seem perfectly normal.

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,450
What do you mean "inferior student"...

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,020
The hospital people say you're an up-and-coming ace doctor.

24
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,390
I think it's about time you get rid of such a terrible habit.

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,500
Don't you think so?

26
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,900
It's the same house. Why did you decorate it so much?

27
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,790
There is a coffee machine. There also is a wine refrigerator

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,730
painting... a massage chair...

29
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,120
This. This figure-eight knot is tied wrong.

30
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,620
What's this? Why are you acting like a know-it-all?

31
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,820
All right. If this end of the rope is on top of the rope,

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,320
when you go through the loop on top, go from bottom up.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,350
If it's on the bottom, go from top to bottom. Like this.

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,240
My father is a mountain rescuer.

35
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,330
Then, this pays for my meal.

36
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,070
Don't forget to tie the end of that rope one more time.

37
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,480
♬ Oh, at the sound of the whistle ♬

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,670
♬ I'm humming along not knowing that I am ♬

39
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,620
An up-and-coming ace surgeon...

40
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:37,890
♬ Unknowingly, I'm thinking of you. Should I try talking to you? ♬

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,310
♬ Rather than what you want ♬

42
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:52,180
♬ Listen to the answer that I prepared for you. Around the sunset... ♬

43
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:00,010
♬ We can talk facing each other, we can fall in love ♬

44
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:10,910
♬ We don't have to do anything to feel great, spending time with you ♬

45
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,420
♬ Just like this, with you ♬

46
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,070
Hello, elders! I'm out for a house call!

47
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,920
Sir, how are you feeling?

48
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,380
I brought everything with me. Gosh, you're all here.

49
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,140
Where... where are you going?

50
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,580
Where are you going? Sir?

51
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,530
Hospital? Why?

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,380
What the heck?

53
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,420
What in the world? I was at the highlight!

54
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,030
Why did you do that?

55
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,480
What? What, what?

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,210
I heard you requested a hospital shuttle for the village, Dr. Park?

57
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,860
You even went to the city hall?

58
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,460
Yeah, so what?

59
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,320
Even someone who lives in a secluded place have the right to

60
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,070
visit a sizable hospital for a treatment once a week. I gave them my advice. So what?

61
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,280
Just because they live in Miryeong village, is there a law they can only consult third-rate doctors in this run down facility?

62
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,960
Third-rate? Are you calling me a third-rate doctor?

63
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,670
Are you a third-rate doctor, Dr. Park?

64
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,030
Of course, we are.

65
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,970
Third-rate doctors who are desperate to go back to the Seoul branch that cut us loose.

66
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,150
Even doing that is bothersome, so we're doing nothing but useless tasks all day. Third-rate!

67
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,640
Aren't we?

68
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,140
I don't care whether you torture yourself or not with useless hope.

69
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,980
But don't you dare create waves in this sewer water.

70
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,190
I drank way too much of it to get swept up in it again.

71
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,520
That sewer water.

72
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,290
Listen up, Dr. Park.

73
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,760
No matter what you do, however you interfere, I'll do my treatments.

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,420
So, don't treat this great hospital like a s***hole.

75
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,820
I'm telling you to stop pouring sewer water that doesn't even exist over yourself.

76
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,860
There's nothing more cowardly and third-rate than treating yourself like a third-rate person.

77
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,300
Nurse, there are facilities and groups that have agreements with Miryeong Hospital, right?

78
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,660
Please give me that list.

79
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,130
Just give it to me! Don't argue with me or say no to me. Just give it to me quietly!

80
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,100
Please do that for me this time.

81
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,580
I ask of you.

82
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,660
Okay, will do.

83
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,650
Vendors who have agreements with Miryeong Hospital

84
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,890
Miryeong 119 Special Rescue Team

85
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,130
Run!

86
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,170
Faster!

87
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,130
The fire is spreading!

88
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Too slow! Too slow! Too slow!

89
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,290
The injured stopped breathing!

90
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,100
Are you walking? Run with all your might!

91
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,510
Too slow, too slow, too slow!

92
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,260
I'm sorry, but you failed this course, Kang San Hyeok.

93
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,010
I came in first. What are you saying?

94
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,970
Not first. I'm here.

95
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,090
Right. You failed because of Choi Chang.

96
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,060
Excuse me?

97
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,100
Why are you paired up during the emergency dispatch?

98
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,850
So that we can cross-check each other's condition.

99
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,700
You're a master at memorization. But why do you perform like that?

100
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,220
Here. The harness is worn out and is about to break.

101
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,950
What if it breaks while you're rappelling?

102
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,480
Then, did Sunbae Choi also fail for not spotting my mishap?

103
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,900
No, just you.

104
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,660
I clearly stated that your partner takes priority rather than yourself in our aviation rescue team.

105
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,140
You are dumbstruck and feel it's unfair, huh?

106
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,850
Engrave that feeling in your brain.

107
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:26,300
And don't you ever let your partner go on dispatch wearing dangerous gear.

108
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,120
Got it?

109
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,890
Hello, I'm Jeong Yeong Jae from Miryeong Hospital. I called earlier.

110
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,810
Yes, welcome.

111
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,050
Have a seat, Doctor.

112
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,570
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

113
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:54,150
So, what brings you out all the way here from Miryeong Hospital?

114
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,710
I reviewed our hospital records and

115
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,490
learned that the 119 Special Rescue Team had a medical treatment agreement with our hospital up until five years ago.

116
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,400
I don't know why the agreement had ended, but I wanted to make another proposal.

117
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,250
I see...

118
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,520
Here's a summary of what you can do with the hospital's program if we reach a deal.

119
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,550
You're going to need first aid training, so I can take care of that.

120
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,150
If any of your men are injured

121
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,780
it's faster for you to get to our hospital where you can arrive in less than five minutes.

122
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,770
If you're a professional, shouldn't you be responsible for your own life?

123
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,530
With your low intelligence and lack of attention

124
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,420
I am saying to stop causing problems for others, Crew Member Choi.

125
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,330
Stay longer.

126
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,130
Then, you will be able to understand what Team Leader said today.

127
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,570
I'll think about it and call you later.

128
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,800
Yes. It'll be a great opportunity for both of us.

129
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,710
- Oh! Yeong Jae!
- Oh Chang!

130
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,020
Is there a relationship with Doctor Jeong?

131
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,820
Of course! Do you know how great I get along with Yeong Jae?

132
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,930
Tiny One!

133
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,770
Oh that person....

134
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,370
You came all the way here, Tiny One.

135
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,940
Mmmm but we can meet at home when I get off work!

136
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,470
Did you want to see me that much?

137
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,840
Just wait a little

138
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,720
Do you want me to finish and go to you soon?

139
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,620
My cute cat ...

140
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,760
At the most important moment!

141
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,490
That moron is good for nothing!

142
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,110
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

143
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,720
The light in the adjoining house, it must have been Kang San Hyeok ...

144
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:26,530
I'm sure Kang San Hyeok will exaggerate everything. So, how do you feel?

145
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,610
I am not interested in him.

146
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,390
Delicious food friend, neighborhood friend is okay.

147
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,290
But that is it.

148
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,600
Okay, I get what you are saying.

149
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,910
But that is good.

150
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,430
Yeong Jae, that night you were so lonely that you could have been swept off your feet.

151
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,370
Go safely, friend. Next time, I'll introduce you to a delicious restaurant.

152
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,510
Is Mr. Choi Jeong Mok here?

153
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,460
Is Mr. Choi Jeong Mok here?

154
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,200
Is Mr. Choi Jeong Mok here?

155
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,700
- Who are you?
- I am Oh Bomi from the Miryoung Forest Protection Team.

156
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,520
Oh, is that so?

157
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,480
You're our newest member in this protection team.

158
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, welcome! I wanted to go in myself and introduce my self-

159
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,860
You filed an objection to a fine, right?

160
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,630
I've come up with a due diligence report to ensure an impartial execution of my offical duty.

161
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,580
Official duties?

162
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,670
Oh, there seems to be a misunderstanding, about the objection.

163
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,580
Yes. That's why I'm came here. I'm going to take a GPS survey instrument.

164
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,610
A survey instrument? I thought you talked to my son.

165
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,530
I'll conduct the inspection!

166
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,520
From here to there, it is Miryeong Forest.

167
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,800
What did you say? What?

168
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,490
I will say it again.

169
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,750
It is not from all the way back there but

170
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,330
from here that way

171
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,200
is not the land belonging to Miryoung Forestry but of the provincial forest.

172
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,580
Please look here. The GPS says Provincial Forest right?

173
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,840
What? It sounds like some Provincial Forest nonsense.

174
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,850
I've used this area for over 20 years. What are you talking about?

175
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm a busy man, you know. What nonsense...

176
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,270
If it was a small area, I wouldn't go this far.

177
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,170
Miryeong Forestry has been using government land as you please for too long.

178
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,640
What a snotty thing to say...

179
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,820
Anyway, I don't care. I'll do as I've always been doing. So there.

180
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,150
Okay. If you don't clean up your things before the deadline on your notice, you'll have to pay a fine and/or be imprisoned.

181
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,480
Please clean up first and submit a request to rent the land.

182
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,150
Imprisonment? Officer, do you know who I am?

183
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,690
Yes, I know very well.

184
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,790
What's a Miryeong Forest position? President Choi Jeong Mok.

185
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,510
This kid doing what? Doing everything so properly, what is all this "everything properly" manner mean?

186
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,730
Serious? Here?

187
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,000
A vicious stickler came in from nowhere.

188
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,270
The worst kind of vicious stickler there is!

189
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,900
Sir!

190
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,960
Sir!

191
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,870
Sir, why are you like this?

192
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,760
Are you injured somewhere?

193
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Tiny one .....how embarrassing!

194
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,350
Sir!

195
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,640
Sir, are you okay?!

196
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,790
Oh my god, what should we do?

197
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,090
What happened...

198
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,870
Nutty Oh?

199
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,900
I don't like it, either.

200
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,190
Grandpa, first of all, I gave you a shot to reduce your vomiting and dizziness.

201
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,980
It will stop them, but this is temporary.

202
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,720
Because your legs are shaking and are exhibiting multiple other symptoms

203
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,060
make sure to come tomorrow to the hospital for an exam. Okay?

204
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,740
Okay.

205
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,550
You said you were going to be a doctor at Myeongseong University Hospital but you are here?

206
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,150
You said since you were a police profiler, that you would be catching criminals, yet you, too, are here?

207
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,780
Catching criminals, here?

208
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,550
I, too, am seeing patients, here?

209
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,610
- What terrible luck!
- What terrible luck!

210
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:50,290
Anyway, you and I never got along since high school, so let's just ignore each other. You Crazy dog Jeong.

211
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,280
Anyone would say it. Getting mixed up with you is three years of disaster.

212
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,480
You're so ignorant. Crazy dog.

213
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,580
That rover....?

214
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,560
The blue SUV, please stop right there.

215
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,490
5027, 5027, Pull over!

216
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,660
What are you doing? This is dangerous!

217
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,710
Wait a minute. Just wait-

218
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,070
5027, 5027.

219
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,190
5027, halt. It is dangerous over there.

220
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,910
5027!

221
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,710
What to do!? Brake!!

222
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,120
Where are you going?

223
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,110
Sir!

224
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,080
Sir!

225
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,210
Sir!

226
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,490
Oh, my gosh!

227
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,050
Stop following me!

228
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,440
Sir!

229
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,390
Let's go.

230
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,100
Mountain rescue dispatch! Mountain rescue dispatch! Please dispatch Gangwon 002 helicopter!

231
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,270
Miryeong Forest Coordinate B31, Male in his 40s fell.

232
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,150
People first, Safety is a top priority.

233
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,650
Gangwon Fire Rescue

234
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,250
"119 Aviation Safety"

235
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,820
Sir, are you okay?

236
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,640
Can you answer me?

237
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,190
Please, hold on a bit.

238
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,660
A rescue team is coming!

239
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,230
Here!

240
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,160
Here, over here!

241
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,130
Over here!

242
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,030
Trying to approach the scene. I'll halt mid-air.

243
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,050
- Check rope hoist!
- Check rope hoist!

244
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,290
Check rope hoist!

245
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,250
Door open.

246
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,730
- Team one, dispatch!
- Team one, dispatch!

247
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,530

- Team two, dispatch!

248
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,560
Over here, over here.

249
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,840
Over here, over here.

250
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,220
It is dangerous so please step back.

251
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,330
- Down!
- Down!

252
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,720
Kang San Hyeok!

253
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,050
Please save me.

254
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,120
Please save me!

255
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,680
Resolved the situation! Withdraw!

256
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,570
- Withdraw!
- Resolved the situation!

257
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,080
- Withdraw.
- Withdraw.

258
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,300
Falling rocks!

259
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,520
Be careful!

260
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,050
Hyung!

261
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,500
- Hyung Man Soo!
- Hyung Man Soo!

262
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,170
Hyung! Hyung Man Soo!

263
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,750
Hung Man Soo!

264
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,930
Hyung Man Soo!

265
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,930
I'll go. Pull me from here.

266
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,260
Hyung!!

267
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,450
Hyung Man Soo!

268
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,410
Going up!

269
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,370
The femoral artery was severed due to an open fracture in the femur.

270
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,970
He can go into shock right away.

271
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,160
Code black on a large TA
 TA: Traffic Accident; Code Black: hospital is understaffed because of multiple patients

272
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,710
Doctor Jeong Yeong Jae, be prepared to operate.

273
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,180
If it's Cold Black, that means I have to perform surgery by myself?

274
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,480
That way, you'll be able to save the patient.

275
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,820
Blood Pressure is falling!

276
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,420
Doctor, it seems he won't make it...

277
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,730
Sorry.

278
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,490
Hey!

279
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,420
What are you doing?

280
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,170
What are you doing right now?

281
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,690
Please go claim damages over there.

282
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,560
If you have any objections, you should be prepared to be sued for unauthorized photography.

283
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,660
My, my...

284
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,620
It's my fault he died.

285
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,490
It's my fault.

286
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,720
No matter what, he didn't die because of you.

287
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,770
You save people.

288
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,090
You

289
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,020
save them.

290
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,480

293
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,810

Forest Preview

304
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,090
I ran away like a coward. A doctor abandoned the patient.

305
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,930
We'll have to report it to the director and boycott.

306
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,860
She couldn't stand it if I weren't around.

307
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,640
She keeps coming onto me asking me to date her.

308
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,260
You don't remember? But you should be able to remember

309
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,600
Find all the leads that pertain to the development of Miryeong Forest and bring them to me.

310
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,770
- I'll take care of it.
- Will that be okay?

311
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,160
He has never gone through GPS training.

312
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,970
The rescue team is setting off for area C19.

313
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,250
Kang San Hyeok! Show yourself, you jerk!
