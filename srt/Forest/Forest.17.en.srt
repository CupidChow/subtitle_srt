Episode 17

2
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,960
I...

3
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,500
Kang San Hyeok, answer!

4
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,300
The village...

5
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,230
Kang San Hyeok, answer me!

6
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,320
Kang San Hyeok.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,390
Kang San Hyeok, come back to your senses!

8
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,820
I burned it.

9
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,170
Snap out of it! Focus!

10
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,210
Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok!

11
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,530
Kang San Hyeok!

12
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,190
She has some exhaustion due to all the coughing and the flames.

13
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,860
It’s not too bad, so she’ll be okay after some sleep.

14
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,560
Yes, ma'am.

15
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,850
You came to meet me and not Chang?

16
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,790
So late?

17
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,770
I was told to come to you to hear stories about the Miryeong village.

18
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,370
It’s said that the village is in the palm of your hands.

19
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,550
Nonsense... what about the village are you so curious about anyway?

20
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,030
When you’re a rescue worker?

21
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,840
There was a fire today in Mount Miryeong.

22
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,220
I heard there was a big fire here in the past. The Miryeong forest fire.

23
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,010
Are you here to talk about that in the middle of night?

24
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,440
Was the cause of the Miryeong forest fire ever found?

25
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,240
Everyone in this village knows that the kid did that.

26
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,060
"The kid"?

27
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,620
Was it caused by that kid?

28
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,040
I heard that no one could find the cause.

29
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,140
The police couldn't find it but I'm sure that the kid did that.

30
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,830
If not, why would he run away?

31
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,690
He... ran away?

32
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,240
There was a boy from Seoul.

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,170
He lived with his grandmother. After the fire, they packed everything at night and disappeared.

34
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,240
Without letting people know about it. I bet he is the suspect.

35
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,050
He just ran away after devastating the whole village.

36
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,970
You don’t know if it was an accident or arson. But you seem very sure.

37
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,160
Did you come to hear the answer,

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,220
or pick on my words?

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,460
You even came here to hear about the story.

40
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,530
But you don't hear me at all.

41
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,910
I’m listening.

42
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,910
It’s just you talk about the incident from 25 years ago like it happened yesterday.

43
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,140
It’s amazing.

44
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,460
Anyway, that’s all I can tell you.

45
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,530
Now stop poking around the neighborhood’s things.

46
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,100
"Miryeong Forest Fires"

47
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,910
“ The cause of the Miryeong fire in Gangwon Province is still unknown”

48
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,400
“ Our town burned down to ashes in a moment.”
- The residents of Miryeong village

49
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,350
He is curious about Miryeong forest fires?

50
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,560
Why is that? Because of things in the past?

51
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,320
What are you saying?
 "Resignation Letter"

52
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,570
Are you postponing going back to Seoul?

53
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,080
Director? Director!

54
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,110
Due to quick arrival of our rescue squad yesterday,

55
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,660
we were able to rescue the victim and extinguish the fire successfully.

56
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,880
You worked hard.

57
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,530
This week, we have volunteer work for the residents. So get ready.

58
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,640
- Is it Soon Tae’s turn this week?
- I will go?

59
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,560
I thought you wanted to put it off as long as possible. Why are you volunteering?

60
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,460
I thought of the grandmother that passed away.

61
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,390
Because of the fire, I bet a lot of elders are in shock.

62
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,060
I shall go and comfort them, since I was the one there.

63
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,400
Come and see me, Kang San Hyeok.

64
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,850
What is this?

65
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,360
It isn't anything important.

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,340
It was my first time with forest fires so I was a bit flustered.

67
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,490
Is that so? So then why didn't you respond on the radio?

68
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,800
By any chance, do you have any problem or issues with fires?

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,040
If I did, would I have been able to successfully graduate from fire school?

70
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,840
I was just a little surprised by how much faster the fire had spread compared to when we trained.

71
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,290
Then, can I leave now to go do the volunteer work?

72
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,550
Even now, if anything is wrong, you cannot hide it from me.

73
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,550
You must never do it.

74
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,120
Yes, sir.

75
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,650
Are you still coughing?

76
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,550
They say forest fires cause explosions of fine dust. You must have swallowed a whole bunch.

77
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,150
Did I sleep here? I remember I came to the hospital but...

78
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,760
You fell asleep after we gave you an injection.

79
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,990
No wonder you're tired. You were trapped in such a fire.

80
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,660
Don't worry about your consultations, Dr. Jeong.

81
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,290
You've got me, Miryeong Hospital's blazing Dr. Park.

82
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,350
Rest up. Relax a little.

83
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,120
Gosh, my worries grow just from hearing the word 'blazing'.

84
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,930
Why don't you get going. I'm going to change clothes and get a good grasp of my life again.

85
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,170
You are pretending to be a workaholic.

86
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:36,200
Do whatever you want. I know you are longing to be acknowledged by someone.

87
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,330
I guess.

88
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,260
He's over the top once again, today.

89
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,530
Dr. Park is still great at prescribing meds.

90
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,770
Make sure to take these.

91
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,310
Mr. Kang came by early this morning.

92
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,950
He also came last night, and left after confirming you were asleep.

93
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,260
It seemed like you didn't know.

94
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,510
Hello.

95
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,700
I'm here to give you a hand, all the way from Miryeong Special Rescue Team over there.

96
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,010
I am Kang San Hyeok.

97
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,710
Won't you look at that face.

98
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,740
How does he look like that?

99
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,360
I heard that's the worker who climbed down a rope to the fire.

100
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,340
He's so good looking.

101
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,510
- He is so handsome
- Yeah definitely he is.

102
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,840
Follow us.

103
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,850

Back in the days, because of forest fires, you all suffered greatly?

121
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,710
Why do you ask?

122
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,830
It's because I'm worried. You mothers must have all been startled.

123
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,170
Did the arsonist get caught then?

124
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,770
Gosh, stop spewing nonsense.

125

What are you saying, Detective Kim?

128
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,690
I sent you a photo of the license plate of the vehicle that left the scene.

129
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,070
So, why can't you find it?

130
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,850
What? An unregistered vehicle?

131
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,290
Miryeong Mountain Fire Prevention Team

132
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,200
What?

133
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,860
Why isn't it there?

134
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,250
- Sunbae, is that all you have from camera 6?
- Yes.

135
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,300
I don't see where the fire started.

136
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,380
If it isn't there, then it must have not recorded it.

137
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,330
Then I guess the ignition spot was a blind spot.

138
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,730
What?

139
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,010
Here. Look over here.

140
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,390
It's camera 6, yet you can't see the burning site.

141
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,490
Give me everything from 16 to 19 hours.

142
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,310
Okay.

143
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,970
There were two people who came from the bottom of the mountain to the fire scene.

144
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,750
There has to be a recording of their route, but I don't see it.

145
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,130
The only thing I have is the video clip of the car. .

146
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,910
But is an unregistered vehicle.

147
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,000
This is where the fire had started. But it's a CCTV blind spot.

148
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,040
And with a loud explosion, white smoke and sparks flared.

149
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,890
What did those guys do here exactly?

150
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,670
It was the hikers.

151
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,620
I guess.

152
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,680
It's fishy. It's my favorite-

153
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,480
What are you doing here?

154
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,840
Why don't we just ignore each other from now on? Nothing good comes out of us talking to each other.

155
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,720
There!

156
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,620
What is that? Why did you scoop up that water and what did you jot down?

157
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,710
You're always picking fights with me whenever you see me.

158
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,280
Are you hallucinating? Why pick a fight with you when I don't even care for you?

159
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,100
Hey. Don't you remember?s

160
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,280
When we were playing dodge ball against another class,

161
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,290
you told the referee that I stepped on the line. So I got eliminated and our class lost.

162
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,530
How can you do that to your teammate from the same class?

163
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,030
And how dare you throw a fastball at your teammate from the same class hitting my head?

164
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,210
Did it hurt a lot?

165
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,240
My jaw was twisted so badly back then that I still can't close my mouth shut and drool.

166
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,240
That's why you yanked out all my hair, you Doggone Bo Mi!

167
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,790
You pulled mine, too, you Doggone Yeong Jae!

168
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,320
Please give us 5 Jjajangmyeon. (Black bean noodles)

169
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,440
Jjangbbong (Spicy seafood noodles) for me!

170
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,320
If I ate jjajangmyeon, you ordered jjangbbong.

171
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,770
What are you doing?

172
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,640
When I suggested that we watch a comedy show, you turned on the game of Go.

173
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,970
You're a b**** reminiscent of a faulty screen on a brand new laptop.

174
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,440
You're a b**** who is like the microdust during the spring cherry blossom festival.

175
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,310
This is my territory.

176
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,380
And whatever you have in your hand, give it to me.

177
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,940
Let go! You aren't letting go?!

178
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,850
Let go!

179
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,260
What is this?

180
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,050
Move out of the way.

181
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,460
What is this?

182
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,000
- Chief Executive Officer.
- Yes?

183
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,070
Does Kang San Hyeok have a second job, by the way?

184
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,840
Kang San Hyeok? How could a government employee have a second job?

185
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,570
If so, I'm sure he would've gotten caught during last month's audit.

186
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,900
Then, by any chance,

187
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,050
is this listed in Kang San Hyeok's resume?

188
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,920
Naseong Development, Park Hyeong Soo?

189
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,870
It's someone else's business card. No.

190
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,920
Yes, sir.

191
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,040
Ma'am, when there was a huge fire in this neighborhood...

192
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,120
♫ So drunk... ♫
Ma'am.

193
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,000
♫ I'm so drunk ♫

194
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,590
♫ So drunk ♫

195
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,590
♫ I'm so drunk ♫

196
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,390
Hello?

197
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,430
♫ So drunk, I'm so drunk ♫

198
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,010
- Hello?
- Director.

199
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,530
Director, I got a call from 1029-1110 on your Naseong phone.

200
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,520
What do I do?

201
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,260
Contacts

202
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,610
Choi Chang

203
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,910
Answer it. As the president of Naseong.

204
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,720
Yes, sir.

205
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,220
Yes, this is Park Hyeong Soo from Naseong Development.

206
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,570
Hello?

207
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,770
- Without talking, he hung up.
- Alright.

208
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,700
It wasn't Kang Sang Hyeok's voice...

209
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,850
Why does he carry so many of someone else's business cards?

210
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,150
So, Choi Chang called Naseong Development's Park Hyeong Soo?

211
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,590
You didn't get out of work?

212
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:57,970
You go first. I have to finish some work before leaving this hospital for few days.

213
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,110
Where are you going?

214
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,920
Well...

215
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,800
Gosh...

216
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,350
What is that?

217
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,760
Are you okay?

218
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,320
Well, thankfully, yeah.

219
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,250
How about you, Kang San Hyeok? You must have been shocked by the forest fire yesterday.

220
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:58,790
I- I haven't eaten dinner so let's eat together.

221
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,020
I would like to cook something for you.

222
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,330
Yeah, sure.

223
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,800
Too casual...

224
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,930
A dress?

225
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,660
I am nervous.

226
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,390
I am hungry.

227
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,820
Should I set up the side dishes?

228
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,190
We won't need side dishes today.

229
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,010
Chinamul soup.

230
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,530
I saw it on my way home. So I plucked some from the ground and made it.

231
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,850
Smells so good.

232
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,420
I made dandelion kimchi last week and it's fermented perfectly. Try it.

233
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,880
Dandelion kimchi?

234
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,900
It's bittersweet and delicious.

235
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,610
I will be sick every day so I can eat delicious food like this.

236
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,690
I guess you must've learned well from your grandmother.

237
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,150
I've never heard of these things before. And you know how to make all these dishes.

238
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,840
I never made them when she was alive. I didn't even like them then.

239
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,970
One day, I was sick with a flu.

240
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,310
And I craved vegetable bean paste stew with kimchi that my grandma used to make for me.

241
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,440
I couldn't eat anything else, but that.

242
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,250
Then I thought, I'd never get to taste those things again.

243
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:43,130
When I suddenly realized that, I felt like I'd be starving for good.

244
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,840
I know what's wrong.

245
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,290
I have cried eating ramen. It tasted so bad.

246
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,760
It's all the same ramen, but why does it taste different when Mom makes it?

247
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,660
Try cooking with your mom's hand lotion on. It will taste closer to hers then.

248
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:05,010
That's right. Mom's lotion. That smell!

249
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,330
You are a genius!

250
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,280
But you know, you like these dishes and know how to make them.

251
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,560
So why do you always make fancy dishes? Did your tastebud change?

252
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,170
We finished eating so let's have some wine. An expensive wine.

253
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,400
I have something to show you.

254
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm so stuffed. This feels great.

255
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,030
Isn't it strange?

256
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,330
They say a person's heart can be felt by how he uses his hands.

257
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,240
Why is that everything Kang San Hyeok makes is so delicious?

258
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,640
It's black, then it's white.

259
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,510
You don't have much of a skill, but then something great pops out.

260
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,510
I wonder if you're a devil, then it turns out you are.

261
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:35,110
The sponsor who made it possible for Rescuer Kim to receive treatment in Korea.

262
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,410
It was you, right?

263
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,960
You rescued Rescuer Kim from the cliff

264
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,290
and sponsored shuttle buses for villagers to use for treatments.

265
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,500
What kind of devil are you?

266
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,100
It really is strange, huh?

267
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,530
I'm just trying to hide my evilness.

268
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,350
I'm just Satan. A devil.

269
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,490
There's no other side to me. It's best to think that way.

270
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,150
Don't you remember experimenting with this in elementary school?

271
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,230
Resonance.

272
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,960
The sound waves that share the same frequency, when one vibrates.

273
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,330
the other one also resonates.

274
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:03,560
I can stay quiet about everything else, but an evil human being.

275
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:11,620
With such a terrible temper, I wonder why

276
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,440
I keep resonating depending on your frequency.

277
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,970
Jeong Yeong Jae.

278
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,930
Are you sure you're a devil? Are you sure about that?

279
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,490
Why why are there facts that prove you otherwise?

280
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,670
Why does the resonance inside me getting louder?

281
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,500
You know...

282
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,110
I think I...

283
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,670
Yeah, I resonate for you as well.

284
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,490
Your movements in your place and the sound of your humming.

285
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:54,720
You opening the window as you wake up in the morning. The refreshing sound of your bicycle horn.

286
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,260
Everything resonated within me and made me waver.

287
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,840
That's why...

288
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,520
I want to stop right here.

289
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,220
Kang San Hyeok.

290
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,540
No one should interfere with my plans.

291
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,720
I'll reach my goal no matter what. And until I do,

292
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,850
I won't look at anything else.

293
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,010
Not even my lost memories and even you.

294
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,270
I made dinner for you, so I could say this to you.

295
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,820
For the last time.

296
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,510
♬ Only ♬

297
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:54,600
Stop that. Don't stop your wavering because of me.

298
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,500
You have a lot already, Kang San Hyeok.

299
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,730
♬ your warm breath ♬

300
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:04,130
Don't you want to know what happiness means?

301
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,840
♬ Because I will love you, ♬

302
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,020
♬ Like a day that will never come back to me ♬

303
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,970
It will be uncomfortable for you. So, I'll move out.

304
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,890
♬ I love you ♬

305

♬ As always ♬

306
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,050
Promise me one thing.

307
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,820
That you'll change your frequency wave.

308
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:41,860
I'll stop resonating as well. So you stop it, too.

309
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,690
♬ Have been imprinted in my heart ♬

310
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,910
I will.

311
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:00,050

314
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,920
He knows nothing of the important things.

315
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Idiot.

316
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,500
Satan. Devil.

317
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,120
♬ As always ♬

318
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,360
