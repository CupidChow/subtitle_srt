00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,800
Episode 9
My, my...

2
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,820
It's my fault he died.

3
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,660
No matter what, he didn't die because of you.

4
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,720
You

5
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,760
save them.

6
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,470
Give me my money!

7
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,120
My ten million won!

8
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,950
Give me my money. My money!

9
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,740
Where the hell are your parents now?

10
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,270
What in the world are you all doing?

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,060
Is this a market place?

12
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,690
How can you do such things to a kid who just lost her parents?

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,300
Don't get yourself into it.

14
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,640
Serious, Scary, crazy things...

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,040
Don't acknowledge those feelings.

16
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
That's not yours, but theirs.

17
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,250
Let them fight each other.

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,200
I have never seen such a pretty child like you.

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,510
That is the only thing that belongs to you.

20
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,900
If that's hard...

21
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,220
Why don't we turn on the music?

22
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,080
Look at that. As we turn on the music, it looks like people have gone crazy about you,

23
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,150
because you are so pretty.

24
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,440
Turn on the music and don't value other people's things.

25
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,410
Do it with me.

26
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,490
I'm not going to value you.

27
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,050
Such a cool kid like you can certainly do it.

28
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,430
Okay, let's try. I'm not going to value you.

29
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,080
Not going to value ...

30
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,060
That's right. Louder!

31
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,470
- I'm not going to... value ..,.
- That's great.

32
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,120
I'm not going to value ....

33
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,490
- I'm not going to value..
- Good job.

34
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,680
Good job.

35
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,060
I'm not going to value!.

36
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,120
- I'm not going to value!
- Good job.

37
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm not going to value!

38
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,620
I'm not going to value!

39
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060
I'm not going to value!

40
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,640
What is this?

41
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,410
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

42
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,150
Also, I am okay.

43
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm very very normal.

44
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,750
I wanted to say this before heading off to work. So...

45
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,350
You must tend to feel very good about yourself. Thanking me is obvious.

46
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,310
Where did you get the impression that I care about your condition?

47
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,170
Why should ever I be briefed on your condition?

48
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,450
Just a second I thought I'd pretend to be caring for you in case you're burdened

49
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,620
I forgot that you're Mr. Kang San Hyeok.

50
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,440
So then, I'll expect zero attention from you going forward.

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,130
You have such an unnecessary obsession.

52
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,670
Obsession 1. Be a strong woman. Obsession 2. Must get rid of panic disorder overnight

53
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,600
I understand you want to be strong-minded. But, don't go overboard.

54
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,530
The idea that the weak get help from the strong

55
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,340
The idea of getting help from the absolute strong man

56
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,290
is not a shame, but a law of existence.

57
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,450
OKay, I do have a panic disorder and did get help from you.

58
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,880
So, I'll accept your provocative nonsense,
as a token of gratitude.

59
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,910
Nonsense?

60
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:10,060
Oh sorry. I'm just saying as your level of obsession and being full of yourself is, much higher than me, in fact..

61
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,120
Oh, you didn't know?

62
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,980
Based on my experience as a fixtern in psychiatry, yesterday's confused behavior (Fixtern: Korean term for an intern who was accepted as a resident in a medical speciality)

63
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,650
came from an obsession about being a gentleman, which was formed in your childhood.

64
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,160
Furthermore, the strong man? No way.

65
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,610
I saw your arms trembling like crazy.

66
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,380
Shaking, like this.

67
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,810
Who was shaking?

68
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Of course,

69
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,480
I wouldn’t say you’re super light but your weight is perfect for....

70
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,350
Anyhow, my arms didn’t tremble.

71
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,060
Is that so? Well then.

72
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,200
- Let's see.
- Are you joking?

73
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,180
How can you be so delusional thinking I'd be that weak... ah...

74
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,490
Look, Look. What's the matter? What's the matter.

75
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,560
Ah, let me go. Let me go. Let go! Oh goodness!

76
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,050
You obviously overexerted yourself.

77
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,640
What to do. I'm so okay.

78
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,110
I’ll get some pain relief patches for you, Mr. Weak.

79
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,990
Ah, this is...

80
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,060
It's not like that! It doesn't hurt because of that!

81
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,220
Sure, sure. I'll play along with you.

82
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,660
Mr. Weak.

83
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,750
Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital

84
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,760
Intensive Care Unit

85
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,570
It's okay.

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,650
Honey, it's okay now.

87
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,690
Don’t worry.

88
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,920
You're aware of what you've been told.

89
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,580
It's all done, Director.

90
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,870
It won't be easy for him to say a word as he faces punishment once he does.

91
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,580
Don't be petty and keep a close eye on him. You'd better be flexible in this kind of situation.

92
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,980
Yes, I understand.

93
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,300
Hello, I am Oh Bo Mi from Miryeong Forest Protection Team.

94
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,680
- You're the best!
I don't want to admit it, but you did a good job.

95
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,990
Thank you, Kang San Hyeok.. Thanks to you, crew member Kim is alive.

96
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,680
I am really proud of you.

97
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,440
- Our country has Kang San Hyeok!
- He’s just like Pororo.

98
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,360
Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok!

99
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,570
Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok!v

100
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,430
Really? Moved to the general ward?

101
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,620
Okay. Now everything is fine.

102
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,690
Sister-in-law. I'll drop by later.

103
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,280
Has Sunbae Kim been moved out of the ICU?

104
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,460
What is this, Bastard? Why did you let two persons die, instead of one?

105
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,290
Fresh out of fire-fighter's school, who taught as a first subject that you do as you please and cut the rope?

106
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,500
If I didn't move, Senior Kim might have...

107
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,800
Don't you think other members didn't move because they don't know how to?

108
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,560
Didn't I tell you my order on scene is your life?

109
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,550
I am not interested in whether you die or not,

110
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,960
but everyone could have died together, if your amateur mistake went wrong.

111
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,170
Do you understand?

112
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,420
Do you ever? You don't know nothing, you asshole!

113
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,290
If you ever act on your own discretion and put others at risk,

114
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,850
I'll cut off your rope. If it somes to that you will understand I am not joking.

115
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,690
Even if that is so, the results are what matters.

116
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,750
If something unfortunate happened to Officer Kim, would it have made sense for me to wait for your orders?

117
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,190
I am telling you everything is about the results.

118
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,330
After all, isn’t it the rescue squad’s duty to save lives, by any and all means?

119
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,660
Mr. Superior, Kang San Hyeok. You seem to have forgotten two things.

120
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,020
First, it is my job to train you guys on all the methods.

121
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,700
Second, whether it’s a fire or saving lives, you absolutely can’t do it alone.

122
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:07,030
Today’s event... was caused by this arrogant rookie who knows nothing about teamwork.

123
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,510
Ready the backpack pumps!

124
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,300
Go! Let’s go!

125
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,690
This water that is as precious as blood!

126
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,020
Whoever spills even a drop, better be prepared!

127
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,330
From the beginning.

128
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,190
Think that you’re in the desert!

129
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,200
Is this a kindergarten show? Pick up the pace!

130
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,850
It is three months.

131
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,720
I’ll make sure the rescue squad leaves the forest within three months.

132
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,890
Let’s chant our slogan! This is all...

133
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,990
Kang San Hyeok’s fault!

134
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,440
- Mr. Know-it-all!
- Go Home!

135
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,470
Again!

136
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,670
This is all Kang San Hyeok’s fault! Mr. Know-it-all,

137
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,700
go home! This is all...

138
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,960
Kang San Hyeok’s fault! Mr. Know-it-all,

139
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,680
Go Home!

140
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,390
Gosh!

141
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,080
He’s tenacious.

142
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,250
Have you heard the news? About the commotion Dr. Jeong caused yesterday?

143
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,990
I heard something went terribly wrong yesterday and it seems it involved a patient.

144
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,270
There is not one person who didn't see what happened at Gangwon Hospital.

145
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,690
She was covered in blood. I heard it was crazy?

146
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,410
Dr. Jeong suffers from PD!
 (PD: Panic Disorder)

147
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,990
That’s why she was kicked out of Seoul. She tried to kill a patient.

148
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,320
She wasn't trying to kill the kid, she was trying to save it.

149
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,680
Did you know that?

150
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,870
Ah you also came from the same hospital, Seoul Myeongseong hospital.

151
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,770
Anyway, what do we do?

152
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,850
You're going to leave a patient with someone who had such a bad seizure? What if something happens?

153
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,750
You have to report the situation to the hospital chief and boycott.

154
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,380
I can't work with someone who isn't normal. I can't!

155
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
I can't!

156
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,440
What?

157
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,800
What?

158
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,190
Oh, so sorry for coming at this moment.

159
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,490
Please continue talking about me behind my back.

160
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,650
Oh, is it now talking in front of me?

161
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,050
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

162
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,450
What is that? You made a mess and patients aren't coming.

163
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,300
It was just a manic parade.

164
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,120
I think you're misunderstanding. PD is correct but there's no mania.

165
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,650
And since we're just starting, we don't know if patients will come or not.

166
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,570
All I'm saying is we ended as soon as we started.

167
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,590
Anyway in the report about Dr. Jeong,

168
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,290
the manic request for all these useless things...

169
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,180
will be covered. Know that.

170
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,790
I guess you were putting on a big show

171
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,950
because there were nasty things underneath.

172
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,890
Dr. Park!

173
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,710
What? Did I say something that isn't true?

174
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,930
Hospital chief!

175
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,470
How are you all?

176
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,460
Office 1.

177
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,190
Why suddenly...

178
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,180
Hospital chief.

179
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,430
The atmosphere in here changed since the last time.

180
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,720
Why... without prior notice, suddenly...?

181
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,320
Are you finding it ok here?

182
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,890
My wife seems to have made room because of your experience in aviation rescue.

183
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,620
You're not uncomfortable?

184
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,100
Yes, well...

185
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,040
That's not a normal house, that one.

186
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,100
There was no way she'd live isolated on a mountain but I carefully lured her...

187
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,260
and we're about to go back.

188
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,940
Until then, enjoy it.

189
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,690
Yes.

190
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,580
There's a lot of hardship for you, right?

191
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,270
Yes, there really is a lot.

192
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,790
You're still the same!

193
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,490
The facilities are...

194
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,840
We don't have any patients, so there's no use for the operating room.

195
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,720
I was going to say something, but the hospital is in this situation...

196
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,860
and I think I am sufficient as the only doctor...

197
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,370
OK, good to know.

198
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,390
Yes? Already?

199
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,640
Hospital chief!

200
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,690
You're already leaving?

201
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,260
Why, you'd like for me to stay here?

202
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,750
Well not really...

203
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,010
Good job yesterday. I think the operation went well?

204
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,730
Yes, I heard.

205
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,660
I’m glad the rescue crew member is okay.

206
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,860
Then, goodbye, Director.

207
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,690
Goodbye.

208
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,260
What was that?

209
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:04,640
It's the discomfort you feel when you're sick with diarrhea, and you try to push but only farts come out.

210
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,680
What did he see in there?

211
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,840
What did he come here for?

212
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,180
♬ Oh, at the sound of the whistle ♬

213
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:31,510
♬ I'm humming along not knowing that I am ♬

214
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,660
♬ Getting tipsy over a cup of coffee ♬

215
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,260
Hello, I’m from Miryeong Hospital.

216
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,720
I want to drop off a blood sample.

217
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,560
Heo Choon Sik

218
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,030
♬ Rather than what you want ♬

219
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,590
♬ Listen to the answer that I prepared for you. ♬

220
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,920
♬ Around the sunset... ♬

221
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,840
♬ We can talk facing each other, ♬

222
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,890
♬ we can fall in love ♬

223
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,850
♬ We don't have to do anything to feel great, ♬

224
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,670
♬ spending time with you ♬

225
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:27,180
♬ Just like this, with you ♬

226
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,130
♬ In my heart, there is only you ♬

227
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,300
♬ In my heart, there is always only ♬

228
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,910
♬ Won't you come to me? ♬

229
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,970
I promised to get you some.

230
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,680
Getting the wrong idea must be a habit. My arm doesn’t hurt because of that.

231
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,750
Yes, yes. I won’t call you Mr. Weak.

232
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,920
I will also be someone who won't be needing your help in the future anyway, so

233
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,240
there won't be any reason for you to buy these anymore.

234
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,670
Just think of it as a kind gesture from a roommate and enjoy it.

235
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,580
You don’t get it.

236
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,000
What I mean is, I’m not so out of shape that —

237
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,030
I don’t need this! Okay?

238
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,890
My life... doesn’t require pain relief patches.

239
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,790
Latest Psychiatry

240
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,920
As if the theory worked.

241
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,160
I think something just went by....

242
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,080
What is it?

243
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,690
It hurts...

244
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,080
What is it?

245
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,030
What? Why are you screaming?

246
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,090
There's a lizard!

247
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,130
- There! There!
- Where?

248
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,700
There it is!!

249
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,770
There!

250
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,650
Oh my gosh!

251
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,710
Where is it?!

252
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,150
- Where is it!
- There!

253
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,260
Whatever!

254
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,050
Look over there!

255
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,090
There it is!! Catch it!

256
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,350
Did you get it?

257
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,900
How dare you.... lizard...

258
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,670
Did you catch it?

259
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,850
It left it’s tail behind.

260
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,180
Oh my gosh!

261
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,660
Where did it go!

262
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,670
Silicone. Get some silicone and block all the gaps.

263
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,880
It learned a lesson. It shouldn’t comeback.

264
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,390
Why?

265
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,660
The patches!

266
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,310
You said they weren’t a part of your life.

267
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:36,440
One more word from you, and I’ll assume you want personally to put them on me.

268
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,180
Let me see. I’ll take a look.

269
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,880
Don’t fall head over heels.

270
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,420
I’m a doctor helping a patient.

271
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,800
I’m not a patient!

272
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,180
I put them on because you bought them for me. Oh, move that one slightly higher.

273
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,340
- Up?
- Yes.

274
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,870
- To the right.
- The right?

275
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,350
- To the right.
- That’s the left.

276
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,400
To the left. A bit more, a bit—

277
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,820
That’s it! I’m done.

278
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,900
This advanced medical task exhausted me.

279
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,100
That’s... ?

280
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,560
The hotteok is done right.

281
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,340
The cinnamon flavor is just right.

282
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,100
You’re enjoying it? I thought you only ate French desserts.

283
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,330
My grandmother sold vegetables at the market.

284
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,480
The hotteok shop next door was really good.

285
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,730
I'm sure you thought I grew up with a silver spoon in my mouth.

286
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:09,380
I was raised by a grandmother whose nails were black from cleaning vegetables all day in the market.

287
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,410
I thought you were a monster, but you have a human side too.

288
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,360
This is the thanks I get for chasing away a lizard?

289
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,850
I'm jealous.

290
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,020
The lizard.

291
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,310
If I could just cut out memory like that,

292
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,440
people could become so much happier.

293
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:43,310
In psychiatry, you'll meet a lot of patients with memory issues.

294
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,040
No matter how much time has passed,

295
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,820
your mind dwells on the moments when you were hurt.

296
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,780
If you majored in psychiatry, why did you change?

297
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,870
I didn't change my major, I ran away like a coward.

298
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,460
There was an anorexic patient.

299
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,560
With that hand, my chest and...

300
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,350
I promised I would be responsible for that patient.

301
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,250
I’m scared of eating.

302
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,940
The things that child experienced,

303
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,230
I couldn't handle the sadness.

304
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,130
It was too scary and hard.

305
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,690
So I ran away. I abandoned my patient

306
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,200
so that I could live.

307
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,900
You didn't run away, you cut it out -

308
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,050
the heavy load.

309
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,240
That's called wisdom, not cowardice.

310
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,770
Because you acknowledged your limits.

311
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:12,670
When you can't handle the weight, it's right to put it down before you're flattened.

312
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,660
Don't go.

313
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,050
Dad... Mom...

314
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,720
I'm sorry I got angry.

315
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,700
Mom.

316
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,620
Right after working your teammates, you always pretend to work alone.

317
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,430
Here.

318
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,660
Our sweet Choi Chang is giving you this.

319
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,890
I have to work hard, with joint training coming up soon.

320
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,670
This time our commander is in charge, so if we make a mistake it will be humiliating.

321
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,500
Of course.

322
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,510
Why do you keep riding on Kang San Hyeok, though?

323
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,890
He did save Man Soo's life.

324
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,100
On top of that, it'll take Man Soo six months to recover and return.

325
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,270
So who will cover during that time?

326
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,270
Anyway, all we have is Kang San Hyeok, whether you hate or like him.

327
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,100
That's why I have to nag him.

328
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,620
Huh?

329
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,160
Only 500 won.

330
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,820
You're so thirsty and want to drink one, but you don't have 500 won?

331
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,110
Why, don't you have it?

332
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,120
If you don't have, give me that.

333
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,300
I'll go to the first floor and get you one, and bring you your change.

334
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,190
When your throat burns, hot coffee is the best.

335
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,120
Ah, so hot!

336
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,670
Oh, our rookie Kang, you got promoted, eh?

337
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
Promoted?

338
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,550
Getting ripped off 500 won from that hyung

339
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,080
means you've been recognized as a real rescuer.

340
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,120
Alas, you'll get your change back in the next life.

341
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,990
I gave one to everyone so don't read too much into it.

342
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:46,250
Let's just say I had one. I don't like getting stuff from others for no reason.

343
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,000
People might think I'm doing this because I like you.

344
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,940
Don't misunderstand.

345
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,600
No one has changed their mind about you because of yesterday’s incident.

346
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,980
They all know you saved Man Soo out of pure luck.

347
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,490
Why don’t you let go my hand?

348
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,220
It may seem like you really do like me?

349
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:16,180
Anyway, no matter what kind of holy thing you do, I won’t trust you.

350
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,630
You made me take coffee I didn’t want. Now, you’re saying you don’t trust me?

351
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:27,700
It’s like a woman who loves me, wanting me to die. What is with this outrageous talk.

352
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,480
I’m not someone who needs your trust, so stop bothering me.

353
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,710
It's not even sympathy.

354
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:38,400
You can't get involved because you don't need something like trust.

355
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,650
You don't even dip your feet into it and just walk around in circles... How long will you continue this?

356
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,920
Is there really a doctor to soak your feet who needs to get involved?

357
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,070
To us, the rescue team is everything. But what is it for you?

358
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,100
I get this weird feeling that I will be finding out very soon.
