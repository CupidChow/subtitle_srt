Episode 29

2
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,640
Kang San Yoo

3
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,430
San Yoo.

4
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,480
Why are you yelling!

5
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,680
Fine. I'm not that educated but

6
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,850
you also graduated from college.

7
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,920
Did you eat?

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,610
- Don't watch them fight.
-There's only so much I can do!

9
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,170
I'm trying hard, too!

10
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,180
There's only so much I can do!

11
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,140
- I can't even make 3 million won!
- How can we teach the kids this way?

12
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm drinking so I can live! How dare you yell at me!

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,710
It's your fault that...

14
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,760
♬ Mountain rabbit, rabbit ♬

15
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,840
♬ Where do you think you're going? ♬

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,840
♬ Hop, hop, crying away ♬

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,540
♬ Where do you think you're going? ♬

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,700
Isn't it fun?

19
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,800
♬ Mountain rabbit, rabbit ♬

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,500
♬ Where do you think you're going? ♬

21
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,390
♬ Hop, hop, crying away ♬

22
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,880
♬ Where do you think you're going? ♬

23
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,490
Oppa, look over there. Isn't it pretty?

24
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,980
If you don't show your hand, you're the loser. Rock, paper, scissors!

25
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,420
Rock, paper, scissors!

26
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,690
You have so many.

27
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,340
Aren't you envious? My dad bought it for me.

28
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,640
I'm super strong now. You can't run away, can you?

29
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,900
Let go. I'm going to tell on you!

30
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,190
To who? You don't even have a mom and dad. Who are you going to tell?

31
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,390
You!

32
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,960
San Yoo!

33
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,560
Hey.

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,590
Are you okay?

35
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,680
If you leave the ddakji here a star will form every night.

36
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,870
I'll change it to a ddakji with 100 stars for you.

37
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,670
- You can't tell anyone about this place.
- Okay.

38
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,570
Let's go.

39
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,230
Oppa, Bo Ram always picks on me. He's mean.

40
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll scold Bo Ram for you.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,680
Oppa, you're going to fight off the evil people that bother me, right?

42
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,450
Don't worry. I'll protect you, San Yoo.

43
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,520
Until the end.

44
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,860
Oppa.

45
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,430
- San Yoo!
- Oppa!

46
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,670
San Yoo!

47
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,980
San Yoo, this is where you've been.

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,140
I told you I'd protect you and didn't do so.

49
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,690
I forgot about you...

50
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,230
I'm really sorry.

52
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,430
San Yoo...

53
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,160
So, your memory came back?

54
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,810
So what?

55
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,210
What will you do about what happened in the past?

56
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,400
Do you have proof?

57
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,510
Not the memories in your head.

58
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,570
Do you have solid proof?

59
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,170
What are you going to do with proof? Send Choi Jeong Mok to jail?

60
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,970
One year of probation?

61
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,130
What are you trying to pull?

62
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,840
Do you know what hurt me the most in that forest fire?

63
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,830
Losing my sister.

64
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,720
Losing San Yoo in that forest fire

65
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,190
was the worst pain for me.

66
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,090
What must I take from you for you to feel the most pain?

67
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,380
Choi Chang. It's Choi Chang.

68
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,420
Shut up! You bastard!

69
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,370
I want to bash your skull in right now.

70
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,490
I can even hire people that kill people in the cruelest way possible.

71
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,260
But not for you.

72
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,130
What brings Choi Jeong Mok the most pain

73
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,690
is ruining his beloved son, Choi Chang, whom he can't live without.

74
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,460
If the kind Choi Chang finds out the truth about his father,

75
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,660
have you thought about how he'd live the remainder of his life?

76
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,800
Have you ever thought about if you'd be able to protect your son

77
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,870
after everything you did?

78
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,320
Keep your eyes wide open and watch.

79
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,500
Choi Chang being thrown into the flames of hell.

80
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,480
What... What do you want me to do?

81
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,140
If I were to testify, it won't be good because Chang will find out.

82
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,390
Jo Kwang Pil covered up everything so perfectly.

83
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,960
I have nothing to offer you as proof.

84
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,110
What must I do

85
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,660
for you not to cause harm to Chang and let him be?

86
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,870
We must find proof against Kwon Joo Han.

87
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,530
When you got Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae out.

88
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,220
you signed the papers to keep quiet about the contamination.

89
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,930
I know.

90
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,010
Not the Miryeong village contamination issue. We must find evidence

91
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,160
that can prove that they mined rare earth minerals here 25 years ago.

92
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,200
As Professor Lee stated, there is probably a ton of contaminants buried in the forest.

93
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,510
We must find that.

94
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,630
Grandma, are you okay?

95
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,370
Doctor, thanks to them

96
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,070
I had a comfortable stay in a good hospital.

97
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,910
I need to thank them...

98
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,490
Did you hide Hwang Young Bok?

99
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,130
I didn't lie, she's receiving treatment from the top medical team in that field.

100
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,640
Please start by treating the heavy metal toxicity.

101
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,130
It looks like we must.

102
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,720
Please give me a call if something comes up.

103
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
Okay.

104
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,710
Miryeong contamination investigation request

105
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,540
Miryeong contamination investigation request

106
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,890
Complaints

107
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,100
Hello. I'm enforcement officer Oh Bo Mi from Miryeong County Government.

108
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,760
Yes. What brings you here?

109
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,070
I wanted to ask what you think about

110
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,830
getting an autopsy done for Heo Choon Sik?

111
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,030
Autopsy?

112
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,870
There are lots of questionable things regarding his death.

113
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,430
Must I get an autopsy done on my father because of things you guys are curious about?

114
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,260
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Nevermind that.

115
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,520
I don't want to be a bad child to my father until the end.

116
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,800
Also, we've already discussed it and decided to get him cremated.

117
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
Wait.

118
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,050
They've already discussed it?

119
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,490
With whom?

120
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,910
It disappeared?

121
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,960
Formal complaint request submitted

122
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,560
Formal complaint request

123
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,750
Complaints

124
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,140
It disappeared again?

125
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,960
Who are you?

126
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,120
Conduct an epidemiology investigation in Miryeong Village?

127
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,010
Neither the media or environmental groups are making a move.

128
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,840
So let's make a legitimate investigation result and handle this ourselves.

129
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,100
- I approve.
- I approve.

130
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,080
Dr. Park, and what if there's a malpractice case?

131
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,860
Could you handle it?

132
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,410
What will you do, jerk!

133
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,160
Bring my son back to life! My son!

134
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,950
Geez, I've been pushed out to Miryeong Hospital. How much further could they push me out to?

135
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,500
And how about you, Nurse Kim? Will you get caught nursing illegally again?

136
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,640
Oh, my gosh! No!

137
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,750
Give me a ballpoint pen. A pen!

138
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,020
Well, was I supposed to just stand back and watch while a person is dying?

139
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,310
Then, we'll begin, okay?

140
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,130
Okay!

141
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:56,410
So, I'm asking you if you're hurting anywhere.

142
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,790
You can't hear me?

143
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,020
Why do you keep getting angry at me?

144
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,200
How dare you shove your face at me?

145
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,260
- Aigoo, what a nice house.
- Yes.

146
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,740
Dr. Jeong, write down on the sample and...

147
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,820
Name, Date

148
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,600
Okay.

149
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,870
Sir, we're here to collect your water.

150
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,900
Sir?

151
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,510
Thank you.

152
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,000
16-2, right?

153
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,450
Aigoo, it was a long day.

154
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,330
There.

155
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,860
We ran a field hospital first time in a long time. It's exhausting. All go home from here.

156
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,320
You understand, right?

157
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,190
Good job, Dr. Park.

158
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,500
Thank you, Dr. Park.

159
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,650
Here is a list of patients you didn't get to see.

160
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,800
Thank you, Nurse Kim.

161
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,820
Bye.

162
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,210
You don't have to rescue yourself, Jeong Yeong Jae.

163
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,530
Because you have me.

164
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,560
If you fall into the water, you become a ball.

165
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,590
If you curl into a ball and stay still, you'll float slowly.

166
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,430
Why are you teaching me this?

167
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,790
It's insurance for when I'm not around.

168
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,340
I'm a ball...

169
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,850
I can float to the surface of the water like a ball.

170
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,740
I won't sink.

171
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,100
I can do it.

172
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,740
And he said the goblin fire appeared at night during those times.

173
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,180
And when the birds cried out at night seeing the fire, the residents said the goblin birds were crying out.

174
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,050
I'm sure they pretended to develop a resort during the day.

175
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,390
But they lit up the fire at night to mine without the residents' knowledge.

176
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:41,010
On that note, I looked up permit paperwork of Taesung mining at the county office.

177
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,630
But they had covered it up as a resort development. There were no records.

178
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,150
How about the mining company?

179
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,310
No trace at all.

180
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,790
I think they changed the company name.

181
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,930
It's the same way with mining technicians. Everything seems blocked.

182
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,870
What should we do about this?

183
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,760
If it's blocked, we should break through.

184
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,690
Starting at the spot that's been blocked.

185
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,420
Send out this photo to all the reporters at the newspapers and TV stations

186
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,270
who are assigned to Taesung Group news and set up meetings.

187
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,730
But then Taesung will find out.

188
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,690
I want them to know.

189
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,000
They took the bait.

190
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,100
Yes, this is Kang San Hyeok...

191
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,570
Director Jo.

192
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,090
I'm Kang San Hyeok.

193
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,310
I'm Kwon Joo Han.

194
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,240
Save us!

195
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,060
Rescue us!

196
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,880
So we get to meet this way, Director Kang San Hyeok. I really wanted to meet you.

197
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,620
I wanted to meet you as well.

198
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:54,290
I was always curious to know what kind of animal pooped out crap like Jo Kwang Pil.

199
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,750
Mr. Kang San Hyeok.

200
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,310
It looks like you trained him wrong.

201
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:08,230
How dare a mutt butt in and starts barking while people are talking?

202
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,470
Director.

203
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,720
Now, let's be open and discuss. What is it you want?

204
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,530
You're the one who requested a negotiation. Why don't you present your terms first?

205
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,980
I'll decide whether I'll accept those terms or not.

206
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,660
Cover up the contamination issue and hand over the...

207
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,660
provincial forest and mining permit. I'll compensate you handsomely.

208
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,890
A top wealthy elite of South Korea, Managing Director Kwon Joo Han of Taesung Group.

209
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,240
Should we make a bet as to who can raise more cash in a given amount of time?

210
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,730
I'm Kang San Hyeok.

211
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,840
I have more than enough investment sources all over the world.

212
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,450
Why would I hand over such a valuable business to you?

213
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,930
Then how about you join us with the provincial forest permit?

214
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,390
Funding power isn't the only thing you need to succeed in the rare earth mineral business.

215
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,390
We'll take care of the mining infrastructure and the know-how.

216
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:30,620
We'll put together a development company and give you the CEO position.

217
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,230
I'll give you 30% share.

218
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,190
Fifty percent.

219
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,840
I'll leave if you won't give me 50%.

220
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,770
You're exactly as I've heard.

221
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,100
Our war is over with this then.

222
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,850
I truly wanted to hold this hand.

223
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:12,160
Now, you're family, CEO Kang San Hyeok.

224
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,610
Do you trust Kang San Hyeok?

225
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,210
Is it possible to do business while trusting anyone?

226
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,770
Just stand back and watch.

227
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,530
He has the audacity to stab me in the back and the ability to do so.

228
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,090
All right, Managing Director.

229
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,920
The look in his eyes is so mysterious.

230
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,190
I can't tell what he wants at all.

231
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,060
People who see me clearly want money from me.

232
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,370
But not Kang San Hyeok.

233
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,530
He's looking at something else.

234
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,550
What could it be...

235
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,790
He's an interesting fella...

236
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,090
I have the confidence to fight thanks to you.

237
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,210
You're the proof that I'm not cursed.

238
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,980
Yeong Jae.

239
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,960
I really like you.

240
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,000
♬ with a small voice ♬

241
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,860
Me, too.

242
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,120
I really like you.

243
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,420
♬ I cried and laughed for a moment because of the memories ♬

244
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:53,090
♬ that passed through my heart ♬

245
00:20:53,090 --> 00:21:00,500
♬ I walked on a rainy street, waiting for you ♬

246
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,500
♬ without an umbrella, like that day ♬

247
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,570
♬ When the rain stops, when the tears stop, ♬

248
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,210
A family in a car falls off a cliff, a young girl rescued, her parents die

249
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,900
♬ I feel like you will come ♬

250
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,260
Oh Bo Mi

251
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,870
What?

252
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,440
Stop it, girl. Come on.

253
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,320
Why are you coming alone? I said the four of should get together first time in a while.

254
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,290
Forget it. Tell me. What did you find out?

255
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,710
All the Miryeong residents are being cremated when they pass away.

256
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,560
Cremated? Don't people in the countryside bury their dead? Why is that?

257
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,730
I don't know why. And when I try to dig in a bit, my superiors stop me.

258
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,860
What about you? Did you find out anything?

259
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:18,680
It was hard to look into so I'm going inside the tiger cave myself.

260
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,170
Tiger cave?

261
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,190
Seoul Myeongseong Hospital.

262
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,730
Just why did Seoul Myeongseong Hospital hide Heo Choon Sik?

263
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,300
Why did they get rid of every trace of him after he died? I'm going to look into this.

264
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,590
Don't you have to return to that hospital?

265
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,290
That's why I have to look into if it's worth returning to.

266
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,470
Here. It's a list of villagers who didn't get tested.

267
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,960
Please do everything you can to persuade them to get tested.

268
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,930
Okay.

269
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,300
There is someone you should persuade first.

270
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,710
Father.

271
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,660
Let's go to the hospital. To get tested.

272
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,890
Test? What test?

273
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,090
Miryeong Village's land and water are contaminated with heavy metal.

274
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,090
You've been drinking the water this entire time.

275
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,440
Heavy metal? Don't blame the water

276
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,450
and you stop giving me a hard time!

277
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm talking about Officer Oh. Crazy Oh!

278
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,340
Father!

279
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Seriously? I tell him to buy bottled water but he drinks tap water to save money.

280
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,590
Things are chaotic enough as it is.

281
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,660
Where did he hear such nonsense?

282
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,460
I should have found and gotten rid of him then!

283
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,830
Kang San Hyeok was discharged yesterday.

284
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,290
I'm Kang San Hyeok's uncle.

285
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,190
I hear that he's lost his mind

286
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,490
and can't remember anything about the forest fire. Is this true?

287
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,640
Yes. He's lost all his memories, not just his memories of the fire.

288
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,440
Whether human or animal,

289
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,120
you must make sure they're absolutely dead when getting rid of them.

290
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,060
Pass me up, you punk!

291
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,100
What is he doing?

292
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,290
Hey, you punk! Drive properly!

293
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,190
If I croak without a chance to hold my grandson, will you be responsible? What the heck!

294
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,030
Was he trying to kill me?

295
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:37,080
Jo Kwang Pil

296
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,120
What do you want me to do?

297
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,660
Pretend that you don't know. That I'm that kid.

298
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,040
You just have to turn a blind eye to the fact that I know everything

299
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,630
about what Jo Kwang Pil and Kwon Joo Han did that day.

300
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,890
If I tell Jo Kwang Pil then Kang San Hyeok will cause harm to Chang.

301
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,750
If I get caught for not saying anything, Jo Kwang Pil will kill me.

302
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,900
Jo Kwang Pil

303
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,770
It's me.

304
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,980
If you have time to tail me to kill me,

305
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,860
you should take care of the tiger cub instead.

306
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,090
Let's meet now.

307
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,750
The environmental standards for mining and purification processes in our country

308
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,780
are more stringent than in China.

309
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,290
It's possible that this will cost us more than we'd planned.

310
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,370
How can we lower the cost?

311
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,640
We can't prevent producing toxic waste during the refining process.

312
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,370
Unless we ship minerals we dig up to Malaysia like Linus of Australia

313
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,680
and conduct the purification process, we can't prevent the contamination of the environment...

314
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:06,490
Why are you only concerned about the environment? The purpose of this company is to make a profit.

315
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,660
There's no need to run a business that is more concerned about other matters.

316
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,010
Yes. I'll look into it again.

317
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,530
Let's end it here today.

318
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,460
President Kang, aren't you pushing it too much from the start?

319
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,150
If you lower the cost too much there are bound to be problems.

320
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:37,120
Taesung Group may have invested in half the shares, but this is my company where I'm the CEO.

321
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,210
Isn't that a clear reason to be more cutthroat?

322
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,250
That way, Taesung Group will make a bigger profit.

323
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,690
I'll relay that to Managing Director.

324
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,100
And the mining company?

325
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,690
We're providing them with our know-how.

326
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,480
We'll select an experienced and appropriate company.

327
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,520
Let's do that then.

328
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,670
A company with a lot of experience and low cost.

329
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,920
K Corporation

330
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,430
It's been a while Director Jo. How can I help you?

331
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,180
I think it's time that we borrow your skills again.

332
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,340
To bury or dig up?

333
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,120
There's no need to bury anything this time.

334
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,130
I'm heading over to you, so let's have a chat.

335
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,530
HS ENG

336
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,390
HS ENG
Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do 32-1

337
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,690
HS ENG

338
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,720
What are you staring at?

339
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,690
Jeez! You scared me!

340
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,960
Is this not your home? Why are you so startled?

341
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,350
What! Your chasing after things like this?

342
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,490
Are you really not coming back?

343
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,030
- Are you going home, Hospital Director?
- Hello.

344
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,270
Director Shim Woo Seop told me that you're working very hard.

345
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,090
Is the work manageable?

346
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,120
Myeongseong University Branch Hospital
Quarterly Report

347
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,620
Dr. Yoon said he had some business to take care of in Seoul so I was just about to send him.

348
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,870
No, Director. I must go.

349
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,080
Is there a reason?

350
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,960
Miryeong Village is contaminated with heavy metals.

351
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,530
I believe Seoul Myeongseong Hospital is also involved in this.

352
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,580
I am doing my best.

353
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,220
All right.

354
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,500
It looks like a patient arrived from Gangwon Hospital.

355
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,470
- Where are they taking him instead of the ER?
- Hey.

356
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,660
I'll be leaving.

357
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,680
I'll call you, so don't go anywhere and wait for me.

358
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,100

Myeongseong University Branch Hospital
Quarterly Report

360
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,510
Dr. Park, are you okay?

361
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,100
Perfect. My disguise is very good and did you see my acting?

362
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,110
My shaking hands.

363
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,790
Everyone fell for it.

364
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,100
What do I have to do now?

365
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,120
Did you see what ward you're in?

366
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,160
Pulmonary Medicine. Room 601.

367
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,060
I'm sure they have relevant documents there. I'll call you as soon as I find them.

368
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,100
Nurse Kim, it's Pulmonary Medicine.

369
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,470
Ward 601

370
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,760
- How have you been?
- Gosh!

371
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,660
Unni, how long has it been? What brings you here?

372
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,960
I stopped by to take care of some things.

373
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,180
Are you busy?

374
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,220
I brought you this. Eat first. Let's go inside.

375
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,130
Come.

376
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,450
Nothing's changed.
Pulmonary Medicine

377
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,720
Looks so good.

378
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,560
- Nothing has changed.
- Right?

379
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,000
- Eat.
- Thanks, Unni.

380
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,350
- Enjoy. Drink it while it's hot.
- Thanks.

381
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,510
I was craving coffee anyway.

382
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,130
You got prettier.

383
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,130
- Oh, no.
- Thanks, Unni.

384
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,330
Myeongseong University Hospital

385
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,820
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

386
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,390
Drink this.

387
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,820
Everything good?

388
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,090
Don't worry about me. I'm okay.

389
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,590
Ward 601

390
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,650
- Thanks, Unni.
- Sure.

391
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,940
Episode 30 will air soon.
