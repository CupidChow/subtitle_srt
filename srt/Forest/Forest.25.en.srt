00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,510
Episode 25

2
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,800
From now on, I'll manage Kang San Hyeok personally.

3
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,620
This woman. Bring her to me.

4
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,120
Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong's Transfer of Duties Ceremony
We'll begin Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong's transfer of duties ceremony now.

5
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,200
We'll trace back Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong's past work through this video.

6
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,160
For the last 23 years, Team Leader Jeong did not look after his own safety

7
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,690
but gave everything to rescuing accident victims.

8
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,440
He was the pillar and the symbol of our Unam Rescue Team.

9
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,660
- Now, Team Leader Jeong will train the next generation at the fire school.
- Good job, Dad.

10
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,360
While on numerous accident sites,

11
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,640
he protected precious lives and property.

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,770
Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong's Transfer of Duties Ceremony

13
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,220
Everyone, salute to Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong!

14
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,130
Unam!

15
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,900
Unam.

16
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,620
Do you feel sad to retire?

17
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,510
No, I don't. I feel grateful.

18
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,690
You feel grateful?

19
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,560
Destiny is so interesting.

20
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,270
It makes me feel like...

21
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,980
To meet you....

22
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,440
I think I wore this uniform to meet you, my daughter.

23
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,480
I see... I also feel thankful for the uniform.

24
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,390
In the middle of so many dangers, it protected my father until now.

25
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,090
- Young Jae.
- Yes?

26
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,680
- Huh?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,090
He is here!

28
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,640
Who?

29
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,920
Come in.

30
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,110
Hello, sir.

31
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,110
Thank you.

32
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,370
Let's eat!

33
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,080
- Thanks for the meal!
-Thank you!

34
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
I know you are busy. How did you come here?

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,440
Nothing important here.

36
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,850
I just wanted to have dinner with you.

37
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,060
I see... that's why she made pumpkin pancake

38
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,370
even though she's really not good at cooking.

39
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,910
Dad... you don't have to say that.

40
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,300
What's the problem?

41
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,890
I'm fine. She cooks me well.

42
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,850
You're kidding me!

43
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,040
Right, you should do that if you want to score some points.

44
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,390
Thank you.

45
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,850
But I think I'm improving with saying cringey things.

46
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,340
Here, here, eat. How you must be suffering.

47
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,950
What do you mean suffer?

48
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,490
It's so delicious.

49
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,710
Wait!

50
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,120
- Here, here.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,900
- Okay.
- Wow.

52
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,460
He's become more gutsy, too.

53
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,970
- Thank you for this meal.
- Sure, sure.

54
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,920
It tastes so nice.

55
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,690
♬ Drunk on a cup of coffee ♬

56
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,410
♬ I also don't realize ♬

57
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,920
♬ I'm sitting and thinging of you ♬

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,600
Harlequin?

59
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,820
I have superpowers.

60
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,570
Magic fingers.

61
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,190
Page...123!

62
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,240
Oh, Page 123.

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,090
"His rough hand pushed into my blouse...

64
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,350
and Elaine started to moan..."

65
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,000
Hmm...

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,490
♬ We can fall in love ♬

67
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,690
♬ Even doing nothing at all I feel good ♬

68
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,720
What the heck? Only this section of the book is worn out. What happened? Are other ones like this, too?

69
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,460
The last one there.

70
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,290
♬ Only you ♬

71
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,210
She used to play around before.

72
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,980
This is when she was a middle school student...

73
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,760
Stop looking at my picture!

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
What is it?!

75
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,510
It looks like a lion's mane.

76
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,000
Were you Miss Korea?

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,560
It's good. Say, ah...

78
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,360
It's not me!

79
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,580
It's not me. Dad, why are you keeping these?!

80
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,910
Dad!

81
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,940
♬ Wu - - Ah - ♬

82
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,710
♬ Only you always in my heart ♬

83
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,610
You hair looks....

84
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,880
It looks pretty.

85
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,660
Why is there so much?

86
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,900
What do you mean? It'll be gone in no time if two people eat it.

87
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,760
As you get older, it becomes more difficult to be genuine with people.

88
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,760
There are other things that get involved in a relationship, besides your heart.

89
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,080
All right. You're doing well.

90
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,290
You're fine as long as you're being genuine.

91
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,790
No need to fear or be calculating. As long as you're being true,

92
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,880
you'll be gaining in the end no matter how it turns out.

93
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,040
And your parents...

94
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,640
Isn't it about time you visit them?

95
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,800
What are you saying? My parent is here. What parents are you talking about?

96
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,100
I'm not forcing it on you.

97
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,160
But when I see you, I feel bad toward them.

98
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,860
Because I only get to enjoy seeing how well you grew up.

99
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,290
That day is nearing.

100
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,070
How about you go and visit them where they're buried...

101
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,880
Dad!

102
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,550
Okay, I got it. Got it. I won't bring it up anymore.

103
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,730
Don't get angry. This is a good day.

104
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,460
He's here. Let's go.

105
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,780
Let's go. Come.

106
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,590
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

107
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,320
It's heavy. Careful.

108
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,230
I had a good time today.

109
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,260
I felt like I went back into all of Jeong Yeong Jae's past.

110
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:53,090
I was so curious every time I saw you. What kind of time you went through and ended up as your current self now, in front of me.

111
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,290
It's not all my past.

112
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,320
It doesn't matter.

113
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,500
The important thing is that Jeong Yeong Jae invited me to her memories.

114
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,820
In that space of memories, I got to have dinner with your father, laughed...

115
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,270
I got to see your mane.

116
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,730
It was so fun and wonderful. The first time I felt those emotions.

117
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,960
What's going on? Why are you getting dressed?

118
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:00,800
What's the use being here when I'm supposed to be so busy? It's not like I'll get my beautiful face back just for lying here.

119
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,290
More than that, I cannot trust you, Director.

120
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,390
You can't trust me? About what?

121
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,150
Do you know how many people are after our Team One?

122
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,510
Would you not be distracted? No...

123
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,650
You can't show weakness to a man.

124
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,130
That's great.

125
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,480
We should wrap up Miryeong project before Kwon Joo Han comes to his senses.

126
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,600
Geez, you're so heartless. You don't even try to stop me.

127
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,500
He's trying so hard to be nonchalant.

128
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,490
He's not trying. He's really laughing there.

129
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,290
Nah, no way.

130
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,300
Even though he got to protect his management rights, he lost so much money.

131
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,590
Isn't it strange?

132
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,950
He blew 300 billion won overnight, but it's too quiet.

133
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,180
Well, he took a huge punch. Don't you think he's being cautious?

134
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,610
- You said Director Jo offered you 100 billion won, right?
- No, no...

135
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,160
100 billion... ow...

136
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,810
Another 100 billion. I'm a 200 billion won man.

137
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,600
Look through all the files you compiled to review their ledger last time.

138
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,200
See if he spent money on anything else besides the high tech and resort businesses.

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
Yup, Director.

140
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,500
Personal Information

141
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,890
How much did this woman find out about?

142
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,710
I submitted the report in order to find that out

143
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,550
but instead of the water analysis, they sent something weird.

144
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,530
State of Special Rescue Team Trauma Management by Jeong Yeong Jae, Miryeong Hospital

145
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,320
Do you think they noticed? Was it talked about with Kang San Hyeok?

146
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,130
Seeing as how there's no movement on Kang San Hyeok's part related to the incident, I don't think he knows.

147
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,450
I'm positive Jeong Yeong Jae has not found out the details.

148
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,070
Let's speed up the plan. Get started on the next step immediately.

149
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:12,100
We don't have Miryeong village in our hands yet. What if a problem arises?

150
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,840
Director, I told you I will take care of it myself.

151
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,710
If I'm taking care of it, who will cause trouble?

152
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,850
I apologize.

153
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,460
We don't have time.

154
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,210
Things will get messy if the press finds out, so hurry up and get rid of that woman.

155
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,560
I will handle Kang San Hyeok myself.

156
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,590
Understood, Chairman.

157
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,400
Grandmother!

158
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,910
Grandmother.

159
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,360
She's not here, she went downtown.

160
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,620
Downtown?

161
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:55,890
She said the medicine's not working and is in a lot of pain, so she'll be staying at her son's place.

162
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,180
How long will she be there?

163
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,020
How would I know?

164
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,010
Since she's uncomfortable around her daughter-in-law

165
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,270
she probably won't be there long.

166
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,010
Here, eat.

167
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,910
Thank you.

168
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,830
She needs to pick up her phone.

169
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,220
Director Jo Kwang Pil

170
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,810
Yes, this is Jeong Yeong Jae.

171
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,410
I gave it some thought,

172
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,300
and I don't think I'll be suitable for the position.

173
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,360
Another teacher with more experience-

174
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,450
If you won't take the position, the foundation would like to withdraw the offer of the sponsorship.

175
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,590
A poor trauma management system for the rescue team

176
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,270
that was conceived by a young doctor who came from the best hospital in South Korea.

177
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,080
No such story can be told by an experienced doctor.

178
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,500
Can't you give it some more time and look around?

179
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,210
If you suddenly dispose of it, the paramedics-

180
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,600
Ah, this is my last proposition,

181
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,670
if you accept to be the medical head of the center

182
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,850
we will immediately go forth with paying for the center's fees.

183
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,450
If not, everything will be cancelled.

184
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,370
The choice is up to you.

185
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,990
I will give it more thought and give you an answer.

186
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,890
Bye.

187
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,250
Why me?

188
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,600
Thank you, Governor.

189
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,980
I will repay your efforts.

190
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,270
There must be something wrong with this...

191
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,000
It must be fake news.

192
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,360
I mean it's not.

193
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,870
Miryeong Confirmed to Develop Asia's Largest Resort

194
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,340
It's hard to believe.

195
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,390
Team leader, what is this? If a resort comes in, will our rescue team be disbanded?

196
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,080
There's no report from the upper departments yet.

197
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,940
The villagers will protest for sure.

198
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,460
Then are they excluding this area when they develop it?

199
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,800
Geez, they can't do that with our heliport.

200
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,310
I'm sure we will merge with Seonam team or something.

201
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,230
Aish, I don't like this.

202
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,110
Why a resort all of a sudden?

203
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,510
Team Leader, shouldn't we do something as a whole?

204
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,800
What power do we have?

205
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,550
Team leader, what kind of company is...

206
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,300
Father! Why are you here? Why?

207
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,160
Team Leader.

208
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,770
Father, what bring you here?

209
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,240
Choi Chang will quit the rescue team from today onward.

210
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,280
Father!

211
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,820
I think you need to discuss this with Choi Chang, why don't you go to the lounge ...

212
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,920
There's nothing to discuss!

213
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,260
I won't allow him to come here anymore, so keep that in mind.

214
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,540
This is all the rescue team's fault!

215
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,520
- The rescue team's fault?
- Hyungnim!

216
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,940
Are you really going to be like this? Coming to your adult son's workplace and embarrassing me?

217
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,010
What do you mean embarrassing? I can't believe you threw me into shock like that.

218
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,090
Forget everything! Hurry, pack up and go study abroad!

219
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,470
Mr. Choi Jeong Mok!

220
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,310
If you weren't in the rescue team, how would you have gotten to know Officer Oh?

221
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,760
You got nothing else to do and no women to date?

222
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,780
Oh Bo Mi? Don't you dare embarrass our family. Go study abroad, man!

223
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,370
Father, did I really do something wrong?

224
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,960
If I didn't do anything wrong, what do you mean I ruined our home?

225
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,230
There's no home to even ruin.

226
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,530
What did I do wrong? Bulls***.

227
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,850
She's suspicious about everything when I've done nothing wrong. That's why I'm saying she's a crazy nut.

228
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,900
No way. I can't stand to see you working as a rescuer any longer.

229
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,170
You get out of here and study more and

230
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,200
grow Miryeong Forestry to become an even bigger company.

231
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,500
Who says you can't grow a company as big as Taesung, huh?

232
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,880
If studying abroad is your dream, you go and study yourself.

233
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm not going to move an inch from here. Also, apologize to Bo Mi, she is a precious daughter of another family!

234
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,970
Is that so? Do whatever you want!

235
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,650
I stopped your card and already sold your car.

236
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,290
I don't need those things.

237
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,390
Until you apologize to Bo Mi, I won't go home!

238
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,560
What'd you say??

239
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,480
I'm disappointed. I won't even call you Hyungnim anymore.

240
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,990
Apologize to Bo Mi!

241
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,020
Hey, Choi Chang. You consider someone else's daughter precious,

242
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,520
yet you Brat don't consider your own father precious? Give me a break!

243
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,950
Unam Mountain Rescue Team (Jeong Byeong Yeong), The angel I met underwater, my daughter

244
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,660
A family in a car falls off a cliff, a young girl rescued, her parents die

245
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,620
A family in a car falls off a cliff, a young girl rescued, her parents die

246
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,660
A family in a car falls off a cliff, a young girl rescued, her parents die

247
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,570
The driver Kim and his wife died from the accident. Kim's daughter (aged 8) was rescued by a rescuer...

248
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:35,260
♬ You put me to sleep with only the memories of being around you. ♬

249
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,310
♬ Because I will love you ♬

250
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,140
Ah, I'm so full!

251
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,140
♬ Like a day which will never return again ♬

252
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,770
What is it?

253
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,330
It's nice.

254
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,120
What is?

255
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,230
Just, you standing in front of me so beautiful and all.

256
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,920
Our Yeong Jae is so nice.

257
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,330
So random.

258
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,610
Not like I've been pretty only one or two days.

259
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,750
That's why I prepared this. My fluffy, fluffy heart

260
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,170
- Ah, really!
- Don't! Don't!

261
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,410
♬ I love you. ♬

262
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,230
Don't! Stop it!

263
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,250
♬ Always ♬

264
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,150
Who is it at this hour?

265
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,920
Let's go see.

266
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,650
- Who is it?
- Delivery!

267
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,480
- Did you order something?
- No.

268
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,580
What is it?

269
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,120
Be careful...

270
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,260
What is it?

271
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,460
Ah, it's so heavy!

272
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,480
Chang!

273
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,050
I came here to deliver something that you like.

274
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,940
Deliver?

275
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,860
Beer!

276
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,130
Beer in perfect temperature, for three of us!

277
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,740
What a nice house for three people.

278
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,050
So what if you left your home? What does that have to do with me?

279
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,720
I know you like me.

280
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,900
You know well that I have to stay in this neighborhood for emergency dispatch.

281
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,020
Forget it. I don't care about your situation, Choi sunbae. Take the beer and leave.

282
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,630
I cannot live with someone else! No matter who it is, I can't live with them.

283
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,220
What in the world? Look at you guys.

284
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,130
You were living in this shady set up this whole time?

285
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,750
Whoa, I didn't think you were like this. But you two are no joke.

286
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,100
What do you mean it's no joke? It's two separate houses once we lock the door. What are you saying?

287
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,470
It pops open. It's open, it's open.

288
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,260
Whatever. You cannot live here. Leave now!

289
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,830
No! I cannot leave my Young Jae in this dangerous house.

290
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,460
Don't say my Young Jae.

291
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,680
She's not yours.

292
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,060
Kang San Hyeok, you wicked one.

293
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,260
Did you know that I'm a good artist?

294
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,580
To show what an interesting set up you and Dr. Jeong have in your living arrangement,

295
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,050
I'll draw it and pass it out to the rescue team.

296
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,200
- Are you threatening me right now?
- Yeah.

297
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,540
Have a conscience, man.

298
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,930
This is one house. Not two separate houses.

299
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,820
I'll have to draw lying down right here.

300
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,870
Here you go.

301
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,320
Of course, you're the best, Uncle.

302
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,020
- Of course! You asked for it, Chang.
- Thanks, Uncle.

303
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,220
Enjoy.

304
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,410
Gosh, look how fresh this is.

305
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,940
There.

306
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,610
He doesn't need a delivery app.

307
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:46,500
This is what a VVIP in a countryside can do. Even Kang San Hyeok isn't capable of this.

308
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,220
But you know, don't you think there's too much food, Chang?

309
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,710
It's not much. She'd have no problem finishing this by herself.

310
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,080
- I can't eat this alone.
- Geez...

311
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,190
You two can't handle this. I can't even do it.

312
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,550
If you're not talking about the three of us, who then?

313
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,530
- She's here.
- What?

314
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,050
He even invited someone over?

315
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,990
Bo Mi!

316
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,610
Bo Mi?

317
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,790
How come a sad premonition is never wrong?

318
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,960
So, you're dating? You two?

319
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,210
So, it was you when Chang said he was inviting me over to a sneaky love house?

320
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,900
So, how could you two beautiful ladies be best friends?

321
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,710
We're not best friends!

322
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,560
Now, now, since Bo Mi doesn't drink, you can have a soda.

323
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,150
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

324
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,040
Did you quit drinking?

325
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:18,400
You used to drink beer with a straw during class and got caught when you stunk up the class burping.

326
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,870
You were beaten to a pulp by our teacher back then. That's why you quit drinking.

327
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,270
You drank beer with a straw during class?

328
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,420
So cute. Cute.

329
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,840
How many times did I tell you that it wasn't beer, but a barley drink?

330
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,860
Besides, it'd be good if we didn't dig up our past.

331
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,630
- Did you know that Yeong Jae's nickname used to be Bowlegs?
- Hey!

332
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,290
Are you bowlegged?

333
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,900
- No.
- Ha!

334
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,530
As a basic rule, she dated at least five guys at the same time.

335
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,450
- She's never had a time without boyfriends ever since elementary school.
- Hey!

336
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,930
Not at the same time. One after another in order. How many times did I tell you that?

337
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,840
By the way, I had boyfriends ever since I was in kindergarten.

338
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm fine with that. No wonder she's got high standards for choosing a good man.

339
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,470
Watch yourself. Once I start talking, everyone will be in for a shock.

340
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,610
Control yourself, too. Passing out seeing a flasher

341
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,160
and all your crazy antics. We can go all night, you know.

342
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,760
Look. Hey.

343
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,040
A cat. Suri and Nol.

344
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,700
Suri and Nol!

345
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,660
My babies!

346
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,530
Oh, my gosh!

347
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,720
They're so adorable!

348
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,550
Women are so...

349
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,160
Just stop right there.

350
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,840
Look for my piggie bank!

351
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,290
Hey, take mine! I'll give you mine!

352
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,730
Your father is opposing your relationship?

353
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,050
I don't think he's in a place to oppose you guys.

354
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,160
For you, Choi Chang.

355
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,870
That's why I left home.

356
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,600
My hyungnim is quite worried for his son.

357
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,120
But still, that's wrong.

358
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,580
That Oh Bo Mi is truly a crazy nut, but

359
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,510
it's not like you're getting married. You're only starting out. She doesn't deserve his opposition.

360
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,990
In this day and age, it's hard to find someone who's as genuine as she is.

361
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,140
She's a crazy one, so she doesn't compromise with anyone.

362
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,420
I know. That's why I put my life on the line for Bo Mi.

363
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,200
It looks like Kang San Hyeok put his life on the line as well.

364
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,060
That's a bird, right?

365
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,930
It's a unique sound.

366
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,370
A goblin bird.

367
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,130
Do you know goblin bird? It lives only in the deep mountains.

368
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,900
You can find everything on the internet these days.

369
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,230
I've heard of it when I was very interested in birds.

370
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:32,480
That's not the bird's real name though. We call it that only in this neighborhood.

371
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,060
Only in this neighborhood?

372
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,890
Yes. When that bird cries, a goblin fire starts to appear far over there in that mountain

373
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,050
and that's why the townspeople started calling it a goblin bird.

374
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,560
It's been a while since I've seen the goblin fire.

375
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,610
When I was little, my father said I should never go outside when the goblin fire appears.

376
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,090
He used to tuck me in under the blanket.

377
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,490
A goblin fire...

378
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,400
- What's that, Dr. Park?
- Huh?

379
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,510
Oh, nothing. I was just bored.

380
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,090
I have a friend who works at a soil pollution research institute. I want to have him take a look at it.

381
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,670
I'm curious to find out why the fatal level of arsenic was found in the soil in this deep mountain.

382
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,420
Better than not doing anything.

383
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,560
But why do your eyes look so serious?

384
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,120
I always had twinkling eyes. Didn't you know? Crystal-like eyes?

385
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,990
My nickname is Crystal Park.

386
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,290
♫ Twinkle, twinkle, Crystal Park ♫

387
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,280
♫ How I wonder what you are ♫

388
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,290
Team Leader.

389
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,220
I'm very sorry.

390
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,220
It was clearly my mistake that the hoist wasn't put away.

391
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,700
You were in great danger because of me.

392
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,540
Don't worry about it. Fortunately, nothing happened.

393
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,110
I think I'm an alcoholic.

394
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,410
An alcoholic?

395
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,720
I was telling the truth that I couldn't remember what you said.

396
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,310
I blacked out since I drink every day.

397
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,060
I'm ashamed, but this is who I am right now.

398
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,290
I think I need treatment now.

399
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:00,340
A long time ago, I witnessed my best friend...

400
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,220
die scorched in fire all over his body.

401
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,400
I couldn't do anything but to watch him. And I only survived.

402
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,320
You know what?

403
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,740
In the past ten years, there were 51 firemen who died on duty.

404
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,930
But 78 firemen committed suicide.

405
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:26,180
Why is it that there are more suicides in this line of work than accidental deaths...

406
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:37,720
Why is it that I can never forget a gruesome scene no matter how much time passes?

407
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:45,590
No matter how much I drink, why is it that my memory becomes clearer rather than fading away?

408
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,460
Team Leader...

409
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:58,070
I think I really need to leave the rescue team now.

410
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,390
With my blackouts and poor judgment,

411
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,090
I shouldn't put my team members in grave danger.

412
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,920
That can't be.

413
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,000
Did you eat the whole thing?

414
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,070
Since Team Leader isn't here.

415
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,740
- You alone?
- One chicken a day.

416
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,020
When will you quit the rescue team?

417
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,580
Everything has been wrapped up. Why do you still go to work there?

418
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,990
Geez...

419
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,690
That's wrong. As if...

420
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,780
Team Leader. I thought you were not coming into work today. Why are you here?

421
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,800
I know you guys would mess up big time without me. How could I afford to take a day off?

422
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,220
See? I was wondering and sure enough.

423
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,660
- Geez, I'm only drinking this.
- A cup of coffee.

424
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,130
Our team leader even showed up. Whoa, it's nice and relaxing. First time in a while.

425
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,670
Why?

426
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,870
Oh, no. No, I take that back. I take it back.

427
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,280
What are you doing?

428
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,630
So, Hyung, within our team, this is like...

429
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,660
Dispatch! Gas leak emergency! Please dispatch immediately.

430
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,650
Geez, that Chang!

431
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,290
Really.

432
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,280
Dispatch Alert Button

433
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,260
Over here, here!

434
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,840
Over there!

435
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,570
If we don't hurry, the child is in danger!

436
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,990
We can't enter through the door. We'll go through the window.

437
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,650
47.
47: It means, "I got it."

438
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,890
You can do it, right?

439
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,640
Be careful.

440
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,330
The golden hour for gas leak.

441
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,120
The golden hour for gas leak is running out!

442
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,270
Emergency rescue! Emergency rescue!

443
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,930
♬ Mountain rabbit, rabbit ♬

444
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,920
♬ Where do you think you're going? ♬

445
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,970
♬ Hop, hop, hopping away ♬

446
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,320
♬ Where do you think you're going? ♬

447
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,010
Episode 26 will air soon.
