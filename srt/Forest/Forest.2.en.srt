00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,090
Episode 2

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,970
Dr. Jeong, thanks for the coffee.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,530
Yes?

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,400
It looks delicious.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,950
Thank you for the coffee.

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,470
What is it?

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,300
There is a coffee shop I frequent near here.

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,310
I brought a variety of special coffees that are not available elsewhere.

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,370
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,560
It was due to an unforeseeable circumstance,

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,760
but I did learn that I owe you coffee.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,070
I'm repaying my debt.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,250
But why so much?

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,460
- I have a favor to ask.
- Oh.

15
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,720
Take the coffee back and don't even think about it.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,800
What? You didn't even hear what it is.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,880
I said take it back.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm not going to give you my number. I can't get any work done around here.

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,070
What now? You are quite obsessive.

20
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,770
I will make sure to ask for your number in my next life.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,810
So show me one more time, egotistic Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae.

22
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,170
What did I do with the coffee that day?

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,000
Pardon?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,030
As you know, I don't remember because of the shot.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,950
I was standing next to the window with a coffee and what did I do?

26
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,790
That's... so...

27
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,010
The sun.

28
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,000
Like this, in the coffee,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,530
you were collecting the rays of the sun that passed through the tree branches.

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,010
Then you drank it.

31
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,340
Tree branches? Sun?

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,640
Isn't that how you normally drank your coffee?

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,990
It's quite a clear and unique behavior for something you did subconsciously.

34
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,180
How was my expression? Was I happy?

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,110
Or was I sad?

36
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,610
You were like a child.

37
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,800
A child that was smiling happily.

38
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,380
Thank you. Then ...

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,560
I spent exactly 795,000 won more than I was indebted to you,

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,840
but I will remember your kindness.

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,350
Although we may never meet again.

42
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,410
Ah yes! Director Han!

43
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,040
I found out what Director Han is working on.

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,750
Naseong Development (Miryeong Forest)
Redline Invesment Director 2 Han Ji Yong

45
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,950
Contents
1. Business Overview; 2. Business Long Term...

46
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,270
1. Business overview. Miryeong forest which will optimizes the natural and human environment for tourism

47
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,900
Naseong Development? Miryeong Forest?

48
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,440
Naseong Development is a small hole in the wall company

49
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,260
and they own a large forest in the Miryeong mountains of Gangwon-do.

50
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,800
So you're saying Director Han is trying to buy Naseong Development?

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,280
Because of this undeveloped land that has never been seen on any anticipated development site list?

52
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,530
And he is going to buy it at 100 billion won when it is worth no more than 30 billion won.

53
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,630
This is what he submitted for approval to the CEO.

54
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,600
Land worth 30 billion won for 100 billion won.

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,970
It must be one or the other,

56
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,430
they are hiding that it is worth 100 billion won or there is another potential buyer who hiked the price up.

57
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,630
You psychic.

58
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,130
I think there is another potential buyer and they are in the heavyweight rank.

59
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,080
I believe Taeseong is meddling in this.

60
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,130
Taeseong?

61
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,630
- The Taeseong Group?
- Yes.

62
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,710
The Taeseong Group that everyone in Korea is familiar with.

63
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,160
The Taeseong Group name is being brought up in the Naseong Development acquisition.

64
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,780
I'm not sure what it is,

65
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,060
but Taeseong Group is behind the price of the land going up from 30 billion won to 100 billion won.

66
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,000
A hole in the wall company and Taeseong...

67
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,920
I'll have the same.

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,260
They may have a lot of money, but they aren't gentlemen.

69
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,040
Hwang Tae Ha and Taeseong Group's Managing Director Kwon Joo Han are at your one o'clock.

70
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,920
Where are you going? You haven't finished your meal.

71
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,590
I haven't eaten at all today!

72
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,240
So rude!

73
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,430
If it is true that the clever and result-driven Kwon Joo Han is in the game,

74
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,730
then I'm positive the forest is worth a fortune.

75
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,540
Find out what Taeseong Group has to do with the Miryeong forest and report it to me.

76
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,790
What is it?

77
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,990
Are you the owner of the black SUV at the end of the road?

78
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,290
Yes, I am. And?

79
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,490
The rescue team vehicle is unable to enter because of your car.

80
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,210
Please move your car.

81
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,460
Why are you touching my camera when you need me to move my car?

82
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,310
The 119 special rescue team is undergoing training.

83
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,030
You cannot take pictures here, so please exit the premises.

84
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,950
You must not understand the situation.

85
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,140
You just rudely and unlawfully put your hands on my camera.

86
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,280
You absurdly laughed at the situation,

87
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,140
and your one-month pay is going down the drain.

88
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,330
It's only fair that you sincerely apologize in this situation.

89
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,890
Oh, my. My apologies.

90
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,330
I only wear shoes worth two months of my pay, so I didn't recognize your one-month's pay shoes.

91
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,730
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,770
The owner of the black SUV with license plate 2205,

93
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,100
please move your vehicle.

94
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,460
Special rescue team?

95
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,260
Park Hyeong Sik, are you awake?

96
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,640
How about Seong Bin?

97
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,930
My Seong Bin...

98
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,800
is he dead?

99
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,280
The surgery was a success. He just needs time to recover.

100
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,940
He will recover and there is no problem.

101
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,890
Your child is okay, so just focus on your own recovery.

102
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,840
You must get better for your child to get better.

103
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,770
You shouldn't move. Lay down.

104
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,080
- Don't move.
- Lay down.

105
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,730
Park Hyeong Sik!

106
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,570
Park Hyeong Sik! Park Hyeong Sik!

107
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,520
You can't do this!

108
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,860
- Park Hyeong Sik! Park Hyeong Sik!
- Let go!

109
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,940
Seong Bin? I'm sorry for being a terrible father.

110
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,330
I love you, my son.

111
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,310
I'm sorry, my son.

112
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,960
Park Hyeong Sik!

113
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,490
- Park Hyeong Sik! Let go!
- Get off of me!

114
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,610
This is the only thing I can do for my child!

115
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,850
The life my kid will live,

116
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,110
you guys have no clue!

117
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,690
What happens when you take one wrong step in this crazy world,

118
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,900
you guys have no clue.

119
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,850
Don't forgive me.

120
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,990
Tae Soo, don't forgive me!

121
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,150
Don't forgive me, Tae Soo!

122
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,430
Park Hyeong Sik, let go!

123
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,930
Let go!

124
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,830
Don't forgive me!

125
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,720
Don't forgive me!

126
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,210
Don't forgive me!

127
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,880
Let go, Park Hyeong Sik!

128
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,940
Who are you to tell him to die?

129
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,560
Who do you think you are?!

130
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,230
Stand back!

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,910
I'm here, Soon Hae.

132
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,080
I thought you would miss this handsome face.

133
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,920
I'm not sure what it is, but I'm not curious.

134
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,080
If you didn't tell me, then I must not need to know.

135
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,870
I will no longer be curious.

136
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,050
You're as beautiful as ever, my Soon Hae.

137
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,710
You're beautiful.

138
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,420
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae.

139
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,430
Why did you use DC cardioversion at that moment?

140
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,630
The child already had ventricular tachycardia and his heart rate was over 100bpm.

141
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,990
I understand the situation, but if the location patient Park Hyeong Sik was shocked was a centimeter off

142
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,660
he may have died or gone into a coma. It was a dangerous situation.

143
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,900
The police have determined that it was an emergency situation

144
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,010
and closed the investigation.

145
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,410
I think it is for the best that we close this case here.

146
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,340
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae, how long has it been since you've been taking medication for your panic disorder?

147
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,720
For over ten years.

148
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,250
For ten years...

149
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,240
This will be my last question.

150
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,540
Do you stand behind your decision to use DC cardioversion on patient Park Hyeong Sik?

151
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,870
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae?

152
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,130
I do not stand behind my decision.

153
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,200
I was unable to control my emotions.

154
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,590
I was furious that the parent believed he had the right to end the child's life.

155
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,790
A doctor's personal feelings were applied in an emergency situation.

156
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:46,190
It was negligence and excessive force.

157
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,660
Director!

158
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,980
Hurry!

159
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,390
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae

160
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,450
Wait a moment.

161
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,810
Hello.

162
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,430
What is wrong with your voice? Is something wrong?

163
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,310
No, just because. Is your presentation over?

164
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,720
Everyone else is finished, but I still have a meeting with my presentation group.

165
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,390
I won't be finished until tonight.

166
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,880
Who is it?

167
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,380
Who is it?

168
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,280
Yeong Jae.

169
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,250
Award of Merit

170
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,460
In Appreciation

171
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,220
Why haven't you eaten yet, do you know what time it is?

172
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,280
Whatever. Change the front lock to a keypad lock.

173
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,360
I can't find the spare key under the planter.

174
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,150
It isn't there?

175
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,230
Did I leave it in the umbrella?

176
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,820
You're such an ajumma. You are forgetful and nag just like an ajumma.

177
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,530
Go ahead and eat.

178
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,890
You know my cooking skills is that of an ajumma, right?

179
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,690
Why? Is something wrong?

180
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,790
You said you don't like coming home because it reminds you of your mom. What is going on?

181
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,370
Your athlete's foot can't be handled by just anyone.

182
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,530
I came because I was scared.

183
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,210
But I don't think I can come home anymore.

184
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,190
I was fired.

185
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,550
Mom died because of me.

186
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,110
She wanted to support her kids and worked as a caregiver and maid even after cancer surgery.

187
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,550
She died from overworking herself.

188
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,330
How can I get fired? I'm such an idiot.

189
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,910
Yeong Jae.

190
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:28,620
Mom and dad, we've never seen a child as cool as you.

191
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,640
Not because you were smart and got into medical school. You were truly a special child.

192
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,190
Your laughter, cries, and the way you walked.

193
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,400
Everything was beautiful.

194
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,690
Both your mom and I could do anything for you.

195
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,890
That is the kind of child you were.

196
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,010
Just looking at you gave us the will to live.

197
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,480
That is how beautiful you are.

198
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,590
Your mom held the happiness you gave her close to her heart when she left this world.

199
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,930
So, don't say such harsh things for the sake of your mom.

200
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,340
Hospital? Just forget about it.

201
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,160
How can they look after patients when they don't have a keen eye for spotting a good person.

202
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,750
I won't send you to such a place. I refuse!

203
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,650
I won't allow you to be a doctor at such a shitty hospital.

204
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,530
Ah, it's hot!

205
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,440
Is it hot?

206
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,990
- It's hot?
- It's hot!

207
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,830
Cold water. Drink cold water.

208
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,100
Drink up.

209
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,030
It's hot water!

210
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,710
Oh, really?

211
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,720
Dad.

212
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,910
It's okay.

213
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,450
Mom.

214
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,720
We've come to an agreement to send you to another branch.

215
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,380
Clear your mind while you're there. The terms are that you overcome your panic disorder.

216
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,470
So rest up. Okay?

217
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,500
It's nice to meet you, Director.

218
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,290
I'm surgeon Jeong Yeong Jae.

219
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,580
I've heard a lot about you.

220
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,190
How did a skillful surgeon like you end up here?

221
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,630
There are not many opportunities to go into the operation room when you're dispatched to a place like this.

222
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,630
Pardon? Dispatched?

223
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,930
Did you not know that you're going be dispatched to Miryeong countryside?

224
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,620
They must not have told you in case you tried to run away.

225
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,200
Miryeong?

226
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
Geochang Logistics President, Choi Seong Sik, charged for attempted murder

227
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,350
Is President Choi Seong Sik out of his mind?

228
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,930
How can he do such a thing?

229
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,750
You're so noisy.

230
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,270
- What happened with Taeseong Group?
- Is work important right now?

231
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,470
You're lucky it was just a fracture. Imagine what could have happened if the police arrived later.

232
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,820
Work is important. It's a problem that you don't understand this.

233
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,820
Why is Taeseong showing interest in this piece of land in the mountains?

234
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,660
What? Did you already survey the Miryeong forest?

235
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,240
The view must be nice. I hear they are building a resort.

236
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,890
Resort?

237
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:37,070
They say Taeseong Group was looking to take over Naseong Development because of the resort land.

238
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,810
They say it is the biggest project in Asia.

239
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,660
And Director Han found out about this and tried to intercept it?

240
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,630
Yes. Taeseong Group and Director Han got into a bidding war to obtain this land,

241
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,900
and the 30 billion price skyrocketed to nearly 100 billion won.

242
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,300
Neither side gave up,

243
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,230
so Naseong Development held out in order to raise the price.

244
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,630
What about Taeseong Group? Will they continue to raise their bid?

245
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:06,430
Seeing that they haven't backed out, I think they're still trying to figure out if they should pursue this further.

246
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,990
Of course, that's the case. It looks like the price will continue to rise.

247
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,520
Director Han is such a sly fox.

248
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,370
How did he even find this deal?

249
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,670
Wait a moment.

250
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,060
W-wait a moment.

251
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,880
Wait!

252
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,890
Ahjussi, where are you going?

253
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,610
My car broke down. You just need to walk a little further.

254
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,730
Ahjussi, ahjussi!

255
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,840
Where am I?

256
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,390
Why did the car have to break down?

257
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,120
He said it was straight ahead. Where is it?

258
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,540
I must have lost my mind.

259
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,660
I should have fought back that I did nothing wrong.

260
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,710
Such an idiot! Oh, my!

261
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,240
Mom. Mom. Mom!

262
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,280
Mom!

263
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:06,500
♬ The dizzying circumstances in front of me ♬
♬ All the different stories ♬

264
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,480
♬ I listen ♬

265
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,360
What do you want?

266
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,160
What do you want?

267
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,490
♬ I come closer to you ♬

268
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,030
♬ The hope I see far away ♬

269
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,630
♬ There are no sweet words of encouragement ♬

270
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,090
♬ They are scattered apart ♬

271
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,900
♬ They are fading away ♬

272
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,310
♬ My feelings, my loneliness, my silence, depression ♬

273
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,750
♬ Are filled in my heart ♬

274
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,380
♬ Even if I struggle to get closer ♬

275
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,760
Forest Preview

276
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,830
If somebody didn't distract me,

277
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,820
this absurd situation would not have happened.

278
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,260
Do you know anything about Miryeong Hospital?

279
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,960
I know that none of the village people go to that hospital.

280
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,950
I feel like I've been exiled.

281
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,700
If you want to develop Miryeong forest, then you must relocate the special rescue team.

282
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,840
I will relocate them.

283
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,160
There was a prohibited area here.

284
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,660
I've been there before.

285
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,720
Jeong Yeong Jae?

286
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,310
Jeong Yeong Jae, come here now!

287
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,730
Did you go to the forest?

288
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,730
Stay here.
