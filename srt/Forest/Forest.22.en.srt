00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,770
Episode 22

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,710
Wow. Really.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,560
These guys are being so recklessly ignorant.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,760
How could they possibly think to take down a wall in broad daylight?

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,380
How did they know that the files were here and not at RLI?

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,310
All the agreements and proxies we collected were all in the safe. What do we do now?

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,930
There's no time for us to go around collecting them all again until the shareholders' meeting.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,770
How about the proxies we could collect from the shareholders before the meeting?

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,170
It's a bit dangerous.

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,740
I'm sure Kwon Joo Han will accumulate all the shares from his supporters.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,560
There's a chance we might lose.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,260
- You--
- What?

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,780
Your eyes are all over the place. Fess up.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,460
Why do you look as if you're the only one who's excited in this world?

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,900
It's because I live in the mountains.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,830
Haven't you ever heard of phytoncide? I can't help it if my face is glowing.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,240
- Is it my fault that I'm at my peak?
- Aigoo...

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,550
Why get all serious? By chance, are you and Kang San Hyeok...

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,880
- You did. Sure did.
- Hey!

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,140
What would you know? You are crazy, crazy!

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,390
Geez, you are crazy.

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,230
You're all giddy. Crazy. Hey...

23
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,790
How will you come back to Seoul when you're so in love?

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,480
What about your Kang San Hyeok?

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,520
You talking about me coming to Seoul?

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,870
What else could it be? Why else would the director want to see you out of the blue?

27
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,530
Hello, Hospital Director. Its been a while since I have seen you.

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,080
I was waiting for you. Please sit.

29
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,860
He helps us out with our hospital's medical services.

30
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,130
He's Director Jo Kwang Pil of the Deokin Foundation.

31
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,430
It's nice to meet you, Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae. I've wanted to meet you.

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,210
Thank you.

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,800
But why me?

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,860
You know how you submitted a proposal on the special rescue trauma center last time?

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,430
The director reviewed that proposal and would like to discuss it with you.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,870
Trauma Center?

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,130
Our foundation has been sponsoring medically neglected regions and hazardous occupations for a long time.

38
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:30,700
When I reviewed your proposal, I realized that the special rescue team can use our foundation's support.

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,220
If that is possible, it would be very meaningful. I hope it does happen.

40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,360
Yes, so I think we would need to discuss the specifics.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,720
I will summarize the strategies and schedules and contact you.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,000
Can I have your phone number?

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,790
Sure.

44
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,520
Then, I will see you again, Doctor Jeong.

45
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,810
I guess you are really busy since you won't pick up my calls.

46
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,950
What is this?

47
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,670
A hole that was dug so deep completely disappeared the next day.

48
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,420
Isn't this extremely suspicious?

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,730
Please leave that over there.

50
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,190
How is the mountain fire incident investigation going?

51
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,360
Did we not call you? It was concluded as an accident.

52
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,020
Please leave if you're done.

53
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,450
You just closed the case like that?

54
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,010
An unregistered vehicle, they ran away without getting captured on CCTV,

55
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,090
and a huge explosion and white smoke? There are so many suspicious aspects to this. How could you just let that go?

56
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,290
Why did you conclude that it was an accident? The possibility of arson is higher.

57
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,490
90% of mountain fires are caused by accident.

58
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,980
Only 1% of them are arson. How much time should I waste on an accidental fire by hikers?

59
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,330
Even with a 1% chance, shouldn't you investigate further if there is a possibility of arson?

60
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,610
Whether it's accidental or arson, it's tough to make an arrest even with a CCTV capture.

61
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,130
But these people didn't leave anything behind.

62
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,460
Arresting hikers who caused the fire by asking around is pretty much impossible.

63
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,320
I think highly of your enthusiasm. Take it easy.

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,380
I'll refuse your opinion about my enthusiasm.

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,130
Please put that energy toward finding the arsonists. Don't worry about me.

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,310
Hello.

67
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,510
Looking for witness: Anyone who witnessed three men in a gray SUV around the Miryeong forest fire on June 3.

68
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,860
Hello.

69
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,060
Have you seen this car?

70
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm from the county office.

71
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,500
Have you seen this car?

72
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,820
About this height and average build. Two men.

73
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,790
Miryeong Fashion Outlet

74
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,660
Hiking gear?

75
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,570
Did you see two men in this car?

76
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,680
Both of them are average in height and slender in build.

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,700
Maybe, I don't know.

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,820
If, by any chance, you remember anything, please call here.

79
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,340
Could it be those people?

80
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,280
Was it that day when the forest fire happened?

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,990
Yeah, it was that day of the forest fire?

82
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,950
Two men came in and they were in a rush. They picked out some things, paid for them, and left right away.

83
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,500
It's weird. They didn't even try them on.

84
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,950
Anything else? How did they look? Anything else you remember?

85
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,600
The way they spoke.

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,210
They spoke like the Yanbian people. (Yanbian is a Chinese prefecture where ethnic Koreans live)

87
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,580
Yanbian?

88
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,970
Really?

89
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,420
You are amazing. I admitted it, my Enforcement Officer.

90
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,720
Perhaps that's why we couldn't find any clues.

91
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,830
They weren't locals but foreigners.

92
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,100
That could be. There are only elderlies around here. So, there are some foreigners who come to work here.

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,470
Like in farms.

94
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,400
To work? By chance, are there any at Miryeong Forestry?

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,920
I think I've seen some when logging.

96
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,350
If foreigners indeed did that, why would they have started the fire?

97
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,430
And how could the foreigners have avoided the CCTVs?

98
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,870
It's okay to be suspicious, but you can't jump to the conclusion and set it up.

99
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,690
If you already set it up, you solve the mystery to fit the setup. No one is innocent then.

100
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,870
It'll be okay but it's still a bad feeling.

101
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,890
Follow me. There is something I want to show you.

102
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,840
Where are we going?

103
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,620
Be careful.

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,570
Are you okay?

105
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,430
We are here.

106
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,560
Wow, it's so big.

107
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,650
What is that?

108
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,730
It's a chipmunk.

109
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,880
Oh my gosh!

110
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,920
When I was young, there were hardships at home.

111
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,050
My father cut down trees to raise me without a mom.

112
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,420
When I was about 14 years old,

113
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,330
It rained a lot that year, so there were many days he couldn't cut down trees.

114
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,650
And we didn't have any food some days.

115
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,810
And Father made me this and went out hunting for pheasants and deer.

116
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,760
Then he'd grill the meat and feed me.

117
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,220
And he'd dry the rest of the meat and give it to me later.

118
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,240
Father said he had already eaten out, but I knew he was starving.

119
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,260
His stomach was growling so loudly.

120
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,890
My father didn't do everything strictly by the book.

121
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,390
He did entertain his customers and even bribed some.

122
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,230
He did use some tricks here and there, but he's not as bad as you think he is.

123
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,320
He's extremely stingy. But if he knows a neighbor is struggling badly,

124
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,300
he drops off rice and meat in their front yard.

125
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,920
I know what you saying.

126
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,050
If I, by any chance,

127
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:44,260
if I've jumped to conclusions about your father, I'll re-evaluate.

128
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,800
But can you promise me something?

129
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,220
Don't jump to a conclusion that, "My father would never do that."

130
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,790
To think everything based on facts.

131
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,760
I promise.

132
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,250
Can I try and blow it?

133
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,960
Here.

134
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,790
The bird, bird!

135
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,340
A chipmunk?

136
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,930
Excuse me? Choi Jeong Mok knows Jo Kwang Pil?

137
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,780
I brought up Jo Kwang Pil with Choi Jeong Mok, but he didn't deny knowing him.

138
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,660
That means Jo Kwang Pil was in charge of Miryeong Development project

139
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,010
and Taesung High Tech's money flowed into his company.

140
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,270
Tell Chairman Hwang to request to review Taesung High Tech's ledger.

141
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,660
As the largest shareholder.

142
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,290
Did you think that

143
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,230
I'd live as your hunting dog all my life?

144
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,630
Wait til I put this gold badge on.

145
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,330
What? "Logger Mr. Choi?"

146
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm home, Father.

147
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,780
What the heck is that? It's lousy.

148
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,310
Lousy? It's a national assembly badge.

149
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:40,510
That's what I'm saying. Why do you have a fake one? Where's your pride?

150
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,870
What would you do if I put on the real thing, not a fake?

151
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,550
What's with you now? Let's not do this, Hyungnim.

152
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,630
Even if I'm your son, no means no for sure, Hyungnim.

153
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,010
Punk, you just wait and see.

154
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,770
Choi Chang's father, Choi Jeong Mok. See if I'll put on the real gold badge or not.

155
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,810
Wait and see.

156
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,990
So, why don't you give me an answer about that blind date?

157
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,480
I heard she's a nice young lady who studied abroad.

158
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,890
Again? Acting like an old geezer again.

159
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:19,940
- Please don't try to match me up with just anyone. I have a very clear and defined taste in women.
- Hey.

160
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,260
You can say that only if you've even brought one lady home. Aigoo.

161
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,670
You know that Officer Oh at the county office?

162
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,810
I'm fine as long as it's not a nut like her. So, just bring anyone home, man.

163
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,980
That idiot. What a half-wit.

164
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,480
Wait a minute. There's no way he's into men...

165
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,690
That a**hole. Seriously.

166
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,790
Jeong Yeong Jae, let's eat dinner.

167
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,120
She's not home yet?

168
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,080
What should I eat?

169
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,470
No wonder she's always sick.

170
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,580
What are you doing right now?

171
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,090
Hi, you're here.

172
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,540
Why are you throwing them out? They didn't expire yet.

173
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,410
You ate these long enough. I won't feed you these things anymore.

174
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,030
But what would I do if you throw all these out?

175
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,420
I'll fill up your fridge again.

176
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,260
Let's go.

177
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,050
My gosh!

178
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,470
What? I love this.

179
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,270
No!

180
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,270
That tofu.

181
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,850
Let's go.

182
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,290
W-wait a m-minute. Ugh, seriously.

183
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,070
Oh, we forgot about meat.

184
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,900
Mmm, today let's-

185
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,010
Honey!

186
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,200
Yes, honey.

187
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,220
I want to drink strawberry milk.

188
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,290
- My honey wants to drink strawberry milk?
- Yes.

189
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,840
Here is some strawberry milk.

190
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,640
Honey. I want tenderloin, sirloin, chuck, and neck meat.

191
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,070
Gosh, just get me a whole cow.

192
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,080
Honey, this is so heavy. My arm feels like it'll break.

193
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,720
Gosh.

194
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,470
Why did my sweetheart carry such a heavy thing?

195
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:49,060
Let's go. I can never allow my sweetheart's arm to break.

196
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,680
Oh, Honey, I just love you.

197
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,510
Oh, it's been a while.

198
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,030
Should I eat some traditional candy?

199
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,070
Wow.

200
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,180
It's so good.

201
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,520
What is this? We aren't kids and we are buying this?

202
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,040
Such a greedy hand. I can't even eat it.

203
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,260
How can you eat these sweets before the meal?

204
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,720
Your teeth will rot.

205
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,450
Oh, come one. We are supposed to eat this together.

206
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,070
You're such a nagging mom.

207
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,870
When I was in kindergarten,

208
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:59,390
I wouldn't eat real food but hang out at this toffee store. And my mom caught me and...

209
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,240
Well, not my mom.

210
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,630
I already knew.

211
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,430
Jeong Yeong Jae loves me like crazy.

212
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,710
From now on, call me Kang Toffee.

213
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,550
Do you think you can compete with this toffee?

214
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,280
You are going to lose your combat power against sweetness.

215
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,180
I guess you don't know. I can be sweet, you know.

216
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,290
I can be so sweet that you'd say, "Please give me some salt."

217
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,280
- You'll beg me like that.
- Gosh!

218
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,730
What are you saying? You wouldn't know what amazing is.

219
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,190
Just wait and see if I know it or not.

220
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,300
But, wait, what did you do at the hospital today? I'm curious.

221
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,080
I wonder what Jeong kiddo does when I'm not around.

222
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,060
Well, you know.

223
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,020
I couldn't go last time...

224
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,540
Don't go there. You like Cha Jin Woo that much?

225
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,510
Well, you know. There was something I needed to sort out at the hospital.

226
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,190
That's why. What exactly did you have to do at the hospital?

227
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,770
Anything interesting or special happen?

228
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,460
There wasn't any. You know it was Miryeong Hospital stuff.

229
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,070
Are you okay?

230
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,210
Yes, I'm okay.

231
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,540
I was just startled.

232
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,660
Team Leader?

233
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,210
It's okay.

234
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,410
Did you drink alcohol?

235
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,500
You seem like alcohol, though.

236
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,220
What?

237
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,520
Did you drink yesterday? You do smell a bit.

238
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,370
Team Leader, your condition doesn't seem well so I'll take care of it.

239
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,250
We'll work on the report and submit it to the admistrative office.

240
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,770
The report? What report?

241
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,450
We have to write it up by today and turn it in.

242
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,900
About the assemblyman's visit last time and the helicopter patrol report.

243
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,490
Why would we write up a report like that?

244
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,690
Are helicopters there for assemblymen to use?

245
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,130
Whether it's training or dispatch, we should use it for saving people.

246
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,200
What the heck are we doing?

247
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,560
Yes, yes. Of course, of course.

248
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,210
They're wasting our valuable time and money for their own promotion.

249
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,210
With that money, we could be replacing all our equipment with safer ones. Dang it.

250
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,720
Just because their lives aren't on the line. Our lives aren't valuable at all?

251
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,650
It doesn't matter if we all die?

252
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,400
- Of course not. Our lives are valuable. Of course, they are.
- Geez!

253
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,110
This darn uniform.

254
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,120
He's really strange these days.

255
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,660
He would never budge to alcohol, but he's out because he's drunk.

256
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,840
And why the attitude?

257
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,270
It's the season again.

258
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,690
- The season?
- The anniversary of construction.

259
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,240
So, why does the Team Leader become irritated around the anniversary?

260
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,230
Is it related to the establishment of the Miryeong Rescue Team?

261
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,030
I don't know for sure, but this rescue team was made because of the Miryeong mountain fires.

262
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,180
I heard that the team leader's friend passed away.

263
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,590
Miryeong Forest Fire?

264
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,220
I heard that it was because he went out on a rescue mission with our team leader.

265
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,260
Still, it's been so long.

266
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,520
I don't understand why he's like this every time.

267
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,700
Why did you become a rescuer?

268
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
It's a civil servant job.

269
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,220
It's not just a civil servant job.

270
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,180
It's risking your life. You're speaking as if you have no emotions.

271
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,120
Why are you like this? What good are having emotions?

272
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,250
Do you want to go into pain mode like the team leader who can't forget the past?

273
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,180
Or to become like his friend, who fell into the fire

274
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,670
trying to rescue the villagers in vain? He saw that happen.

275
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:45,920
I think we can only do this for a long time when we look at our bank accounts.

276
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,280
Hyung, can I ask you something?

277
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,060
No, you can't.

278
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,910
Good morning, nurse!

279
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,630
Oh! This arrived for you when you were away in Seoul yesterday.

280
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,090
Water Quality Analysis Results

281
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,730
Dangerous level of arsenic?

282
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,000
It came out all normal last time. How could this be...

283
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,070
Arsenic level: 0.6mg (Dangerous)

284
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,260
If it's 0.6 mg per liter, then it's fatal.

285
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,430
The townspeople have been drinking this?

286
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,490
Good morning. Ready and set. I'm ready.

287
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,030
Doctor, didn't you say you had a test kit for measuring metal content?

288
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,640
What test kit for metal?

289
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,590
Was it two years ago?

290
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,890
You know how you plagiarized an international research paper on metal content for the conference and got dropped when the hospital director found out?

291
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,410
Didn't you say you had a do it yourself test kit then?

292
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,550
Did you have to say that in front of her? I don't know. I never used it myself.

293
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,520
There is such a kit though. For different varieties of metals.

294
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,530
Yes, it's urgent.

295
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,390
Can I come by in person to purchase it?

296
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,940
Expense Reports

297
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,490
Expense Reports, Tax Records

298
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,650
Financial Statements, Copies of Bankbooks

299
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,090
2016-2017 Taesung High Tech Financial Audit Report

300
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,090
Team Leader, look at this.

301
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,790
Deokin Foundation: 482,010 won

302
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,430
2016-2017 Taesung High Tech Financial Audit Report

303
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,560
We found a trace of Jo Kwang Pil inside Taesung High Tech.

304
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,250
Kwon Joo Han will be paying for the most expensive wall repair.

305
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,850
How about the thing I asked you to find out?

306
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,530
Yes, sir.

307
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,450
In 1994 when the rescue team was formed, Kwon Joo Han set his foot into the company as a director.

308
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,210
At the time, there was a lot of talk about him taking over or how unqualified he was.

309
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,560
I think there was tremendous pressure for him to show results quickly.

310
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,090
He was in charge of a huge project soon after he started working.

311
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,460
What? Taesung had tried to develop a resort back in 1994?

312
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,970
Yes. The development fell through due to the Miryeong forest fire.
Rendering of Miryeong Forest Resort 1994

313
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,190
This rendering is the only record we have of it, but I'm sure.

314
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:03,320
I believe establishing a rescue team was a strategy to gain the support of the village residents.

315
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,690
If they were trying to gain the support of the villagers, they should've donated the money before the fire.

316
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,250
Why would they donate when the development fell through after the fire?

317
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,030
Well. They were probably looking into the future, no?

318
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,770
In the end, Taesung jumped into the project once again.

319
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,710
He started a resort project to produce a quick result,

320
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,130
then donated a fortune looking into the future?

321
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,950
It doesn't make sense. There's no way Kwon Joo Han would've done that.

322
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,850
Why are you here at this hour?

323
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,650
Aren't you going home?

324
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,060
Go ahead. I have something to do.

325
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,170
Anyway, why all the fuss? What's with working late?

326
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,890
Please go home, Nurse Kim.

327
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,550
I have another one. Thunder and lightning. Gosh, I'm so scared of thunder and lightning.

328
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,210
Kang San Hyeok

329
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,400
Orange color.

330
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:05,070
My sweetie

331
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,930
Director Jo Kwang Pil?

332
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,070
My sweetie

333
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,230
Kang Toffee

334
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,870
What brings you here, Director...

335
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,620
Didn't I tell you, Dr. Jeong?

336
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,880
That I'd be seeing you again real soon.

Forest Preview

344
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,960
Will you be okay? Alone?

345
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,690
You must've been so scared. I'm so proud of you, Jeong Yeong Jae.

346
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,910
What?!

347
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,360
Hey, Oh Bo Mi! Give back my son!

348
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,670
He knows who I am, huh?

349
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,540
If you work with us, I'll give you 100 billion won and another 100 billion won as incentive.

350
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,140
What are your terms?

351
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,150
Something is strange about Miryeong village.

352
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,190
We'll have to investigate in detail.

353
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,820
You'll pay your dues for not stopping.
