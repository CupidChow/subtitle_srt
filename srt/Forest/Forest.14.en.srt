1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,290
I saw that.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,600
Good morning.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,780
Oh, you came.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,890
Episode 14

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,920
Team Leader.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,740
When on earth will I receive my official passcard?

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,870
You came?

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,630
- You came?
- Why...?

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,930
You look handsome.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,390
You came!

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,630
What is up with you all?

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,850
Did you all go for drinks in the morning, or what?

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,560
Oh my, what is that? What?

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,270
On the desk!

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,890
It looks a little familiar... what's this again?

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,690
Congratulations, Hyung.

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,270
Ah, it finally feels like he is a member of our team.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,520
Team Leader, don't you think it is too early to give a probationer a card?

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,010
How can I bear looking at this arrogant guy more?

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,850
I am not giving it to him.

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,770
The Captain is rewarding him for saving two people.

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,400
Lies. He told me to make the card.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,890
He's coming up with excuses now.

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,540
Ahem... we gotta go clean up...

25
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,740
Don't interfere.

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,030
Don't be annoying. Don't act like Kang San Hyeok.

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,690
Let's see if you're capable of that.

28
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,910
There's still a long way for me to see you as a member of my team.

29
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,540
Either way, thank you, Team Leader.

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,640
This is a serious waste of my abilities,

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,430
but I shall gladly devote my body for the Miryeong Forest.

32
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,490
Not the rescue team but Miryeong Forest?

33
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,260
Sir, I am going to the work you ordered right now?

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,970
Yes. 47.

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,310
What? 47?

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,260
No, we have to do it properly. We have to finish this properly.

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,000
47....

38
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,550
Died during transport

39
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,330
Died during transport

40
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,990
Died during transport.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,030
This, too. Death.

42
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,670
Death...

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,440
Golden time?

44
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Yes.

45
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,540
I thought the rescue team's location was a bit strange.

46
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,860
The other rescue teams are located at the center of their jurisdictions so they are able to stay within the golden time.

47
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,950
The Miryeong Rescue Team here is only close to Miryeong Village and

48
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,500
the west side of the mountain is rather far from us so the Southwest rescue team can get there faster.

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,040
Well, that is why we now share mobilization with the Southwest rescue team depending on the circumstances.

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,070
Of course, most of the time we go, but

51
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,050
in the event of a serious injury, the Southwest team will go.

52
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,700
When you say "now," does that mean that the Miryeong team used to always go in the past?

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,580
Then, if they missed the golden time

54
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,850
would there have been deaths?

55
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,410
Yeah.

56
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,170
Actually, at the start of this place's construction,

57
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,170
there were frequent deaths during rescue or transport.

58
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,030
Hey.

59
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,860
This information among insiders even is a bit hush hush, but this place's location is a little... iffy.

60
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,370
Not only the distance,

61
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,910
but there's a serious disadvantage to us air rescue paramedics, who have to move by helicopter.

62
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,020
Gust zone!

63
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,380
A gust zone?

64
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,840
The Miryeong Mountain is topographically prone to gusts of wind.

65
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,900
Our rescue team is right at the center.

66
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,270
Don't get me started. Ever since I transferred here, it's been gust and fog day after day.

67
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,080
We often have to put our lives at risk to go rescue!

68
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,500
Why do you think helicopter captains comes first on the least wanted jobs list.

69
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,050
Why do you think they would have chosen to place the rescue team here of all places, when there's such a problem?

70
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,840
Who know? Well...

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,940
Maybe because of the forest fires?

72
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
There's no rescue agency in the Miryeong district.

73
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,270
The residents didn't stop complaining about how we couldn't stop the village from burning down.

74
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,550
Yes.

75
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,040
Hey, hey. hey. Don't ever mention the Miryeong fire in front of the team leader.

76
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,270
He must have gone through a lot at the time, and he's very feisty about it.

77
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,930
Yes.

78
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,300
Yeah, I will be going that way.

79
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,160
Forest fires and gusts...

80
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,600
Is your father a land owner in Miryeong?

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,570
Not knowing now when something happens to your elderly mother,

82
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,710
wouldn't it be safer to move her to a city with a large hospital?

83
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,320
"Real Estate Contract"

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,890
We can move those who have passed away to a memorial park.

85
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,210
Should you really leave this land with great value unrealized, just because it's your family gravesite?

86
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,620
How much does it cost to care for a child!

87
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,970
Isn't that right?

88
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,400
- That's right!
- That's right.

89
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,110
What was the result?

90
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,140
I've convinced all parents in Miryeong who say they will sell their land.

91
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,800
Director, you really.

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,570
It's a lot quicker to make deals with kids who have a lot more expenses than the rural old folks..

93
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,640
If we add the villagers who already agreed on selling, I think that should do it.

94
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,700
There is only one person left.

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,140
Choi Jeong Mok!

96
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,360
That land leads to the road. If we can't obtain it,

97
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,440
we will have to divert the drive to the resort too far.

98
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,500
Get Choi Jeong Mok's land. No matter what.

99
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,710
I understand.

100
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,870
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,970
Are you in charge of the catchment too, Ms. Oh?

102
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,280
If there's ever a fire in the Miryeong forest,

103
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,900
this is where the helicopter would get the water from. Of course I've got to take care of it.

104
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,330
I'm guessing you're here to inspect the catchment.

105
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,760
Yes.

106
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,600
Give it to me.

107
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,900
I'll do it.

108
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,430
Am I having a fling with this guy?"

109
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,670
When he just looks at me, he keeps on grinning foolishly.

110
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:03,120
He took my tools, saying he would give me a hand. But where he laid his hand was only 3cm away from mine!

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,700
Congrats! on getting out of the Forever Single Club!

112
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,130
3cm for sure!

113
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,870
It's a fling! Hahahaha

114
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,730
I have given it much thought.

115
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,720
I am in trouble.

116
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,500
What?

117
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,670
Last time I was fishing,

118
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,630
You grasped my waist, when my arm was available.

119
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,960
And earlier too, you could have placed the notebook

120
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,060
on a rock, on the grass, or laid it on the sand. But you handed it to me.

121
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,700
I know the meaning of that, I understand but

122
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,620
I can't.

123
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,210
I've got to separate my private life from my professional one.

124
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,250
Wow!

125
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,130
I guess he must be really hurt.

126
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,930
Naturally, he would be hurt.

127
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,200
He is a pain in the neck.

128
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,920
Yeah, yeah, Please keep smiling that way,

129
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,070
So we can comfortably see each other.

130
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,870
In public.

131
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,540
Then, how does it seem if you separate your private life and professional one?

132
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,340
Can I hand my notebook to you, privately?

133
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,970
What?

134
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,510
His flirting skills are on another level.

135
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,200
I should be careful.

136
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,100
Our Naseong Development is planning on building a training institution.

137
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,900
We'll get you a better price than the market value, Sir.

138
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,810
Why don't you hand the mountain and factory over to us.

139
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,530
Oh my, is that so?

140
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,130
You're quite young, to be in charge of such a big business.

141
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,390
But you're not a major company,

142
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,040
why are you building such a large training center?

143
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,230
Naseong Development's already got more than enough land,

144
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,160
to build a couple of training centers. But that ain't enough for you?

145
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,440
What? Are you coming after me after you bought all that land?

146
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,260
But since I feel bad, I'll tell you something.

147
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,750
I have one flaw.

148
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,700
I have no greed for money.

149
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,060
I don't know if people are willing to sell their land for money

150
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,390
Not in my case.

151
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,960
My grandfather's burial and my parents' burial.

152
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,870
They're all lying down here in Miryeong.

153
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,750
How could I sell that for money?

154
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,100
This is all Miryeong.

155
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,000
This Miryeong forest.

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Do you know how much I have taken care of and developed it?

157
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,690
Every day, I have shed so much blood.

158
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,640
How could I exchange it for money?

159
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,720
If you were to give me the money, how much would that be?

160
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,960
Several hundred billions?

161
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,560
How much billions (of won)?

162
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,300
Just leave.

163
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,580
As for my land, no matter how much fortune you give me

164
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,910
you can't have it.

165
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,890
Well, that's it.

166
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,920
You'll have to go through my land to connect to a major highway.

167
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,070
That amazing value.

168
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,370
How would you calculate such value with money?

169
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,010
It sounds like there's an amount you desire, so if you negotiate with us in detail...

170
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,760
You don't get me at all. I'm saying that's not it.

171
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,590
Merchants can smell other merchants.

172
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,760
If you're a businessman of such a huge scale,

173
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,500
there has to be a strong smell. The blood and sweat you've shed all this time.

174
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:32,170
But since you came to me, it seems that the smell of blood is rather weak?

175
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,150
For sure. It seems you are following the orders of another person.

176
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,610
Please go.

177
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,450
What is the problem?

178
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,140
What are you doing blocking the street?

179
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,530
Oh, is that so?

180
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,720
I mean, I almost fell because the wheel was loose.

181
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,230
I will take care of it.

182
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,870
The hub is loose.

183
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,850
You are strong self-sustaining man, huh?

184
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,730
You look like you'd order people around not lifting your finger.

185
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,650
Do you think I could've come up to this position without lifting a finger?

186
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,620
In anything you do, you have to know how to do things well if you want to order others around.

187
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,740
Do you know that the majority of corporate CEOS who frequent the psychiatrist office happen to be perfectionists?

188
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,490
Thanks to their perfectionism, they were able to climb up the ladder,

189
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:33,470
but they're only happy when they do everything themselves. So, they're suffering from high stress from overworking.

190
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,660
"It's okay if I do less..."

191
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,320
I've seen a case where someone who said that to himself every morning got better very quickly.

192
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,400
I guess that person must've had someone to fall back on even if he didn't get to do things himself.

193
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,590
I--

194
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,950
I what?

195
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,750
Pass me the wrench.

196
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,430
I what??

197
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,710
I have seen a completely opposite case.

198
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,250
I have an orphan friend.

199
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,280
He was abandoned by his parents as a child

200
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,860
and said this to himself every morning looking at the mirror.

201
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,860
"I'm my protector."

202
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,080
Only I can save myself.

203
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,700
Do you know how much that friend has been able to succeed now?

204
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,580
A protector, a rescuer...

205
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,580
He can do less?

206
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,100
Of course. I'm sure you speak of fairytale-like stories since you don't know.

207
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,130
The psychology of a person who has to endure without anyone to depend on in this world...

208
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,360
How could Jeong Yeong Jae know–

209
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,380
It's about the adopted daughter from the forest.

210
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,300
I guess you know. Since you studied psychiatry for a short time.

211
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,110
Why are you riding the bicycle everywhere when you can't even fix something so simple?

212
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,090
- It's all about looking cool, huh?
- In any case...

213
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,010
You always cut down the other person.

214
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,760
I ride it because I can't drive in this narrow and rough road.

215
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,730
At first.

216
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,460
That's why I started riding the bike.

217
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,280
But.

218
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,590
On the road that felt like I was going on exile...

219
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,590
What I saw.

220
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,540
See? What

221
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,340
I won't tell you.

222
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,590
It's kind of like not wanting others to know about a truly great restaurant.

223
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,580
That's it. It's perfect now.

224
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,320
Gosh, you're such a high maintenance woman.

225
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,880
WOW!

226
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,870
I'll fix the rest of the bike and bring it back.

227
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,820
Is that so?

228
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Then I will go in and do my work.

229
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,000
The location is the truck parking lot at a highway rest stop.

230
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,250
It's a blind spot for the CCTVs, so there won't be any evidence.

231
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,820
Politicians are sensitive about bribery.

232
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,440
When you meet him, take the black box and exchange it.

233
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,550
It's a sign of trust symbolizing that you're not secretly recording them.

234
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,850
I delivered it to the partner.

235
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,620
Assemblyman Kim

236
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,090
Assemblyman Kim

237
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,520
- Let's have a drink.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,800
I have arrived, partner.

239
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,940
Sit.

240
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,940
Assemblyman Kim received scholarships from Taeseong, so he’ll definitely join hands with Director Cho.

241
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,460
We’ll change our partner. It’ll be more expensive, but he’ll be more helpful.

242
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,990
He has a bad relationship with Taeseong. They’re enemies.

243
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,330
I’m honored to work with you, Governor.

244
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,310
Nice to meet you.

245
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:58,120
Even if I release the provincial forests, if you can’t move the special rescue squad,

246
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,340
won't the development be impossible.?

247
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,300
You don't have to worry about that problem.

248
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,900
I’ve found problems that will justify a relocation. I only need your permission for the development.

249
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,410
I am sure I will be able to move the Special Rescue Team.

250
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,670
What is that?

251
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,980
Backward! Go back!

252
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,700
Bastards.

253
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,170
How did it go?

254
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,200
After you left Assemblyman Kim, he went directly to meet someone nearby.

255
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,280
The pictures our staff took, I sent them to you right now.

256
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,880
Why is he meeting with Mr. Bong?

257
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,770
Don't mention the Miryeong fire in front of Team Leader.

258
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,530
He must have gone through a lot at the time, and he's very defensive.

259
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,360
I can deal with the other areas, but the special rescue squad is a problem.

260
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,150
Memories of the Miryeong forest fire will cause a lot of opposition from the residents.

261
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,220
You must bring me a complete plan to move the base.

262
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,210
Miryeong forest fire?

263
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,230
Whatever it is, I am sure.

264
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,140
Even though he has a temper.

265
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,800
I mean, why is this in Kang Sanhyeok's belongings?

266
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,920
Why is there a stone wall here?

267
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,650
Is this where the old Miryeong village was?

268
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,040
Jeong Soon Ae

269
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,360
Kang San Hyeok!

270
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,750
Choi Jeong Mok.

271
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:07,640
Someone’s trying to buy Mount Miryeong, to build a resort.

272
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,560
It's been a while since we have met.

273
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,820
About 25 years.

274
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,280
Kang San Hyeok!

275
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,960
I have some emergency pain relief medicine. I’ll give you an injection.

276
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,740
It will be fine in a bit.

277
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,880
Don't do it. Don't give me a shot. I will endure it.

278
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,460
I’ll find out what’s causing this without falling asleep.

279
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,000
I have to do it.

280
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,580
Even if it’s phantom pain, it will be the same as the real thing!

281
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,280
You’ll feel like your arm is actually burning right now, Kang San Hyeok!

282
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,530
This is right. No one should go through this.

283
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,610
Don't do it.

284
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,170
I can endure it. I must endure it.

285
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:08,550
The boy who was abandoned by his parents when he was young, looked into the mirror every morning and said...

286
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:13,910
“I am my own guardian. Only I can save myself.”

287
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:20,950
How would you know what goes on in the mind of someone who is alone and has no one else to lean on-

288
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,230
You are wrong, Kang San Hyeok.

289
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,130
Why are you alone under the sky?

290
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,220
You know I am here.

291
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,200
Kang San Hyeok, whenever you are sick and come running, I am here, you know?

292
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:50,350
I am the girl next door who cannot let you suffer alone.

293
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,960
♬ Sometimes holding my breath, I approach closer. ♬

294
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,630
So, don't get hurt.

295
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,610
Don't endure it.

296
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,060
♬ Without a word of sweet comfort ♬

297
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,230
♬ Just scatter ♬

298
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,510
♬ and disappear. ♬

299
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,950
♬ My feelings, my loneliness, my silence ♬

300
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,470
Don't choose to suffer, Kang San Hyeok.

301
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,380
Please.

302
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,120
♬ In spite of my effort♬
Please.

303
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,540
♬ to get closer, you coldly push me away. ♬

304
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,690
Jeong Soon Ae

305
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,210
♬ Please take me now ♬

306
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,520
♬ Please take me now ♬

307
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,220
♬ Towards the light which shines on me ♬

308
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,820
♬ Please take me ♬

309
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,540
♬ Please take me now ♬

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,730
♬ The hope that is felt ♬

Forest Preview

312
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,010
I started wanting to know everything there is about Kang San Hyeok.

313
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,390
You don’t have to remain here with the rescue squad.

314
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,280
I’ll start crossing your line now, Kang San Hyeok.

315
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,480
Let’s meet for personal reasons.

316
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,640
This is my chance to ditch him.

317
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,480
Who is it?

318
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,060
It’s not your memory?

319
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,950
