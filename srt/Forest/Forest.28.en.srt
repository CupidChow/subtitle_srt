00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,850
Episode 28
How dare you show up here?

2
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,870
I'm here to investigate the arson committed by Miryeong Forestry's employees.

3
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,410
The police were here and did all the investigating. What more is there to investigate?

4
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,140
Do you think you're a cop or something?

5
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,440
It's also my job.

6
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,140
Did you really not know that those people were going to commit arson?

7
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,650
That's why I was so shocked myself.

8
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,600
I couldn't believe such evil punks were hiding in our Miryeong Forestry.

9
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,830
I was so shocked. Ever since that day,

10
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,700
I could neither eat nor sleep.

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,130
What's wrong with me?

12
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,690
President Choi!

13
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,070
Excuse me! Is anyone here?

14
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,060
Father! What's wrong?

15
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,440
What happened? Are you okay?

16
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,130
They'll observe him for a day and he can go home.

17
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,950
Thanks, Bo Mi.

18
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,500
What do you mean, thanks? I collapsed because of this Officer Oh.

19
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,690
Why did you have to get me all riled up?

20
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,420
- I couldn't just stand back and watch my future father-in-law fall into the depth of evil.
- Aigoo!

21
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,820
Who's your father-in-law?

22
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,470
Then, should I just say, "Father?" Or "Dad-in-law?"

23
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,430
Aigoo, give me a break.

24
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,760
That's nice. Dad-in-law.

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,510
So cute.

26
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,540
Go. Don't get me riled up and leave.

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,210
Do you know how much of a shock I was in?

28
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,930
My heart is still pumping fast and the back of my neck hurts. Aigoo...

29
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,540
Aigoo...

30
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,190
You're holding onto your stomach when your heart is pumping and the back of your neck hurts.

31
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,880
If you're this full, of course, you're in pain.

32
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,080
Geez, I was worried you were skimping on your meals without me. I worried for nothing.

33
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,550
This is from aging, man.

34
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,310
You're way too old then.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,160
- You're full of energy.
- Ouch!

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,960
I was actually relieved when I saw my father calling the police first.

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,660
I guess I was suspicious of my father subconsciously.

38
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,880
The father I know wouldn't do such a thing.

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,120
Is something wrong?

40
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,350
Chang, I think Miryeong Village has been contaminated.

41
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:03,500
So, how about President Choi also gets his complete medical examination?

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,160
Contaminated? No other villages are cleaner than our village.

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,330
And my father is so healthy.

44
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,940
He still lifts lumber without any problems.

45
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,290
But still. You never know.

46
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,730
I was locked up in the hospital because of that psycho.

47
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,660
Did she leave?

48
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,350
Why? You miss her already?

49
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,920
Why would I miss that psycho?

50
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,990
Father, why don't we get a complete physical since we're here?

51
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,920
Do you think that's free? Why bother with a physical?

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,490
I'll pay for it.

53
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,720
- Man, don't you know that your money is my money? Forget it.
- Geez...

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,760
Fine. I'll come back home.

55
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,950
So, let's get a physical.

56
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,170
I said I don't need it.

57
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,650
- Stop spewing nonsense.
- Come on...

58
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,650
I know you're happy. Then, we'll get a complete physical, okay?

59
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm hot. Get away from me.

60
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,190
I don't want to. Don't want to.

61
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,760
I'm hot. It's hot!

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,790
- I don't want to. Don't want to.
- I'm hot!

63
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,120
Seong Il, did you look into what I asked about?

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,420
I looked it up, but I can't view Hwang Hyeon Bok's file.

65
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,680
You can't view it? Why not?

66
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,920
I don't know. I can't view it with my ID.

67
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,670
That can't be. It's not like she's a politician or a celebrity.

68
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,130
I know. There's no reason why I can't view an ordinary citizen's file.

69
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,860
All right. Thanks.

70
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,640
Dr. Jeong, do you have the list of residents who took the heavy metal poisoning test?

71
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,500
Yes, it's at home. I took it home to organize the file.

72
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,660
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

73
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,200
Miryeong Village seems very unsettled.

74
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,290
Of course.

75
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,740
Heavy metal poisoning, contaminations. I'm sure they've never even imagined it.

76
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,850
Not about that. I heard a resort development will take place here.

77
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,320
The village land and Naseong Development's land...

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,930
I heard they were all sold.

79
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,710
Didn't your boyfriend tell you?

80
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,720
About what...

81
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,290
He did work in that industry before, but he got out of it now.

82
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,320
He's a member of the special rescue team. You know that.

83
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,440
Really? I heard that a young man from Seoul went around purchasing the land, so I thought...

84
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,980
But you know, why did he quit such a great job...

85
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,840
and why? Why did he become a rescuer?

86
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,440
Isn't that weird? It's weird.

87
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,510
It's weird.

88
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,540
For me to give you a permit to use provincial forest land at this point in time,

89
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,020
it only shows them what we discussed that day.

90
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,730
We'll have to watch ourselves for now.

91
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,070
I even had someone follow the governor that day. When did they photograph him?

92
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,180
A drone. They were watching us through a drone.

93
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,650
What? A drone?

94
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,590
For them to be so blunt about it means they know we wouldn't be able to do anything about the contamination.

95
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,090
Wouldn't we have to cover up the contamination issue if we want to dig up rare earth elements?

96
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,940
For symptoms like these to appear, I'm sure it didn't happen in a short amount of time.

97
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,160
You can say it was accumulated over a long period of time.

98
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm sure a large amount of mineral waste is buried somewhere.

99
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,770
Mining 25 years ago and a large amount of mineral waste, huh?

100
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,520
If we find critical evidence, we can be the ones in control.

101
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,240
Someone in the Miryeong Village must know that fact.

102
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,670
The call is not going through. After the beep...

103
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,210
Why do I feel so uneasy as if I got swindled?

104
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,060
He'd better not stab me in the back.

105
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,960
On the Miryeong Mountain, 1994

106
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,850
It's strange.

107
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,690
I'm sure I left it here.

108
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,460
San Hyeok.

109
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,920
He's not off work yet?

110
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,510
Plans to Mine Miryeong Forest Rare Earth Elements?

111
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,060
Rare Earth Elements and Environment Pollution

112
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,190
Blood Cell Heavy Metal Test

113
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,780
Arsenic level

114
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,750
Why would he look at this...

115
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,060
You've been selected as a beneficiary for the medical welfare program that our company sponsors.

116
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,050
Why did he quit such a great job...

117
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,220
why did he become a rescuer?

118
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,450
It's weird.

119
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,130
I'll take these.

120
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,160
Just a moment, please.

121
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,140
You're home.

122
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,060
- You're late.
- Yeah.

123
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,610
I prepared a bribe.

124
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,630
Ta-da. Aren't they pretty?

125
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,830
I had a hard time picking them out because I wanted to buy you the prettiest pair.

126
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,710
Try them on.

127
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,130
They're so pretty.

128
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,840
How do they look? Do they look nice?

129
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,640
Yeah. They're beautiful on you.

130
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,000
Put these on and let's go back to Seoul.

131
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,240
Let's go back. I'll look into a hospital position for you.

132
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,360
Let's go back to Seoul and...

133
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,200
Should I?

134
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,930
To look wealthy and elite. Should I live like that?

135
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,460
Just like these high heels.

136
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,300
Just like Kang San Hyeok?

137
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,780
Did something bad happen?

138
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,420
I thought that you had the same mindset as me.

139
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,160
But you're faithful to the desires that your eyes can see.

140
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,850
Ms. Hwang Hyeong Bok. Did you hide her?

141
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,030
Why? To deceive the sick lady and get involved in the rare earth element business?

142
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm not deceiving her. I'm treating her at a place with the topnotch medical professionals in that field.

143
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,110
Right. You're hiding the fact that the residents are sick from arsenic poisoning.

144
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,450
If that is found out, it will be an obstacle to the rare earth element business. Isn't that right?

145
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,020
Let's think rationally, Yeong Jae.

146
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,040
Just because you reveal the cause of their sickness, their ailments don't go away.

147
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,780
Even if it weren't for me, Miryeong forest's rare earth element will be dug up.

148
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,800
If I develop it, I'll use the method that is least invasive to the environment...

149
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,880
So, you're saying you're different than people who contaminated the land of Miryeong?

150
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,920
Different from extremely evil people, you're just slightly evil?

151
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,650
Is that what you want to say now?

152
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,680
After crumbling many walls and beyond them, I thought I saw

153
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,130
the real Kang San Hyeok who is so friendly and warm.

154
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:09,470
But when it comes to your work, you're still the coldhearted man who sees nothing else besides your goal.

155
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,750
Yeong Jae...

156
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,090
Could you fix your eyes on me?

157
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,980
I'll ask you one thing.

158
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,970
The rare earth element business you're about to launch...

159
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,690
could you give it up if I opposed it?

160
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,360
I have never lived any other way. I don't even know how.

161
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,310
If you trust me and wait a little longer...

162
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,720
Don't play with words. Don't try to get out of this at the moment. Give me a straight answer.

163
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,860
If I oppose it, could you give up on this business?

164
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,150
That's right. How could I rescue someone else?

165
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,500
I can't even rescue myself.

166
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,780
But at least, I don't want to become someone who causes others to die because of my desires.

167
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,460
I want to become someone who can ask myself, "Why do you need that much money?"

168
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:35,350
And now, I don't want to stay with someone whose direction in life is different from mine.

169
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,790
What do you mean by that?

170
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,550
Should I move out or will you?

171
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,650
♬ Without feeling anything,  ♬

172
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:28,330
♬ it seems hard to smile ♬

173
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,450
♬ Although that's what everyone says  ♬

174
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,400
♬ Every moment is too much so I turn my head away ♬

175
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:52,020
♬ As one grows older ♬

176
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,730
♬ The dream gradually grew smaller ♬

177
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,890
♬ Oh, how are you doing? ♬

178
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,870
♬ Yes, don't get tired. ♬

179
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,290
♬ In the many nights which were brilliant ♬

180
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:24,250
♬ I'm sure there was a star shining on me ♬

181
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,890
♬ I open a dusty book ♬

182
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,540
I'll never deceive you again.

183
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,640
Give me a chance.

184
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,200
This world has never been friendly to me.

185
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,190
But when you smile, the world smiles at me.

186
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,560
♬ In the many nights which were brilliant ♬

187
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,580
Yeong Jae, I like you.

188
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,510
I found out this time around.

189
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,460
How precious you are to me.

190
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,890
I really like you.

191
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,660
♬ I open a dusty book ♬

192
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,740
♬ In there is the dream I am looking for. ♬

193
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,420
♬ Send to the dark sky ♬

194
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,860
You'll only focus on your goal.

195
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,050
I'm afraid of that obvious outcome.

196
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,060
I have confidence to fight thanks to you.

197
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,080
It's proof that I'm not cursed.

198
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,460
♬ I'm sure there was a star shining on me ♬

199
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,500
You have me.

200
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,900
When you smile, the world smiles.

201
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,720
I, Jeong Yeong Jae, is always by your side.

202
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:54,270
♬ In there is the dream I am looking for. ♬

203
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,530
Even including romance... oh, yeah...

204
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,490
It's a movie with all types of genres combined.

205
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,930
I like it.

206
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:27,140
I warned Kang San Hyeok with photos. Should I carry it out into action?

207
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,630
Please wait. We have to figure out the forest permit issue anyway.

208
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:39,260
Let Kang San Hyeok be our hunting dog and bring it to us. Just watch him for now.

209
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,720
After our hunt is over, we'll eat the dog.

210
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,390
We'll boil him and eat all the meat

211
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,050
and the bone marrow.

212
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,070
How do you feel, Grandma?

213
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,280
For having me in such a nice hospital...

214
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,770
I'm just so grateful and I'm comfortable here.

215
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,710
Until your treatment is over, you can rest at ease.

216
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,930
Our company will pay for all the costs. Do you understand?

217
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
I'll be back.

218
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:29,570
Grandma, by chance, these people...

219
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,190
Director, where are you right now?

220
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,800
I looked into it and the guide that Kwon Joo Han hired when coming out to Miryeong to hunt

221
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,270
was Choi Jeong Mok of Miryeong Forestry.

222
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,660
He'd blow a whistle of some kind and gather around the animals.

223
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,210
If you look at the files, right after the fire at Miryeong Mountain from 25 years ago...

224
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,970
Miryeong Forestry has been supplying lumber to Taesung Construction.

225
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,290
And the arsonists for that recent fire were workers from Miryeong Forestry as well.

226
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,950
I think there's a deep connection among the forest fire, Choi Jeong Mok, and Taesung.

227
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,010
The call is not going through. After the beep...

228
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,690
How much did you receive?

229
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,830
How much did Taesung pay you for you to do such a thing?

230
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,830
What are you talking about coming here out of the blue?

231
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,330
Starting the forest fire.

232
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,980
Did you think you wouldn't get caught?

233
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,110
Did you get your memory back?

234
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,670
Did you think I'd never remember?

235
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,950
A**hole! It wasn't me. It was you!

236
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,250
You started the fire! How dare you try to put it on me?

237
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,730
Stop it!

238
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,470
I said I remember everything!

239
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,790
Shut up, you a**hole!

240
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,050
Let go of me!

241
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,210
Did you start the forest fire, punk?

242
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,380
No, it wasn't me.

243
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,400
- There's a proof.
- I said I didn't!

244
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,130
How dare you. Let's go to the police.

245
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,480
I said, no!

246
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,900
Where are you going?

247
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,860
I won't let you win, rock-paper-scissors!

248
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,700
Got you!

249
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,950
- How can you let it go?
- It's okay. But still...

250
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,480
San Hyeok. I'll be right back. Make sure you stay here and wait for me.

251
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,730
You can't go anywhere, okay?

252
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,160
Tickets

253
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,690
Oppa.

254
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,570
What are you doing?

255
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,770
We're playing hide and seek.

256
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,000
Count to ten starting now.

257
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,120
One, two...

258
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,880
three, four...

259
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,210
five, six...

260
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,150
seven, eight...

261
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,860
nine, ten.

262
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,330
- Stop!
- Mom said she'd come back on my birthday.

263
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,370
She's not coming. She abandoned us.

264
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,830
She won't come.

265
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,430
Kang San Yoo, your only family is Grandma and me.

266
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,620
Oppa... I hate you.

267
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,220
Hey!

268
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,620
You kid. Hey, what are you doing hiding here?

269
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,930
Man, you started a forest fire. A forest fire!

270
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,160
It wasn't me.

271
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,710
What do you mean it wasn't you? Hey, look here.

272
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,150
Look at this here. Here's the proof.

273
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,340
I said I didn't!

274
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,550
Hey, this can't be. Let's go to the police.

275
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,930
You started the forest fire! You're in deep trouble...

276
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,290
Hey! Stop right there!

277
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,590
Hey! Stop!

278
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,720
It was you...

279
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,990
The one who started the forest fire...

280
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,630
It was you.

281
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,560
San Yoo!

282
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,480
Kang San Yoo!

283
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,590
Oppa!

284
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,840
San Yoo!

285
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,560
Oppa!

286
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,720
Kang San Yoo, stay there. I'm coming.

287
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,540
If you photograph like that, you won't get a good picture.

288
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,060
Give it to me.

289
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,050
Over there. Like this. Zoom in.

290
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,370
Like that over there. It's firing up.

291
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,550
That's right. Right, right.

292
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,260
Okay.

293
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,730
- You have to capture stuff like this.
- Help us!

294
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,030
A village that's about to disappear and tragic children.

295
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,250
Doesn't it sound more meaningful?

296
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,750
- Help us!
- Save us!

297
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,700
Save us! Save us!

298
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,290
- What should we do?
- Let's go home.

299
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,500
Help us! Help us!

300
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,490
Help us!

301
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,680
- Help us!
- Save us!

302
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,830
Help us!

303
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,410
Help us!

304
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,290
- Help us...
- Oppa, I'm scared...

305
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,670
It's okay. I'm here.

306
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,160
Hold my hand tightly.

307
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,830
Oppa!

308
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,690
- San Yoo!
- Oppa!

309
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,990
Oppa...

310
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,220
San Yoo, San Yoo, San Yoo!

311
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,440
Oppa...

312
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,890
San Yoo! San Yoo!

313
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,170
Oppa...

314
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,440
San Yoo, San Yoo...

315
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,830
Oppa...

316
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,260
San Yoo, San Yoo...

317
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,220
It's dangerous! Dangerous!

318
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,830
No, San Yoo...

319
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,550
- San Yoo...
- It's dangerous.

320
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,290
- San Yoo.
- Oppa...
- I'll save you.

321
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,030
You guys killed her.

322
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,190
You guys killed San Yoo!

323
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,700
My sister!

324
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:17,200
♬ You filled up a small empty spot ♬

325
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,790
♬ Where are you? ♬

326
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,260
Forest

327
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,970
Keep your eyes wide open and watch.

328
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,290
How Choi Chang is thrown into the fires of hell.

329
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,030
I truly wanted to hold your hand.

330
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,210
CEO Kang San Hyeok, you're family now.

331
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,530
Conduct epidemiology investigation in Miryeong Village?

332
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,130
I'm sure they tried to cover up the poisoning as another symptom.

333
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,420
You can curse me. I just wish you were in front of my eyes.

334
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,900
I have to get rid of the cub.

335
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,530
I'm sorry.

336
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,360
Let's make it a great night.

337
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,930
San Hyeok!

338
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,110
♬ Come to me ♬
