1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,800
Now, now, everyone. Please be respectful toward the chair.

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,040
Now, now, now. We don't need anything else.

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,380
As CEO Kwon has been doing thus far,

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,920
why don't we decide with our applause?

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,870
CEO Kwon will take full responsibility for Taesung High Tech's poor management

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,360
and select the board of directors that the Mirae Fund recommends. The shareholders who agree,

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,930
please give a round of applause!

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,850
The hunt is over, Director.

9
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,950
I apologize, Father.

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,230
Due to my lack of insight

11
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,890
I caused trouble for you.

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,730
There's no words to express the dishonor I brought as a son.

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,090
If you help me this one time,

14
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,330
I will repay your grace ten- or twenty-fold.

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,280
Please help me, Father.

16
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:33,430
Why did you get involved in a resort project and take the hit?

17
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,800
How is the likes of you going to pay me back ten- or twenty-fold?

18
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,700
It's not a resort.

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,680
I have a big plan in that area, one that others can't even fathom.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
Please support me with a management defense fund.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,820
I will protect Taesung Hitech and make this business successful.

22
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,720
Meaningless expenditure and meaningless news,

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,500
you truly are an inferior.

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,400
Father, please help me.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,080
The heir of one of Korea's greatest companies: Taesung Group's Kwon Joo Han's position is being threatened.

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,330
[Taesung High Tech in Management Crisis]
Due to purchasing of Taesung High Tech's holdings and shareholders' complaints,

27
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,470
the second largest shareholder, Mirae Fund

28
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,030
declared it will participate in Taesung High Tech's corporate management.

29
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,250
During the shareholders' meeting, Managing Director Kwon...

30
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,820
We can't leave Kang San Hyeok alone.

31
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,650
We can no longer just watch what he does. There's no time left.

32
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,850
- We're looking for him. Please wait a bit longer.
- Yes.

33
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,620
For now, this is the information about Naseong development.

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,380
After going into Miryeong,

35
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,680
Kang San Hyeok is documented to have left RLI.

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,860
All businesses have been placed under his right wing man, Park Hyeong Soo.

37
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,690
When he leaves the special rescue team after wrapping up all the foundational work,

38
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,210
he wants to get his director position at RLI, huh?

39
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:14,600
The important thing is, currently Kang San Hyeok has no power according to the documents.

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,170
Regarding the development of Miryeong forest, Kang San Hyeok does not exist according to the law.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,190
A 'ghost' that does not exist according to the law...

42
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,630
What's up? How come you came to see me?

43
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,620
You know the Miryeong village water quality analysis? You said you've done it every year, right?

44
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,660
What about it?

45
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,860
Were any metalloids found by any chance?

46
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,960
Metalloids? Why all of a sudden?

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,570
If such a thing were found, we would have disposed of it right away. Would we have left it in the groundwater?

48
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,460
By chance, did Daewon Bio conduct all the water quality analysis?

49
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,510
They're the only vendor near Miryeong county.

50
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,820
What's going on?

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,190
I need to do more research, but I think there's something going on.

52
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,560
We should do further research by reporting to the higher-ups.

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,610
That weird hole that was in Miryeong mountain in the past,

54
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,230
you said it suddenly disappeared after you reported it, right?

55
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,620
Don't tell anyone else yet. At least not til things are made clear.

56
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,680
Just stop the people in the village who are still using the groundwater.

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,980
They'll listen to you if you tell them the county office is shutting it down.

58
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,810
Nomination

59
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,140
You just need to submit an application as a formality.
Gangwondo Governor Baek Myeong Ho

60
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,780
You already have the nomination. So once you submit the application, you're a proportional assemblyman.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,970
In the Korean National Assembly, 75 seats are proportionally divided among political parties.

62
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,620
The 75 assemblymen are chosen by the political parties and not elected by the voters.

63
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,400
Restoration of Land Ownership Rights in Miryeong Forest

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,870
You know better. Why are you doing this?

65
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,440
It's a district assemblyman position.

66
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,080
There. Happy?

67
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,410
Real Estate Sales Contract
When the contract on all the residents' land is completed,

68
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,830
I'll exchange it with this recommendation letter then.

69
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,240
You'll have to get their signature stamps soon.

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,960
The deadline to submit the candidate application isn't too far off.

71
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,430
Fine.

72
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,160
I'll have to rush it if I want to put a gold badge on.

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,060
Would you hand me that blue file over there?

74
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,500
There's no reason to put such an old picture there.

75
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,880
Then that means, it was to test my reaction?

76
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,170
They found out who I am.

77
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,010
Yeah.

78
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,510
Everything is done here. How about there?

79
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,050
I made the things you ordered and distributed them to the reporters.

80
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,700
Kwon Joo Han is preoccupied with trying to gather funds

81
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,230
to purchase the rest of the shares and to win over the shareholders.

82
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,460
Now that we have President Choi's land, I can truly see the end.

83
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,690
It's not over til the end.

84
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,550
I'll go to Naseong and go over the things to talk about, so come immediately.

85
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,320
Okay! I am going right now!

86
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,890
What is this?

87
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,760
Ouch! It hurts!

88
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,480
I wanted to meet you once, and to think we meet this way

89
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,660
Naseong Development's Director Park Hyeong Soo.

90
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,920
Your face doesn't look as well as it did at the shareholder's meeting. You looked so joyous then.

91
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,370
What are you doing?

92
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,600
You have been assisting Kang San Hyeok since you entered RLI, right?

93
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,560
I heard Director Kang's salary and bonus are above and beyond the highest in the industry and truly astronomical.

94
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,040
For him to produce such results, I understand you played a crucial role in that.

95
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,080
Did you receive compensation that is equivalent to that?

96
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,580
Why don't you get to the point?

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,690
Please help us.

98
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,810
We'll give you everything that Director Kang San Hyeok has been taking.

99
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,540
You're taking away time from a busy person over such a useless thing.

100
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,670
Please don't come looking for me over stuff like this.

101
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,930
It's 100 billion won.

102
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,260
I'll give you 100 billion won for coming over and working with us. When Miryeong Forest project is completed,

103
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,060
I'll give you an additional 100 billion won as an incentive.

104
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,780
Please think it over carefully.

105
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,100
Not as a mere director at an investment firm,

106
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,600
but Taesung Group Managing Director Kwon Joo Han's right hand.

107
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,270
What are your terms?

108
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,150
Hyeong Soo

109
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,970
The phone you are calling is turned off. Please call again at a later time.

110
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,200
Hand over Naseong Development and Miryeong Forest to us.

111
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,680
All the documents are in your name and Kang San Hyeok has no power legally.

112
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,460
How should I trust Director Kwon Joo Han and Jo Kwang Pil?

113
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,420
You continuously followed Director Kang San Hyeok and me.

114
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,510
And not only did you set up a hidden camera in our homes,

115
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,140
but you also broke Naseong Development's walls and stole the safe.

116
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,980
To you people that commits these crimes like it's nothing,

117
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,530
how would I play such a big part not even knowing what you'll do to me?

118
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,790
That's how I deal with my enemies.

119
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,040
I can go even further than that.

120
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,010
But if you become part of our family, you will receive such help from me.

121
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,270
Transfer Contract

122
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,240
Let's work together.

123
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,070
I will change your life.

124
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,320
If I hand over Nasung Development,

125
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,370
will I really become Taesung Group Kwon Joo Han's

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,200
right hand man?

127
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,400
That's right.

128
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,850
Sign here.

129
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,630
I will stamp my fingerprint.

130
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,850
Fingerprint one.

131
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,200
Fingerprint two.

132
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,670
Double fingers.

133
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,560
You'll give me 100 million dollars?

134
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,040
You talk as if you're getting Mansour's card loan.

135
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,900
Of all people to believe in this world, do you think I'll believe someone who murders and frames it as suicide?

136
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,750
Enough of this.

137
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,710
What?

138
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,930
Hold your hand? (aka take your side)

139
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,850
How ridiculous.

140
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,340
I live off of my director's good looking face.

141
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:07,390
Do you think after looking at Kang San Hyeok's face, that I'll be able to side with your face?

142
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,050
The disparity is too much.

143
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,020
No conscience..

144
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,210
no conscience...!

145
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,450
Go look for him.

146
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,850
I just gave a taste of what happens

147
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,810
if you mess with someone you shouldn't touch.

148
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,980
Hyeong Soo!

149
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,690
Hyeong Soo, Park Hyeong Soo!

150
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,280
Hyeong Soo!

151
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,360
Yeah?

152
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,090
Me? I'm...

153
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,730
I'm going over to the village center to take care of something.

154
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,250
Hello?

155
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,080
What kind of jerk is this guy?

156
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,450
Oh gosh, this diarrhea.

157
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,860
Oh my gosh.

158
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,940
Can I really go inside?

159
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,990
What if Director Choi comes?

160
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,780
Once he goes into the village, he takes the whole day concerning himself with every little thing that's going on.

161
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
Don't worry and come inside.

162
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:46,110
Then, since we already exchanged our passwords, should I take this chance to explore?

163
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,920
Wow it's amazing!

164
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,940
Actually,

165
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,020
I wanted to have you in my space.

166
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,920
To tell you the truth,

167
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,150
I imagined the place everyday.

168
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,860
Your room.

169
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,260
This way.

170
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,400
This is your room?

171
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,000
So it looks like this!

172
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,990
Have a seat.

173
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,770
Should I?

174
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,330
We...

175
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,190
I got a muscle cramp!

176
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,530
Are you okay? Where?

177
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,390
-On top of there.
-Here?

178
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,100
-No, more to the top
-Here?

179
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,710
What?

180
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,600
You... you!

181
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,720
Run!

182
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,350
Run away!

183
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,600
Are you not stopping?

184
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,490
How dare you slap my hand away?

185
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,350
Huh?! Huh?!

186
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,530
Stop right there!

187
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,410
You better stop!

188
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,500
Wow you're so harsh with your words!

189
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,740
If you're talking about crazy, I'm the crazier one.

190
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,790
You're originally crazy! Your hands,

191
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,120
let go of your hands!
- No, I won't!

192
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,660
You crazy wench! Stay right there? Aren't you staying put?

193
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,950
I don't want to!

194
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,240
Come You, you crazy! Hey!!

195
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,520
Give me my son back!

196
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,070
Are you awake?

197
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,330
My fingerprint...

198
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,750
they stamped it...

199
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,840
Naseong Development...

200
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,570
I will take care of it.

201
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,860
Don't think about work and focus on getting better.

202
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,720
Clothes...

203
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,600
M..y p..h..o..n..e

204
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,220
What?

205
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,870
In my clothes,

206
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,240
my phone!

207
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,720
My head...

208
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,000
hurts so much..

209
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,620
There's my Naseong Development phone...

210
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,530
What are the conditions?

211
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,300
How should I trust Director Kwon Joo Han and Jo Kwang Pil?

212
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,660
You continuously followed Director Kang San Hyeok and me.

213
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,730
And not only did you set up a hidden camera in our homes,

214
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,140
but you also broke Naseong Development's walls and stole the safe.

215
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,740
To you people that commits these crimes like it's nothing,

216
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,820
how would I play such a big part not even knowing what you'll do to me?

217
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,380
That's how I deal with my enemies.

218
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,390
I can even go further than that.

219
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,570
I have two conditions.

220
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,100
Give me Naseong Development's contract,

221
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,790
Managing Director Kwon Joo Han who is found to have collaborated with organized crime...

222
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,790
if the news finds out about this,

223
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,150
will you be able to protect your position in Taesung Hitech?

224
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:48,120
I'll lend great help to him who is preoccupied with gathering his shares.

225
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,480
Director Jo Kwang Pil.

226
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,400
Transfer Agreement

227
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,430
If you ask the professional, you'll find out we didn't manipulate the recording.

228
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,600
Just know that you missed the timing on stopping.

229
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,060
You'll pay for not having stopped for sure.

230
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,390
Second condition.

231
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,860
It looks nice. Give it to me.

232
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,490
How dare you mess with my man?

233
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,660
A dog bit a man, so your owner should be held responsible.

234
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,180
Anticipate.

235
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:19,220
An eye for an eye. A thuggish move for another thuggish move.

236
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,170
Hello?

237
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,380
Sorry. Something urgent came up at the office.

238
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,180
You were worried since I was out of touch, huh?

239
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,790
I'm not a kid. I know you're a busy man.

240
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,190
Where are you? You must be somewhere noisy.

241
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,400
I had to take care of something after work.

242
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,960
But when are you done with that job?

243
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,340
I think it'll take a bit longer.

244
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,040
Why? Is something going on?

245
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,460
There's nothing much going on.

246
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,250
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

247
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,110
Do you need tomorrow off as well?

248
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,880
I forgot all about Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong of Unam Rescue Team's transfer of duties ceremony.

249
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,910
Can you switch your day with me?

250
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,280
Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong's transfer of duties?

251
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,620
It was posted on the site. Didn't you know?

252
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,810
Due to his age, emergency dispatch is dangerous for him. So the fire school asked him to be an instructor.

253
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,080
I'd like to attend his ceremony.

254
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,140
I'm sorry, Sunbaenim. I have to use my day off tomorrow for an important matter.

255
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,520
Why are you buying me clothes?

256
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,040
I know you won't like it.

257
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,880
I know, but your father is also my sunbaenim whom I respect.

258
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,840
On the day of my sunbaenim's transfer of duties ceremony, I want my woman to go looking beautiful.

259
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,100
So, please oblige.

260
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,730
You're a total expert. Total player.

261
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,400
"Father, my woman..."

262
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,970
What? You don't like it?

263
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,060
I didn't say that.

264
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,380
All right then. I'll let you get me just one outfit.

265
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,320
Instead, something I can purchase with my paycheck.

266
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,990
Okay?

267
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,930
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,780
How about that one?

269
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,460

It's pretty.

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,690
Why don't you try it on? It's the last one. So it's 70% off.

290
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,400

All the shares have been purchased.

306
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,970
The rest of the minor shareholders. We can't visit all those people.

307
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,800
Now, Mirae Fund won't be a threat to your management rights.

308
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,530
That's the way it should be. So much money went into it.

309
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,800
Yes.

310
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,100
Yes, I understand.

Managing Director.

312
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,750
[Taesung Group Crown Prince's Humiliation]
Mirae Fund that became the second largest shareholder

313
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,160
sold the majority of its shares.

314
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,660
A dog bit a man, so your owner should be held responsible.

315
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,690
The time is now, Chairman.

316
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,320
Sell everything now.

317
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,490
Mirae Fund sold shares unexpectedly to MH Life Insurance

318
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,280
and profited about 300 billion won due to the sales.

319
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,180
Meanwhile Managing Director Kwon Joo Han of Taesung Group who was defending his management rights

320
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,600
not only took a tremendous loss,

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,680
but is in a bind having his management ability being questioned along with his close relationship with organized crime.

322
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,290
And in the process of becoming the heir to Taesung Group...

323
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,530
Bring in Director Jo.

324
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,380
Tell Director Jo to come.

325
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,020
- Here?
- No, no.

326
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,840
No, no.

327
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,430
- No.
- But I want to see you.

328
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,510
Can't you please look at me?

329
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,980
Personal Information: Kang San Hyeok

330
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,920
From now on, I'll manage Kang San Hyeok personally.

331
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,560
This woman. Bring her to me.

332
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,190
I want to give her everything in the world.

333
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,730
Me too.

334
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,690

Forest Preview

339
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,350
Our team one has been dismantled.

340
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,840
I found the arsonists.

341
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,260
If I get arrested,

342
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,270
can I tell the police what happened 25 years ago?

343
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,520
I think there's metal poisoning in the areas surrounding Miryeong Mountain.

344
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,090
I'll have to dig into that land.

345
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,660
Did you see the same thing somewhere?

346
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,030
Kang San Hyeok! Kang San Hyeok, wake up!

347
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,600
Just remember that. I'll never let Jeong Yeong Jae die alone.

348
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,130
Get rid of that woman quickly.

349
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,830
Jeong Yeong Jae, you're under arrest.

350
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,520
