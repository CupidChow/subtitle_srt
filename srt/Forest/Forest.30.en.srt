00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,520
Room 601

00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,050
Heo Choon Sik

00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,180
BDZ 4mg IV TID

6
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,860
Benzodiazepine?
Benzodiazepine: a class of psychoactive drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers

7
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,190
So exciting.

8
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,640
So, this is a secret hospital room, huh?

9
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,860
Is the patient awake? I'll go in to treat him right away. Please prepare.

10
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,380
What the heck? Why is it so quick?

11
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,300
What do I do now?

12
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,100
Dr. Park: 911

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,950
No.

14
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,630
How bad is the poisoning that he's in this state?

15
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,430
Call the nursing hospital and tell them we'll send him tomorrow.

16
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,030
Yes.

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,860
Dr. Song Jin Soo of Pulmonology. Please come to the ER right away.

18
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,130
- Dr. Song Jin Soo of Pulmonology. Please come to the ER right away.
Geez.

19
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,970
Thank you, Sung Il.

20
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,250
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,420
Dr. Park! Are you all right?

22
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,850
No... What the...

23
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,540
Did they almost stick this in my arm?

24
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,470
- Dr. Park, we have to leave right away. You can tell right away when Nurse Kim starts lying.
- Yeah.

25
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,240
Okay, okay.

26
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,320
Unni, why are you blinking so much? Is something in your eye?

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,590
- Me? I don't think so.
- Let me see. Is something in your eye?

28
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,600
No, right?

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,530
Why are you blinking so much then? Something didn't go in?

30
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,350
I'm okay...

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,020
Drink this, Unni. Gosh, look at you turn red.

32
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,390
You're turning red. Oh, no.

33
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,800
Now, now, now. We can't be doing this now.

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,320
Hurry up and check what the solution is.

35
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,150
It's benzodiazepine.
Benzodiazepine: a class of psychoactive drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers

36
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,100
Benzodiazepine: a class of psychoactive drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers
What's this? It's for convulsions from poisoning.

37
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,630
That means nothing's wrong with the prescription then.

38
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,350
What in the world? Did we just do all this for nothing?

39
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,080
No.

40
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,270
They also gave this to Heo Choon Sik.

41
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,050
Heo Choon Sik: BDZ 4mg IV TID

42
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,680
Why would they give this to a leukemia patient?

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,070
To other patients as well.

44
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,120
They prescribed this to all of them. In large dose.

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,310
This dosage can cause side effects such as reduced consciousness or respiratory failure.

46
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,870
No way...

47
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,530
I'm sure they tried to cover up poisoning symptoms with other symptoms.

48
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,760
But why would they?

49
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,660
Yes, Director.

50
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,340
We got out safely, thanks to you.

51
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,120
I think we found what we needed. I'll tell you when I get there.

52
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,190
So, will you really process Kang San Hyeok's letter of resignation?

53
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,920
Of course I will. I've applied all the sick days and days off.

54
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,820
I can't cover up for him anymore. What now?

55
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,660
That Kang San Hyeok. He ignores my calls, and he's not even home. What the heck?

56
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,010
Did he really run away to Seoul?

57
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't think so.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,970
- Pilot Jeong saw his car go into the forest yesterday.
- Geez, this guy...

59
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,800
Team Leader, Kang San Hyeok may look like a cold person on the outside,

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,040
but didn't he behave more kindly?

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,550
I just don't think he'll cut out the rescue team and leave. It's my gut feeling.

62
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,350
Geez, it's tough and too much work with a person missing. Let's just wait and see.

63
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,110
Shut up! Why would we wait for that jerk?

64
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,760
I'll cut him off today. That jerk.

65
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,770
You won't cut him off.

66
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,040
What's he saying? He even called him a jerk.

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,100
- Get to work already.
- He can't cut him off.

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,770
- Everyone, get back to your desk!
- All righty...

69
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,500
I don't think you can cut him off.

70
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,770
I'm on my way out.

71
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,940
I'm Choi Jeong Mok.

72
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,500
What?

73
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,330
Who... who...

74
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,250
It's stage 3 liver cancer. It's spread to your lymph nodes.

75
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,690
You should be hospitalized first and have a detailed examination.

76
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,500
It'd be best to pick a surgery date as soon as possible.
[Jo Kwang Pil]

77
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,290
Me? I have advanced liver cancer?

78
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,260
Jo Kwang Pil

79
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,440
This Choi Jeong Mok will die?

80
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,150
Advanced liver cancer...

81
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,930
I'm home, Your Majesty.

82
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,820
What are you doing?

83
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,530
What, you're going to lie and say women used to chase you around thinking you were actor Kim Chu Ryeon?

84
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,710
Fine. I'm used to your lies. I'll go with it.

85
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,360
Didn't you think I'd notice that you use up my BB cream every morning?

86
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,890
I can tell, you know.

87
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,510
This color is better for your darker complexion.

88
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,970
Why are you fussing?

89
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,060
Stay still. This is much more expensive than mine.

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,190
What the heck? What's with the age spot...

91
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,970
That's why I told you to put sunscreen.

92
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,040
Seriously. What's this? You look like an old man.

93
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,160
I am an old man.

94
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,990
You're not.

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,900
You're my hyungnim, Choi Jeong Mok. You'll never get old, my hyungnim.

96
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,810
I'm an orphan without you. You know that, right?

97
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,840
You're never allowed to get old. Never, got it?

98
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,330
Look how handsome my hyungnim is.

99
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,360
All I did was put some BB cream on you.

100
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,520
My baby...

101
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,100
My baby that I gave birth to...

102
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,960
What's with the vibe? Is something wrong?

103
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,080
What do you mean? Nothing's wrong.

104
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,040
I gave birth to you through my aching belly. Make it up to me with money.

105
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,870
Of course. What do you mean you gave birth to me?

106
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,250
You still have your potbelly.

107
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,600
This is the ultimate in secrets behind birth origin stories.

108
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,470
Chang... I can't see my Chang any longer.

109
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,230
My Chang. My precious Chang...

110
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,610
Pay me back for the BB cream.

111
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,680
You thug.

112
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,760
What a swindler. You're always asking for money.

113
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,080
Okay, okay, okay. Got it. Dad...

114
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,850
You make me use my martial arts on you...

115
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,640
- See.
- Ow!

116
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,670
He went inside.

117
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,150
HS ENG. It used to be a company called Hanshin Chemical.

118
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,790
It specialized in metal refining.

119
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,830
But it suddenly declared bankruptcy 25 years ago and closed its doors.

120
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,860
[HS ENG]
The ownership and the company name changed, but the president is the same. Park Dong Geun.

121
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,360
- Who are you?
- Are you President Park Dong Geun of Hanshin Chemical?

122
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,660
You've got the wrong person.

123
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,800
Since the mining work in Miryeong Mountain 25 years ago,

124
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,370
you changed the company name and its ownership. I guess you were in a rush?

125
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,400
What is the reason you got rid of your trace enough to declare voluntary bankruptcy?

126
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,540
Is Jo Kwang Pil asking you to work together again?

127
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,960
Utilizing the same method you used 25 years ago,

128
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,850
is he enticing you saying you can make even more money?

129
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,670
How much did he offer?

130
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,900
Who are you?

131
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,850
Someone who'd rescue you from prison.

132
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,550
If you accept this money and tell me what Taesung did 25 years ago

133
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,380
in order to mine rare earth minerals,

134
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,110
I'll protect you, sir.

135
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,350
I've prepared a place for you to hideout overseas.

136
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,270
- And if I refuse?
- You'll end up being framed for all the crimes Kwon Joo Han committed.

137
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,540
Because I'll expose this incident soon.

138
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,370
What will you do?

139
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,830
Will you let Kwon Joo Han cut you off later or

140
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,890
will you look for a way to survive?

141
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,380
Reporter Park, see me right away.

142
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,590
Taesung High Tech, Plans for Mining Rare Earth Minerals in Miryeong Forest

143
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
Managing Director!

144
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,170
"A Corporation" which is one of the top corporations in our country

145
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,840
is under suspicion of contaminating a village,

146
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,970
which has generated a shock wave.

147
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,100
So if you don't treat the contaminants properly, it soaks into the ground.

148
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,630
But they told us to just cover up the ground saying they're folding the business. What else could we do?

149
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,560
We could only do what we were told to do from superiors.

150
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,380
The contamination began with the excavation of rare earth minerals.

151
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,110
When they encountered obstacles during the commercialization phase, the corporation halted its development

152
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,950
and closed up the excavation area.

153
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,850
The location?

154
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,150
It was Miryeong Mountain. They had built this on that spot.

155
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,620
Miryeong 911 Special Rescue Team.

156
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,010
Knowing full well that it will be a health hazard for the village residents.

157
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,370
They did that not to cost them any money.

You need to spend money to treat pollutants that come out of mining operations.

So if you don't treat the contaminants properly, it soaks into the ground.

The contamination began with the excavation of rare earth minerals.

When they encountered obstacles during the commercialization phase, the corporation halted its development

and closed up the excavation area.
