00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,160
Episode 19
By chance...

2
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,030
Get off.

3
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,000
Get lost.

4
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,730
Yeong Jae.

5
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,380
Sit over here.

6
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,420
Come.

7
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,080
What are you doing right now?

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,550
There's no reason for you to be here. Come out.

9
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,570
Why do you get to decide my business?

10
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,270
You're wrong if you're doing this to get me mad.

11
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,980
I'm not the type to get emotional over such a provocation. Come.

12
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,390
Kang San Hyeok.

13
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,460
You should stay out of this, Dr. Cha Jin Woo.

14
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,710
I believe you're not fit to invite Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae to a place like this in the evening.

15
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,840
Does your fianceée know that you're doing this?

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,240
You should stay out of it, Kang San Hyeok.

17
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,120
Do I look like an idiot who gets dragged around just because someone asks me out?

18
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,770
I'm here because I wanted to come out and it was my choice.

19
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,780
Jeong Yeong Jae.

20
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,940
You have no right to meddle in my business.

21
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,250
I don't have sufficient interest to pull a stunt to make you mad.

22
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,500
I'm saying, please rest assured.

23
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,900
Hyeong Soo

24
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,070
Hyeong Soo
Please don't bother other people with your baseless delusion. Just go.

25
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,080
To where you want to go. Someplace which suits you.

26
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,720
La Pi
Ristorante Italiano

27
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,560
I apologize for being late, Chairman.

28
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,300
There was an unexpected incident on my way over. I'm sorry.

29
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,000
Three minutes out of the ten minutes you permitted has passed. So please listen to me for seven minutes.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,520
Those seven minutes will change the level of your investment amount.

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,400
What are you trying to create out of Daeyeong Auto's case?

32
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,640
By chance, is it what I'm thinking?

33
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,550
That's right.

34
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,570
It's about attacking the management rights of CEO Kwon Joo Han.

35
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,120
- Explain in five minutes.
- Thank you, Chairman.

36
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,190
How did you get to meet Kang San Hyeok here...

37
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,380
I don't wish to talk about anything else.

38
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm here to hear about PTSD. So, give me your opinion on that as a specialist.
PTSD: Post-traumatic Syndrome

39
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,610
All right.

40
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,860
First, how is his MSE?
MSE: Mental Status Examination

41
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,780
I brought my observation data.

42
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,410
Please read this over.

43
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,980
Global Fund, David Profit Report, Challenging Daeyeong Auto management rights and overall profits

44
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm sure you're aware, Chairman. Last year, the global funder David

45
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,730
attempted to challenge Daeyeong Auto's management rights.

46
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,950
When David began to purchase massive amounts of stock, the owner defended itself by purchasing the remaining shares at a high price.

47
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,850
When the stock price increased this way, David sold all the shares they had purchased and went away.

48
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,100
The profit made by David at that time is over 1 trillion won.

49
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,550
They weren't after the management rights to begin with.

50
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,540
Do you think this example also applies to Taesung High Tech?

51
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,750
Even though the CEO is no other than Kwon Joo Han?

52
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,180
Of course, the shareholders are highly loyal to Kwon Joo Han who is the heir to Taesung Group.

53
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,050
However, High Tech has a unique problem due to that fact.

54
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,170
It was managed as if it were a private company owned by Kwon Joo Han.

55
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,920
As a classic example, the Miryeong Forest Resort Development Project.

56
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,500
Are you saying CEO Kwon is pursuing a resort develpment business? I've never heard of it.

57
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,550
Of course not.

58
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,110
Although he was utilizing the company funds, he never got approvals from the board of directors nor did he notify them.

59
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,000
There are numerous examples of arbitrary management.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,010
It means you have every reason to challenge him in that respect.

61
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,950
I will make you the second largest shareholder.

62
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,240
You just have to purchase the shares I have in my possession.

63
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,010
Kwon Joo Han will have no other choice but to defend his management rights. And when the price goes up, you sell everything then.

64
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,470
- And what do you gain through that?
- Time.

65
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:25,410
While he's out of energy trying to defend his rights. I'll take that time away from him.

66
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,610
Bring me the stock proxies (power of attorney). I'm going up against Kwon Joo Han.

67
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:55,250
Unless you have the proxies from other shareholders saying they'll hand you the shares,

68
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,640
I can't take such a huge risk.

69
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,390
Chairman.

70
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,780
Send me the proxies.

71
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,580
You won't be able to persuade me without that.

72
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,930
PTSD Checklist

73
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,450
Did you ask him when his exercise obsession began?

74
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,760
He says it was three years ago when he witnessed his colleague's leg get amputated.

75
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,230
If it's been three years already, the PTSD must've progressed quite a bit.

76
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,940
Seeing that he has repetitive muscular ruptures and can't even hear the mission sirens.

77
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,520
All the symptoms he's listed here say only one thing.

78
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,990
- Pain?
- Yeah.

79
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,120
I think you should send him to Gangwon Myeongseong Hospital. It will be too much for you to handle.

80
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,920
As the doctor for the rescue team, isn't there something I could do for him?

81
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,430
Besides telling him simply to go to a larger hospital, I'd like to be more helpful.

82
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,860
Will you be okay?

83
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,790
Even when you were a fixtern-
 (Accepted for a residency in a medical speciality)

84
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,620
No. I won't run away this time.

85
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,460
I'll do as much as I can.

86
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,480
You have to make him talk.

87
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,220
What happened then and how he felt then.

88
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,530
Our brain stores traumas in a different spot than other memories.

89
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,690
You have to make him talk to draw out the memory that's stored in that deep storage.

90
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,980
That's the start. It could also be the end.

91
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,410
I guess I need to listen to him endlessly, huh?

92
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,130
It's not your memory? Then how about the drawing on that ttakji...

93
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,630
I found it. It's not mine.

94
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,800
My phantom pain was brought on because of the feeling that the fire had occurred there. But it has nothing to do with me.

95
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,930
What if the person refuses to recall his memory? What do I do then...

96
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,450
No, never mind.

97
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,200
By chance, to alleviate that rescuer's pain,

98
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,050
is there anything I can attempt to do?

99
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,160
You're still the same.

100
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,400
As expected of Jeong Yeong Jae.

101
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,570
Jeong Yeong Jae that I know was someone very unique.

102
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,300
You seem outgoing and strong on the outside, but you're very fearful on the inside.

103
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,750
But even though you get so scared, you always did it in the end.

104
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,880
You were so tenacious. Even trembling in fear.

105
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,350
There's no way. I ran away not being able to finish a psychiatry residency.

106
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,260
My fault in that was great, as your mentor.

107
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,110
When you were an intern, I didn't stop you from getting too involved with the patient although I saw it all.

108
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,630
In the end, you experienced countertransference.
Countertransference: Redirection of a psychotherapist's feelings toward a client

109
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,370
This is why dating in the workplace could be dangerous.

110
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,490
Because you were my girlfriend, my judgment became clouded.

111
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,880
I think we're done here. I'll get going. Thanks for your opinions.

112
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,500
Yeong Jae.

113
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,820
Your feeling for Kang San Hyeok.

114
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,040
Whether if it's a repetition of countertransference that occurred before,

115
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,840
or if you're having a pathological reaction having accepted his pain as yours.

116
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,540
I hope you examine yourself thoughtfully.

117
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,400
Well, as a psychiatrist

118
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,140
and as your former mentor who made a grave mistake, I ask this of you.

119
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,690
As expected, he's asking to see the proxies.

120
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,890
You have the list of shareholders who are likely to hand over the shares to us, right?

121
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,050
Yes.

122
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,430
I've already scheduled meetings with shareholders we'll meet in Hong Kong tomorrow.

123
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,020
We're running out of time. So, we should think we only have one chance at it.

124
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,850
Focus, so we can take care of it in one shot.

125
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,920
Yes, I got it.

126
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,640
Director?

127
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,210
Go ahead. I have to stop by somewhere first.

128
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,050
Oh, gosh.

129
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,270
D... Director! Director!

130
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,980
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

131
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,460
No.

132
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,150
Jeong Yeong Jae just has a bad temper. There's no way...

133
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,580
she's just let herself go.

134
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,690
Look at this woman!

135
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
Geez.

136
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,250
I actually couldn't get it.

137
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,470
We made many requests, but...

138
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,590
You're from Myeongseong University Hospital, right? I'm looking for Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae of the surgery department.

139
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,180
Oh.

140
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,660
You're Dr. Jeong's fiancé, right?

141
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,150
You came to the executive director's publishing party.

142
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,550
Yes. I'm Jeong Yeong Jae's fiancé.

143
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,000
Jeong Yeong Jae.

144
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,360
Jeong Yeong Jae.

145
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,390
Jeong Yeong Jae!

146
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,190
My feeling toward Kang San Hyeok?

147
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,680
Gosh.

148
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,350
What's there to examine?

149
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,050
I already have no feelings for him.

150
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,760
I really hate a man who keeps going back and forth.

151
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,280
He says he doesn't want me. So?

152
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,720
That I'm interfering.

153
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,600
Gosh.

154
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,360
Why did he show up there?

155
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:58,630
He doesn't want me, but he doesn't want anyone else to have me. How greedy!

156
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,070
He's so bad!

157
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,200
Hey, Kang San Hyeok, don't you live like that.

158
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,490
You'll go to hell that way!

159
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,860
♬ I try saying anything. ♬

160
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,290
♬ Rather than what you want ♬

161
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,550
That woman is crazy.

162
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,380
No matter how much I hurt her, how could she see that guy who looks like an aged eel?

163
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,690
You have no idea how much I waited for this day.

164
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,660
I missed you, Jin Woo.

165
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,470
Come on!

166
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,390
♬ We will sit and face each other blankly ♬

167
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,760
♬ We can fall in love ♬

168
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,810
Please comfort me, Jin Woo.

169
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:16,650
I went through so much because of that crazy guy, Kang San Hyeok. Gosh!

170
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,380
Geez, I'm going nuts here!

171
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,910
♬ That is how I want just you ♬

172
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,850
♬ Only you in my heart ♬

173
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,190
♬ Wu - - Ah - ♬

174
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,390
♬ Only you always in my heart ♬

175
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,290
♬ Wu - - Ah - ♬

176
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,120
♬ Will you come to me? ♬

177
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,360
Director. Director.

178
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,900
Why don't you take a sip of your warm soup?

179
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,670
My tongue feels prickly.

180
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,850
It's so strange.

181
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,510
This resembles that. Being lovesick.

182
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,680
Who in the world turned you this way, Director?

183
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,400
This looks like someone who witnessed his girlfriend cheating on him

184
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,340
and is fending off the shock with your entire body

185
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,600
What an appropriate but tiresome expression.

186
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,690
Well, I mean. I'm saying it because there's no way that's it.

187
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,640
Lovesick? You, Director? Nonsense.

188
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,020
You never even glance at a woman. You're like a walking Buddha.

189
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,870
Shut up.

190
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,140
If you're done, prepare to get back to Korea. Don't mess up the meetings.

191
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,850
Yes, I got it.

192
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,820
Jeong Yeong Jae

193
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,600
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

194
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,950
She blocked me?

195
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,200
- Jeong Yeong Jae...
- Yeong Jae.

196
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,200
Here are some materials that might be helpful for you on PTSD.

197
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,010
I also saved some files on a USB. Take a look at it.

198
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,260
What are they doing?

199
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,540
I'll accept it since it's work. Thanks.

200
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,690
She's going with that jerk again?

201
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,450
You'll be late.

202
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,800
Hong Kong

203
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,260
Chairman Hwang Seok Ho of Haeseong Precision

204
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,690
has already agreed to support me with funding on this.

205
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,380
Chairman Hwang did?

206
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,590
Seoul

207
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,590
Chairman Hwang's cash support. You know it already.

208
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,670
We've won this already.

209
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,180
You'll be investing about five times more.

210
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,520
- Welcome.
- Aigoo!

211
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,400
Thanks to you, we get to have a village party.

212
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,830
Aigoo, we have an excuse for us to all get-together. Isn't this nice?

213
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,370
Are we strangers or something?

214
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,750
- We're not strangers.
- Enjoy!

215
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,340
Oh, that. Give me all the things that you wrote down.

216
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,610
- Here you go.
- It feels like my birthday.

217
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,360
Our village will prosper.

218
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,420
Nice handwriting.

219
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,860
Aigoo.

220
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,830
You need more meat.

221
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,570
There.

222
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,160
Oh, ma'am...

223
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,310
You know that ahjumma from long time ago. Do you know how she is now?

224
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,200
The kid who started the fire.

225
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,330
His grandmother and you were pretty close.

226
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,590
Did you ever hear from her ever since they ran away in the middle of the night?

227
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,850
No way. She cut off contact completely. I have no idea whether she's dead or alive.

228
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,420
Then, do you remember that child's name?

229
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,200
Why do you ask me that all of a sudden?

230
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,520
It’s been a long time since we all got together,

231
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,390
and it reminded me of our old village that burned down.

232
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,670
What was that child’s name? Do you remember?

233
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,580
I don’t know. Was he a Kim?

234
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,970
Or maybe a Kang?

235
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,610
Kang?

236
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,850
Director, the Miryeong residents are refusing to sell their land.

237
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,580
Wasn’t the date of sale today?

238
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,500
Yes. But all of a sudden, they said they will side with Miryeong Forestry’s Choi Jeong Mok.

239
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,790
Mr. Choi is obviously against selling. He even got the people to sign a form.

240
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,740
Go to Miryeong and meet with Choi Jeong Mok right now.

241
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,410
You must make him sell the land. Before Taeseong Group takes it.

242
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,560
Yes, sir.

243
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,570
Manila

244
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,920
And there’s a massive change in blood color after the insulin therapy.
 Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health

245
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,380
As you can see on the left side, it’s strawberry milk like blood before the insulin therapy.

246
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,100
The comparison between a normal brain and a brain with Alzheimer’s.

247
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,520
One of the most important changes in public health is our brain.

248
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,430
Here’s a picture of villagers in Bangladesh. And in this village...

249
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:37,170
The initial cause was unclear due to discrepancies of the onset as well as the differences in the diagnosis.

250
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,990
However, patients who were presenting more symptoms on their skin, increased.

251
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,910
Particularly, in this village.

252
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,120
And this village has a history of manufacturing pesticides.

253
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,040
Why don’t you switch specialties, Dr. Cha?

254
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,950
Hitting on woman has become your habit.

255
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,040
You’re not qualified at all to listen to your patients.

256
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,030
I will reflect deeply about my qualifications.

257
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,800
However... I’m sorry to hear that’s what you think of Dr. Jeong.

258
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,360
Dr. Jeong is not that kind of person.

259
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,280
She’s not the type of person, you can just hit on.

260
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,480
If you’re not hitting on her, then...

261
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,030
are you saying you’ll go back to Yeong Jae?

262
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,550
Yes, I will.

263
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,150
Yeong Jae rejected you and your advances.

264
00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:00,180
But you still act obsessed and give out orders. I will return to her and keep you away.

265
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,480
There is one thing that remains true. Facts don’t lie.

266
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,230
Saying it’s for Jeong Yeong Jae. The true fact about you, is that you’re a cowardly betrayer.

267
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:18,820
That means... you are unable to go back to her.

268
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,360
I’ll prevent it and keep watch, on you.

269
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,540
Don’t look at her, and don’t even listen to her breathe.

270
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,150
I won’t let anyone. Especially you of all people. Don’t even dream of it.

271
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,290
Do you understand, betrayer?

272
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,530
Director, Chairman Hwang just left the hotel to meet other investors. What should we do?

273
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,190
Do you know where he went?

274
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,320
Alright. I’ll go after him.

275
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:16,500
One of the most important changes in public health is our brain. It cannot function without it.

276
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,360
Therefore, the study of Alzheimer’s disease has been increasingly...

277
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,950
Sir, it’s Kang San Hyeok.

278
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,020
An important meeting is coming up, but my phantom pain has returned.

279
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,580
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae knows my symptoms very well,

280
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,420
and she’s here for the conference. May I borrow her?

281
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,640
The conference isn’t even over yet, it’s not funny.

282
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,370
Forget the conference. Didn’t the hospital president tell you to take care for me?

283
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,670
I’m not joking. My arm really hurts.

284
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,260
So then, where are you taking me with a hurt arm?

285
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,990
I dislike your attitude. I’m not telling.

286
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,050
What’s a rescue member doing here on vacation?

287
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,890
You realized it. This is what I did before joining the squad.

288
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,590
I’m finishing up a project I had started. Don’t tell the squad.

289
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,800
It doesn’t matter to me what you are.

290
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,920
I like that attitude. Indifference.

291
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,420
Then, I’m off to be a manager for a bit.

292
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,520
You got the proxies signed already?

293
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,530
Hong Kong’s Chairman Song, Spain’s Chairman Abala,

294
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,130
and two Chairman Kim’s from Seoul, have signed them.

295
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,580
All the shareholders are wanting to join our fund.

296
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,860
The longer we wait, the sooner Kwon Ju Han will figure it out.

297
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,930
It’s time to make a decision, Chairman.

298
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,150
I never go back on my word.

299
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:30,190
Bring me the proxies from all the shareholders needed to create the fund.

300
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,860
If you can’t, our conversation never happened.

301
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,330
Chairman, it’s better to save time-

302
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,990
Goodbye.

303
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,800
Will you just stand there?

304
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,410
If you’re finished, then let’s go.

305
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,780
Chairman!

306
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,300
Stop, it’s a respiratory obstruction.

307
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,760
Food is stuck in his throat.

308
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,930
I need your help. You’ve learned the Heimlich maneuver.
 “Heimlich Maneuver: A first aid measure to help when food has blocked the airway.”

309
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,470
It’s my first time though.

310
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:47,750
Put your fist between his belly button and solar plexus and pull upward.

311
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,230
Lay him on the ground.
