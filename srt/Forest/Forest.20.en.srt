Episode 20

2
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,810
Let’s go over there.

3
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,750
♬ each other blankly ♬

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,410
♬ We can fall in love ♬

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,970
♬ Even doing nothing at all I feel good ♬

6
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,200
Tell me what you want. Today, I’ll do anything you want.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,110
Anything, but returning to the conference.

8
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,370
You’re not eating?

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,690
Today, you’re enjoying your food more than usual. It’s my first time seeing you eat this well.

10
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,090
Is that so?

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,660
I saved someone. I did a good deed, and it worked up my appetite.

12
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,030
It’s my first time eating in this kind of place.

13
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,050
First time?

14
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,300
There are night markets and restaurants everywhere, and it’s your first time?

15
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,640
I never went anywhere for fun.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,230
- What is it to have fun?
- What?

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,280
Now that I’m thinking of it, I’ve never traveled for fun.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,590
I’ve never done anything that wasn't to be evaluated by others.

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,270
Traveling and drinking.

20
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,770
Even sleep was all about work.

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,220
How can you live like that?

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,620
So that means you’ve never relaxed, even for a moment.

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,680
You were busy every second of every day.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,100
Why should I relax? I’d fall behind.

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,190
I don’t like having fun anyway. It’s not a problem at all.

26
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,610
You must get him to speak or bring up memories, that are hidden way down deep.

27
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,790
That’s the beginning.

28
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,990
I will accomplish my goal. Until I do...

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
I won’t look at anything else.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,310
Not at my lost memories.

31
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,890
And not at you.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
That’s a lie.

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,230
What? Lie?

34
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,050
It’s not true.

35
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,220
I see how you harass and bother people, Kang San Hyeok.

36
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,700
You just love to play around and have fun.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,840
Should we see if I’m right or wrong?

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,790
♬ When you look me, I don’t know what I’m doing ♬

39
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,290
♬ Used to love me ♬

40
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,920
Let’s go.

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,590
Gosh.

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,630
We’re not kids, so why ride this?

43
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,940
You said you’d do anything I wanted.

44
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,280
Wow. How is it?

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,060
I hate things like this. It’s childish.

46
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,480
- Awesome.
- This is amazing.

47
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,230
Can we go back now? I’m so tried!

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,060
One should be careful around kids.

49
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,690
How fun!

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,170
How’s your arm?

51
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,780
It’s not going to hurt?

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,560
It won’t

53
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,990
It shouldn’t do it here.

54
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,620
It’s a wishing tree.

55
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,790
They look like lanterns. So pretty.

56
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,920
You must like cringey and sentimental things?

57
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,390
Things like this, remind me of my mom.

58
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,890
We weren’t Buddhists,

59
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,920
but my mom would hang a lantern every year,

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,220
with my name on it, in a temple on Buddha’s birthday.

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,370
Whenever we went for the free rice cakes,

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,130
I’d look up at all the hanging lanterns.

63
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,910
Jeong Yeong Jae.

64
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,130
My name was up there.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,640
She wished for my health and for my happiness.

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,990
My mom did that.

67
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,840
After my mom passed away, I would see lanterns hanging on the street

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,140
and would think, "Oh, I see the mothers' prayers are up."

69
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,520
"I no longer have a mom that will write my name."

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,450
I felt that way.

71
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,060
Fine, I'll do it.

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,320
You're straight up asking me to hang a ribbon for you.

73
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,970
Let's go.

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,690
I've really wanted to do this.

75
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,730
- What did you write?
- None of your business.

76
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,790
To live a long and healthy life and fulfill all my wishes. What about you?

77
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,850
To make my name known and be successful.

78
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,820
Oh, I see.

79
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,440
♬ Suddenly ♬

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,540
♬ Like a tree that has grown, you're always there  ♬

81
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,360
♬ Always ♬

82
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,360
♬ Always ♬

83
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,550
♬ your warm breath ♬

84
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,180
♬ fills me up  ♬

85
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,100
This is my room. Go to sleep in your room.

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,220
This is my room. You go.

87
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:39,850
♬ Like a day that will never come back to me ♬

88
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,600
♬ Always ♬

89
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,370
♬ Always ♬

90
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,630
♬ Only your warm breath ♬

91
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,000
♬ fills me up ♬

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,900
♬ Because I will love you ♬

93
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,860
♬ Like days that will never come back to me ♬

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,270
♬ Because I will love you ♬

95
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,260
♬ I love you ♬

96
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:24,190
♬ Like always, always ♬

97
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,820
♬ Wait for me ♬

98
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,010
♬ On that radiant day ♬

99
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,900
♬ Hold me in your arms ♬

100
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,680
♬ Because I will love you ♬

101
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,120
♬ Like days that will never come back to me ♬

102
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:54,100
♬ Because I will love you ♬

103
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,860
♬ I love you, I love you ♬

104
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,470
Hyeong Soo

105
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,480
Director, President Hwang approved it.

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,600
He says he was able to avert a crisis thanks to your fiancée and is grateful.

107
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,230
You're so thorough. You caught on right away that something was wrong with President Hwang's breathing.

108
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,420
Isn't that why you took Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae, just in case?

109
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,070
Anyways, it was a stroke of genius pretending Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae was your fiancée.

110
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,310
Hello? Director?

111
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,240
Hello, Professor. I'm Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae of Seoul Myeongseong University Hospital.

112
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,160
Can I ask you something?

113
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,990
Both of these people have a different illness,

114
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,140
but they have something in common.

115
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,180
They used groundwater from the mountain behind their village as drinking water for a very long time.

116
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,740
Can this be a similar case with what you've been researching?

117
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm not too sure. It's hard to say with only two cases.

118
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,230
Have you tested the water?

119
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,970
The thing is...

120
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,270
everything was in the normal range on the test.

121
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,530
I can't be too sure, but if it were me, I'd test the water one more time.

122
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,460
The results can be vary depending on

123
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,870
when you collected the samples and the level of rainfall.

124
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,180
Jeong Yeong Jae.

125
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,290
Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please leave a message after the tone.

126
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,660
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae said she was leaving and took all her bags.

127
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,260
By any chance...

128
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,330
What about Psychiatrist Cha Jin Woo?

129
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,800
Dr. Cha Jin Woo left with her after the lecture.

130
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,790
No, no. I said to look here.

131
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,350
Do you see it? What kind of hole do you think this is, Sunbaenim?

132
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,880
Hey, do you know how many holes there are in the mountains?

133
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,290
It might be a mole or snake hole.

134
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,780
Is it an anaconda for the hole to be this big?

135
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,710
Take a closer look at it!

136
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,360
Yes, Detective Kim. I was just about to call you. Have you gotten the results?

137
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,540
No saliva was detected on the cigarette butt.

138
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,510
I think they lit it to smoke, but ended up throwing it out and running away.

139
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,450
It's not a cigarette, Detective Kim.

140
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,060
When I caught them there was a big explosion and there was a lot of white smoke.

141
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,230
Neither of them had a cigarette in their hand.

142
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,500
Anyways, there was no saliva or fingerprints on the butt.

143
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,600
The only thing we found are footprints, but the prints are from common hiking shoes

144
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,400
so it's hard to say it belongs to the culprits.

145
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,500
Okay. Well, please let me know if you find anything else.

146
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,930
Enforcement Officer Oh, why did you submit such a report?

147
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,090
Why are you saying to investigate a scene that doesn't exist?

148
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,270
What are you saying? Why is there no scene?

149
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,300
I took pictures and included them in the report.

150
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,390
Go check and see if it's there.

151
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,750
You made me go for nothing! Jeez!

152
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,330
Where are you going now?

153
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,820
What? Why isn't it here?

154
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,630
It was definitely here.

155
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,680
Why isn't it here?

156
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,940
So tell me what your conditions are. We can't negotiate like this.

157
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,770
There is no condition. Why do you keep asking me the condition for selling.

158
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,530
Our neighborhood is the child we won't sell for money.

159
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,470
You're a businessman, are you going to continue being this way?

160
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,920
How much do you want?

161
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,800
Hey. Tell the owner to come.

162
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,330
Not you, but the real owner.

163
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,950
I'll only negotiate with the real owner.

164
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,730
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,160
The deadline you've given has already passed.

166
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,350
Yes, it has.

167
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,300
Why did you do that, Director?

168
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,150
Is this such a demanding business?

169
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,980
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,870
Due to the limitations of having to proceed quietly... I'll take care of it right away, Sr. Managing Director.

171
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,300
If you speak in that tone, your opponent will be startled.

172
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,130
It makes the mood serious when I didn't say it was serious.

173
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,680
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,850
I really sorry, President.

175
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,390
Put your head up.

176
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,890
So, when will you bring me, Miryeong Forest?

177
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,690
It's fishy. Something smells very fishy.

178
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,550
I'm positive it wasn't a naturally created hole,

179
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,890
but one that was drilled very deeply using a machine.

180
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,850
And it just vanished?

181
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,690
Why? Who?

182
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,650
I'm so darn curious!

183
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,530
What are you so curious about?

184
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,670
Here.
Today's our day 1. Milky skin Oh Bo Mi.

185
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,110
What's with the flowers?

186
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,250
Today is our first day of having a personal relationship. I can't let a historical day just go by.

187
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,490
This is the "day 1" I've only heard about.

188
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,920
Milky skin Oh Bo Mi. This is insane!

189
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,360
I've received flowers so many times, but I'll accept them since you brought them.

190
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,460
Chang. Who is there that can avoid all the security cameras

191
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,010
in the forest and get to that site?

192
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,200
Is that even possible?

193
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,980
Unless it's a county office employee or villager who knows where all the cameras are.

194
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,900
All the villagers are elders, it isn't possible.

195
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,290
They don't know where the cameras are located.

196
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,920
There is one person.

197
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,110
A person who knows all the nooks and crannies of Miryeong Forest.

198
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,840
Miryeong Forestry President Choi Jeong Mok.

199
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,250
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,220
It slipped my mind.

201
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,570
No, you're right.

202
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,500
A person who knows all the nooks and crannies of Miryeong Forest.

203
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,890
Kang San Hyeok

204
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,880
Where did you go without saying a word?

205
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,690
Where are you? Call me.

206
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,110
I'm not feeling well.

207
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,700
Did President Hwang's fund registration go well?

208
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,590
Yes. I took care of everything as you instructed. But what did you in the hotel at night?

209
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,450
Do you know I couldn't reach you for 15 hours?

210
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,520
You were reachable for a moment and then I couldn't reach you again.

211
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,070
I slept.

212
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,500
You slept?

213
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,440
A person who says there isn't enough time to make money and only sleeps for 4 hours, slept for 15 hours?

214
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,820
You're right.

215
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,070
I don't think I've ever slept for more than 5 hours since grade school.

216
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,730
You must have felt at ease enough to let down your guard.

217
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,600
Is it because of President Hwang's issue being resolved?

218
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,450
Hello? Director?

219
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,910
What's the point.

220
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,050
Here you go.

221
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,490
Water test request

222
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,190
- Please take good care of this.
- Yes, of course.

223
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,300
Tomorrow's Environment

224
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,570
Shouldn't you apologize to me?

225
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,730
You just left like that and haven't said a word to me.

226
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,820
You only apologize to someone who deserves it.

227
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,880
What do you mean?

228
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,610
Nothing.

229
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,500
I don't want to speak to someone whose body cells are filled with lies.

230
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,790
What do you mean?

231
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,720
Even if I am selfish, you should explain so I understand.

232
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,740
I said I don't want to talk.

233
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,690
Let me ask you something.

234
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,170
Did you leave without a word because of Cha Jin Woo?

235
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,670
Did you go to meet Cha Jin Woo?

236
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,810
Yes.

237
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,900
Fire Extinguisher Checklist

238
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,390
To be healthy and happy

239
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,990
My mom hung it up for me.

240
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,600
Kang Sang Hyeok
To make my name known and be successful.

241
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,590
Do you know I couldn't reach you for 15 hours?

242
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,500
You were reachable for a moment and then I couldn't reach you again.

243
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,550
When you couldn't reach me at the hotel for 15 hours,

244
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:42,820
what do you mean I was reachable for a moment? I have no recollection of talking to you.

245
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,850
I did?

246
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,980
What did you say to me?

247
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,680
Team Leader. I hurt my hand and need to go to the hospital.

248
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,720
Hurt? Where?

249
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,610
Is Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae here?

250
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,850
Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae had an engagement and just left for Seoul.

251
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:44,730
I don't want to speak to someone whose

252
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,790
body cells are filled with lies.

253
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,300
I said you did a good job pretending Dr. Jeong Yeong Jae was your fiancée.

254
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,720
Gangsin Express

255
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,860


256
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,090
Your call cannot be completed as dialed, please leave a message after the tone.

257
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,840
Mom will be right back.

258
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,550
I'll be right back, so stay put right here.

259
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,110
I'll be right back, so stay put right here.

260
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,390
You can't go anywhere, understood?

261
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,030
Mom! Mom!

262
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,520
What are you doing?

263
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,840
Kang San Hyeok?

264
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,870
What is wrong with that person?

265
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,640
Kang San Hyeok!

266
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,320
Mom!

267
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,070
Mom.

268
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,920
Tell your kid.

269
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,290
Tell your kid!

270
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,440
Tell him you're not coming back, so not to wait for you.

271
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,320
You have to tell him.

272
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,840
If you're going to abandon him, you have to do that for him.

273
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,090
So your kid won't wait and he understands that you're never coming back.

274
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:07,300
So he knows that he won't be able to meet you even after he dies!

275
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,910
I left something behind so I came to get it.

276
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,240
Mom.

277
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,270
Take my car, I need to go for a walk.

278
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,280
I need to take a walk as well.

279
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,840
I'll move out tomorrow.

280
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,660
Okay.

281
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,080
Does it not affect you at all?

282
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,330
I'm no longer surprised by anything you say.

283
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,060
"Are you happy to see with your own eyes that I'm a patient?"

284
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,500
It's time for you to say this line.

285
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,840
You've been caught, so it's time for you to run away.

286
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,840
Don't go to that bastard.

287
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,020
I'll admit that I need help and won't say things that aren't true.

288
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,840
So don't go to that bastard. Stay with me.

289
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,040
I'll refuse.

290
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,810
Do you like Cha Jin Woo that much?

291
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,720
No. I can't trust you, Kang San Hyeok.

292
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,760
What do I have to do for you to trust me?

293
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,930
I know you.

294
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,920
You can't throw out that thick wall you've put up.

295
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,590
- You–
- I've told you many lies.

296
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:31,320
I didn't quit my job as a director and I went to the Philippines because of money.

297
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,830
I won't lie to you ever again so give me another chance.

298
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,130
Even if I want to, I can't do that.

299
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:53,060
I know too well that you can never open up to me.

300
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,910
Because I'm that type of person.

301
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,510
It's best that we don't continue our relationship.

302
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,840
We both can't do it.

303
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,500
What's this on your hand? What's wrong with it?

304
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,380
When I was 10 years old

305
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:44,280
my mom abandoned me at that bus terminal, called my grandmother and then left.

306
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,630
She told her to come get her grandchild.

307
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:54,390
My father who died when I was in high school, I've only seen a handful of times

308
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,660
including the time at the funeral.

309
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,520
Why am I telling you this?

310
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,540
So that you pity me.

311
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:14,910
Jeong Yeong Jae, you're a kind person. If you can't trust me then pity me instead.

312
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,690
Don't distance yourself from me. Stay by my side.

313
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:34,360
You're a person who can only see the goals you set.

314
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,790
I'm afraid of the obvious result.

315
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,790
No. I won't go down the obvious road.

316
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,670
I've realized that without Jeong Yeong Jae, I have no goal.

317
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,700
Stay by my side and be my goal.

318
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,550
I need you.

319
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:08,170
♬ Suddenly, like a tree that has grown, you're always there ♬

320
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,340

I'll be good to you.

I'll repent and repay you forever.

328
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,520
- So let's–
- Jin Woo.

329
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,840
I think I love Kang San Hyeok.

330
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,320
Whether he's good to me or not, or what he thinks of me...

331
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,230
All my cells are yearning for him.

Sadness and happiness

334
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,640
are burrowing in my heart.

♬ Always ♬

336
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,370
I came to see you so I can tell you this.

♬ Always ♬

338
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,280
Thank you, Jin Woo.

339
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,340
♬ Yes, with your warm breaths, ♬

340
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,030
For giving me the opportunity to have these kinds of feelings.

341
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,760
For betraying me.

342
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,860
♬ Because I will love you ♬

343

Forest Preview

354
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,180
She's just too pretty.

355
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,320
What is wrong with him?

356
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,190
How do you plan to return to Seoul when you're so head over heels?

357
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,460
What about Kang San Hyeok?

358
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,160
What is that?

359
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,500
That bastard, Kang.

360
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,060
Since the real owner of Naseong came to see you as you requested, let me take care of what you cannot resolve with just money.

361
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,660
I had no idea Kang San Hyeok would do such a thing.

362
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,830
I hope you make it so that I never have to hear the name Kang San Hyeok again.

363
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,060
I'll take care of it.

364
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,350
♬ I love you ♬
