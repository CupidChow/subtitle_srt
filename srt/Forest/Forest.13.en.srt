2
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,080
♬ The chaos which unfolds in front of me ♬

3
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,150
So should I cry?

4
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,010
The time we broke up? Am I supposed to cry about that?

5
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,660
Although it might sound strange, but did you care as little as that?

6
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,020
I was the one who got dumped so why are you mad?

7
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,850
I'm not angry...

8
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,940
Did you like me?

9
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,720
What are you so unhappy about?

10
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,630
Saying you wanted to go out with me and then setting up an impassable wall.

11
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,140
Have I set up a wall?

12
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,070
Doesn't dating someone and liking each other mean getting close and becoming an important person to each other?

13
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,330
You hate that. The feeling of developing our relationship.

14
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,940
If we are starting to make progress, you'll use that and make us back away.

15
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,370
I want my girlfriend to look at me with more special eyes

16
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,310
Just how I look at you.

17
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,400
I do focus on you. Why do you keep saying that I don't?

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,110
So can you tell me you love me?

19
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,290
Have you ever said it?

20
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,210
♬ Take me now ♬

21
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,250
I get it. You chose to break up so I'll respect your decision.

22
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,350
What the hell have I

23
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,600
♬ Towards the light which shines on me ♬

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,800
been doing with you that whole time?

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,550
♬ Please take me now ♬

26
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,240
Are you sure that you don't want to go with me?

27
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,400
Your heart sounded like it was on a roller coaster.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,670
Are you sure you won't pass out?

29
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,050
Whether he is bragging or not, why did I ever played a true-false game?

30
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,340
Did you stay overnight here because of the rescued patient?

31
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,350
I don't know. I must have gone crazy.

32
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,020
Why is she like this?

33
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,250
What is it? That cringey look?

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Breathalyzer Record
Kang San Hyeok None

35
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,620
Good morning, Subaenims.

36
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,370
Hyung, is your shoulder okay?

37
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,580
What? I told you to take a break. Why are you at work?

38
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,290
Now that I'm eligible for award, how can I take a break for my shoulder?

39
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,430
An award citation?

40
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,950
I saved a colleague's life in the spirit of a saint sacrificing himself but I shouldn't be given one?

41
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,040
Well then, it should be given to me as someone who is on probation.

42
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,150
Saving one's life, my foot.

43
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,930
How is it saving someone’s life when some materials just fell from the ceiling?

44
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,920
You're bragging too much.

45
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,880
After being injured and hospitalized, you disappeared without a word. Why did you leave?

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,540
Something urgent happened.

47
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,790
You've lost your position as the ace rescuer to me.

48
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,800
Do you think the rescue team is some kind of neighborhood foot volleyball team? Someone on probation rashly mentions the ace?

49
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,460
Aigoo, it's time to take a med.

50
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,610
Our Yeong Jae, prescribed me these with love, wishing a speedy recovery.

51
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,560
Do what you wanna do.

52
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,730
As I'm enjoying several victories, I can take it to some extent.

53
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,010
Victory? What kind of victory?

54
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,530
I have some kind of victory.

55
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,080
What is that satisfyingly bragging look?

56
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,540
What is it? It's suspicious.

57
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,060
- Member Yang?
- I didn't see him.

58
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,990
He must have forgotten. Take him to me.

59
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,980
Cheol Sik admires this lecturer the most.

60
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,560
Member Yang!

61
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,060
Member Yang!

62
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,420
Yang Sunbae?

63
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,140
Crew member Yang, the guest lecture is about to begin.

64
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,220
Yang Sunbae?

65
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,540
I don’t think he heard you.

66
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:15,360
Oh, sorry. I’m just so used to checking that my colleagues got the information they need, I was meddling.

67
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,010
I don’t know who you are, but this isn’t a rescue.

68
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,980
I’ve told him multiple times, it’s his responsibility now.

69
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,210
Making others remind you about the lecture, it’s an inconvenience.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,780
Team Leader Jeong?

71
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,030
You are Team Leader Jeong, right?

72
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,170
I have heard a lot about you. It is an honor to meet you, Team Leader.

73
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,750
An honor? What??

74
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,690
Let’s go to the lecture hall, I’ll take you there.

75
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,060
Please go this way.

76
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,630
- Yes, I’ll escort you.
- Is it this way?

77
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,050
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,060
Team Leader Jeong?

79
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,580
He is someone who turned down a promotion and comfortable office position,

80
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,890
to volunteer to work in Mountain Rescue and be in the field for over 20 years.

81
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,390
Please welcome, Team Leader Jeong Byeong Yeong, a living legend of Unam Rescue Squad 6.

82
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,110
Nice to meet you all.

83
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,700
Th man we had to rescue was stuck between the rocks, so we were unable to see him.

84
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,690
In cases like this, it’s very important to check how much battery is left in the cell phone,

85
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,840
of the person you’re rescuing.

86
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,590
In his case, he had about 4% left.

87
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,420
So I asked this person to turn off the phone.

88
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,370
Then after getting him to send a few texts,

89
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,580
I carefully approached him.

90
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,730
The mountain rescue squad does everything on foot without using helicopters.

91
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,520
It is so difficult and dangerous that everyone avoids working there long-term.

92
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,940
Is there a reason you volunteered to work there for over 20 years?

93
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,450
What made that possible? I really want to know.

94
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,800
Well....

95
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,090
I just liked this job.

96
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:34,520
About 20 years ago... I responded to a scene where a family attempted suicide together.

97
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,990
When we got there, the parents were already completely submerged and suffocated.

98
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,210
There was also a little girl, who wasn’t moving either.

99
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,310
When I pulled her out of the car and held her...

100
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,720
I could feel her heart beating.

101
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:01,850
However, I knew that it would stop before I could get her out of the water.

102
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,120
So I quickly took my oxygen mask off, put it on her, and then swam and got her out of the water.

103
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,690
And from my heart, I said this to the child...

104
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,670
Thank you.

105
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,270
Thanks for surviving.

106
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,880
You are such a great child to overcome this.

107
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Please hold on more.

108
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,140
And then surprisingly, she opened her eyes and starred at me.

109
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,430
Just like she heard my mind.

110
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,630
How grateful it was...

111
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,460
Her eyes starring at me...

112
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,140
Little hands holding me tightly...

113
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,490
I still remember that feeling.

114
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,160
I think that's the reason

115
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,680
why I couldn't leave this field.

116
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,420
It is about his adopted daughter's story in his essay.

117
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,560
What’s the matter?

118
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,260
Look at that!

119
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,180
Do you know what it is?

120
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,480
You like it, don't you?

121
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,560
Wait, what is this? What’s this?

122
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,960
I found this!

123
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,890
Do you want this?

124
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,990
Ta-Da!

125
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,960
You’ll need to come back to remove the stitches.

126
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,310
- Does it hurt here?
- Yes.

127
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,680
What about here?

128
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,160
This part hurts too, right?

129
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,370

There is no record of transfers to the outside of Seoul.

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,740
Why do I have a memory about Miryeong Forest?

135
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,710
My parents whom I even don't remember at all have no presence.

136
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,980
There's just blank on the record.

137
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,730
Who am I supposed to ask?

138
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,270
What these things are...

139
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:56,010
How did I know they were inside of that tree? Is this just a coincidence?

140
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,170
Everything is just coincidence, grandma?

What is this? We are not in a relationship where we can call each other.

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,530
I know you are embarrassed but come here quickly.

144
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,270
Embarrassed? Who is embarrassed? What is the matter?

145
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,620
I’ll say nothing happened, so just hurry back.

146
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,820
I have to shower!

147
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,900
This guy! Why do I need to hurry because you need to take a shower? That’s ridiculous!

148
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,890
What are you thinking?

149
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,590
My boiler is broken but the repairman is going to come and fix it tomorrow.

150
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,560
Let me use your bathroom.

151
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,990
Just skip the shower until tomorrow.

152
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,820
Do you regard my house as a public sauna?

153
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,550
Or just use the bathroom as the door is not locked.

154
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,710
Public sauna?

155
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,360
I bet she couldn't expect me to come here!

156
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,970
Password?

157
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,530
Would it be the same as before?

158
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,020
Yes, the house should be like this for my princess.

159
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,860
It looks good.

160
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,010
Oh, dear.

161
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,810
What’s that?

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,040
I wanted to surprise her, but I’m too late.

163
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,490
She's already here.

164
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,340
My daughter’s clothes.

165
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,720
There.

166
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,220
Aren't you finished yet, Jeong Yeong Jae?

167
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,000
What is it?

168
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,810
You must be surprised! Come out!

169
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,630
Your dad is here!

170
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,010
D..dad??

171
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,960
Dad? No way...

172
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,920
Ta-Da! Our princess’ favorite seaweed chips...

173
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,620
Dad? Dad!

174
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,630
Let's eat!

175
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,930
You’re not criminals. Hurry and eat.

176
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,440
What’s wrong with living with together?

177
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,440
We're not living together! We are just living in a connected house.

178
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,530
It’s really not like that. It’s just that his furnace broke down.

179
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,940
So, it’s really nothing at all, and you still hid it from me?

180
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,940
Nice... Very nice...

181
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,700
I...I didn't intend to deceive you...

182
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,080
There was no need to talk about it.

183
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,680
Why are you hiding your mouth by the way?

184
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,170
Just like a person who kissed to someone.

185
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,030
Food is stuck in your throat, hurry and have some soup.

186
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,330
How cold it must’ve been, being naked like that.

187
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,010
Ye-Yes... Team Leader Jeong.

188
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,170
You know, I thought I was an open-minded person.

189
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:50,970
But today, I now know what it’s like to feel the urge to kill.

190
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,850
Where are you going? You have no sense of humor.

191
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,350
Sit back down.

192
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,120
If you run from the table, you’ll be hungry for the rest of your life.

193
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,240
Hurry and eat.

194
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,650
Alright, here. I dried and fried these myself.

195
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,220
It’s our Yeong Jae’s favorite. Here, try it.

196
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,690
Our Princess, here you go!

197
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,500
Hurry and eat. Have some fish as well.

198
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,190
Eat.

199
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,890
- It’s good.
- Right?

200
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,850
So, how long have you been in the rescue squad?

201
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,380
A little over two months.

202
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,910
- Is it worth it?
- Yes.

203
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,400
Hey. Don’t let her drink too much water.

204
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,130
She’ll pee a lot.

205
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,430
What?

206
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,970
She wet her bed until she was 13 years old.

207
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,530
Dad! Until I was 3.

208
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,840
Don’t lie. I found her bed wet a few times until she was 13.

209
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,930
- How could a 13 year old—
- I wasn’t 13!

210
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,730
Have a red pepper. It’s delicious.

211
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,070
Not peppers.

212
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,920
- Why?
- I can’t eat spicy food.

213
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,980
- Dad, it’s spicy!
- No, I...

214
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,280
- Is it?
- What?
- Don’t.

215
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,750
Have one.

216
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,770
Stop it.

217
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,480
Does it make sense that we aren't staying the night after coming all this way?

218
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,780
I told you I have a morning shift. Team Leader Kim also came to see his mother.

219
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,770
It's already been decided that I'll be taking that car.

220
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,030
Look. There it is.

221
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,050
Hurry and go back in.

222
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,930
Team Leader.

223
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,540
I had a great time. Please take care of yourself.

224
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,860
Take care okay?

225
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,280
It would have been so much better if you just stayed the night.

226
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,990
In any case, the rescue team is all you care about.

227
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,580
What did I say was the most important thing when living this life?

228
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,700
Never back down?

229
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,440
Well the way I see it, it applies to relationships as well.

230
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,850
There is only something to gain if you go all the way without backing down from the war.

231
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,880
As long as you're not taking the other's happiness, what is there to be afraid of?

232
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,580
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

233
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,060
Just, I'm just saying that I believe in you.

234
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,200
Do you know how exceptional you are? Knowing that you take after me?

235
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,920
I am going.

236
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,270
Dad.

237
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,590
Call me often!

238
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,020
What was I doing all that time with you?

239
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,430
Consultants opposing removal of Miryeong 119 SRS

240
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,720
Here, too, they didn't answer.

241
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,060
Something is really fishy.

242
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,560
All the consultants and city council members who opposed moving the special rescue squad 119,

243
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,570
are all avoiding our calls. Like they’re colluding.

244
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,980
Then we’ll go catch them.

245
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,350
What? Where are you going?

246
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,030
Shouldn’t we hunt? The slimy evaders.

247
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:40,140
He left Naseong Development and went to work.

248
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,230
Yes, sir. I understand.

249
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,870
As you instructed, I put two fast guys on their tail.

250
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,830
Don’t lose them.

251
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,020
Do it right, and catch a rat.

252
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,780
1, 2

253
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,650
3, 4

254
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,430
Do it faster!

255
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,990
At this speed, when will you finish connecting it and spray the water?

256
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,960
8, 9, 10.

257
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,650
Again!

258
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,220
What? We did it within the time given?

259
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,930
The front part of this control head...
 “ Control Head: A pendulum control device for steering large freshwater bags for fire extinguishing”

260
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,780
It should be facing up when connected. Didn’t you learn this in firefighting school?

261
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,950
You don't like this feeling, huh? Again!

262
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,800
1

263
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,420
-2
-He didn't even tell me when he was going to start.

264
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,590
3

265
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,190
The golden time is going.

266
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,800
The very beginner is going to burn down the house.

267
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,330
Taesung

268
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,020
What is this? Isn't this Taesung Group?

269
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,420
Taesung group?

270
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,090
You come.

271
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,560
No... I just wanted to look around here. That's it.

272
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,300
Stop, stop, stop!

273
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,490
Why is your leg like this?

274
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,910
I have my knees swollen.

275
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,320
You're limping.

276
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,270
What? All the villagers are coming?

277
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,620
I don't want to get his treatment.

278
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,630
- You condescending jerk. I’ll rip your face off!
- Oh, wait. Calm down.

279
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,950
-Your leg! Let's start by going in.

280
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,850
You should walk slowly....

281
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,680
I’ll rip his face off!

282
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,230
Did I beg her to get treatments from me?

283
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,630
She said that!?

284
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,090
Until your knee got this swollen, you didn't come to the hospital? What have you been doing?

285
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,280
I didn't wanted to come here because of that guy outside.

286
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,190
That man is a total disgrace.

287
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:01,800
As he isn't kind to the elderly, no one wants to come here.

288
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,070
But I thought that you are not like him,

289
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,260
When I saw you're being kind to Jeong Bae's father.

290
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,850
You did well in coming.

291
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,220
Let's talk about it after taking an X-ray.

292
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,280
It just seems like a recurrence of your arthritis. So don’t worry too much.

293
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,660
There you go.

294
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,710
Is your hand also being abnormal? Is it shaking?

295
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,630
It's been like that. I must be because I drink a lot of coffee.

296
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,340
Is that so?

297
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,590
Yes, this is Miryeong Hospital. I am Doctor Jeong Yeongjae.

298
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,700
It's Gangwon Hospital.

299
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,090
The previous blood test results showed the presence of leucocytosis and blast cells. 
Leucocytosis: increase in number of white blood cells
Blast cell: myelogonic cells

300
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,310
The elder man whom we had a smear screening test done on, Heo Choon Shik? 
- Yes.

301
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,390
The results are out. It looks like acute leukemia, for sure.
 Leukemia: acute blook disease

302
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,460
Acute leukemia?

303
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,660
Ma’am, is Mr. Heo at home right now?

304
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,640
Jeonb Bae's father?

305
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,860
He is heading to his family house.

306
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,420
'Family house'? What is that?

307
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:29,100
Dr. Park should have come with us! How can I drive on this road when I hardly drive?

308
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,220
You do have the life insurance, right?

309
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,860
Don't you talk to me. Just look ahead.

310
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,220
I think it’s this way.

311
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,250
We didn’t used to live here, but across the mountain.

312
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,510
But our whole town burned downed due to a fire, so we moved here. 
- Mr. Heo!

313
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:03,990
It wasn’t just Jeong Bae’s father, but almost everyone used to live there. 
- Mr. Heo! Mr. Heo!

314
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,430
- How do you think he would have felt, 
- Sir, do you hear me?

315
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,550
- after seing his parents grave burn to dust like that? 
- Sir!

316
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,410
Mr. Heo Choon Shik!

317
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,210
Grandfather!

318
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,720
Grandfather, can you hear me?

319
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,070
Can you open your eyes?

320
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,510
We have got to give him a transfusion, right away. It's petechia.
 Petechia: a small red or purple spot caused by bleeding into the skin

321
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,220
We should go directly to the hospital.

322
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,450
Don't be surprised, Grandfather.

323
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,620
You are okay.

324
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,140
You are okay.

325
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,580
I am here.

326
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,430
You are okay.

327
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:06,590
Slowly, go slowly.

328
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,400
Be careful.

329
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,070
Watch your step.

330
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,570
Yes, this way.

331
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,560
“2nd floor under repair”

332
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,910
His name is Cho Yong Pil. He’s a new director Taesong Group brought in for the resort project.

333
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,180
He's known to have belonged to organized crime and when he gets involved in a business that seems utterly impossible,

334
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,560
things proceed flawlessly, so he's become quite infamous in the industry.

335
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,950
Anyone who stood in the way of his projects ended up dead, disguised as suicide.

336
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:01,470
No wonder. I thought he seemed quite a large scale of a character to be used as Chief Han.

337
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,670
They even took the professor away from the restaurant last time.

338
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,050
I mean, we took Naseong Development from them awhile ago. Why is Taeseong Group giving us all this trouble now?

339
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:15,230
A corporation like that would try to bargain the cost down to the penny. Have you ever seen those people pay more than the market price?

340
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,480
They looked down on Chief Han.

341
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,190
He's not the one to lead the project properly. So they probably thought Naseong Development would give it up at a lower cost.

342
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:30,760
But in the midst of that, I jumped in and brought it thus far. So, Taesung is in a rush.

343
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,970
Seeing how they've hired a gangster like him, I don't think Taesung would give up on Miryeong Forest but go all in.

344
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,120
What should we do? Looks like it'll be a headache.

345
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,760
We should hurry up and get out. Before those people do anything funky.

346
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,820
Starting today, operate headquarters 1 to full capacity. We'll put everyone in and speed up the Miryeong Forest business process as much as possible.

347
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,590
Yes, sir.

348
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,100
"In a little bit, episode 14 will be airing."
