00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,250
Episode 7

2
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,750
I finally know now.

3
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,380
That I can't return to Seoul.

4
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:06,600
I learned why I had to get this sentence after watching that woman earlier.

5
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,950
Do you want to date me? I don't even have anything to do.

6
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,480
I feel like you've done something bad like this multiple times, but this time, you'll have to take responsibility.

7
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,850
The only conclusion you came to after everything that happened yesterday was that you can't return to Seoul?

8
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,670
Shouldn't you be figuring out how to return to Seoul as soon as possible and crush them?

9
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,910
Why do I have to live being conscious of them?

10
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,870
I have no interest. I don't care if I crush them or whatever.

11
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:51,120
You have no respect. For yourself. At the very least, you shouldn't get stepped on.

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,500
Are you going to make Jeong Yeong Jae bow to people

13
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
who won't even look at her once?

14
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:05,730
I'm going to make you pay the consequence for treating yourself with no respect.

15
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,570
The thing you spat out... it's going to happen exactly like you said.

16
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,920
What do you mean by that?

17
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,990
Get ready to date.

18
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,300
Miryeong Hospital
- Yes?

19
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,780
Wow, what?!

20
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,150
The rumors have spread all throughout the hospital. What do you mean you're living with Kang San Hyeok?

21
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,700
Well, it is the same house, but it's separate-- ugh, whatever!

22
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,060
Anyway, it's not anything you're thinking.

23
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,980
What do you mean it's not? He said that you're his fiancée.

24
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,040
Wow, you're a pro. How can you get shipped with someone up in the mountains?

25
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,300
And with our VVIP?

26
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,370
When exactly did you two meet, and when did you go all the way there?

27
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,140
It's not that. Your VVIP and I have nothing to do with each other!

28
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,340
Anyway, I'm opposed to this marriage. He's a firefighter!

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,160
What?

30
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,090
Your temper. That temper isn't normal.

31
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,750
And you have such a dirty mouth. You hit men too.

32
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,930
Kang San Hyeok's aura is something else too. If those two tempers collide,

33
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,980
it's going to be a bad dog fight.

34
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,880
I oppose! Break up.

35
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,230
This dude... Hey, if you're going to talk nonsense, I'm hanging up.

36
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,810
And I guess you don't care about your come-back news now that you're with Mr. VVIP.

37
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,090
Come-back news?

38
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,660
That day, after you left,

39
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,770
apparently the directors asked how you're doing.

40
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,960
Your professor asked that you come to Seoul.

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,280
So do well, my friend. The more that the situation's like this, the more you should do something.

42
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,320
Hi, Sunbaenim. How would you like your coffee?

43
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,280
Hello!

44
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,780
- What is this?
- What?

45
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,610
What is this?

46
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,870
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

47
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,710
Hello, sir!

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
- Aren't you drinking it?
- Try it.

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,730
Chief Deputy. Sunbaenims. Is that coffee palatable?

50
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,290
What? You even prepare the system?

51
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,840
There is no current rescue request area as of 08 AM, no fire reports, humidity is 36% toward the dry side, and the

52
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,590
the meteorological visibility is 8 miles, the height of the cloud ceiling is 3000 feet,

53
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,320
winds are at 20 knots.

54
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:20,500
From now on, as a rookie, naturally, I'll prepare all of the work for my sunbaes. I'll do it all for you.

55
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,140
My sunbaes will not have to lift a finger.

56
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,520
What did he eat during the holidays? This is not like him.

57
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,030
As you already know, a rock climbing session was scheduled today,

58
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,050
but it'd be dangerous since it rained yesterday. The rock climbing session will be rescheduled.

59
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm trying very hard to learn things as soon as possible.

60
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,380
If we can't do rock climbing, we should do "analyzing rescue points" today.

61
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,380
What are you saying? We have to go inside the prohibited zone in the mountain to do that.

62
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,570
Because of the rain, it is also very slippery there.

63
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,700
That's what I am saying.

64
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,360
It's not as dangerous as rock climbing, but you can still learn about emergency situations. Isn't that perfect?

65
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,730
We should do it while we can, sir. I need to get used to the area quickly too.

66
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,920
Let's do that, sir. It won't be as dangerous since there will be no hikers because of the rain.

67
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,480
I think we should just do this today since we have time too.

68
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,960
- Mr. Kim, please give me the passcode for the circuit breaker.
- What?

69
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,720
I need to do this as the newest from now on. Give me.

70
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,680
Okay then.

71
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,920
This is Point 1-12, where we rescued
National branch number Mama 07195737 Miryeong County Fire station emergency number 119

72
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,620
someone last month.
Present location number Mt. Miryeong 1-12

73
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,110
We usually receive reports on trails since we rescue hikers most of the time,

74
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,390
but sometimes people sneak into the prohibited area.

75
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,190
Therefore, it's important to learn where the rescue points are located so we can send down a stretcher on the helicopter.

76
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,270
Look at him. He's looking at the wrong things.

77
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,160
Newbie, what do you have to consider when picking a rescue point?

78
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,250
You should've just memorized the manual instead of taking a field trip.

79
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,810
The entryway for the helicopter, the direction of departure, the possibility of rocks falling, the ground sinking since it's a steep slope.

80
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,790
And the removal of foliage and branches that will get in the way during the rescue.

81
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,940
Do you need more?

82
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,070
Wow! You already memorized that thick manual?

83
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,490
All? It seems he just memorized that.

84
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,020
- Well...
- Look around as much as you can

85
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,800
and memorize the topography and all the locations.

86
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,070
You need to know every single corner of Miryeong Forest, which is our area.

87
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,680
Nurse, we still have no patients?

88
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,860
No, as you can see.

89
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,190
The people of Miryeong Village are simple-minded, but hard to get close to.

90
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,250
They are very suspicious of outsiders and they all turn their backs on them if someone disapproves.

91
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,380
It's been a long time since they turned their backs on us. They probably won't come back.

92
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,190
You'll do what? House calls?

93
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,090
Yes, no one would come in a million years at this rate.

94
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,560
I'll go out since you'll be here.

95
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,080
Doctor Jeong, Doctor Jeong!

96
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,390
Hello!

97
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,820
Hello Unnies!

98
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,870
- What? Unni?
- Unnies?!

99
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,710
Unbelievable.

100
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,150
Today, Unnies are here.

101
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,330
I came to the right place, right?

102
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,850
I came from Miryeong Hospital!

103
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,760
For what? Since you came to this town,

104
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,430
you never said hello to us. Why do this now?

105
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,320
You're right. How rude of me, right?

106
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm sorry. I'm still familiarizing myself in this neighborhood.

107
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,430
That's why!

108
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,390
I'm here for a house call to make up for it!

109
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,290
Wherever you are feeling uncomfortable, please let me know.

110
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,630
I don't need this.

111
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,590
There isn't any doctor at Miryeoung Hospital who isn't rude.

112
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,420
Are you mocking us right now? I'd rather take some pills

113
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,170
than being examined by a doctor from Miryeong Hospital.

114
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:20,220
Hey, don't say that and come sit here. I will take your blood pressure and take a look at everything from head to toe.

115
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,660
- Oh my god.
- Oh my god.
- Let's go.

116
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,320
- You should've just been nice to us.
- Let me take your blood pressure!

117
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,110
Come out of there! Hurry!

118
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,590
Hello, elders. I came from Miryeong Hospital.

119
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,720
Today, is there anywhere you aren't feeling comfortable? I will be able to take of everything for you!

120
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,390
Elder, please. Wait a minute...
I will take of you. Please come down, please.

121
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,420
Oh my god!

122
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,200
Hello, you are so pretty. So pretty.

123
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,020
Oh my god. What do I do!?

124
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,800
Oh my god!

125
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,430
Oh, this neighborhood isn't a joke...

126
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,120
This is mindlessly difficult...

127
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,020
Elder, are you not feeling well somewhere?

128
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,420
How could you just barge into other people's houses?

129
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,620
You have no business here. Leave!

130
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,870
I can tell your limbs are in pain, but how about your eyes?

131
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,620
- Since when did it hurt...
- You have no business here.

132
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,270
Tomorrow, I will be going to the city hospital. It's none of your concern.

133
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,430
Hurry up and leave. Hurry up and leave!

134
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,330
- Hey--
- That's enough. Why don't you go back to what you were doing?

135
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,650
Lunch today especially tastes delicious~~

136
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,150
Tiny one

137
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,800
Tiny one. Tiny one.

138
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,170
Ti...Tiny one?!

139
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,650
Oh, how cute, our tiny one.

140
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,690
- What is this right now?
- I missed you so much I felt like I could die.

141
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,460
Look, the bear my tiny one really likes.

142
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,860
Aigoo! Here!

143
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,700
Have... have you gone crazy?

144
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,420
Oh, it's the man who came here when he hurt his foot....

145
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,570
But this... How did this relationship develop?

146
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,630
- He--
- You didn't tell them?

147
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,130
We are dating and living in one house.

148
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,500
How could I not fall in love?

149
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
These two eyes that shine like stars ...

150
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,270
Dr. Jeong, I guess you've been busy lately.

151
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,950
Excuse me but give me a hand.

152
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,380
♬ Jamme, jamme 'ncoppa, jamme jà ♬
♬ Goin’, goin’ on a..., goin’ go... ♬

153
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,470
♬ Funiculì, funiculà, funiculì, funiculà! ♬
♬ Rope-a-here, rope-a-there ♬

154
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,720
♬ Jamme, jamme ♬
♬ Goin’, goin’ on a..., ♬

155
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,620
♬ Funiculì, funiculà! ♬
♬ Rope-a-here, rope-a-there ♬

156
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,370
What? This, too?

157
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,420
I can't leave our fairy alone. It's lunch from a downtown hotel.

158
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,890
Oh, I got some for your colleagues but if, by any chance,

159
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,030
the people who are bothering my tiny one...

160
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,800
This isn't them right?

161
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,860
If, by any chance, that's the case, tell me little one... You know my temper, right?

162
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,860
The 206 bones that make up his body.

163
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,650
I'll make them 2,600.

164
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,620
Oh, lunch was, of course, ramen...

165
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,450
Because it's swollen, it's even more delicious.

166
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,430
- They are really swollen! So they must be even more delicious!

167
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,630
I'll pick you up when you get off work, little one.

168
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,910
You little! I should carry you around in my pocket.

169
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,590
In my pocket!

170
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,570
Don't do anything! Just look at me!

171
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,030
Oh god, I--

172
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,540
Oh, I guess this human is determined to humiliate me!

173
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,900
What is in the world is all this???

174
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,540
Oh my god. Wow.

175
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,680
Mille-feuille?

176
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,120
My goodness!

177
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,140
A desirable man.

178
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,680
When I couldn't see you, where were you?

179
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,480
Rescue workers are ready to move.

180
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,510
You didn't forget the rule of duty is that one should be in a place in sight of your team,

181
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,570
did you? Of course, jealousy is a man's strength.

182
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,090
You understand that, Sunbae Choi? In our country, if there were more perfect men like your hoobae (junior)

183
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,180
you would be distracted by every move he makes.

184
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,270
There they go starting again.

185
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,440
Just in time. Cheol Sik, teach them a thing or two.

186
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,450
Because these guys aren't a joke.

187
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,380
No way, you missed me that much?

188
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,360
If you waited a bit, I will be getting off of work. Why did you come all the way here?

189
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,480
You, that newly arrived Forest Protection Team big shot. Have you or have you not met her?

190
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,200
Oh, I will go tomorrow. It's because something urgent came up today so

191
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,890
You! Look at this!

192
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,600
What is this?

193
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,970
Illegal occupation of provincial forest, destruction of a national sign ...

194
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,680
Unauthorized collection of forest products... Why are there so many...?

195
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,320
That's why I'm so upset!

196
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,660
I never had any problems so far. And now I'm in this mess because of that new officer!

197
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,030
Hey, There wasn't any problem. Usually there isn't a problem so

198
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,700
- They just let it go because of all of your connections.
- Is that so?

199
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,190
Anyway, that officer is really something.

200
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,350
I guess she's doing this because we never introduced ourselves. Go meet with her.

201
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,060
Today, you are going to figure out what is going on, right?

202
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:57,020
Shred all this and make sure this never happens again.

203
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,190
Otherwise, I'll take your car and credit card away.

204
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,670
Can't you just pay the fine, Hyungnim? You have a lot of money.

205
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,760
-Ugh this guy!

206
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,640
-That's why. What is this?

207
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,820
We got a forest fire inspector a long time ago. Why are you announcing recruitment again?

208
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,650
It's not "again." This will be the first time.

209
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:24,510
The forest fire inspector is an occasional contract position, but that Choi Jeong Mok from Miryeong Forestry has been doing it exclusively for 25 years.

210
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,600
If you've been doing it for 25 years, are you not allowed to continue?

211
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,120
That's why I'm trying to compare him with other candidates to determine whether he can or not.

212
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,800
That's the rule.

213
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,060
It's better to just stick to the old ways, okay?

214
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,790
Ms. Oh.

215
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,350
No, I'll follow the rules.

216
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,010
That way, we won't have any problems.

217
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,810
It's almost time to leave the office. Where are you going now?

218
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,170
The sun is about to set.

219
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:59,210
I should walk around the neighborhood since they burn trash around this hour.

220
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,520
Stop penalizing people.

221
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,860
It's not my fault if we receive a complaint, okay?

222
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,770
Seriously...

223
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,510
- Choi Chang, long time no see.
- Hello.

224
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,950
- Hello!
- Hello.

225
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,470
You're busy as usual.

226
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,580
Enforcment Officer, not a lady.

227
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,290
I'm an enforcement officer, not a lady.

228
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm sorry, but please step aside.

229
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,300
What brings you here?

230
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,190
I have someone to meet with.

231
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,920
By chance, do you know the new enforcement officer on the Protection Team?

232
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,600
Let's talk for a second, Officer.

233
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Can't you tell that I'm working?

234
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,150
I'm Choi Chang, the Air Rescue Team Member of 119 Special Rescue Squad of Miryeong.

235
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,090
I wanted to introduce myself since I'm in charge of the Forest Conservancy Team.

236
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,130
But what about the penalty? Is the Special Rescue Squad interested in penalizing?

237
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,220
You're very famous in this village.

238
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,130
That you love to penalize.

239
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,720
You live in the Miryeong village?

240
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,350
Yes, I was born there.

241
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:36,340
You must know the Miryeong Forestry then. What kind of place is that?

242
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,990
Miryeong Forestry?

243
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,320
I heard Mr. Choi Jeong Mok started as a lumber dealer and became very successful.

244
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,750
He must be a very important person here.

245
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,340
He's involved with everything in this village.

246
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,830
He's the evil force of Miryeong, right?

247
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,520
Evil force?

248
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,870
I get it. I get it now.

249
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,670
I understand the situation well now.

250
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,090
Thanks for the quality information. Well then...

251
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,910
Well, Miryeong Forestry isn't exactly like that.

252
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,380
They're all about supporting one another...

253
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,880
There's no way she'd get it.

254
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,220
Sir, sir! No!

255
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,230
You can't burn there!

256
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,910
It might start a fire in the mountain!

257
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,120
It's okay, it's okay.

258
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,700
Look, the wind is blowing this way.

259
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,290
- Okay, okay.
- It could easily move over there.

260
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,430
Okay, okay, okay.

261
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,890
Haengwoon Development

262
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,350
We'll have to look into it further,

263
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,290
but if there's a wetland like this, the environmental groups

264
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,520
will give us a headache trying to preserve it.

265
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,550
You should take care of the wetlands and rare wildlife first in order to develop quickly.

266
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,760
Look everywhere and tell me everything that will get in the way.

267
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,230
It's hard to create something that doesn't exist, but it's easy to destroy something that exists.

268
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,520
Kang San Hyeok is getting ready.

269
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,190
What should I do?

270
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,880
Should I follow him more closely?

271
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,510
Let's just keep an eye on him for now. Back out now so he doesn't notice you.

272
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,460
Yes, sir.

273
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,490
No trespassing

274
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:09,150
No... No more of that "tiny one" nonsense.

275
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,050
What's the deal?

276
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,190
What's going on anyway?

277
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,150
I don't know, the electricity went out all of a sudden.

278
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,450
What did you mess with?

279
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,080
I didn't mess with anything.

280
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,860
Is the whole area out? I should call.

281
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,800
The director of the hospital is the landlord, right? Call him.

282
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,910
Pardon?

283
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,360
My goodness, I forgot to tell you.

284
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,390
That building won a design award for residential buildings. The eco-friendly award.

285
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,240
It's designed to switch to the self-generating mode if you use a certain amount of electricity.

286
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,120
Have a fun time pedaling the generator, okay?

287
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,930
- No way!
- No way!

288
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,950
I had a bad feeling about this from the beginning.

289
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,330
Why is this house so uselessly scientific anyway?

290
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,210
Pedal harder!

291
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,840
The lights won't come on.

292
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:47,470
I should maintain this speed with the length of my legs to match the rev count with your legs.

293
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,690
Don't you know what RPM is?

294
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,850
RPM my foot.

295
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,320
Anyway, no more surprises. Stop saying you'd pick me up either.

296
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,110
- You were waiting for me.
- Are you crazy?

297
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,160
You were disappointed.

298
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,780
I didn't even call you "tiny one", but you're bringing it up first.

299
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,120
Stop it. I'm getting goosebumps all over my body.

300
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,860
I apologize.

301
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,400
I won't ask you out unwillingly ever again.

302
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,890
So the war ends now, okay?

303
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,400
Fine.

304
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,460
I'm talking to you right now even though it pains me.

305
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,910
I'll accept your apology. This is it. Okay.

306
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,590
My goodness.

307
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,180
I'm not doing this anymore.

308
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,340
Are you trying to use all the electricity?

309
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,680
We're in this mess because you have all these electronics.

310
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,330
Okay then. Let's just live like this.

311
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:15,000
Men tend to romanticize the primeval life. This could be kind of fun.

312
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,390
Just live in the dark.

313
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,930
Seriously!

314
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,920
What are you doing? Keep pedaling!

315
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
Seriously...

316
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,580
Why do I have to suffer so much...

317
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,790
Anyway, you're banned from using the massage chair.

318
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,780
You can't use any of these ridiculous electronics.

319
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,280
If the electricity goes out again from using those, you'll be pedaling alone, okay?

320
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,640
Do I smell steak?

321
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,480
It smells a bit fatty. Is it sirloin? The grade A stuff?

322
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,850
What are you, a sniffer?

323
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,340
You can use the oven then.
