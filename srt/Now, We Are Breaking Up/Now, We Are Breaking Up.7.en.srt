We made a bet with Jae Gook at the ski resort back then.

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,420
- Really? Soo Wan did that?
- Yes.

8
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,170
They were fighting over who was going to go down first, and Jae Gook fell over badly.

That's right. I remember now.

Thankfully, he only scuffed his knee, but we took him to the hospital.

Soo Wan really liked Jae Gook.

12

He really adored his little brother.

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,200
He would go wait outside ahead of time if Jae Gook was coming home,

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,510
and he always let Jae Gook eat whatever was tasty and good first.

15
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,530
He acted like he was the only one in the world with a little brother.

By the way, tell me about you.

I heard you told your mom you were seeing someone.

Yes.

19

What kind of person is she?

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,410
A good person. And she's also a person that I really like.

21

That makes me more curious.

22

What does she do?

23
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,940
When are you going introduce her to your mom?

- Cheers.

We're getting bombarded with requests to expand the number of pre-orders,

How can you spread the same gossip for decades? It's boring.

It would be stranger if nothing happened

67
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,900
because you insisted on working with the factory that was guilty of copying.

68
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,810
In the time that you used to wonder about what happened overnight to the team next door,

69
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,530
if you had concentrated on your design instead,

70

a newly launched brand wouldn't have been outshone by us.

and he's going to keep thinking about whose woman you were.

84

Jae Gook couldn't give an answer either.

He said he was seeing someone, so his mother has high expectations.

<i>When will you return the Sonó products that you rented last month?</i>

162
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,610
Let me see if you can respond to this with one word.

163
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,890
<i>[Seok Do Hoon]</i>

164
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,980
I knew it.

165
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,850
Hello, Hwang Chi Sook speaking.

166
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,730
This is Gwak Soo Ho. I'm calling about the rented products you were inquiring about.

167
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,730
We will also gather products rented from Lamong and return them together this week.

168
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,260
Do whatever you want!

169
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,350
Do whatever you want?

170
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,490
She was acting so crazy that it shook my mental state for a bit.

171
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,300
I will return to my original self now.

172
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,330
The sharp, cool-headed, rational me.

173
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,920
Do whatever you want? Okay!

174
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,770
In that regard, how about you go play outside?

175
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,590
I'm not playing.

176
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,890
There is something I have to think about so I'm concentrating.

177
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,210
You have both fame and money!

178
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,780
Your life is a path of flowers, your love life is promising, and it looks like you're going to be a filial son.

179
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,520
So what's the problem?

180
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,660
You're probably wrong about me being filial.

181
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,250
Why?

182
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,390
What is this silence? Oh.

183
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,510
Your mom won't be satisfied because she doesn't have the right background? Is that it?

184
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,090
Maybe.

185
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,260
Hey! What's wrong with Team Leader Ha?

186
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,510
She's smart, competent, and sensible.

187
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,090
Sonó has been at the top for the past 10 years!

188
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,500
Honestly, she's the one pulling Sonó along. Those guts and vigor!

189
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,880
To be honest, I think she's a lot better than a global dandelion like you who lives as you desire.

190
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,290
My mom probably won't see those qualities.

191
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,090
So why not?

192
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,810
- Because of Hyung. <i>(older brother)</i>
- Me?

193
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,430
What did I do?

194
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,180
Hyung Soo Wan.

195
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,990
Why are you mentioning Soo Wan all of a sudden?

196
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,580
She's that person.

197
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,460
The person Soo Wan said he was going to marry ten years ago.

198
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,230
Oh, right.

199
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,990
What the heck.

200
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,040
Okay, well.

201
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,740
You can't change how someone feels. No one can stop that.

202
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,170
But, Jae Gook, I just...

203
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,500
I don't think I can cheer you on.

204
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,180
I like her, and she likes me.

205
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,400
Do we really need other people's permission, support, or acknowledgment?

206
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,350
You were in Paris ten years ago.

207
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,080
At that time, I was the one who was next to Soo Wan.

208
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,480
He couldn't eat or sleep. But what happened?

209
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,890
- It's because he gave up.
- No. He couldn't just be happy by himself!

210
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,540
I couldn't just be happy by myself,

211
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,590
so I've been living quietly until now.

212
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,100
That's why I stayed back in Paris.

213
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,580
I didn't even use my real name when I was working.

214
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,820
Just in case my name or existence might be bothersome.

215
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,470
Jae Gook.

216
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,290
Hyung, since I was born,

217
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,290
I've never made a choice for my sake.

218
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,880
But the only choice I made for myself,

219
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,420
just for my happiness, is Ha Yeong Eun.

220
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,680
But you still can't cheer me on?

221
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,780
What about Mother? What will you tell Mother?

222
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,560
The truth.

223
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,010
I'm contemplating when to tell her, since I'm not the only one involved.

224
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,480
Is Team Leader Ha as determined as you are?

225
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,320
If not, you shouldn't tell your mother just because you want to.

226
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,750
Team Leader Ha might end up suffering much harsher consequences.

227
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,650
Think about it carefully. This is Korea.

- Noona Yoo Jeong?
- How do you two know each other?

231
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,960
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

232
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,400
Because she asked me if I was going to keep seeing you.

233
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,250
Why do I have to be asked something like that by Shin Yoo Jeong?

234
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,970
How close are you two that she's asking if our relationship is right?

235

She was my brother's fiancée.

What do you...

237
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,760
No way... Even while he was seeing me in Paris?

238
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,300
Yes.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,830
He was still engaged then.

240
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,270

"I see"? That's it?

Then what should I say instead? Do you want me to curse?

Dating two women at once? Isn't that the worst?

247
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,730
- I agree.
- I got stabbed hard in the back. That bastard.

248
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,180

The main season hasn't even started yet.

00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,730
<i>[Ji Min's Grandmother]</i>

319
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,050
Hello, Mother.

320
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,600
I was the only granny at my get-together.

321
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,240
Their daughters-in-law got them botox and massages.

322
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,160
<i>But I didn't say anything so that I wouldn't embarrass you.</i>

323
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,700
We really don't have any spare money to do those things.

324
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,730
That's why it's tough when there's only a single income.

325
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,640
My son is the only one who ends up suffering.

326
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,260
I'm hanging up.

327
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,830
The maturity date is just around the corner, so if you cancel now, there will be a huge loss.

328
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,220
You'll only get 30% of the interest right now.

329
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,550
- But it's possible to cancel, isn't it?
- Yes, it's possible.

330
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,240
This one and...

331
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,310
this and this.

332
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,250
All of these please.

333
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,300
Aren't you getting off?

334
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,960
What about a movie after work today?

335
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,770
I'm busy. I have to check the tone difference of fabric,

336
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,320
check if the samples came out correctly, and confirm materials.

337
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,290
It's never-ending work.

338
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,680
How about tomorrow?

339
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,200
You have to empty your head the busier you are.

340
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,530
Recharge for some inspiration.

341
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,910
If we're going to the movies, let's watch an action movie.

342
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,080
One where everything blows up.

343
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,950
Look.

344
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,170
What would be good?

345
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,590
- How about this one?
- I don't really like that one.

346
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,350
Then this one?

347
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,340
Oh, Team Leader Ha, here you are.

348
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,850
How are you together?

349
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,290
Sorry? We are—

350
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,970
I came to check for materials a little while ago.

351
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,480
Is that so?

352
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,170
Thank you for helping. I'll let you get back to work.

353
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,130
I saw the draft for Clair Marie. It's good!

354
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,530
Thank you.

355
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,430
Try to make it blow up like how Sonó did, Mr. J.

356
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,420
No, was it Cookie?

357
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,430
I'll do my best.

358
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,710
I... have a meeting in thirty minutes.

359
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,280
If you're going to look around, hurry.

360
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,980
We should both be careful around the CEO.

361
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,220
- For what reason?
- Director Hwang Chi Sook.

362
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,960
- Then I can't do this?
- Of course not.

363
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,760
- And this is impossible?
- Of course.

364
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,400
But anything is allowed if he can't see?

365
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,170
Probably?

366
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,190
<i>As you get older, you lose muscles as well as collagen.</i>

367
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,420
<i>In your twenties, the collagen was full like this.</i>

368
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,240
<i>Where the leg rests, we've added some rotating rollers.</i>

369
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>So leg massage functions have been added.</i>

370
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,380
Aren't you going to give me food?

371
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,610
Look in the rice pot and heat up the soybean paste stew.

372
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,570
Finish them completely so there won't be any food waste.

373
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,260
Where is the ramyeon?

374
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,640
Where is the ramyeon?

375
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,490
Hey!

376
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,150
What is all that?

377
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,840
<i>As you can see, it has a diagonal rotating...</i>

378
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,130
₩3,600,000... You didn't buy that, did you?

379
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,860
My mom is sore everywhere.

380
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,060
Did you buy that?

381
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,100
<i>It is made with 100% Italian leather.</i>

382
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,170
- Are you kidding me?
- You get a discount if you pay in full.

383
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,400
You have money to buy a massage chair for Mother-in-law and a bag for yourself,

384
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,330
yet you treated my mom like that?

385
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,160
She called you too?

386
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,000
I heard that you cut her off saying we don't have money.

387
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,160
Yes, from now on I don't have any money to spend on your mother.

388
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,380
Jeon Mi Sook!

389
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,210
When I try to buy a winter coat, she takes it saying some daughter-in-law bought a mink coat for her mother-in-law.

390
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,770
When I try to travel to Southeast Asia,

391
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,700
she takes the money saying someone had a 70th birthday party in Hawaii.

392
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,350
I did all I can.

393
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,520
Hey, you're a daughter-in-law. It's a given that—

394
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,280
What's a given?

395
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,510
Who can guarantee that it's a given I'll wake up tomorrow?

396
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,920
Still, you shouldn't treat my mom like that.

397
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,120
Do you know how much trouble she went through for me?

398
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,190
You're the person that she sacrificed for, so why do I have to pay for it?

399
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,580
I've been wronged for having to give for all these years,

400
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,210
so I'm going to live for myself.

401
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,140
<i>What are you doing?</i>

402
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,730
<i> Getting ready for some aromatherapy. I'm going to take a bath.</i>

403
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,770
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

404
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,680
♫ <i> I miss you again </i> ♫

405
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,400
<i> You're really thinking of coming over?</i>

406
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,470
<i>You can expect me to arrive in 30 minutes.</i>

407
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,560
♫ <i>My steps again</i> ♫

408
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:24,290
♫ <i>Are following your back</i> ♫

409
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:31,620
♫ <i>The air I feel while going home</i> ♫

410
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,870
♫ <i>After I touch it and blow it out</i> ♫

411
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,020
Is he already here?

412
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:44,420
♫ <i>I feel as warm as if you're covering me</i> ♫

413
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,910
♫ <i>I think I am falling</i> ♫

414
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,010
♫ <i>It's my first feeling</i> ♫

415
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,530
<i>You can't come.</i>

416
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,040
<i>You said anything is allowed out of his view.</i>

417
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,900
<i>Mi Sook is here.</i>

418
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,740
♫ <i>Oh darling, we're falling</i> ♫

419
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:04,770
♫ <i> It might be love, in love </i> ♫

420
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,990
♫ <i> Awkward feeling </i> ♫

421
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,800
Hey, didn't you just leave?

422
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
You came back really early.

423
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
You told me instant food is the enemy of the middle-aged.

424
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,460
It's a miraculous cure for stress too.

425
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,560
Oh, good.

426
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,420
- I got stressed just now.
- Hey!

427
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,280
It's just a single portion!

428
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,980
It's delicious.

429
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,940
I must be crazy.

430
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,920
Tell me. What's going on?

431
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,470
I told you it's stress from menopause.

432
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,540
- You expect me to believe that?
- Just entertain me.

433
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,070
There's something going on with Soo Ho, right?

434
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,880
What is it? You can tell me.

435
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,560
Wait just for a while.

436
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,350
When my thoughts get sorted out, I'll tell you then.

437
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,600
No matter what it is, I'll help you.

438
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,790
If we lack physical strength, I'll at least curse him out with you.

439
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,460
Don't forget that I'm here for you.

440
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,710
Oh hey, you're quite dependable.

441
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,510
You're going to beat him up with me, right?

442
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,120
Hey, you must've spent a good amount of money.

443
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,960
I closed my installment savings.

444
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,920
You still have your house deeds, right?

445
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,220
Yeong Eun, I honestly thought that I'd die if I didn't have my installment savings.

446
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,670
But I'm still fine after closing them.

447
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,880
Just how much of my life was trapped inside of that account?

448
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,710
What's more flabbergasting is that I'm the one who willingly did that to myself.

449
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,020
So do you feel better now?

450
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,930
I feel empty.

451
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,490
It is done now, and it wasn't even a big deal.

452
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,940
Mi Sook,

453
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,040
I got a call from Soo Wan.

454
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,750
What? Was it an accidental call?

455
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,570
Probably.

456
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,820
But...

457
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,040
I heard he had a fiancée.

458
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,450
What did you just say?

459
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,230
That bastard was two-timing me.

460
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,240
How did Team Leader Ha know?

461
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,690
I told her.

462
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,480
Wow, what an honest man you are.

463
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,000
The fact that you directly exposed his two-timing just like that...

464
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,390
You're so upright, aren't you?

465
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,330
- Was I too honest?
- What did Team Leader Ha say?

466
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,510
Then, another sigh.

467
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,060
No sentences besides expressions?

468
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,280
"I see."

469
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,350
What? That's it?

470
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,990
She was even cool about cursing him out.

471
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,010
Just a few words like, "He was a bastard." That was about it.

472
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,710
Oh, she was cool. I see...

473
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,220
What's your analysis?

474
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,000
All right, "oh" and "sigh."

475
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,820
They are initial reactions of shock and fluster to finding out about something she didn't know.

476
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,710
Then the few curses she said coolly after that...

477
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,720
Were you upset after you found out he had a fiancée?

478
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,970
Was I upset?

479
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,000
Do you think she was upset?

480
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,890
If she had been upset, she would've been angry,

481
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,170
been resentful, or treated him like complete trash.

482
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,840
She didn't really though.

483
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,270
She was entirely calm and said, "That bastard." That's it.

484
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,560
Really?

485
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,490
If that's the case, then...

486
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,370
Strangely enough,

487
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,460
I felt calm.

488
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,040
Calm?

489
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,920
When I heard about Soo Wan doing that,

490
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,360
at first, I felt numb.

491
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,050
But when I thought about it,

492
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,990
I was more okay than I expected.

493
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,180
I'm proud of you.

494
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,570
You've grown a bit.

495
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,600
- Is that so?
- Yes.

496
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,230
When troubles in life keep popping up,

497
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,880
you get rid of the useless things in life without a regret,

498
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:48,000
and you realize how precious and special the things that remain with you are.

499
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,230
Isn't that what life is about?

500
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,830
Is that so?

501
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,720
Cheers.

502
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,020
Yes, that's exactly it.

503
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,360
It probably means that the past no longer influences the present.

504
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,110
So she feels composed, calm, and cool.

505
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,360
Don't you think those emotions come from that stage of realization?

506
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,120
<i> I'm here. Open the door for a quick second.</i>

507
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,520
Why'd you come so suddenly without saying anything?

508
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,910
<i> What's this?</i>

509
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,490
So you can have a drink with your friend.

510
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,810
Well, that's an excuse.

511
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,360
I wanted to see you even if it's like this.

512
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,870
Do you want to come in?

513
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,090
Thank you for the offer, but next time.

514
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,630
You should have fun with your friend today.

515
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,920
Alright, you should get going. Drive safely.

516
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,030
I'll see you tomorrow evening.

517
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,910
- What? Did someone come by?
- Yeah, well.

518
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,730
What's this?

519
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,130
He left these for us to drink since you're here.

520
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,900
My gosh, you lovebirds.

521
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,320
Wow. Cheese and Shine Muscat wine.

522
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,430
This won't do. Let's pop this open.

523
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,860
All right.

524
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,210
<i>[Yeong Eun's Father]
Thanks to your help, it got settled well.</i>

525
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,430
<i> I'll buy you a meal sometime.</i>

526
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,980
<i> You can call for me whenever.</i>

527
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,850
Why are you so surprised like it's the first time you've seen me?

528
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,880
Gosh, this person!

529
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,360
You should've let your presence be known!

530
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,390
Whose text are you smiling at this late at night?

531
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh, it's school guidelines.

532
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,580
I need to let them know before the meeting tomorrow.

533
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,770
Move aside! You know how valuable our heart is at this age.

534
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,860
How could you just scare me out of nowhere?

535
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,370
You should take this!

536
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,150
- Good morning.
- Yes.

537
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,800
Hey, if someone greets you, isn't it good manners to look at them?

538
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,690
I'm busy. Just get to the point.

539
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,740
- Why don't you care?
- About what?

540
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,110
Hye Rin and me. How could you not say anything about it all day yesterday or today?

541
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,390
I don't care, nor am I curious.

542
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,300
That's why I'm asking. Why don't you care? I'm even the CEO's son.

543
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,500
You're the CEO's son. So what?

544
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
You're so strict about your work life.

545
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,320
Hey, look.

546
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,480
If we share our personal lives with each other, we'll become close.

547
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,450
If you're connected to someone like me,

548
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,270
your work life will become easier.

549
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,920
Having an uncertain hope that the connection would get me somewhere,

550
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,240
I'd have to make an effort to look good to you and

551
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,920
be anxious about whether or not I did something to your liking.

552
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,890
And if you change your mind and turn your back on me,

553
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,560
then I become completely lost.

554
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,660
Instead of that, I'm better off drawing another spec sheet.

555
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:10,420
Jeong So Yeong, did you just put a spec sheet above me?

556
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,480
Okay. That was a fresh one.

557
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,730
I'm not Jeong So Yeong to you. I'm your senior.

558
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,540
- Yes, so according to you, So Yeong—
- Sunbae-nim <i>(senior)</i>.

559
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,180
Yes, Sunbae-nim.

560
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,990
Hurry along. We need to send this to the development team.

561
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,610
Yes, Sunbae-nim.

562
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,250
What are you doing here so early...

563
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,480
What brings you by so early, Director Hwang?

564
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,850
There's a man.

565
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,040
And?

566
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,680
And to every text I send,

567
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,770
he only replies with a single word, "Yes."

568
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,650
What do you think it means?

569
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,490
Who is it this time?

570
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,160
You don't need to know.

571
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,930
Singer, actor, model.

572
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,350
You can't date a younger idol, got it?

573
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,150
If his fans find out, our forum will explode.

574
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,500
Unless you want to shut down Clair Marie as soon as it launches.

575
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,580
Don't worry. He's not in that line of work.

576
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,620
He's not younger, and he's definitely not an idol.

577
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,980
Really? Are you sure there's nothing I have to sort out for you?

578
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,520
All you have to sort out is Yoon Jae Gook.

579
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,510
Do you know how obvious you two looked in the sample room yesterday?

580
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,870
I think Father's got a hunch.

581
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,400
You know how quick my dad is.

582
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Even to those who aren't that quick, one glance and they could tell you two looked like a couple.

583
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,780
Wench, you're so fearless at the workplace...

584
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,160
Anyway, tell me. What do you think it means?

585
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,090
Go and ask. Directly to his face.

586
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:05,040
Instead of using your head and making wrong assumptions. Got it?

587
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,910
<i>Are you in the office?</i>

588
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,840
<i>Yes.</i>

589
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,620
<i>And you must be busy?</i>

590
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,590
<i>Yes.</i>

591
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,000
<i>I have something to say, but you probably can't come out though?</i>

592
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,270
<i>No.</i>

593
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,580
<i>That's why I came over. I arrive in a minute.</i>

594
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,630
If someone looks for me, tell her I'm not here...

595
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,140
It's because you barged in so suddenly that I—

596
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,210
It's flustering, isn't it? Same for me, too!

597
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,620
What? What is?

598
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,220
No matter what I ask, the replies are always the one word "yes."

599
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,300
Why exactly are you doing this to me?

600
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,330
I thought about it all night, but I really can't figure it out.

601
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,300
So answer me.

602
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,290
You don't know why?

603
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,990
I don't.

604
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,780
I'm drawing a line.

605
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,800
W-Why?

606
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,590
I didn't like getting bothered,

607
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,990
getting excited,

608
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,170
and getting disappointed all alone.

609
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,560
So why did you?

610
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,240
Why do you think?

611
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:40,000
<i>Hold on. Getting bothered, excited, and disappointed all alone?</i>

612
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
<i>That's...</i>

613
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,240
<i>what I do when I fall in love...</i>

614
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,820
Good.

615
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,020
Let's smile a little more.

616
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,090
Hurray!

617
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,620
Let's move the lights in closer.

618
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,690
- Also, please go in closer with the reflector.
- Okay.

619
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,310
Okay. Good.

620
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,640
Oh, it's raining!

621
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,120
Let's continue after the rain stops.

622
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,010
Bring more tarp!

623
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,980
Cover this first.

624
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,300
The neck line is too wide.

625
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,700
Let's decrease it by 1/4.

626
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,050
Sixteen.

627
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,870
Here you go.

628
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,080
Wrong one.

629
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,310
What? You want me to go get it again?

630
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,660
Let's do velcro here.

631
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,360
Adding eight rivets around the canton is staying as is?

632
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,570
- Get the alteration done by tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

633
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,330
Hello? This is Ha Yeong Eun speaking.

634
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,820
<i>Team Leader Ha, the CEO wants to see you.</i>

635
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,000
Did... you get bribed by the factory?

636
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,150
No, I didn't.

637
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,660
I've had one rule ever since I started selling fabric.

638
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,930
To employees who want a raise or want their transportation expenses paid for,

639
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,130
I just give it to them if they are performing well enough.

640
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:17,140
But people who take money from the register out of my sight

641
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,040
can never set foot in my store ever again.

642
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,170
It's not that I lost a lot of money

643
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,640
but deceiving me cannot be calculated with money.

644
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,750
I never deceived you in any way.

645
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,820
I know. With whose money

646
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,110
you finished that tough education in Paris

647
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:46,220
and thanks to whom you are where you are.

648
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,500
You can't be eyeing

649
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,590
something you shouldn't.

650

I'm sorry. I didn't hear it.

672
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,320
Yes, there is something.

673
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,700
We missed our movie. What do we do?

674
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,340
Let's go somewhere for now. It's cold.

00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,520
did you start liking me?

679
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,380
It's not like you can set a date and time for such things.

680
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,070
It just happened one day.

681
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,770
My heart aches.

682
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,650
It's possible to not realize it.

683
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,690
You don't have to feel bad.

684
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,100
I'm not going to like you.

685
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,060
Why not? Because of my looks?

686
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,480
You know, I look pretty good if you take a good look at me.

687
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,410
Love should be mysterious.

688
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:05,020
But you've seen me getting dumped by J

689

690

You saw all that.

691
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,980
I saw because you showed me. Is it my fault?

692
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:18,190
Anyway, I won't like you.

693

Director Hwang, can you stand up for a second?

One, two, three!

708

If you just put some strength into your legs...

709

<i> What?</i>

719
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,370
- Director Hwang.
- Yes?

720
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,410
We need to prove that it's you.

721
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,770
One, two, three!

722
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,990
<i> Oh, here. Here.</i>

Gyeong Ja?

727
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,050
Are these really the only choices?

728
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,670
Let's choose at the same time to make it fair.

729
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,310
Thirty-thread Supima cotton. Its coziness is the selling point.

730
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:43,580
Or a silk base with Lasalle lace. Its strength is that it's extremely lovely.

731
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,920
One, two, three.

732
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,800
- Lovely.
- Cozy.

733
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,680
So I've confirmed that we have different tastes in gowns.

734
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,600
You put eggs in ramyeon, right?

735
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,590
No, I don't.

736
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,370
Then at least you agree that chicken drumsticks are the best, right?

737
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,420
Chicken breasts taste clean and aren't greasy.

738
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,930
Wow, we really aren't compatible.

739
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,880
We're probably going to fight a lot in the future, right?

740
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,810
You'll find out that ramyeon without eggs is good,

741
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,060
and we won't have to fight over drumsticks.

742
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,390
I think this is better.

00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,000
<i>Without a reason, I thought this wouldn't work out.</i>

<i>That I, that we...</i>

745
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,010
<i>wouldn't be able to have a normal, ordinary relationship.</i>

746
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,750
What is it?

747
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,480
I got a call from Soo Wan.

It turned out that I never deleted Soo Wan's number for 10 years.

759
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,140
I was so busy with life that at some point,

760
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,620
I completely forgot to the point that I didn't even think about how I should delete it.

What brings you here this morning?

802
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,840
I wanted to talk to you about something.

803
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,000
Hold on.

804
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,330
So it was you.

805
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,440
What are you doing right now?

806
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,950
I came to ask you that.

807
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,580
What are you doing right now?

808
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:59,290
What are you doing to Ha Yeong Eun with Hyung's phone?

809
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,890
I told you.

810
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,400
I'm worried about your mother.

811
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,570
Aren't you using that worry as an excuse to take out your anger?

812
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:11,630
Are you really okay?

813
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:17,510
Are you okay with the shock and the pain you'll give her?

814
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,740
You aren't.

815
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:25,920
That's why you couldn't say anything in front of your mother either.

816
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,570
Mother, it's me.

817
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:43,860
I'd like to introduce you to the person I like.

818
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,880
That person's name

819
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,630
is Ha Yeong Eun.

820
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:58,990
What? Ha Yeong Eun?

821
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:13,310
Jae Gook, by any chance, are you...

822
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,020
Yes. It's that Ha Yeong Eun.
