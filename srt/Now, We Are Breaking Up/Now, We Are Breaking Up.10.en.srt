You are very pretty.

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,820
My daughter, her promising life...

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,380
have been put on hold for a decade.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,800
My life has also been difficult from watching that.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,520
That's why... your daughter should stop.

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,480
Is it my daughter's fault?

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,900
Can one hand make a clapping sound by itself?

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,310
You already dealt with my eldest,

14
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,160
so you should at the very least be sorry and not do this.

15

Who are you saying should be sorry?

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,630
It wouldn't be sufficient even if you bowed down in front of me right now and begged for forgiveness.

Do you know how long my child waited in the rain?

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,760
Because she met the wrong man, my child gave up her bright future

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,470
and for ten years, she... Do you know what she had to give up?

20
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,950
My child... died.

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,240
He went out after receiving your daughter's call and was not able to come back from that road.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,450
Ten years, you say? Are you heartbroken?

23
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,490
I can neither see

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,890
nor touch my child.

I understand that.

28

If she says she can't understand,

However...

31
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,600
to use them as reasons why we can't love,

32
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,040
I can't understand that.

33
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,300
He was two years old when I took him in as my own son.

That's why...

35

he is a child that makes my heart ache all the more.

Please stop her.

I want to work, love, and fight next to her.

But stay at your career level, okay?

63

Work to your ability. Don't waste your talents by scaling down.

Who knows? An unexpected road could open up.

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,830
- A change?
- In any case, I'm going to open right away,

68
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,010
so don't add anything to my calendar. Got it?

I couldn't just pass by,

70
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,870
so I stopped by on my way to work.

80
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,260
How was it? Did she fall for it?

81
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,470
She seemed a bit sleepy.

82
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,520
She was sleepy?

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,810
You need to make the big push while things are like this.

84
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,490
The back of my neck already feels pretty bare. I can't do any more.

85

You're going on a date later this evening, right?

86
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,310
For now, yes. I told her that I'd be coming to get her.

There were countless five pyeong fabric stores like mine
<i>(1 pyeong = 36 square feet)</i>

88
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,290
that ran their business in Dongdaemun.

89
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,570
As time went on, some people closed their doors because business was bad.

90
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,350
Others passed it on to another person. However, I...

91
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,540
I grew it to become The One.

92
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,550
Alway changing the subject like this must be a family tradition.

93
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,460
It doesn't matter what the beginning was like.

94
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,490
It only matters how you make it into a success.

95
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,530
That means...?

96
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,790
Whether it'll end in two months or whether it'll continue...

97
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,130
report back to me after tonight's date.

98
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,150
Tonight?

99
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,240
Why would you drag it out?

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,300
You need to make me feel certain,

101
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,100
so that I can decide how to look at you.

102
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,030
Yes, I will do my best to bring you that certainty.

103
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,290
I'm confused.

104
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,830
Is kissing... like swimming?

105
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,040
Once you do it, your body remembers.

106
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,490
If you fall into water, you remember automatically.

107
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,800
In that sense, it seems like you've fallen for CEO Seok.

108
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,650
I haven't yet.

109
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,430
I thought you were going on a date tonight.

110
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,240
His style completely changed.

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,320
Seeing him put in the effort even though he knows that the relationship will end,

112
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,370
it seemed like I was looking at myself.

113
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,040
Try dating him sincerely. CEO Seok is a good person.

114
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,530
You know that my relationships were always just unrequited love that eventually ended.

115
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,770
If I get dumped after showing interest,

116
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,280
I wouldn't have regrets since I would have been on a few dates with them.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,450
But if the relationship with a person who likes me ends too,

118
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,880
I think that'll hurt a lot.

119
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,120
Rather than that happening, keeping the relationship strictly business is better

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,630
since at least that good person will remain.

121
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,620
Don't ever run away in the middle of a relationship, okay?

122
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,210
It's not that it hurts because love fell apart,

123
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,970
but because a person turned his back on you.

124

Do Hoon was right.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,960
I don't think people come to studios to get their pictures taken these days.

I see that it hasn't bothered you much though.

134
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,980
That's why I'm changing my methods.

135
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,040
I won't limit the number of photos, and I'll take as many pictures as needed until we get the best one.

136
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200

138
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,130
You really aren't made for a business life.

139
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,120
It'll just be chaotic with no profits.

140
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,380
I won't do any editing though.

141
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,410
I take back what I said. It won't even be chaotic.

142
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,860
People don't even take pictures on their phones without using an app these days.

143
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,440
What do you think people look at when they see their photos?

144
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
Instead of how pretty they looked that day,

145
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,350
they'll remember what day it was.

146
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,040
They'll remember what they talked about and why they laughed.

147
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,050
All photos are memories.

148
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,490
I want to sincerely capture that.

149
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,670
That's true.

150
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,000
The things that photos don't capture - that day's smell, air, happiness -

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,270
you end up remembering all of that.

152
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,060
And if that creates another memory, that will be great as well.

153
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,780
I'll promote this a lot to those around me.

154
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,070
Trimming the hanging threads isn't our job.

155
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,080
Do you perhaps believe that if you work hard,

156
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,310
the company will recognize it later on and share the glory like a fairy tale?

157
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,860
But that doesn't happen in real life.

158
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,320
Which is why I'm working myself down to the bones.

159
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,260
I get thirsty too.

160
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,390
I only hold it in since I have no time to drink.

161
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,030
No one's forcing you. It's your choice.

162
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,290
As for me, I'm doing just enough to get by for my own sake.

163
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,060
- Is that such a bad thing?
- That kind of talk...

164
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,870
you can say it outside of the workplace after handing in your resignation letter.

165
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,420
There are countless people who eat seaweed rolls that are close to expiring from convenience stores

166
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,490
as they write their resumes because they want your position.

167
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,960
Everyone has their own worries and sufferings.

168
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,740
The idea that your own efforts are commendable and tear-jerking

169
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,010
while a life without needing to write resumes is a comfortable one

170
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,820
- is a strong prejudice.
- Is it less embarrassing to make excuses?

171
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,280
What?

172
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm sure it's hard.

173
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,060
You were born, but it just so happened that you were born into a rich family.

174
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,470
But how terrible! You wore luxury brand items in all of the colors offered,

175
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,920
yet you don't even know where to begin to start making that one piece of clothing.

176
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,460
Your words are a bit extreme.

177
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,730
You act all cool as if you don't care about others' approval.

178
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,850
- You're lazy and you make excuses.
- Sunbae Jeong So Yeong!

179
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,680
Be honest. Aren't you just afraid that people will see the real you?

180
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,890
Honestly, no matter what I do, you'll just criticize me.

181
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,710
The fact that I am coming to the warehouse today was already posted on the Blind.

182
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,600
Will the precious master be able to endure well?

183
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

184
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,620
Why do I have to knowingly let myself be trampled?

185
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,640
You can play the victim card all you want.

186
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,920
At this moment, you're just my junior.

187
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,020
So you just work quietly.

188
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,830
Hey, Jeong So Yeong.

189
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,120
- I told you I'm "Sunbae" <i>(senior)</i> to you.
- Forget it.

190
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,620
When it's just us two, you're just going to be Jeong So Yeong, okay?

191
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,440
- Mom, you do it!
- You do it. You're supposed to do it.

192
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,060
- You do it, Mom.
- You can't watch cartoons until you're done.

193
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,540
What are you doing?

194
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,790
- Auntie.
- Don't look at her.

195
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,640
Put on your stockings, tie your hair, put on your jacket,

196
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,530
zip it up, then get it checked by me.

197
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,850
- If you don't do it well, you'll have to restart.
- I won't!

198
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,220
Then, get up. Get up!

199
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,120
- Mi Sook!
- Yeong Eun, leave.

200
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,670
Jeon Mi Sook.

201
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,420
I'm going to count to 100 then come out.

202
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,000
If you don't finish by then,

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,690
you won't be able to watch cartoons for 10 nights. Understand?

204
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,210
- Mom!
- It's okay, Ji Min. Don't cry.

205
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,030
Oh, don't cry. It's okay.

206
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,750
I need to feed my kid dinner. Just get to the point.

207
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,110
Are you really quitting?

208
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,230
I was a bastard. I was crazy.

209
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,670
It's too late, but I'm going to live with the right mindset at least from now.

210
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,830
Are you really not coming back?

211
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,600
I already told you.

212
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,850
I need to be with my wife.

213
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,980
Then what am I supposed to do?

214
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,910
We're near my house.

215
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,020
They want me to handle Lafayette all by myself.

216
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,000
How can I do all of that by myself? I need you.

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,330
You know that I'm still in the beginners class for French.

218
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,730
If the CEO asks me to speak but I can't, imagine what will happen!

219
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,230
I'm a contract worker! What am I supposed to do?

220
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,180
Is that why you kept coming for me?

221
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,050
I still need you.

222
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,500
I told you to pack up for the hospital, but why are you going after your daughter like that?

223
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,960
If I'm not there, she'll have to do it all by herself anyway.

224
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,850
I need to teach her while I'm here.

225
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,140
Mi Sook.

226
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,960
Yeong Eun.

227
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,520
Here and there, I can't help but feel that this is unfair. I think I'll go crazy.

228
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,380
What did I do wrong?

229
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,290
Why me?

230
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,080
What's Ji Min supposed to do? Why is it me of all people?

231
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,550
She can't even put on a sock. What's she supposed to do?

232
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,920
Why is this happening to me?

233
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,000
Then why are you doing this?

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,060
Why are you doing this to a kid who doesn't know anything?

235
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,860
I came to my senses all of a sudden.

236
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,220
How much longer can I just sit lamenting?

237
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,130
There's no time for that. I have so much to do.

238
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,700
There are so many things that need my touch.

239
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,240
Those who are left behind

240
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,440
have to live with only the memories of their passed one.

241
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Don't make Ji Min remember you as a scary, angry mom.

242
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,910
My body

243
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,110
speaks to me everyday with aches, Yeong Eun.

244
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,610
It tells me to hurry.

245
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,990
It tells me there's not much time left.

246
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,800
That's why my heart feels so busy.

247
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,070
But why is there so much to do?

248
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,500
Oh, yeah.

249
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,610
I need to take pictures before I lose more weight from chemo.

250
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,760
- Pictures?
- The only pictures I have of myself after having Ji Min are all selfies.

251
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,560
Ji Min's dad is the type of person who will just make my ID picture bigger and use it as my funeral picture.

252
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,150
We have to use that picture for three days.

253
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,400
Hey, I don't want to end my life on an embarrassing note.

254
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,970
- Mi Sook.
- I want my funeral picture

255
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,270
to be deadly pretty.

256
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,500
Even better if it's one where I'm smiling brightly.

257
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,190
Is there a restaurant here?

258
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:22,160
There is no way you're asking me to walk up to that high point at this late hour, right?

259
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,220
The car can only come up to here.

260
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,110
Try them on. These are limited edition.

261
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,640
As the Vision PR CEO, I was able to specially get these.

262
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,360
I can tie them myself.

263

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,480
Hurry and unlock the door.

314
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,670
You should've called me.

315
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,580
But what are you doing here at this hour without advance notice?

316
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,300
I wanted to have a drink with my daughter and sleep with her.

317
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,740
What about Father?

318
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,080
Is he a kid? Is he afraid of a burglar or ghosts?

319
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,620
Wow, my mother drinks well.

320
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,590
In my younger days, I used to drink by the bottle.

321
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,420
Living with your father, I pretended to be modest.

322
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,500
Because you were the vice principal's wife?

323
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,830
I have one set of eyes,

324
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,030
but there are hundreds of eyes staring at me.

325
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,520
Who knows which one of them are looking at me critically?

326
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,660
I've lived without even throwing away a wrapper on the street.

327
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,260
Since you've suffered a lot, you must take a shot.

328
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,490
I didn't do it because I liked it.

329
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,200
It was because I had no choice.

330
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,460
Out of all times, you came to us right then that...

331
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,360
Is that my fault?

332
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,710
Yes... I was blinded by love.

333
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,380
As I lived my life,

334
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I grew mad at my deceased mother.

335
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,510
She should have stopped me just a bit more.

336
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,350
She should have shaved my head so I would have no choice but to give up.

337
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,010
Then I would have gone to work

338
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,980
and found out that there's another world out there.

339
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,000
I would have lived differently...

340
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,650
Yeong Eun,

341
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,010
you shouldn't go down this road.

342
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,710
Don't go.

343
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,110
Mom...

344
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,560
She said he died.

345
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,360
I... opened a photography studio.

346
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,650
I even started a promotional event.

347
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,150
It's also an experience to run a business.

348
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,470
Consider it as studying and do it just for a while, then go work for our company.

349
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,900
"Would I be able to do something like this here?"

350
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,410
"Can I act like nothing is wrong when strangers stare?"

351
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,620
But it was better than I thought.

352
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,000
Today, I waited for people all day long.

353
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,870
Don't make it hard on yourself and hold onto Hyung either.

354
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,080
Please let him go now.

355
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,550
I can't do that because he's my child.

356
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:49,110
As a mother, I can't tear my child out of my embrace.

357
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,550
She won't accept you.

358
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,390
Even if I were her, I wouldn't.

359
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,250
It's the two of us who love each other.

360
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,890
No matter what other people say, I won't care.

361
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,170
Are your parents "other people"?

362
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,930
Can you live having turned your back on your parents?

363
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,870
And even if you do...

364
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,560
There's nothing which benefits you.

365
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,750
You'll be sorry forever for the sin of cutting ties with your parents.

366
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,350
And that man... will feel more sorry for seeing you feel sorry.

367
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,700
I didn't do anything wrong.

368
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,680
So why must I be sorry?

369
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,000
Turning her back against us because she doesn't approve of us is her choice.

370
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,970
Yeong Eun...

371
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,310
That time 10 years ago,

372
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,850
do you know what was the hardest for me?

373
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,810
Being ghosted? Getting dumped?

374
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,890
No, Mom.

375
00:25:53,890 --> 00:26:00,380
To me... having to end my feelings when my feelings weren't over.

376
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,430
I still... liked him so much.

377
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,790
But to know that I can't see him anymore... that made it crazy hard.

378
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,880
But you want me to do that again?

379
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,700
You think you won't be able to right now, right?

380
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,500
You think it's going to be great like this everyday, right?

381
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,080
No... when life gets hard, a man?

382
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,690
You'll want to tear your eyes out.

383
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,890
Love?

384
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,650
There is no such thing. You just live.

385
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,400
Thinking that my place is here... you just give up and live.

386
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,500
Then I will break up with him at that time.

387
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,650
When his and my love withers away.

388
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,960
When it doesn't really hurt to break up, I want to break up then.

389
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,080
- Yeong Eun...
- Whether I change or he says that we should stop.

390
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,160
If it's not one of those, I can't comprehend any other reason.

391
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,810
And then another 10 years?

392
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,590
How can I live... huh?

393
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,360
I...

394
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,640
wish you wouldn't live like I did.

395
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,530
If you go against your parents and live doing what they told you not to do,

396
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,710
you can't complain even if it gets difficult.

397
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,880
Seeing you getting thinner and thinner

398
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,350
makes me upset.

399
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,560
Don't do anything you will regret.

400
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,110
It will be harder to take it back later.

401
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,670
Just...

402
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,520
go through the hardship now.

<i>[The One]</i>

404

We also try to use domestic options for fabrics like polyester and suede,

405
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,370
but there are many instances we can't due to quality.

406
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,690
Brands show us the imported samples and tell us to copy exactly what we see.

407
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,710
Do they just tell us to do it? While providing only 1/3 of the cost

408
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,080
and asking us to meet the deadline ASAP, they can't complain about quality.

409
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,420
Is it possible to develop a new texture or a new print?

410
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,260
In terms of technical skills, we are the best!

411
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,010
There are so many textile factories in Daegu.

412
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,900
There are many that have closed.

413

Eighty percent of domestic brands use imported goods.

There's no place for domestic fabric to stand. There is no place.

If it was like this 10 years ago as well...

472
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,520
Then persuading your mother will actually be impossible.

473
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,240
The same situation can end in many different ways.

474
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,410
And... that's entirely up to us.

475
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,210
Yes.

476
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,780
So I... want to live really well.

477
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,460
Do you perhaps have a scheduled customer?

478
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,380
I thought that we couldn't do it if we didn't make a reservation.

479
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,780
Because of you, I'm thankful.

480
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,360
Why are you already thanking me?

481
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,590
You are always underestimating my skills.

482
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,740
You have something else?

483
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,200
By the time the makeup is almost complete,

484
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,320
some outfit samples of the 2022 new spring collection will arrive.

485
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,380
Real killer items.

486
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,590
Except for work, I'm quite talented.

487
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,870
For instance, I personally invited the makeup artist who was the first domestic beauty content creator

488
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,550
and responsible for making K-beauty a thing.

489
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,070
She's here.

490
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:02,450
- Hello, Director.
- Hello! It's been a while.

491
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,310
Please take special care of my friend.

492
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,940
Of course.

493
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,620
Hello.

494
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,760
You must have something great going on.

495
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,690
We want to take a picture.

496
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,590
You said that you wanted to take a picture before you started chemotherapy.

497
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,070
Let's do that. Because today will be your most beautiful day.

498
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,490
Let's take it now.

499
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,980
Please make her very pretty.

500
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,640
We are going to look at it for years to come.

501
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,490
Yes, of course.

502
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,020
- We will get started.
- Yes.

503
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,910
Hey, it seems like I am getting bridal makeup done seeing you guys waiting there like that.

504
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,390
Who knew that you would wear the wedding dress first?

505
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,590
I was the representative runner for my class.

506
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,350
I'm good at crossing the finish line first.

507
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,060
That day really was the prime for Jeon Mi Sook. It's belated, but I'll acknowledge it now.

508
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,390
Where did that Jeon Mi Sook go?

509
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,410
Seeing that I can't even recognize myself...

510
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,120
Not much is needed for you to be at your prime.

511
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,980
If you're having good days, those days are your prime days.

512
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,380
If today is a good day, today is also your prime.

513
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,390
Since this is the first customer of your event, please take extra care when you shoot.

514
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,620
I'll take care of it.

515
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,360
I will get the photoshoot started.

516
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,430
H-Here? Ah, so embarrassing...

517
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,000
We will smile a bit more.

518
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,640
Also, look this way.

519
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,110
Ah, okay.

520
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,370
You are so fast. Please wait a minute...

521
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,010
That won't work.

522
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,960
Why, why? What is this?

523
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,870
♫ <i>I swore to myself I wouldn't be honest this time</i> ♫

524
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,280
Leave your body to the rhythm of the music.

525
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,610
Look at me, look at me.

526
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,320
- Okay.
- Got it, got it.

527
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,310
Like this?

528
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,210
Act cool.

529
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,030
♫ <i>And kiss me cuz I don't know how to shut my dirty mouth</i> ♫

530
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,960
I think this color will look pretty too.

531
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,940
Ah, looks good on you, looks good.

532
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,970
Do you like it?

533
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,580
♫ <i>My dirty mouth, yeah</i> ♫

534
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,960
♫ <i>I say too much when I'm drunk</i> ♫

535
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,480
Okay.
♫ <i>Oh and here I go again. Here I go again!</i> ♫

536
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,830
♫ <i>You caught me with my inhibitions down</i> ♫

537
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,940
Go outside and enjoy yourself.
♫ <i>And now you're hearing all the secrets from my dirty mouth</i> ♫

538
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,060
♫ <i>I'm gonna need you to come wash it out</i> ♫

539
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,500
♫ <i>And kiss me cuz I don't know how to shut my dirty mouth</i> ♫

540
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,100
♫ <i>Yeah</i> ♫

541
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,570
Ah, Yeong Eun, I'm feeling very good.

542
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:37,810
Hey, Hwang Chi Sook, how is it? Can you feel the aura of a former model?

543
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:41,280
You are totally pretty. Very pretty.

544
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,060
These came out very well.

545
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:52,700
This cold-hearted woman. Why is she so pretty like a flower?

546
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,460
You are right.

547
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,190
She's like a flower.

548
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,410
- You guys should also take pictures with her.
- Us too?

549
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,570
Regardless of the number of takes, it's just 5,000 won until you like it.

550
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,880
I will start the shoot.

551
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,100
What are you doing again? Let's try it, let's try it!

552
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,820
How should we do it so that we look like Miss Korea?

553
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,380
<i>In the pictures, we are mostly laughing.</i>

554
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,520
<i>Were we laughing because we were happy?</i>

555
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,950
<i>Or did we laugh because we were in front of the camera?</i>

556
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,050
<i>But one thing is certain.</i>

557
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:46,860
<i>In that moment, we were laughing and we were happy. </i>

558
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:54,100
<i>That those memories will allow us to live our remaining days.</i>

559
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,960
Why is it my fault that Yeong Eun met him?

560
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,630
What is the most important thing that a woman must do in the house?

561
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,590
Raising a child is a woman's duty.

562
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,590
If you did things correctly, why would these things happen?

563
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,740
What did you do?

564
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,760
I dedicated my entire life to education whether it snowed or rained.

565
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm not embarrassed at all when it comes to fulfilling my role as a head of household.

566
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,910
Not embarrassed at all? And you didn't do anything else?

567
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,800
Anything else? What thing?

568
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,860
You see, I'm a person who can live without the law.

569
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,000
And you took upon the role as the head of the household by yourself?

570
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,660
Then who did it? Have you even earned 10 won before?

571
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,400
To make you a lead teacher,

572
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,020
I am the one who went to the principal's house to make kimchi.

573
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,690
To make you the head of teachers,

574
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,530
I made all of the wedding food when his daughter got married.

575
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,340
Vice principal? They said that the chairman's dog disappeared while the door was opened.

576
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm the one who went around for three days and nights to find it!

577
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,330
Just because you helped with making some bundles of kimchi, you want to teach me?

578
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,950
- Bragging about nothing...
- Brag? Brag?!

579
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,200
I should just keep my mouth shut.

580
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,460
<i>I work at Jeju Island.</i>

581
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,020
<i>- Are you originally from Jeju?
- No, I'm not.</i>

582
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,240
<i>Just for work.</i>

583
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,550
<i>I specialize in Chinese food.</i>

584
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,920
Mi Sook, it's me.

585
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,530
Yes, you are doing well, right?

586
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,020
<i>[Our Photography Studio]</i>

587
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,150
Mi Sook had such a fun time.

588
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,790
Ever since she was in school, her dream was to become a model, but she gave up when she got married.

589
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,070
She sent a storm of text messages saying "Having Mr. J photograph me at this age is nonsense."

590
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,440
Did you reply that I normally don't take pictures of anyone?

591
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,970
Usually in a moment like this, one shows humility.

592
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,160
If you have skills and humility on top of that, it's not attractive.

593
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,400
Will you be done after that?

594
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,390
Yes, I'll be done after I put this away.

595
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,590
The lighting must be heavy.

596
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,160
- Your face is red.
- Hey.

597
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,450
I'm hungry. Let's hurry up and go eat.

598
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,770
If we did this much, are we done?

599
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,990
I think so.

600
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,100
What are you doing here?

601
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,220
Mom.

602
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,960
Are you dating my child to make her do these kinds of things?

603
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,180
Come in for now, Mother.

604
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,800
Who are you calling mother? Who says I'm your mother?

605
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,020
Mom, why are you being like this?

606
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,980
Mom, let's go out. Talk to me.

607
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,180
<i>[Our Photography Studio]</i>

608
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,890
You're Yoon Jae Gook, right?

609
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:48,980
Yes.

610
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,060
And you're Soo Wan's little brother?

611
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,950
Mom.

612
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,340
Then what are you doing right now?

613
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,110
Do you think this makes sense?

614
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,930
Why? Because you're not full brothers?

615
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,860
Is that why you think it's okay?

616
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,850
Mom!

617
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,150
I heard you're a child from an extramarital affair.

618
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,530
Yes.

619
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,810
As for me, I have no desire to have a son-in-law who is born of an extramarital affair and calls me mother.

620
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,860
That's not what I raised my daughter for.

621
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,390
What are you saying, Mom? Why are you being like this?

622
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,730
Am I wrong?

623
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,120
I heard that you're a son brought in from outside the marriage.

624
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,050
Yes. You're right.

625
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,190
Then how dare you think you could have my daughter?

626
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,390
I'm sorry. I'll apologize instead, Jae Gook.

627
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,620
She came to see me. It's fine.

628
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,760
Mom, leave now. Stop doing this here, and let's leave now.

629
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,390
Please speak.

630
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,720
Even though I wasn't able to raise her lavishly,

631
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,500
I raised her with a lot of care.

632
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,020
We couldn't even help pay for her college tuition

633
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,870
because her father lost money by cosigning for the wrong person.

634
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,070
But while she worked three, four part-time jobs

635
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,030
and took care of everything herself,

636
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,760
all I could do was massage her legs throughout the night.

637
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,910
It killed me to see her like that.

638
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,760
I didn't give her a penny to help with her living expenses when she was studying overseas.

639
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,840
But when she would bring back shoes and bags purchased for me,

640
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,540
I felt like those were my daughter's tears of blood,

641
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,470
so it devastated me.

642
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,640
Mom, stop it. Please!

643
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,200
But still, seeing her bearing her life well

644
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,000
is admirable and beautiful.

645
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,740
My daughter, who is too precious to look at for the fear of wearing her out...

646
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,150
who are you to shake her up?

647
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,750
Who are you to do this to my daughter's life?

648
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,560
Why are you tearing it apart?

649
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,820
Please go. You can talk to me!

650
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,620
Don't date my child.

651
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,210
Let's not see each other ever again.

652

How could you say those things?

660
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,950
Because I'm your mom.

661

The fabric factory will accept Team Leader Ha's proposal

726
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,710
to pay the fabric development fee in advance.

727
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,550
I did hear this correctly, right?

728
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,150
We can't ask them to make it for us no matter what when we can't even promise the quantity we will purchase.

729
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,250
Why wouldn't we purchase the fabric if it's good?

730
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,950
When buying imported products, we can't even begin to bargain,

731
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,390
but when buying domestic products, we decide that the price should be below a certain amount.

732
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,810
So how can they utilize good thread and raise the quality?

733
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,280
But what about our loss when the quality still ends up subpar?

734
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,090

And the reason?

737
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,910
This season, the next, and the one after that.

738
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,730
If we keep buying imported goods for a high price, then the price of clothes will continue to rise.

739
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,240
We will fall behind due to direct purchases from overseas.

740
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,920
You also added the condition that the materials team

741
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,230
will constantly communicate with the factory and quality check?

742

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,430
It's all done.

789
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,420
After chemo, I won't be able to eat well because I will feel nauseous and throw up.

790
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,830
I need to eat a lot before that so I can recover quickly.

791
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,770
I need to fast six hours before, so let's eat quickly.

00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:53,530
Oh right. Make sure you take a look at Ji Min's assignment notebook and sign it early in the evening.

795
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,640
You always postpone it saying you will in the morning and then forget about it.

You're only there for one night.

Honey, I am going to get my treatment diligently.

I'm going to do it for you and Ji Min.

807

It's okay. I've heard it many times.

840
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,620
There were people who said it with their mouths

841

and some who said it with their eyes.
