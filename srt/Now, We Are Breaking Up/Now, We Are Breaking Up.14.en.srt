This is Olivier's official offer.

He wants to take you, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun, to Paris.

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,210
<i>Ten years ago, I loved someone,</i>

00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,050
<i>so I let go of my dream.</i>

11
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,120
This time, he's taken office as DPHP's Head Director,

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,560
and it appears that he's looking for talented people to work with.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,520
It seems like your buyers show left a big impression on him.

<i>And ten years later...</i>

15
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,590
They would like you to take charge of the designer brand Duchamps.

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,660
As long as you accept, you will be provided with

17

an apartment, a vehicle, and sales incentives.

<i>"How will you decide this time?"</i>

Renoir and Maison Mihabelle are opening on the third floor in zone B,

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,630
where domestic women's clothing shops have been removed.

37
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,960
We are currently in negotiations regarding the rate of commission.

What is the current sales status for women's business attire for this quarter?

39
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,040
There has been a 12 percent decrease from last year.

40
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,690
The only brand exhibiting an upward trend is Sonó.

Has Sonó responded?

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,270
They said that they would apply the same conditions as a popular foreign brand contract

44
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,740
and lower the commission to 20 percent.

45
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,200
Wow, I've never had the upper hand over a department store before.

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,520
While they're at it, it would have been great if they moved our store in front of the up escalator.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,860
They said that they will.

48
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,330
The pressure for sales will be as large as the spot is nice.

Someone who breaks a contract once will do it a second or third time.

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,560
I respect Team Leader Ha's opinion one hundred percent.

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,490
Why are you being like this? Maintain your character!

54
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,400
Team Leader Ha is a completely, absolutely treasured existence to The One.

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,860
I especially respect her.

56
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,120
So, Yeong Eun, what do you want to do?

57
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,260
Do you think it would be right to stay at The Hills or leave?

58
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,300
I think it would be best to stay.

59
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,570
It's expected that they would make judgments based on sales.

60
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,830
Our burden for sales will definitely increase,

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,870
but these conditions and this spot

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,380
will set a good precedent for other domestic brands.

63
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,770
As expected, a generous heart.

64
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,080
Even after enduring that humiliation from Vice President Shin Yoo Jeong,

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,770
you retain a detached state of mind to consider the company's profits and pride.

66
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,860
You are so cool, Team Leader Ha.

67
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,320
Wow, I really can't get used to this.

72
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,980
<i>So it is a recruiting proposal.</i>

73
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,900

75
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,860
Well then, we'll stay.

76
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,810
Let's go with that, CEO.

77
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,700
If you have confidence that you can keep your pride until the end, go for it.

78
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,790
What is the next item on the agenda?

79
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,450
- Awesome!
- Isn't the space in front of the escalator killer?

80
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,730
It looks like The Hills raised the white flag in the end.

81
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,660
Since we went face to face with our clothes as opposed to lobbying or whatnot,

82
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
this is our own achievement, right?

83
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,430
It is, it is! It one hundred percent is!

84
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,290
I feel very proud that I am a Sonó designer.

It's like homework that I have to do but really don't want to do.

I don't know how they read my mind,

but some people came saying that they're sad too,

122
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,940
that they will take a photo while they're here,

123
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,480
and that they would bring their family next time.

124
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Thanks to that, I'm feeling relieved.

125
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,230
What if you lose your opportunity to work in Paris while doing that?

126
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,650
Then it can't be helped. I'll just stay here longer.

Did something happen?

129
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,360
The Hills said that they would move us to the best spot.

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,000
Wow!

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
To be honest, it's nice.

132
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,800
When they told us to close up our store,

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,110
it felt so hopeless that I felt like I had sunken underground.

134
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,000
But now I feel like I pulled through, that I made it...

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,950
That's great.

136

<i>But... can I continue to be all right without you?</i>

137
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,910
How are the contract conditions from the people in Paris?

138
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,700
They aren't bad.

139
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,170
From their perspective, she is definitely an unknown designer.

140
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm sorry, that happens to be their perspective.

141
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,200
So what did they say they would do for her?

142
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,390
Full control over design, control over personnel, profit shares,

143
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,280
and direct planning and participating in Paris fashion shows for two seasons.

144
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,450
To be honest, this is an offer that would be difficult for any designer to decline.

145
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,400
Since you're doing it anyway, take care of each of those conditions one by one.

146
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,900
That kid, Yeong Eun, is like a daughter to me.

147
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,330
These are already good conditions, but go for something that would benefit her more.

148
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,170
Instead of two seasons, make them promise something like a few full years.

149
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,140
For the contract, be very meticulous and detailed while taking care of it.

150
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,840
Yes, Father. I will take care of it well.

151
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,130
All right. That's all then.

152
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,300
I'll trust you.

153
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,710
Okay.

154
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,920
<i>Your dad and that man are meeting alone.</i>

155

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,620
Director Hwang.

157
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,310
Why are you coming from there?

158
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,490
I had something urgent to report to CEO Hwang only.

159
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,070
Urgent and only for him... What is it?

160
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,640
I told you that it was urgent and for him only,

161
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,460
so it's not something I can recklessly disclose.

162
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,740
Of course, he wouldn't be able to say anything.

163
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,490
Since that "urgent, for him only" probably contains some kind of deal.

164
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,960
They must have had some business to attend to as CEOs.

165
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,480
I think they were talking about you though.

166
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,200
That's because I'm the common denominator between the two of them.

167
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,870
And he was put in charge of marketing for not only men's clothing line but also the rest of The One?

168
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,840
That's because, on top of everything else, he's competent.

169
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,440
That's why. Aren't you getting the feeling that he approached you for business reasons?

170
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,170
What are you talking about?

171
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,870
The reason why I like him is because he's not the kind of person that you're describing. Got it?

172
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,150
CEO Hwang must really like him.

173
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,000
He even said that he would give him a 15% increase on his contractual fees.

174
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,930
You wrote that novel of yours in detail!

175
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,260
I acknowledge your hard work!

176
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,910
Confirm it.

177
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,310
What is wrong with you?

178
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,130
Why are you so confident?

179
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,010
Because I genuinely love you.

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,920
Wow, I was so nervous!

181
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,800
You were the most wonderful, even among the professional models.

182
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,990
Really?

183
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,650
<i>Say "Mom, you're so cool!"</i>

184
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,170
She was so pretty that I kept filming her without realizing it.

185
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,940
I get giddy from just looking at my daughter because of how much I adore her.

186
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,030
After living my whole life alone, there were two of us after meeting my husband, then we became three...

187
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,010
Whether I was pretty or ugly,

188
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,890
they took my side and kept me from being lonely.

189
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,060
If not family, who would do that for me?

190
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,080
That's true.

191
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,920
Assistant Manager Seo, do you have any plans to start a family?

192
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,970
I'm not sure.

193
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,100
I haven't met a good person like the senior manager yet.

194
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,290
You've been working with him for a long time, right?

195
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,770
Yes, ever since I was hired.

196
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,070
- What do you think of him, Assistant Manager Seo?
- Pardon?

197
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,570
I was just wondering about what he's like from the perspective of someone working with him.

198
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,160
I see.

199
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,580
He's someone I'm thankful for.

200
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,970
In the beginning, I made a lot of mistakes and was criticized by clients.

201
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,080
"That's all right. It happens."

202
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,370
He comforted me and cheered me on.

203
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,890
So when the senior manager is around, I somehow feel safer,

204
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,540
and I lean on him.

205
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,090
While working, that's how I feel.

206
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,460
Our Soo Ho is a pretty good man, I'll admit.

207
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,380
Am I taking too much of your time for giving something as small as one container of kimchi?

208
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,520
Not at all! Today was pretty relaxed because a large show has finished.

209
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,140
What do you usually do when you have free time?

210
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,570
I go to the bookstore to look at magazines and go to popular places.

211
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,670
These days I also go to the department store often.

212
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,280
I can learn just from seeing what's displayed.

213
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,580
I'm sorry for taking away the time that you would be using to study.

214
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,510
These are photos from the fashion show.

215
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,920
Thank you.

216
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,460
Me too. I'll enjoy eating the kimchi.

You worked hard!

241
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,070
Team Leader, these are some images I've picked out.

242
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,620
Okay, and you've spoken with the visual merchandising department regarding The Hills store?

243
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,270
Yes. They said that they would get an interior plan together after seeing the scale and location of the store.

244
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,200
Tomorrow, I will be going directly to The Hills to work.

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,290
Are you not going home, Team Leader?

247
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,190
I will a little later.

We all did it together.

251
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,990
As for me, I will help more and more for next season and the one after that.

- All right, let's do that.
- Okay.

253
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,910
Then, see you tomorrow.

For that time, 2022 F/W, 2023 Resort & Cruise,

285
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,720
and 2023 S/S will be assigned to you.

286
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,020
Depending on your performance with those three collections, you will be able to negotiate your salary again.

287
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,230
A contract extension will also be decided based on your performance.

Performance?

289
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,110
At this age, I must prepare for the shows as if I'm studying for an exam.

Of course as someone who watched how you led Sonó by your side,

298
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,900
I can't help but think that opportunities are made by people.

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,200
To that extent, Team Leader Ha, you really led Sonó well.

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,270

301
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,680

307

An exhibition?

308
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,420
This invitation is only for those who have won grand prize at international photography contests.

309
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,960
He has so much to prepare that even if he stays up all night starting from now, it wouldn't be enough,

310
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
but he only keeps taking identification photos.

311
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,670
The fashion industry is consumed so quickly.

312
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,650
What's hot right now will change quickly with the trends.

313
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,590
There are many skilled photographers

who switched to wedding photography and general product advertisements.

315
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,960
Isn't the final dream of all photographers

316
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,350
to eventually exhibit their own work?

317
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,970
Jae Gook is precious.

318
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,670
I don't want to make him lose his opportunity.

319
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,090
Go with him.

- Oh my god!
- What?

333
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,460
It's from Vision PR so it's trustworthy information.

334
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,870
On top of that, it's Duchamps, a luxury brand with 130 years of tradition.

335

Paris is finally recognizing our Noonim Yeong Eun.

It's Team Leader Ha. Not Noonim Yeong Eun.

338

Then, are we all going together?

But... seeing how quiet it's been until now...

340
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,960
She still hasn't decided.

341
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,260
Why would she not be able to decide?

342
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,220
When would another opportunity like this come around?

343
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,600
Maybe it's because I treated her so well.

344
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,990
Sonó just recently got raised to the top after all these years.

345
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,060
Wouldn't she feel uneasy to ditch it and leave just like this?

346
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,150
Even still, she won't not go,

347
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,930
and she will definitely take Manager Nam with her.

348
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,820
If she's the creative director, she will have control over human resources too.

349
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,710
Well, I did work with her for a long time.

350
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,420
What about you, Jeong So Yeong?

351
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,490
Well... if Team Leader would take me.

352
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,130
It must be nice to be so young.

353
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,860
If you go and get 3-4 years of work experience, your portfolio will just upgrade on its own.

354
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,990
- That too but I do want to keep learning from Team Leader Ha.
- Cheesy!

355
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:35,020
- Okay, then let's say that we're going.
- We? We!

356
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,770
How dare they after all I've done for them.

357
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,850
What the heck!

358
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,160
What are you all doing now?

359
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,100
Shouldn't you be working? Shouldn't you?

360
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,790
Work! Work!

361
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,820
Gosh, seriously.

362
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,600
Why are you so surprised?

363
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,910
I'm a director. I'm even the CEO's daughter.

364
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,960
They told me not to say anything because a rumor will spread around.

365
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,760
Vision PR is in charge of all marketing down to men's clothing?

366
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,420
Yes.

367
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,240
And the contractual fees have increased by 15 percent?

368
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,700
Yes.

369
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,310
Has it been signed?

370
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,960
Yes, it likely has since CEO Hwang is taking care of it himself.

371
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,630
Really?

372
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,720
So my father and CEO Seok are in the middle of planning something together?

373
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,790
Is that what you mean?

374
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,380
When the customers come down the escalator,

375
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,360
they will naturally look this way.

376
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,030
Then how about we put a colorful display right here?

377
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,340
Okay, and I think it would be good to adjust the lighting too.

378
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,690
I'll consult with the department store about whether or not we can add point lighting in the center.

379
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,350
Yes, I'll leave that to you.

380
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,810
Yes, understood.

381
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,620
Team Leader Ha? It would be good to take down this fake wall, correct?

382
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,150
Yes.

383
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,540
- Just a moment.
- Ah, yes.

384
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,040
Yes, this is Ha Yeong Eun.

385
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,220
I am Jae Gook's mother.

386
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,120
Yes, please speak.

387
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,170
If you have time, would you like to have tea with me?

388
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,650

Yes, I will.

394
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,160
Mi Sook, is something wrong?

395
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,290
You're crying? Why? Are you in a lot of pain again?

396
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,610
It's not me, but Chi Sook.

Huh? Chi Sook?

398
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,340
Yeong Eun, you have to come and help stop her tears.

399
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,420
She's been crying for 30 minutes!

400
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,440
Did you fight with CEO Seok?

401
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,790
Is she someone who would fight?

402
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,380
She's like this because she got upset about something on her own.

403
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,290
In the end, he was the same.

404
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,840
That person also met me for my dad's money.

405
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,050
He's not that kind of person.

406
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,210
No, who would say such a thing?

407
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,900
I verified it all.

408
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,700
With the intention of getting our company's marketing,

409
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,840
he dated me.

410
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,080
But why are you crying?

411
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,440
It wouldn't be enough to rip out all his hair.

412
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,680
Did you check with CEO Seok yourself?

413
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,670
It would be confirmed once I hear it from his mouth.

414
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,530
I really liked him!

415
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,330
How can I break up?

416
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,800
She's sincere.

417
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,630
First, calm down.

418
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,610
Since Ji Min and Soo Ho will come soon, let's go to my house.

419
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,100
Leave her alone. It's fine.

420
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,790
Ji Min and Soo Ho went shopping.

421
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,710
They will eat dinner before coming back.

422
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,990
- The two of them?
- With Assistant Manager Seo.

423
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,740
<i>Assistant Manager Seo, what brings you... here?</i>

424
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,700
<i>Your wife asked it of me.</i>

425
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,490
<i>The aches are strong today.
[My Honey]</i>

426
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,130
<i>Assistant Manager Seo happened to say she was going to the department store today,</i>

427
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,990
<i>and the time happened to be right.</i>

428

<i>Would you be able to dress the child properly?</i>

429

<i>For girl's clothes,</i>

430
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,730
<i>a woman has to see it to know if it fits or suits her.</i>

431
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,150
<i>Ji Min, come with me to try on clothes.</i>

432

<i>Dad, I'm going to go with Auntie.</i>

433
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,000
<i>Okay.</i>

434
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,120
<i>If you feel sorry, buy Assistant Manager Seo a meal or something.</i>

435
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,730
<i>Something I need?</i>

436
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,830
<i>What would I need?</i>

437
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,030
<i>There's nothing.</i>

438
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,070
<i>Don't go somewhere like the food court because of money,</i>

439
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,390
<i>and go somewhere nice, okay?</i>

440
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,160
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,160
Hey! You stay still!

443
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,680
These assholes! I'm going to show them what betrayal really tastes like!

444
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,200
Forget it! Don't go overboard!

445
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,090
I asked Assistant Manager Seo to do that.

446
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,890
- Mi Sook.
- Jeon Mi Sook.

447
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,270
That's right, I'm in the middle of breaking up right now.

448
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,530
Sure, I honestly do feel a bit of rage!

449
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,050
If I didn't happen to be sick, the two of them... I would just—

450
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,320
That's what I'd think one second, then afterwards...

451
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,830
I'm so grateful that she's not a weird lady.

452
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,560
My heart goes back and forth,

453
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,390
like this and like that.

454
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,980
But I am not breaking up with Soo Ho.

455
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,040
My lingering attachment,

456
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,720
my hope,

457
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,830
desires...

458
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,610
those are the kinds of things I'm breaking up with.

459
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,820
This girl, seriously!

460
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,710
And if that doesn't work?

461
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,400
If you keep hesitating, what should you do?

462
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,340
That's when you should really part, no?

463
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,540
When you keep getting greedy.

464
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,020
When you've gotten greedy so you anxiously wish for a bit more,

465
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,680
a bit more...

466
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,140
I can't live! Seriously, this girl!

00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,420
Yes, good!

469

If I got the marketing rights because of you, I wouldn't even accept them!

It's true that I liked you.

And it's also true that I became close to CEO Hwang through you.

Do you think my work became easier because of that?

No, it didn't.

It became more difficult and challenging.

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,770
she has to be not only cut-throat but also sly.

635
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,980
I can't make her stay by my side

636
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,060
if she has to go through that.

637
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,840
Will you be all right?

638
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,030
No.

639
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,070
Understanding that so well is driving me crazy.

640
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,620
To the point that I can't insist,

641
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,050
I understand the situation so clearly that it is driving me crazy.

642
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,860
Despite that, Hyung,

643
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,400
just once...

644
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,050
I want to grab her just once.

645
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,560
If I don't, I'll go crazy.

646
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,160
Jeez.

647
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,920
Is it love that's hard

648
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,830
or breaking up that's hard?

649
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,780
<i>I understand how you two feel</i>

650
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:03,140
<i> and that I am the villain in your love.</i>

651
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,660
<i>You may be sad now,</i>

652
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,650
<i>but after ten or twenty years,</i>

653
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,850
<i>you will be glad I did this.</i>

654
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,300
<i>That time will come.</i>

655
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,720
<i>I lived longer, so what I say will be right.</i>

656
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,950
<i>For setting aside your feelings after understanding my words,</i>

657
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,760
<i>I thank you.</i>

658
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,410
<i>Please don't thank me.</i>

659
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,370
<i>It's not because of you.</i>

660
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,910
<i>Jae Gook and I did not love for someone else's sake,</i>

661
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:42,610
<i>nor do we plan to set aside our feelings because of someone.</i>

662
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,990
<i>Jae Gook will go to Paris.</i>

663
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
<i>That's the correct choice for him.</i>

664
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,930
<i>And I</i>

665
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,310
<i>will also make the correct choice for me.</i>

666
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,640
<i>A choice that will</i>

667
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,450
<i>allow me to love and protect</i>

668
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,200
<i>the work that I love</i>

669
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,510
<i>and the people I love until the end.</i>

670
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:21,420
♫ <i>At first, I was calmer than I thought I would be</i> ♫

671
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:27,000
♫ <i>The longing hurts more than breaking up</i> ♫

672
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,420
<i>What do you think is at the end of that road?</i>

673
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,520
<i>It's probably me there.</i>

674
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,980
<i>No matter what path you take,</i>

675
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,810
<i>at the end of it, I'll always be there.</i>

676
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,740
♫ <i>Even still, I, who am truly like a fool</i> ♫

677
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,210
♫ <i>Survive like this</i> ♫

678
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,800
♫ <i>I couldn't let you go</i> ♫

679
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,770
♫ <i>And I couldn't erase it</i> ♫

680
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:11,640
♫ <i>One side of my chest just hurts</i> ♫

681
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,900
♫ <i>Turning away again</i> ♫

682
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:20,300
♫ <i>My departing footsteps are heavy</i> ♫

683
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,350
<i>I appreciate DPHP's offer,</i>

684
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:47,250
<i>but I will remain in my position as Sonó's designer.</i>

685
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,840
<i>This is my official position.</i>

686
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:57,500
Noona Yeong Eun always defies common sense.

687
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,220
Because she's riding a roller coaster, she's out of her mind.

688
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,410
I thought we were really going to Paris this time.

689
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,470
Then with that mindset shall we get ready for the next season?

690
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,300
Is that okay?

691
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,380
With that, the team leader position has gotten further away.

692
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,460
Didn't know my position was at risk.

693
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,290
I had a splendid dream.

694
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,870
Make pretty and good clothing and come up.

695
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,400
I'll give it to you anytime.

696
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,370
<i>[Secretary Kim]</i>

697
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:31,950
<i>Team Leader Ha, the CEO is summoning you.</i>

698
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,420
You called for me.

699
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,630
You decided not to go to Paris?

700
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,290
What is the reason you can't go to such a great place?

701
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:55,320
It's not that I can't. It's that I won't.

702
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,440
So, why?

703
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,090
I didn't know until now.

704
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,530
I didn't think much about my team leader position. I thought "well, that's that."

705
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,090
But then when I actually tried to leave it behind,

706
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:11,700
I couldn't imagine myself without Sonó.

707
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,470
The moment I thought of separating, I realized something new.

708
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,960
It's not that Sonó is here because of me.

709
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,070
Thanks to Sonó, I am here.

710
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,120
Yeong Eun, you... I know you've worked hard.

711
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,970
You have struggled covering for your friend's lack of skill and doing your own work.

712
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,290
It must have been hard.

713
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,020
Honestly, at first I thought it was for money.

714
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,700
I thought for the sake of your own job security,

715
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,780
you cleaned up after Chi Sook's messes

716
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,090
while only being concerned about moving up in the company.

717
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,080
Is that so?

718
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,160
Every season, you never wasted a day and just made clothes.

719
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,430
When I saw you treat Chi Sook sincerely as a friend, I thought I wasted my life

720
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,540
because I don't know how to read people at all.

721
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,170
I was ashamed.

722
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,330
With this incident, I realized something too.

723
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,430
Sonó is Ha Yeong Eun's.

724
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:14,980
So take Sonó and become independent.

725
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,010
CEO.

726
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:22,440
You made it and protected its value.

727
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,200
Become independent and develop it however you wish.

728
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,080
Your sincerity won over me.

729
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,310
<i>Breaking news! Team Leader Ha is not going to Paris.</i>

730
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,360
<i>CEO Hwang suggested she become independent with Sonó.</i>

731
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,800
What?

732
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,160
Did something happen?

733
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,890
- She's not going to Paris.
- Did you see this?

734
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,560
<i>[Wow, as expected from Team Leader Ha!]
[Did Sonó reject Olivier?]</i>

735
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,610
<i> [Is Team Sonó moving out together?]
[I can't believe she rejected Olivier...]</i>

736
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,400
I heard Team Leader Ha won't go.

737
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,460
What is it? What is it that you're like that?

738
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,510
I'll make it a separate corporation, so lead it like a personal brand.

739
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:07,220
Is it going to be The One's licensed brand?

740
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,220
We'll split the sales profits 50-50.

741
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,970
What do you think? Do you want to try it?

742
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,800
I'm very thankful for the offer,

743
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,160
but, honestly, it's something I never thought about.

744
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,550
Do I have to give you my answer now?

745
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:26,410
Take your time thinking about it and put together a business plan.

746
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,970
Yes, it's Ha Yeong Eun.

747
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:05,370
You remember, right? I'm Kim Seo Hyeon, editor-in-chief of Nouvelle Vague.

748
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,160
<i>I called as soon as I heard the news.</i>

749
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,800
You refused an offer from Olivier?

750
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,000
<i>Now I really want to know who Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun is.</i>

751
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,470
I want to do the interview I requested last time.

752
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,140
Of course, I will send you the questions again.

753
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,110
As you wished, we will do it at Sonó's office.

754
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:28,320
I decided to do the Nouvelle Vague interview.

755
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,950
Awesome.

756
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,920
Then, will the Nouvelle Vague interview be done at our office?

757
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,640
What are you doing? You must hurry and fill it with our clothing.

758
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,970
It will be a six-page article in Nouvelle Vague.

759
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,690
Yes!

760
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,660
Sketches! I'll bring the sketches.

761
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,200
So?

762
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,950
<i>I wondered if I could ask you to take photos during the interview.</i>

763
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,690
Why are you making such a request?

764
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,710
Is it not possible?

765
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,470
<i>I meant you don't have to ask me.</i>

766
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,520
Just tell me the time and the place.

767
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,030
I will be there promptly.

768
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,610
If it isn't me, who would take your picture?

769
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,100
<i>Isn't that so?</i>

770
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,400
The date is tomorrow and the place is our Sonó's office.

771
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,050
Okay, I got it.

772
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,020
Then, see you tomorrow.

773
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,330
Just as you brought Sonó to popularity, I ask the same for the men's clothing line.

774
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:18,140
Yes, we will probably proceed differently than we have until now.

775
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:22,680
From what we've analyzed, it looks like you are planning to market to people in their late 30's.

776
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,120
Once they settle on a brand, there's a high chance of them becoming long-term customers.

777
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,720
Instead of excessive online advertisements and celebrity models,

778
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,290
we plan to use an algorithm to choose five items that customers prefer

779
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,100
and have them try them on.

780
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,340
Afterwards, they will choose products they want and return the rest.

781
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,860
An experiential marketing strategy is what we plan to use actively.

782
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,790
Okay.

783
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:48,830
Is there anything specific you'd like to add, Director Hwang?

784
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,330
- There isn't.
- Yes.

785
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,550
Okay, then we'll finish here.

786
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,210
- You've all worked hard.
- You've worked hard.

787
00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:01,960
Regarding marketing, what are your thoughts on using an online algorithm?

788
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,030
I think I'll have to look at the data first.

789
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,350
- You've worked hard today.
- As have you.

790
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:28,030
Do you really have nothing to say?

791
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,600
No, I don't.

792
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,200
Do misunderstandings happen for no reason?

793
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,700
Wouldn't the person who acted suspiciously also be at fault?

794
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,390
If there's trust, even if the person acted suspiciously, one would not doubt him.

795
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,660
Then well...

796
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:53,190
If you have nothing to say, there's no reason to meet anymore.

797
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:01,680
Are you saying we should break up?

798
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,390
Isn't that what you were saying?

799
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,180
I understand.

800
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,990
Well then.

801
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,410
- Shall we start?
- Yes.

802
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,350
Shall we start with a simple question?

803
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:58,560
I heard that you came up with the name Sonó yourself.

804
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,050
What does it mean?

805
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,990
I didn't come up with it.

806
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:13,350
A no name photographer in Paris came up with it for me.

807
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,700
Sonó means echo, a resounding sound.

808
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,210
Sonó was started because of that no name photographer

809
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:28,190
who wrote that he hopes that the echo will extend far and wide.

810
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,700
I'm most curious as to why you refused Olivier's offer.

811
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,700
Isn't it an offer any designer would hope for?

812
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,150
If it was the me from ten years ago, I probably would have wanted it.

813
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:46,020
Because with Paris, the birthplace of fashion, the name alone gives the feeling that you've succeeded.

814
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:51,370
But to me now, success isn't that kind of thing.

815
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:55,710
What do you think success is, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun?

816
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,880
Going to multiple places myself to choose the fabric,

817
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,220
creating the spec sheet with my own hands,

818
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,930
staying up all night,

819
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:08,490
and seeing the pile of eraser dust on the desk when the morning comes.

820
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,010
Although it might be slow and tedious,

821
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:18,200
breaking the stereotypes, preconceptions, and prejudices surrounding domestic brands

822
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,310
one by one while remaining in my position.

823
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,330
Doing the work that I love

824
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:30,820
and reaching far away around the world by doing that.

825
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:36,770
That's what success means to me.

826
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:42,150
If the photographer who gave the name Sonó hears this, he would be very happy.

827
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:47,090
Do you want to say something to him through this interview?

828
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,230
Thank you.
<i>(Informal speech)</i>

829
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:00,590
Thank you.
<i>(Formal speech)</i>

830
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,010
Congratulations on getting to hold an exhibition.

831
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:37,910
Congratulations on getting to do what you wanted to do.

832
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:47,670
Soon, it will get cooler and autumn will come, right?

833
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,190
A new season will also start.

834
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:59,460
Before autumn comes, go to Paris.

835

<i>A relationship that started in the spring passes the hot summer</i>

837
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,950
I was thoroughly...

838
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:21,030
warm and happy.

839
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,230
And I loved you.

840
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:30,170
Me too.

841

<i>The next season of our lives that will begin in autumn,</i>

842

<i>I wish it happiness. </i>

843
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,700
To be honest, I bought a plane ticket.

844
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,230
When is it?

848
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:22,210
The decision of Designer Ha Yeong Eun and the decision of Sonó's Team Leader Ha...

849
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,970
I understand. I acknowledge it.

850
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,750
I respect it.

851
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,020
I will accept everything.

852
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,980
But putting all that aside,

853
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,060
just this one thing.

854
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:49,890
My brother, my mother, being a designer, being a photographer... forget all that.

855
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:52,440
They all don't matter.

856
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,010
The man, Yoon Jae Gook,

857
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,930
will ask the woman, Ha Yeong Eun,

858

this one thing just once more

for the last time.
