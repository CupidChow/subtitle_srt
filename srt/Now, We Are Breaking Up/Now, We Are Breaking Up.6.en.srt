was vague and vast.

If we're doing this, what's the point of having two brands?

It must be a coincidence.

We need to ask for soundproof walls.

They must have heard our discussions while walking in and out.

66

Or it was leaked by the development office.

I saw something really interesting yesterday.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,140
I was wondering why you stayed behind to work until it was so late.

74
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,040
Can you tell me in a way I can understand?

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,350
I get that you were trying to be transferred to a successful team.

76
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,430
But you shouldn't do that, don't you think?

77
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,690
Are you suspecting me right now?

78
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,220
I'm certain it's you.

79
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,850
It's not me. And what are you saying about my effort?

80
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,420
Why are you looking down on my effort? Who gave you the right?

81
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,940
Me? I'm the CEO's son.

82
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,650
Out of 80 applicants, I was the one who was hired.

83
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,480
From the application review to the three rounds of interviews,

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,050
I worked and worked so hard just to get to here.

85
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,840
What effort did you put in to get this job?

86
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,290
One word from the CEO.

87
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,470
That doesn't give you a right to doubt someone so rashly.

88
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,380
But you did something that deserves my suspicion.

89
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,710
I've never done anything that would sow doubt in the mind of someone like you.

90
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,400
Don't doubt me so rashly.

91
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,500
What are you going to do? I need to go report an update.

92
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,330
One of them is a copy, and I'm saying it isn't mine.

93
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,160
I know that you would never steal another's work even if there was a knife to your neck.

94
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,980
But what can I do?

95
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,910
Clair Marie is also my responsibility.

96
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,420
There is no way I can report that you two had the same idea.

97
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,910
What are you doing?

98
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,990
Clair Marie handed it in first. It's right to take their side.

99
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,660
- I won't acknowledge this.
- And if you don't?

100
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,470
We need to look at the CCTV footage.

101
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,420
What if it was really a spec sheet leak?

102
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,740
You won't be the only one receiving disciplinary action. I will too for bad management.

103
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,360
Responsibility must be taken if needed. That applies to you, too.

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,100
Even if it was leaked, you're responsible, too.

105
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,390
That means you weren't able to manage your team well.

106
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,040
Plus, you said you were confident.

107
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,660
You must have a lot of reference materials piled up over the 10 years.

108
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,930
Just choose one that sold well, make some alterations, and use that.

109
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,990
I can't do that.

110
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,800
Then what will we do?

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,840
Do you want to delay the season because of your stubbornness?

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,020
Will you form an investigation committee when we don't even have evidence

113
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,060
and give up on the S/S season because everyone is busy being questioned?

114
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,870
Bitch.

115
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,490
W-W-What did you say? I-I-I'm a—

116
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,100
Hey! I'm your boss!

117
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,110
That's right, you are my boss! So act like one!

118
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,830
You told me to win, but you're playing it like this? You're really a bitch.

119
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,970
You're pathetic.

120
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,020
O-O-Oh my. Hey!

121
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,420
Wow, seriously?

122
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,590
Wow, Team Leader Ha is really too sensitive.

123
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,290
Honestly, don't all creators have similar thoughts about trends and patterns?

124
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,290
Why is she this upset over a similar design that happened by chance?

125
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,160
Shut your mouth, In Na.

126
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,000
I've known Yeong Eun for 20 years.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,750
I know for a fact that she would never do that.

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,010
Although I'm going to let it slide this time, if you pull something like this again...

129
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,440
I'll really become a bitch!

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,300
Got it?

131
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,640
Director. Director!

132
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,010
Make sure to provide a lot of promotion and marketing efforts.

133
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,410
Yes, sir.

134
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,430
I'm so busy preparing for the season. Why did you call me?

135
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,690
Spent the whole time together yesterday?

136

Who spent time with whom?

137
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,050
Secretary Kim said that you went to the exhibition and ate dinner together.

138
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,710
Ah. Yes, well.

139
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,640
But are you sure our families were close before?

140
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,780
What do you mean?

141
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,720
Well, you can't even distinguish between him and his brother.

142
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,610
That was only because I saw him occasionally when he was a child!

143
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,960
Anyway, if the company is going to grow, it needs distribution channels.

144
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,150
Make sure you meet him often and gradually get to know him better. Understand?

145
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,100
Why aren't you answering?

146
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,210
Yes, I understand.

147
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,570
Ah, you've answered.

148
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,840
What's the matter?

149
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Oh, there's something you left at my place yesterday.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,240
I think this is your scarf, Director Hwang.

151
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,570
Oh, that?

152
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,640
You can just keep it.

153
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,450
What? Your scarf?

154
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,760
What does that mean?

155
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,800
Well, I guess that we've taken a step further in our relationship?

156
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,590
And by a step, you mean?

157

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
and it's just a gift, so keep it.

160
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,760
A gift. To me?

175
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,280
How did you find an artist from the UK?

176
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,080
You're the only one who doesn't acknowledge it, but I'm very capable.

177
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,970
I'll stop here with the paint and get started with the lettering now.

178
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,030
Okay! Sounds good.

179
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,290
Last year, when we opened the personal exhibit, the response was really good.

180
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,460
If we do a live show in Hongdae this time, I'm sure that many people will show up.

181
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,870
Oh, wow. This is a really good shot.

182
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,130
This is for the event brochure, so let's go with the intense shots.

183
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,390
- What's with this?
- It's nice, right?

184
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,840
Let's keep our distance.

185
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,790
It's a gift.

186
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,010
I mean, if someone is thankful, she can buy a meal next time or give a gift card.

187
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,920
But she discreetly left this behind.

188
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,220
That means she's sharing with me.

189
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,100
She's being so forward and boldly not hiding her feelings.

190
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,720
What do you think this is?

191
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,420
She must like you.

192
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,740
Right? That's the only conclusion you can make.

193
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,250
Who gave it to you?

194
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,440
There's someone. I got really close to her yesterday.

195
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,320
I guess I should earn a lot of money and move out.

196
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,300
You're so hard to understand.

197
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,570
- How so?
- It's not like you don't have money saved.

198
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,400
You say you want to earn more, yet you don't want to work for profitable fashion shows.

199
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,160
You don't even want to do photo shoots. Yet you jump at these opportunities.

200
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,130
What's the reason?

201
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,040
It's fun.

202
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,920
And there is something else fun today.

203
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,170
The fabric for Clair Marie was changed to tweed this morning.

204
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,110
I heard on my way here.

205
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,270
Isn't it fun since it changes so quickly?

206
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,560
Make sure you change your concept in good spirits.

207
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,960
<i> Na Ri, I think the gabardine and the tweed will both work, </i>

208
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,100
<i> but the gabardine has a heavy color, </i>

209
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,460
<i>so let's go with the tweed.</i>

210
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,720
<i> Ma'am, Ji Min did not bring her assignment notebook today.</i>

211
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,110
<i>[Assignment notebook]</i>

212
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,300
<i> I told you to sign Ji Min's assignment notebook and put it in her bag.</i>

213
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,100
It's not like she has just one or two notebooks. I put them all in.

214
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,920
Why do you always leave the socks like this? How many times have I told you?

215
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,470
Is it that hard to turn the socks inside out and put them in the washer?

216
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,530
"Is it that hard to turn the socks inside out and put them in the washer?"

217
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,530
I'm the one working, yet you told me to drop off the kid and throw the trash away.

218
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,180
What were you doing in that time?

219
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,320
I need to go into a meeting. Bye.

220
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm sorry I didn't pick you up even though I told you I would.

221
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,450
- Did you wait for long?
- No.

222
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,920
Oh, one minute, Assistant Manager Seo.

223
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,610
Were you able to handle the brainstorming for The FallM?

224
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,030
I've been blaming myself for not being as competent as you are.

225
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,230
Should we go somewhere over the weekend?

226
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,220
Ideas usually come up when you relax.

227
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,030
Will things be okay back home?

228
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,150
Why are you bringing up my home at work?

229
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,220
Where should we go?

230
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,000
<i>[Misdiagnosis by university hospitals]
[Is it possible to sue?]</i>

231
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,250
<i> I cried so much after the CT scan revealed that I'm at the last stage of pancreatic cancer.</i>

232
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,940
<i> Additional tests showed gastrointestinal tuberculosis, and I was able to recover completely.</i>

233
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,220
<i> My aunt was told by the university hospital she had a malignant tumor, but it later turned out to be a cyst.</i>

234
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,900
<i> The university hospital told me it was a malignant tumor, but it was a cyst when they opened me up for surgery.</i>

235
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,850
<i> The really flustering fact was that it wasn't cancer.</i>

236
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,390
<i> The problem was a mass in my small intestines.</i>

237
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,460
<i> Please make sure you get a PET-CT scan in addition to blood work.</i>

238
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,900
<i> You need to go to at least three hospitals.</i>

239
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,350
The design got leaked, but it's so quiet.

240
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,770
It's not even the first time it has happened. We have always just let it blow over and moved on.

241
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,700
Gosh, who leaked it?

242
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,820
Seon Joo, you really left right after I left, right?

243
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,920
Why are you being like this? I really left right after.

244
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,960
<i> Are you really going to let the atmosphere be like this?</i>

245
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,560
<i> You should come clean and aim for brighter days.</i>

246
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,720
What's with the atmosphere?

247
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,120
I know you're all upset, but it's more upsetting

248
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,460
if teamwork falls apart in addition to the leaked design.

249
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,310
I don't believe that anyone from our team would've done it.

250
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,760
Things already turned out this way.

251
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,220
What we can do is finish what we meant to do.

252
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,070
- Might as well do it brilliantly.
- Yes.

253
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,820
We don't have much time. We need to choose a new design.

254
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,270
I'll look into what fabrics we can secure.

255
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,500
Let's all stay strong.

256
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,750
Among the fabrics that were ordered and canceled by other companies,

257
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,470
are there any that we can use? I'd prefer a seven-gauge.

258
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,420
Everyone is using checkered fabric, so some of that is left.

259
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,610
We aren't planning on using checkered fabric.

260
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,020
There is a place that will get you what you need

261
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,210
if you also take what's left in their stock.

262
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,880
But the production department will not allow it.

263
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,280
What do we have left?

264
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,190
Jersey.

265
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,040
<i>[Jersey: light and stretchy but stable knit fabric]</i>

266
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,530
You should confess before the matter gets bigger.

267
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,140
What did you do yesterday at Team Leader Ha's desk?

268
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,600
- Why do I have to tell you that?
- Want me to reveal the CCTV footage?

269
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,590
If you're confident, then do it. But what if it wasn't me?

270
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,740
How are you going to take responsibility for misunderstanding me?

271
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,910
Why aren't you answering?

272
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,290
I guess the cameras didn't capture exactly what I was doing.

273
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,100
Is it fun making others suffer just because of your ambition?

274
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,020
Is it fun making someone a fool because of your doubt?

275
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,440
What are you doing here?

276
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,650
It would have been nice to know in advance.

277
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,160
Then I could have put more effort into my appearance before coming.

278
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,440
You already look great.

279
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,740
The scarf is so fancy that it catches my eye.

280
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,010
Then my gaze goes up, which is great.

281
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,980
I should have gifted it sooner.

282
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,230
Should we watch a movie together tonight?

283
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,080
As a token of gratitude for the scarf, I would like to give you something in return, so I'll buy the tickets.

284
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,500
It's too early to be thankful. My request has just started.

285
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,160
- What do you mean?
- Cookie's ruthlessly cold heart.

286
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,670
I'd like to know what would make it melt.

287
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,510
- You said you were dumped.
- I didn't agree to it.

288
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,950
- Then, what's with this?
- A sign of friendship.

289
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,310
When you said we took a step...

290
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,780
I meant that we took a step towards knowing the truth about each other.

291
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,950
Hey, Noona Sook.

292
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,440
Oh my, Pete! Oh, my god! It's been a while!

293
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,780
- Who's this?
- I heard you broke up with Jimmy.

294
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,370
The truth is that I was the one who dumped him. Tell people that if they ask.

295
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,310
But who's this? Your boyfriend?

296
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,540
No, just a friend.

297
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,180
Say hello. This is Vision PR's CEO Seok Do Hoon.

298
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,050
This is Pete, a rising model. He's a freelancer right now.

299
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,630
Yes, hello.

300
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,370
Nice to meet you. I'm Pete Park.

301
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,050
You have good style. Please contact me when you can.

302
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,650
What does this mean?

303
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,090
Well, it means I'd like to talk deeply with him separately.

304
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,120
<i> Oh, my! He's so straightforward.</i>

305
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,320
I'm sorry! I haven't been in the dating game for so long that I didn't catch on.

306
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,980
I should be going because of work.

307
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,990
I hope the two of you are able to share a deep talk.

308
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,400
You guys look good together.

309
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,260
We'll talk later.

310
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,720
- No.
- What?

311
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,900
You're making the wrong assumption.

312
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,150
That man is straight.

313
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,760
There's no way. He said women weren't his type.

314
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,860
Is that not so, CEO Seok?

315
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,600
Then this scarf was also because...?

316
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,750
Yes, well.

317
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,880
No... where...

318
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,050
CEO Seok!

319
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,270
Please tell me at which point I misunderstood and caused you to feel disappointed.

320
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,000
Why do you always judge and make your own assumptions about me as you want?

321
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,680
I apologize if I offended you.

322
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,530
I'm not offended by your misunderstanding.

323
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,290
I'm not prejudiced against it either.

324
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,230
Then why are you being like this?

325
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,820
Because my heart hurts.

326
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,430
You've never made the point

327
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,890
to look at me or get to know me.

328
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,100
But the fact that I had a different thought

329
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,940
makes me angry.

330
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,200
A different thought?

331
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,520
Never mind.

332
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,870
I'll get going.

333
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,700
So frustrating. Just tell me!

334
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,590
I am a man who has feelings

335
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,960
and a heart!

336
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,250
A man?

337
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,160
This artist was born in Korea,

338
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
but worked in Bristol and got famous.

339
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,590
You're a fashion photographer but also take pictures like these?

340
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,900
Look.

341
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,410
"I have nothing to lose."

342
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,340
I have nothing to lose.

343
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,030
"Guts over fear."

344
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,120
Guts over fear.

345
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,500
"Prends ces ailes cassées et apprends à voler."
<i>(in French)</i>

346
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,730
Take these broken wings and learn how to fly.

347
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,030
The moment that these words are written upon an empty wall,

348
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,270
they start to have meaning.

349
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,370
It's similar to us.

350
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,600
Even though it may seem like a piece of clothing that will be discarded after a season,

351
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,410
we always try hard to create new meaning.

352
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,070
The same goes for humans.

353
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,620
Although it seems like we are just passing by,

354
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,900
to someone,

355
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,860
we may leave behind something special.

356
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,920
Because of that person,

357
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,420
your life can change as well.

358
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,460
For me,

359
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,570
a woman who bought my picture,

360
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,260
that no one else glanced at, changed my life.

361
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,690
Because of that, when I was about to give up on photography,

362
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,400
I didn't end up doing that.

363
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,280
Thanks to that picture,

364
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,860
I was able to hang on whenever things got hard.

365
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,790
Because of me.

366
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,910
That is how discerning my eyes are.

367
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,690
By the way, isn't charging 20 euros for a picture by an obscure artist too much?

368
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,010
I had to skip my meals to buy it.

369
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,820
Oh, it was 15 euros, but my friend charged 20 without knowing.

370
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,230
- Excuse me.
- It's too late for a refund.

371
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,970
Hold on.

372
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,380
<i>[Prends ces ailes cassées et apprends à voler.]</i>

373
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,160

00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,790
<i>[Prends ces ailes cassées et apprends à voler.]</i>

(Take these broken wings and learn how to fly.)</i>

378
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,600
They took everyone from Lamong.

379
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,170
It is easier to work with the same people.

380
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,240
<i>[Personnel Announcement]</i>
This is why connections are so important.

381
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,540
Clair Marie is receiving a lot of support.
<i>[Oh In Na, Song Hyeon Joo, Lee Seong Min, Im Soo Yeon from Lamong to Clair Marie]</i>

382
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,220
- I'd love to go to Clair Marie.
- So Yeong isn't on here.

383
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,380
Hey, Ahn Seon Joo. What's going on here?

384
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,730
Am I the only one who doesn't understand?

385
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,370
- Let's work well.
- Yes.

386
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,090
What on earth happened?

387
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,330
Did the spec sheet walk out on its own or what?

388
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,370
I have no words even if they say they had the same idea.

389
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,200
This is just so dumbfounding, really.

390
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,710
I can't believe it.

391
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,550
It's unfair, but what can we do?

392
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,310
There's no way to prove it.

393
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,210
Let's just work.

394
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,080
Ahn Seon Joo, what's wrong?

395
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,060
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Let go.

396
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,770
- You should at least explain why you're acting like this!
- It was me.

397
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,770
What do you mean it was—

398
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,620
Yes, it was me! I did it.

399
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,640
I wanted to go to a successful team,

400
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,600
so I sent them the design!

401
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,550
You! You...!

402
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,690
Team Leader.

403
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,750
You! Is this really how you're going to do your job?

404
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,980
Everyone, leave.

405
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,700
What's the matter?

406
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,440
What brought you all the way to our workspace?

407
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,410
You took our factory and our fabric.

408
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,810
Fine, I will understand that since you have to win against the competition.

409
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,610
You shouldn't play with people though.

410
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,940
I can't even make offers?

411
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,310
All I did was present a possibility, and Ahn Seon Joo was the one who took it.

412
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,970
That's not an offer. You used her.

413
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,980
You weren't going to take her anyway.

414
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,820
Do you hire anyone who sends in a resume?

415
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,420
Ahn Seon Joo's skills were lacking.

416
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,250
Are you that insecure?

417
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,770
You don't have much confidence to win against me?

418
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,900
- What?
- Although you took everything,

419
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,830
you're still insecure and anxious.

420
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,020
No matter how you think about it, you don't have the confidence to win against me.

421
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,440
Excuse me, Team Leader Ha!

422
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,910
Don't just design clothes. You need to design your heart, too.

423
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,870
Greed, insecurity, playing both sides, and betrayal.

424
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,950
Hey. With those things, will you be able to produce pretty and well-made clothes

425
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,870
when what is in your heart will come out through your hands?

426
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,280
Will you stop speaking so rashly?

427
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,780
Bother my team again

428
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,140
and I'll file a civil case against you no matter how many years it takes

429
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,270
so that you won't be able to make clothes ever again.

430
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,970
What are you doing? If you called me out here, you should talk.

431
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,360
Well, I was curious.

432
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,400
Just what did you do at Team Leader Ha's desk?

433
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,570
Team Leader's sketchbook.

434
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,830
<i> Would you like to use this as reference material?</i>

435
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,570
<i>When I was your age, I drew these for my graduation project.</i>

436
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,550
The team leader told me

437
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,250
that I could take a look at it whenever I had artist's block.

438
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,430
So, when I'm alone, I want to look at it to study.

439
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,150
Why would you look at it by yourself late at night?

440
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,490
I don't want to get caught.

441
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,940
I lack a lot of skills and don't have great ideas.

442
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,270
I'm not naturally talented, so I take more time than others,

443
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,340
which means people will think I don't have the skills and I won't be recognized.

444
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,420
But isn't it better to be honest than to be misunderstood like this?

445
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,220
Misunderstandings will clear up one day,

446
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,410
but lacking in skills becomes a judgment against me.

447
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,390
One by one, those all stack up and become my future.

448
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,490
Although for you, as the CEO's son, how skilled you are or what others say

449
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,190
will not matter at all.

450
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,580
- It's the team leader.
- Fabric sample room?

451
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,080
Ahn Seon Joo, she wants you to come too.

452
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,010
It's jersey.

453
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,850
What are you going to do with this?

454
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,390
A collab.

455
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,050
A collab? With who?

456
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,990
With them.

457
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,970
<i>[Prends ces ailes cassées et apprends à voler.]</i>

458
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,690
With jersey?

459
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,600
It's worn for comfort as innerwear. Wouldn't it be too ordinary?

460
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,810
You can say it's ordinary, but I would say it has a lot of potential.

461
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,700
Coco Chanel made outerwear using jersey which was previously only used for innerwear.

462
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,120
What about the main design?

463
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,170
We'll go with the shirt dress that So Yeong designed.

464
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,830
Among the designs that didn't get sent to Clair Marie, this is the one I like most.

465
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,630
How do you all feel about it?

466
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,900
I like it.

467
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,790
I don't think it's a bad idea either.

468
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,120
What about you, Seon Joo? Why aren't you saying anything?

469
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,600
You don't want to work anymore?

470
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,950
No, that's not it.

471
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,150
It's just that... I don't think I should be at Sonó any longer.

472
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,600
Even if you leave, you should apologize properly before you do.

473
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,270
I'm sorry.

474
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,860
Not to me, but to your coworkers.

475
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,630
Your seniors and juniors... You knew how we all wanted to do well.

476
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,460
How excited we were.

477
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,770
So see exactly what your greed caused

478
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,080
and properly apologize.

479
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,900
Don't just apologize with words. Show us with your results.

480
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,910
Design diligently and finish the season properly.

481
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,220
Then officially apologize to everyone.

482
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,050
I'm not giving you a chance. I'm telling you to apologize.

483
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,540
Whether your apology is accepted or not is up to your coworkers.

484
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,340
Why aren't you saying anything?

485
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,720
Team Leader is asking you what you think about So Yeong's design.

486
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,660
I like it too.

487
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,950
It's unanimous, Team Leader.

488
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,110
All right, we'll divide up the work now and start recruiting influencers.

489
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,490
Na Ri, contact Im Soo Ah. Seon Joo can contact Park Ha Mi.

490
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,930
I'll contact Ahn Hae Rang as well.

491
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,930
And who else is popular nowadays?

492
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,990
I know someone too.

493
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,000

495

What's with these looks?

496
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,730
You don't believe me?

497
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,570
Excuse me, I'm pretty popular in that field.

498
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,340
I don't know if you're popular or not, but I know Hye Rin will never do it.

499
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,550
Let's start with recruiting the influencers we mentioned before.

500
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,160
Okay.

501
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,840
Can you really recruit Hye Rin?

502
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,860
Why do you ask?

503
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,210
If you do, I'll overlook how you've wronged me.

504
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,670
As you requested, the CT, MRI, PET-CT,

505
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,440
and the blood work were all done.

506
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,090
You see this on the screen?

507
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,660
It is correct that it is pancreatic cancer.

508
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,980
There's no possibility of the device being faulty or it being a misdiagnosis?

509
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,760
No, there isn't.

510
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,790
You should get hospitalized as soon as possible and get treatment.

511

All right, Secretary Choi.

520
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,540
Yes, good work.

521
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,430
The food will come out soon. Drink a bit slower.

522
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,950
How refreshing.

523
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,280
Did the estimates come out to be a lot?

524
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,780
The hood of the car needs to be straightened out, the bumper needs to be replaced,

525
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,070
and oh, the engine oil needs changing.

You should've asked them for a discount.

I'll take care of it.

528
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,320
But you're drinking that beer well for someone who crashed her car.

529
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,530
Why? It's fun.

530
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,700
Got just the two of us hanging out like this.

531

Your positivity is no joke.

532
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,800
But why did you call me instead of Yeong Eun?

533
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,520
Did you two fight?

534
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,980
Yeong Eun is busy.

535
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,200
You took their fabric, factory, and design.

536
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,620
Would she have any sanity right now?

537
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,370
Wow, did she tattletale about all of that?

538
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,620
And what else? What else did I do?

539
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,060
Hey, did she even tell you how she cursed me out?

540
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,490
That's why

541
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,170
you should treat her better.

542
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,400
She's the only friend you have.

543
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,930
Why is she my only friend? I have two including you.

544
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,260
Yes, you have two for now.

545
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,240
What's with you?

546
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,880
Soo Ho, did you do something wrong?

547
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,780
Me? No.

548
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,650
I'm innocent in every way.

549
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,970
But she showed up here unconscious, which she's never done before.

550
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,990
She started drinking a lot since early in the evening.

551
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,040
It must be one of those days.

00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,530
You haven't heard anything?

555
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,980
She was drinking happily after crashing her car.

556
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,550
She said she doesn't want to see her kid or her husband.

557
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,280
She didn't want to go home and wouldn't let me go saying "let's have one more glass."

558
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,790
What on earth is the matter?

559
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,240
There must be a woman.

560
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,760
Soo Ho wouldn't do that.

561
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,540
Ha Yeong Eun, you don't know men at all. Hey, men are...

<i>and a heart!</i>

Anyway, you didn't watch "The World of the Married"?

565
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,280
He cheated on his wife, but in front of her,

566
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,210
he said, "Loving isn't a sin!"

567
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,680
That's how men are.

568
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,430
Yeong Eun, you have alcohol, right?

569
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,730

575

But I don't know how to do these types of things.

576
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,740
I would ask my daughter, but I'd have to tell her how much money I lost.

00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,290
What if I told you? What would that change?

626
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,170
Well, nothing would change since I like him.

627
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,900
