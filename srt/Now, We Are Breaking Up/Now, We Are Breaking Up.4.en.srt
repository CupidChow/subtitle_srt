Although they fought head-to-head with originality as the main weapon after copies surfaced,

38
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,770
the results are tragic.

39
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,310
It seems like they even got a top photographer, Mr. J,

40
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,910
to try to make it up with a high-class image,

41
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,040
but it did not influence the sales at all.

42
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,630
Although Sonó is still at the top, it has started to fall from its peak.

43
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,550
It's been stationary for two years.

How is the store reorganization plan going?

45
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,490
Here's the store reorganization plan.

46
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,470
Some stores will be moved based on the revenue.

<i>[Sonó]</i>

48
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,090
Let's move the domestic brands including Sonó

49
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,570
to the B zone on the third floor.

50
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,880
Domestic brands no longer have competitive value.

51
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,360
Chief Jeong, please re-do the reorganization of the stores

52
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,610
focusing on the stores launching with foreign brands.

53
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,440
That'll be all.

54
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,810
Responsibility?

55
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,100
Is this something that can be settled with a single page of written apology?

56
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,900
We were on the second floor's A zone for eight years. Now we're on the third floor.

57
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,090
And it's looking like we'll be pushed to the corner.

58
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,700
Don't you know that a brand's power comes from its location in the department store?

59
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,910
At this rate, it will only take a second for our reputation to turn sour.

60
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,370
And like that, our brand could be shut down!

61
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,480
Because you didn't want to lose.

62
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,310
Take a good look at how much damage your stubbornness and misplaced bravado have caused.

63
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,580
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,240
This is not something that can be solved with an apology!

65
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,400
Anything going on with you these days?

67
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,590
Me? Well, I'd like to find quickly a sense of security in life

68
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,210
with a life-long partner of mine.

69
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,740
It's not the first time we've had copies show up.

70
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,990
Why are you wilted over such a matter? It's unlike you.

71
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,590
Yes.

72
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,060
You should observe your own daughter that carefully.

73
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,580
There's nothing more foolish than holding onto what's already passed.

74
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,320
Dust yourself off,

75
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,000
and take your role in Clair Marie after getting a license with them.

76
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,330
It's not a sudden decision that was made.

77
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,430
Domestic brands have been overtaken by foreign brands at the department stores,

78
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,940
and this is not a recent happening.

79
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,950
We have to go with the times.

80
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,470
Then what about Sonó?

81
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,590
Why aren't you answering me?

82
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,480
Yes, I understand.

83
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,430
What about Sonó? What will you do with Sonó, Dad?

84
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,400
Yeong Eun, explain it to her well.

85
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,410
What is my dad saying?

86
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,790
He's saying there is no foreign brand better than Clair Marie

87
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,470
that appeals to Sonó's customer base.

88
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,340
He's entrusted that matter to me.

89
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,510
So, if you do that, what about Sonó?

90
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,190
No way, is Sonó going to disappear?

91
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,070
I have to go to our shop at The Hills to check on our display.

92
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,980
If actress Han So Hye wears it, it will sell out.

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,770
As the drama airs,

94
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,170
we will promote the brand and price on blogs and social media.

95
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,410
Okay.

96
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,660
Episodes four and six.

97
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,790
Did you confirm with the production company?

98
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,250
The producer in charge has changed his number. Do you have it?

99
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,080
Hold on.

100
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,760

101
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,000
<i>I want to eat dumplings.</i>

102
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,690
CEO, how about we have lunch before we go back to the office?

103
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,880
You can eat with Assistant Manager Seo and go in.

104
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,100
I need to check some things still.

105
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,010
- I'll see you in the office.
- Okay.

106
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,300
I sent him three hearts for once, but this person really...

111
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,930
<i> Wait, hold on.</i>

112
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,540
Oh, Director Hwang Chi Sook, hello!

113
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,140
I am here for my monthly meeting.

114
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,360
What's with this energetic status report all of a sudden?

115
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,690
Oh, well, goodbye.

116
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,830
Why are you saying goodbye already? I've just started.

117
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,350
What's the matter with you?

118
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,490
We're at work!

119
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,690
What are you doing?

120
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,010
I was going to contact you anyway.

121
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,750
I thought asking for understanding would be the right thing to do.

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,820
Although it's kind of late for that,

123
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,730
I completely understand.

124
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,720
It's good manners for a virtuous man

125
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,650
to not speak of what happened when we were drunk.

126
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,640
Were you drinking already?

127
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,070
What?

128
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,060
I'd like to see Yoon Jae Gook.

129
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,880
I thought apologizing to him personally for canceling the interview would be the right thing to do.

130
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,770
Is that all?

131
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,520
Does there need to be another reason?

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,430
Do you go to a dermatologist frequently?

133
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,130
It's one of my favorite places. Why?

134
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,770
I was wondering if you ate some numbing cream, too.

135
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,180
Are you playing twenty questions?

136
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,670
If you don't remember, then never mind. Sure.

137
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,440
Never mind. I'll let him know.

138
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,250
I'm fine.

139
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm really fine. Really.

140
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,140
Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun is doing well, right?

141
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,430
You're staying longer than I expected.

142
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,660
Yes. It turned out that way.

143
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,850
- Why did you come find me?
- To ask for some work.

144
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,810
I think I'm going to be staying here longer this time.

145
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,230
Because of a woman?

146
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,010
Yes.

147
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,200
Who?

148
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,320
Check with the manager which pieces to remove from the display.

149
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Also, we'll need to hang everything over again.

150
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,090
Take lots of photos of the store meticulously beforehand.

151
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,720
Okay.

152
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,660
Na Ri, make sure you check with the manager which pieces to remove from the display.

153
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,070
You just said that.

154
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,430
- Are you okay?
- Yes, of course.

155
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,490
The team leader is acting strange, right?

156
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,870
The store is getting moved to the third floor,

157
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,670
and the superiors are putting her in charge of licensing.

158
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,790
Of course her mind's all over the place.

159
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,260
It would be stranger for her not to be strange.

160
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,130
Director Hwang said Team Leader Ha is doing well.

161
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,070
Hey, cholesterol is an enemy to the middle-aged.

162
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,330
But, our Cookie, why are you asking about Team Leader Ha's well-being?

163
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,480
What's the reason?

164
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,890
Yeah, Team Leader Ha is a good person.

165
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,010
I've never heard of her dating anyone,

166
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,190
and it has been seven or eight years since I've worked with her.

167
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,360
How has our Cookie become so interested in such a hard-to-get woman?

168
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,640
Hey. How about we eat separately from now on?

169
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,630
The smell from that instant ramen... I really want to eat it.

170
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,990
- About Sonó...
- What about Sonó?

171
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,190
Are they going through a really hard time because of what happened with the copy?

172
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,870
I'm sure it must be hard. It was definitely a blow.

173
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,530
Oh, our Cookie is even worrying about her company now, huh?

174
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,720
Why? Aren't you eating it?

175
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:44,170
Hey. If a love cynic like you falls for someone, you know you'll suffer severely, right?

176
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,980
Yes.

177
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,920
But you can't do anything about your feelings?

178
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,990
No.

179
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,060
Your fast answers leave me with no doubt.

180
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,650
I'm going to eat this.

181
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,720
Food waste is a significant social issue.

182
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,120
Yes, Mother?

183
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,930
Ah, yes, Jae Gook is right next to me actually.

184
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,170
Of course. Yes, hold on a second.

185
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,150
Gosh, seriously?
<i>[Jae Gook's mother]</i>

186
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,720
Yes?

187
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,500
If you have time, stop by the house in the evening.

188
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,590
I have something to tell you.

189
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,530
Is it her son?

190
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,030
Hey, you should be good to your mother.

191
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,760
She even set up an arranged date for you.

192
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,210
That kind of effort? I think it's love.

193
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,920
When are you moving back home?

194
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,640
It'll be the first time you'll be alone with your mom, right?

195
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,660
I like you.

196
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,130
If you're trying to say you're going to live with me, take it back.

197
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,790
The heart does not move by will.

198
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,500
Take care of me.

199
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,820
Hey! A single cup of ramen is not good enough for what you're asking.

200
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,760
Hey, Cookie!

201
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,150
<i>Yoon Soo Wan.</i>

202
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,930
<i>Does he really not mean anything to you?</i>

203
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,560
Please be careful of its weight.

204
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,160
- Is Team Leader Ha sick?
- Pardon?

205
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,300
She has a lot going on lately.

206
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,420
Can you give me the pin?

207
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,560
<i>[Mi Sook]</i>

208
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,870
Enjoy it! Unni, the dumplings just came out. Have some.

209
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,790
Which will you have?

210
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,810
I know it's been crazy for you after the copy surfaced,

211
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,680
but you've been quite neglectful.

212
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,800
How come you haven't called once?

213
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,260
I've had a lot of work.

214
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,310
Why'd you call me here suddenly?

215
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,850
I really wanted to eat this all of a sudden.

216
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,350
I was going to ask my husband,

217
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,670
but he doesn't even reply to my texts nowadays.

218
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,680
- Please enjoy.
- It's here! Let's eat, let's eat.

219
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,030
Yes, this is it!

220
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,090
It has been 10 years, yet the flavor hasn't changed one bit.

221
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,510
The reason why I wanted to eat this suddenly...

222
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,900
Never mind. I'll tell you once I know for sure.

223
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,340
Just wait. You're going to know later today.

224
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,590
What is it?

225
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,020
Is it too hot?

226
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,540
What's wrong?

227
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,810
Did something happen?

228
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,440
Mi Sook.

229
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm actually able to eat this.

230
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,280
I'm able to eat dumplings.

231
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,320
What is it? What happened?

232
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,560
H-He died.

233
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,990
Who?

234
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,600
Soo Wan.

235
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,420
That day, while he was on his way to me...

236
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,480
he died.

237
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,990
That terrible man.

238
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,090
Why'd he die? How dare he die?

239
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,250
I can order mine separately.

240
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,090
I can't even eat much because my teeth get cold.

241
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,270
We've studied together for two months now.

242
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,690
I feel like we haven't talked much.

243
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,420
Oh, but, how old are you?

244
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,410
- What?
- I'm 67.

245
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,630
I'm a year younger than you.

246
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,860
Oh, at our age, being within 10 years apart makes us friends.

247
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,050
You can speak informally to me.

248
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,250
Here you go.

249
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,680
Two years ago, my daughter spent a lot of money on me, and I had a dental implant.

250
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,370
Thanks to her, I'm able to eat things like this.

251
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,220
I see.

252
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,550
Honestly, my husband and I haven't done much for her.

253
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:40,260
My husband has always been in education, so he's not very worldly,

254
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,080
and if he hears how others are suffering, he can't just ignore it.

255
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,470
When she went abroad, we couldn't even send her allowances for her living expenses once.

256
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,480
But they say talent does not go unnoticed.

257
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,480
A huge company paid for her tuition,

258
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,570
so she finished her degree,

259
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,990
and now she's a team leader at that company.

260
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,490
What a remarkable daughter you have.

261
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,390
Please eat.

262
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,430
There's no use in spending money on coffee when I can't even appreciate it.

263
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,760
It's been frustrating trying to talk to younger people whose lingo I don't understand.

264
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,880
It's nice to have a friend.

265
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,100
<i>Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun is doing well, right?</i>

266
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,920
Why did he? Why?

267
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,060
What is it?

268
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,910
<i>Ingo Maurer. Bang and Olufsen.</i>

269
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,070
<i>Your taste is very similar to mine.</i>

270
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,370
That's what it is.

271
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,860
<i>Be careful not to get wet.</i>

272
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,280
Why is she appearing again?

273
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,590
For not working on anything special together,

274
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,760
it feels like meeting twice a day is way too often.

275
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,390
- You're already leaving?
- Yes, I'm done with my work so I'm planning to.

276
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,630
Before my roommate comes home, I need to prepare dinner.

277
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,820
You have a roommate?

278
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,310
Oh, there's a guy named Mr. J

279
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,330
who forced himself into my home without caring about how I feel.

280
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,510
You live together with J?

281
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,820
By the way, there have been rumors that Sonó is getting pushed back at The Hills.

282
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,520
There must've been a big blow because of the other colors.

283
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,350
Is that not so?

284
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,630
CEO Seok, I think I understand how you feel.

285
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,560
Should we go to a quiet place for a moment?

286
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,880
What is it that I feel, and where is this quiet place?

287
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,690
It's just as it means, a quiet place.

288
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,460
For example, your house?

289
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,290
After my oldest goes to school, I was planning on having another child.

290
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,640
It's a planned pregnancy.

291
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,020
But since it's a geriatric pregnancy, there will be a lot of exams, right?

292
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,380
- Please have a seat.
- Yes.

293
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,540
Do we really have to do an amniocentesis?

294
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,230
My insurance covers it, right?

295
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,830
Do you have any other symptoms?

296
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,670
Oh, just some indigestion and some morning sickness.

297
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,230
It's pretty similar to when I had my oldest.

298
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:27,220
When you get pregnant, hCG levels are high in a blood test.

299
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,730
But, right now, it's normal.

300
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,430
It doesn't seem like your uterus is preparing for a baby, either.

301
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,330
Oh, then is it because it's too early?

302
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,010
You're not pregnant.

303
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,970
<i>(Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a protein produced in the placenta that is used to determine pregnancy.)</i>

304
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,260
<i> I heard you're going to be in charge of the Clair Marie licensing.</i>

305
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,160
<i>Are you really going to take it?</i>

306
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,240
<i>It's on the Blind that you're taking it over.
(Blind is a site where you can post about jobs/companies anonymously.)</i>

307
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
<i>What happens to us, then? Will we disappear?</i>

308
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,710
<i>Jeong So Yeong, it takes minutes to even restart a computer.</i>

309
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,660
<i>Sonó has been The One's main brand for 10 years. How can it disappear so easily?</i>

310
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,510
<i>Lee Seom also killed off their founding brand within a night once they realized it lacked good sales.</i>

311
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,700
<i>There's nothing that says it couldn't happen to Sonó too.</i>

312
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,130
<i>Either way, sales are most important for the company.</i>

313
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,510
<i>On top of everything, my decision was a blow to sales last time.</i>

314
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,870
<i>Does it make sense to get rid of Sonó just because of that?</i>

315
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,770
<i>It's true that sales have been declining for two years.</i>

316
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,930
<i>Even so, we're still at the top.</i>

317
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,090
<i>There's no such thing as being at the top forever.</i>

318
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,000
<i>Team Leader.</i>

319
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,750
<i>The final decision will be made by the company.</i>

320
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,470
<i>It's true that it's been hard for domestic brands lately.</i>

321
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,830
<i>We're designers, but we're also employees of this company.</i>

322
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,560
<i>So we need to follow the company's decisions.</i>

323
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,480
<i>And after all that, if they say they don't need any of us,</i>

324
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,990
<i>we have to take our severance pay and leave quietly?</i>

325
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,400
<i>You all can go home. I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

326
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,600
<i>What about you, Team Leader?</i>

327
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,390
<i>Are you okay?</i>

328
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:16,770
<i>Even if Sonó disappears, will you really be okay?</i>

329
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:49,890
<i>Why did I hold onto all of these for so long?</i>

330
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,700
<i>Why couldn't I throw it away?</i>

331
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,920
<i>Why did I let it all pile up?</i>

332
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,530
It's not just you. Me, too.

333
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,960
Hey, it's like that for everyone.

334
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,150
Don't be sorry.

335
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,590
Ha Yeong Eun, if not me, who else would you cry to?

336
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,430
Yeah, with my husband...

337
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,240
I guess he felt bad about not getting me lunch.

338
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,860
We ate out for once.

339
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,230
So I'm eating dinner right now.

340
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,310
Yeah, girl, I'm happy.

341
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,890
Happiness isn't so far-fetched.

342
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:47,440
The three of us spending time together once in a while doing something nice...

343
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,100
That's what happiness is.

344
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,900
<i> It's not morning sickness.</i>

345
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,980
<i>It might be sickness related to something else.</i>

346
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,760
<i> What does that mean?</i>

347
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,390
<i> I saw something in the ultrasound.</i>

348
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,480
<i> It's not in the uterus. But the size is pretty big.</i>

349
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,440
<i> I think you need to get a complete check-up at a bigger hospital.</i>

350
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,910
Hey, I have to hang up now and flip the meat.

351
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,730
I'll call you later.

352
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,730
Alright.

353
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,430
Are you here for a job interview?

354
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,770
You can relax. It's your house.

355
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,030
I'm not very familiar with this kind of situation.

356
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,430
No need to be awkward. We'll see each other more often from now on.

357
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,670
Why would that be?

358
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,650
In the future, we...

359
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,190
In the future, what?

360
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,070
Will have a very special relationship.

361
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,110
Why would that be?

362
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,520
Just keep it to yourself.

363
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,940
J...

364
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,460
and I are going to get married.

365
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,820
- So we should help each other.
- Oh, okay.

366
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,240
I saw your heart, that's why.

367
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,480
My... my heart?

368
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,170
Since when did you start having feelings for Yeong Eun?

369
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,670
- What?
- I'll help you.

370
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,820
But I need something in return.

371
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,500
I would appreciate a positive and active cooperation and collaboration.

372
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,420
Don't people usually offer guests something to drink or eat?

373
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,870
What? Oh, right.

374
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,760
Can I look around your house?

375
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,040
So Director Hwang was his blind date in Busan?

376
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,850
But Cookie is totally into Team Leader Ha, and the blind date lady...

377
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,010
doesn't like me but Jae Gook?

378
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,120
Color and composition...

379
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,430
They're all fabulous.

380
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,990
Why is she here?

381
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,430
What are you doing?

382
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,320
Director Hwang?

383
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,670
I... didn't see anything.

384
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,830
What?

385
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,670
I never came in this room and

386
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,920
I never came here today.

387
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,900
Then for whom did I make this coffee?

388
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,090
It was hard to get used to the current situation,

389
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,070
and this version isn't all that great either.

390
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,270
What on earth did she look at?

391
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:34,100
Oh, does our Cookie have something weird?

392
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,040
Is that what it is?

393
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,000
She saw. She did. She saw it.

394
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,910
She got hurt. She did. She got hurt by it.

395
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,560
<i>[Director Hwang Chi Sook]</i>

396
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,920
But what would I say if I call her?

397
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,700
I'm worried.

398
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,850
Why am I worried?

399
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,280
Gosh, I'm worried.

400
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,910
Hey, Ha Yeong Eun!

401
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,170
You should ring the bell.

402
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,340
You have something you didn't tell me, right?

403
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,510
- What are you talking about?
- In Busan, you...

404
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,130
What is all this?

405
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,290
I'm in the middle of putting the past behind.

406
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,930
Are you really switching to Clair Marie?

407
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,120
That's what I was told to do.

408
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,600
Your survival skills are really amazing.

409
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,790
Do you want some coffee? Hot or iced?

410
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,810
It's a brand you created. How can you just abandon it like it's nothing?

411
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,820
You were basking in Sonó's glory not too long ago.

412
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,360
Now you're leaving it because it's failing?

413
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,020
Now that you've got a licensed brand, you figured it would last you another several years?

414
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,340
You're okay with that?

415
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,640
Can you be okay with that?

416
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,290
No, I'm not okay. How can I be okay?

417
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,050
For the past ten years, I ran around every day while my feet got blistered.

418
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,350
Like someone put me in a spin-dryer, I squeezed out all of my energy until I was drained.

419
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,750
With my determination and tenacity, I put in my best efforts.

420
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,450
I poured my all into it, so how can I be okay?

421
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,740
Does it look like I'm okay to you right now?!

422
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,980
Determination and tenacity? Just those?

423
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,750
What?

424
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,320
Be honest. You liked it too!

425
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,270
You had fun.

426
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,310
I've known you for 20 years since high school! I know you!

427
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:37,150
You don't do anything you don't want to do!

428
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,750
I'm saying stop showing off.

429
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,730
If it weren't for Sonó, you wouldn't be where you are now.

430
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,350
Understand?

431
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,040
Why am I all worked up again?

432
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,380
I came here to demand information about her relationship with our Cookie.

433
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,420
I got taken in by her issues instead.

434
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,380

Yes.

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,910
<i>[Ha Yeong Eun]</i>

478
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,040
Yes, Ha Yeong Eun?

479
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:35,610
Where is Soo Wan right now?

480
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,170
<i>[Late Yoon Soo Wan]
[Son of Yoon Jin Woo and Min Hye Ok]</i>

481
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,090
<i>I think I have to break up.</i>

482
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,000
<i>- What?
- She has a lot of dreams and talent.</i>

483
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,200
<i>She wants to do a lot of things here.</i>

484
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,330
<i>And I'm sure many places want her.</i>

485
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,130
<i>But I have to go back to Korea.</i>

486
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,990
<i>Then let her choose.</i>

487
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,370
<i>If she'll come to Korea with you or not.</i>

488
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,760
<i>Why are you agonizing about that?</i>

489
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,150
<i>Mother wouldn't approve anyway.</i>

490
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,460
<i>Rather than having her go through that,</i>

491
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,890
<i>I think it's right to let her go.</i>

492
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,270
<i>You said you love her.</i>

493
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,540
<i>Because of the pain Mom went through,</i>

494
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,880
<i>we both had a hard time.</i>

495
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,010
<i>That's our parents' problem. I don't care.</i>

496
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,070
<i>My position is a little different, Jae Gook.</i>

497
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,300
<i>If she loves you, she'll stay.
(in French)</i>

498
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,490
<i>If she doesn't, she'll leave.
(in French)</i>

499
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:04,880
<i>That's destiny. You can't really do anything about it.
(in French)</i>

500
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,090
<i>Let her choose</i>

501
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,990
<i>if you'll break up or not.</i>

502
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,690
<i>You said you love her.</i>

503
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,580
<i>You said you love her.</i>

504
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,250
<i>[Yoon Soo Wan rests here forever]</i>

505
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,780
Why did you tell me about Soo Wan?

506
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,880
Because you don't seem like just a person whom I'll pass by in my life.

507
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,960
It's love that ended in two months.

508
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,790
Others might wonder what was so great about it,

509
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,700
but time doesn't dictate the depth of love.

510
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,200
For me at that time, those two months of time

511
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,730
were significant enough to change my life.

512
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,460
And it's time that's already passed.

513
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,040
Let's not do anything from now on.

514
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,620
I can't ignore that Soo Wan is your brother.

515
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,370
Because your past is my brother...

516
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,080
Is that the only reason why I can't be?

517
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,970
I'm not confident about my choices.

518
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:01,520
The one time that I chose with my heart and not my head

519
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,600
was Soo Wan.

520
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,770
And everything got messed up.

521
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,130
I'm not my brother.

522
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,390
And even if you make the same choices, the results might be different.

523
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,740
Maybe

524
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,480
if I were still 20,

525
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,750
then it might have been.

526
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,980
But I'm already 38,

527
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,760
and there is no need for me to repeat misery.

528
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,190
Experience is the coldest advice.

529
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,460
Today, I came here with Yoon Soo Wan's younger brother,

530
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,650
not with Yoon Jae Gook.

531
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,600
Thank you.

532
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,730
I'll go back by myself.

533
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,450
<i>[The One]</i>

534
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,330
<i>[The One]</i>

535
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,690
You called to see me?

536
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,730
Good morning, Noona. It's been a while.

537
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,640
When did you get here?

538
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,410
It's been two weeks since I got back.

539
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,910
I successfully finished quarantining and got released yesterday.

540
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,490
I told him to come back.

541
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,960
Oh, okay.

542
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,350
But the executive designer is still Director Hwang Chi Sook.

543
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:23,420
How about we come out now? People who should know already know by now.

544
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,120
Overall, her ideas have been actively reflected.

545
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,770
Where? Where is it?

546
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,120
I don't see any.

547
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,190
Noona, why would you lie so professionally?

548
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,250
If you're coming to work, correct how you call her.

549
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,980
I still want freedom, but Dad approved of my condition

550
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,900
that I work with you, Noona.

551
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,110
Let's be together for good.

552
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,780
I let that reckless guy loose for too long.

553
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,510
I'm thinking about putting him in Clair Marie.

554
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,540
Take him on and make sure you teach him well.

555
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,010
Is it an official job?

556
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,980
It is an official job.

557
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,520
<i>[The One]</i>

558
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,710
<i>Breaking news. All Hwang siblings made it in.</i>

559
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:14,620
<i>He will be working under Team Leader Ha in the Clair Marie licensing team.</i>

560
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,650
It's hard enough for her to take care of Director Hwang's matters,

561
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,910
but now her brother's, too.

562
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,050
It's like you've raised your first child and finally sent her off to school, then you get a second child.

563
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,950
But then what happens to us?

564
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,450
Say hello. This is Hwang Chi Hyeong.

565
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,120
This is Manager Nam Na Ri, Assistant Manager Ahn Seon Joo,

566
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,920
and Maknae* Jeong So Yeong of the design team.
<i>(Maknae means the youngest of the group)</i>

567
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,960
Nice to meet you all.

568
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:48,100
So... are we Sonó or Clair Marie licensing?

569
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,000
I'd like to know what we're doing, Team Leader.

570
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,460
<i>You'll go till the end with Sonó?</i>

571
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,740
<i>It's a brand that I made with my own hands.</i>

572
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,710
<i>I don't think it's right to put it in the storage </i>

573
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,990
<i>because it has done its worth, then let someone else clean it up.</i>

574
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,970
<i>If I have to take Chi Hyeong,</i>

575
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,870
<i>I think he will have come to Sonó, not Clair Marie.</i>

576
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,150
<i>Would it be alright?</i>

577
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,160
It wasn't just my determination and tenacity.

578
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,970
Sonó was my dream, my future, and my youth.

579
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,520
We make clothes every season

580
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,060
and our names are not on any of them,

581
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,190
but they still mean something.

582
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,870
So I should finish it up.

583
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,690
Team Leader.

584
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,340
Each one of you will have full say over your decision.

585
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,750
So it's okay if you go to the license team.

586
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,570
Sonó will only last two seasons at most anyway,

587
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,790
and buying a license to place foreign brand labels

588
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:56,500
on our clothes to increase sales is reality.

589
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,990
It's fine. I'm staying, too.

590
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,920
In college, I used to work part-time for months to buy one item of clothing from Sonó.

591
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,990
And I got this job with the dream to make clothes like that.

592
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,890
We'll be getting the least amount of marketing funds.

593
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,510
And we'll be de-prioritized at the factory.

594
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,590
They'll tell us to reduce the material fees.

595
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,310
And we won't even be able to dream about Italian fabric.

596
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:21,070
With all that, the number of stores will decrease,

597
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,860
and we'll end up at outlets later on.

598
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,120
But instead, we can do anything, right?

599
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,690
There are so many things I couldn't try.

600
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,490
It's a brand they're getting rid of anyway.

601
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,530
We won't have to worry about sales anymore.

602
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,320
We won't have to worry about what the higher-ups will say.

603
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:38,890
Can I make whatever I want for the remaining seasons?

604
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,440
I'll stay too.

605
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,360
Except let me have a chance at designing a matching set.

606
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,280
Instead of switching jobs in between skill levels,

607
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,780
I want to gain more experience here before I leave.

608
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,810
Hey, Maknae over there.

609
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,860
Sorry? Are you calling me?

610
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,490
I'll be your mentor from now on.

611
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,110
Is that okay, Team Leader?

612
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,550
How much do you know about fabric?

613
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,590
Oh, fabric?

614
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,430
I don't really know anything about fabric,

615
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,580
but I do know popular shops.

616
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,480
I'm going out for a meeting regarding material parts.

617
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,210
Alright.

618
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:36,870
<i>But, Mi Sook...</i>

619
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,170
<i> You know what?</i>

620
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,590
<i> To be honest, when I found out,</i>

621
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,650
<i> I asked myself,</i>

622
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,870
<i> "What should I do?"</i>

623
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,030
<i> That person was saying</i>

624
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,780
<i> Soo Wan was his older brother.</i>

625
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,730
<i>But I was asking myself,</i>

626
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,880
<i> "What should I do with him?"</i>

627
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,520
<i>What should I do?</i>

628
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,880
What else can I do? It turned out for the better.

629
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,150
This is good enough.

630
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,670
You did well, Ha Yeong Eun.

631
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,890
What we'll do in the future...

632
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,680
Whether or not we'll continue to meet ...

633
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,260
Yes,

634
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,760
