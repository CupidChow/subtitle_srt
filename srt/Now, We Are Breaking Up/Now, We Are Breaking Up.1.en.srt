There's a Dior, Chanel, and Givenchy show in Korea. Is this for real?

- It's nice to see you!

36
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,810
But I didn't know that even Olivier is having a show here.

37
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,940
My point exactly. He is snobby and used to say, "If you want to see my show, come to Paris."

38
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,880
Now, now. K-pop, K-beauty, K-drama.

Fashion is no exception.

41
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,450
Also, money is necessary if he wants to keep being a snob.

42
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,760
Which means he can no longer ignore the Asian Market.

43
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,910
Anyway, it's so nice to not have to take long distance flights.

44
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,200
Ah, in order to land deals with popular celebrities,

45
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,990
we must land a sponsorship with Olivier in any way possible.

46
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,600
- Fighting, Sunbae.
- Okay.

47
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,230
Work hard.

48
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,910
- We're leaving then.
- Okay, take it easy.

49
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,730
Is there any new information? Like what he needs or stuff like that?

Thankfully we have something called a translator.

56
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,510
They sent out love calls but were turned down each time.

- Mr. J?
- You know, the photographer.

58
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,610
The one with a lot of nicknames. Even Hermès, Dior, and Chanel are lining up to work with him.

59
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,030
Oh, the Japanese guy whose real name Juniwara?

60

Team Leader, Olivier hasn't come down yet.

- How many teams are in front of us?
- Two teams.

91
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,570
Viace is in front of us.

92
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,980
You must be hungry. Go eat first. I'll be here.

93
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,340
I ate a lot at brunch. Team Leader, you go eat.

94
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,400
I can eat after the interview.

95
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,520
You haven't eaten anything since morning.

96
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,980
I'll call you as soon as Viace's interview starts. Be on your way.

97
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,420
As long as Olivier has decided to break into the Asian market,

98
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,100
he will definitely need us since Sonó is a recognized domestic brand.

99
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm going to focus on that appeal.

100

<i>Don't say much. Just bring the results.</i>

You know that I used to sell fabric in Dongdaemun. What would I know?

102
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,690
I'll keep you updated.

105
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,340
She has a lot of materials to look over for the meeting right after.

106
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,000
My secretary made a reservation at a restaurant for tonight at 7:00.

110
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,100
It's a meeting organized carefully by two families, so tell her to act properly and not embarrass me.

111

114
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,250
I'll be there within 15 minutes.

115
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,460
I'm sorry. I'll come another time.

116
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Oh, nice to see you!

117
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,860
This rude bastard always makes me call first and come look for him.

118
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,480
<i>[Please do not disturb. Thank you.]</i>

119
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,680
How dare he?

120
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,500
I generously let him stay in my room ahead of my arrival,

121
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,690
and he dares to use the sheets with some other wench?!

122
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,040
And he brazenly uploaded photos to his social media!

123
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,280
Who are you?

124
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,260
Can you tell Jimmy to come out?

125
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,120
- Oppa, come out here!
- I'll be right out. Stop nagging me!

126
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,310
- Hurry up!
- How are you never satisfied?!

127
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,830
My legs are still shaking...

128
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,560
Team Leader.

129
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,670
Jimmy, as The One's casual menswear model,

130
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,500
you've breached the contract pertaining to maintaining dignity in your private life.

131
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,810
I'm sorry, it was a mistake. I mean it, please trust me!

132
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,870
You're aware that the penalty fee is three times what you got paid, aren't you?

133
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,030
Really, nothing happened. Also, I don't know that woman.

134
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,650
Hey, do you know me? You don't, so why are you here?

135
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,790
How about we head out?

136
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,370
Mind your own business. Who are you to tell me what to do?

137
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,500
Not the girlfriend, but Jimmy.

138
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,980
Can't we make her leave instead?

139
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,710
Bastard!

140
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,630
Noona!

141
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,560
Let's not draw blood if we don't have to.

142
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,080
Don't make this worse than it is and keep it quiet.

143
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,790
I can kill him and bury him though, right?

144
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,540
It'll be quiet since no one will find out.

145
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,290
Do you want to stay here or follow me out?

146
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,010
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

147

149
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,490
Hold on, wait for me!

150
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,910
It's a misunderstanding, Noona.

151
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,810
Nothing happened.

152
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,740
I met her by chance at a club last night,

153
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,270
but it just happened that she had nowhere to spend the night.

154
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,460
Should I have just left her out on the street when the night gets freezing by the ocean?

155
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,550
Seriously, that's not right!

156
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,630
We just slept next to each other, that's all.

157
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,500
One-night stand? No, just one night!

158
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,380
It's true. Please trust me.

159
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,150
Noona. Noona!

160
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,820
Noona, please believe me this once!

161
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,150
I did reserve the one with an ocean view.

162
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,450
I did, but a hoobae <i>(junior)</i> I know couldn't get a room.

163
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,960
He didn't realize it would be so hard to book a room since he's so new to this business.

164
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,660
- So?
- So as a sunbae <i>(senior)</i>,

165
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,120
I willingly gave him my room.

166
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,240
Why did you do that? The night gets freezing by the ocean!

167
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,590
We have your room though.

168
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,290
- I won't see you out.
- Hey!

169
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,210
I hear everyone who is fashionable from overseas are all here.

170
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,540
I'm the CEO of Vision PR, the backbone of Korea's fashion promotion agency.

171
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,070
You're the only one who doesn't acknowledge it, but I'm a bit of a celeb.

172
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,470
What does that have to do with my room?

173
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,880
This K fashion week is the first of its kind in Asia taking place in Busan.

174
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,740
I need to stay at the center of it all in order to see what clothes, bags, and shoes people are wearing

175
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,110
to identify the latest trends.

176
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,180
I saw there's only one trend when it comes to hotels.

177
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,250
Love and war.

178
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,950
What?

179
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,870
What?

180
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,920
Do you have something more to say to me?

181
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,640
Delete the picture of Jimmy you uploaded to your social media.

182
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,830
Along with all the photos of him on your phone.

183
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,620
Ridiculous...

184
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,790
It's my phone and my memories.

185
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,260
Th-then I'll sue you.

186
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,950
It's not like he's a married man.

187
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,690
Who cares about the law when our hearts and eyes clicked?

188
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,850
Go ahead and sue me!

189
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,550
<i>A model being seen on social media because of women trouble is damaging to the company's image, too.</i>

190
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,380
<i>We have the rights to his privacy and portrait,</i>

191
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,240
<i>so we can hold you responsible for publicizing his private life.</i>

192
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,470
What do you want to do?

193
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,000
Wow, this is so annoying.

194
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,620
Happy now?

195
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,830
It's an addendum to the contract.

196
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,770
If you repeat what happened today, you'll pay three times your penalty fee

197
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,810
and any damages made to The One's image.

198
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,400
If you agree, we'll just close out today's incident as a misunderstanding.

199
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,380
Thank you.

200
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,920
Love is too commonplace and taken too lightly!

201
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,650
There is no sincerity in it and I'm appalled by that fact.

202
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,000
There's no reason for you to get upset when you're not the one going through it.

203
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,440
Still, at least that man is making an effort going back and forth between two women.

204
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,240
What are you doing? Are you not going to get married?

205
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,010
Before you know it, you'll have turned 40.

206
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,710
You're not in a place to worry when you're already 40.

207
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,170
I'm just waiting for fate to strike like lightning.

208
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,330
And I don't believe in marriage.

209
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,790
Does it make you look cool saying that?

210
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,770
Just be honest and say you don't want any responsibilities.

211
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,260
That's right. I don't want any responsibility.

212
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,440
Wow. You're overly honest.

213
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,330
How can you be responsible for someone else?

214
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,930
I just want to keep living this life of freedom and independence.

215
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,610
So basically you want to keep flirting and having fun with women.

216
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,610
If I keep my safe distance, I won't get my hopes up or get disappointed.

217
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,670
So that's why you're traveling from country to country choosing to only work on whatever you want?

218
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,310
Mr. Cookie?

219
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,380
You think you're some flying global dandelion or something?

220
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,480
I'm just being faithful to this moment and the present.

221
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,540
Whether it's work or dating.

222
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
So meet someone who's passionate and cherish any fate that comes your way.

223
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,140
In that sense, let's share the room.

224
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,320
Where's your room?

225
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,250
Hold on! Hyung!
<i>(*Hyung is a way to address a close male friend who is older)</i>

226
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,700
It was just a simple one-night stand.

227
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,610
Because of alcohol. You know how that can happen with physical attraction.

228
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,380
There's no need to be backward and keep thinking about it.

229
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,000
What about Jimmy?

230
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,110
I made sure he understands.

231
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,750
It won't get out, so you don't need to worry about your father.

232
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,390
I see.

233
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,140
Oh, get yourself a new bag. You've had yours for too long.

234
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,050
CEO Hwang's dinner reservation is at 7:00.

235
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,320
I made an appointment at the salon, so don't be late.

236
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,700
Bastard...

237
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,630
Why was he in such a hurry that he didn't even make a single excuse and left like that?

238
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,580
Go where?

239
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,930
It's the hottest restaurant among couples these days.

240
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,350
Why would I want to go there with you?

241
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,240
Thanks to you, I saved money on a hotel room.

242
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,600
I'll buy you a generous meal, so come on time.

243
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,180
I couldn't sleep lately because of work. I'm dying.

244
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,590
So why are you going out?

245
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,550
There are tons of shows lined up.

246
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,670
I need to make connections in advance to get clothing sponsored.

247
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,760
The main show starts tomorrow. Get some sleep first.

248
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,410
Hey, there's nothing in this life you can put off till tomorrow.

249
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,230
I might miss out on a connection if I don't try, so I need to at least go.

250
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,320
It's at 7:00. It's an expensive place, so dress up.

251
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,520
How is it?

252
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,430
- You should add a bit more.
- Alright.

253
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,890
- You should place it more carefully.
- Okay.

254
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,050
Wow, you did so well!

255
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,480
Please get up for me.

256
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,340
Alright, today's best dish on the menu goes to Mrs. Min again!

257
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,240
Food needs to have some style, too.

258
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,480
Such an elegant garnish really helps to increase the food's quality.

259
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,230
So let's try again and wrap up nicely.

260
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,480
That lady always gets first place, so why is she still learning?

261
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,430
Is she trying to open a store?

262
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,220
Well, she looks like she's the wife of a rich family.

263
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,270
Why would a precious lady study something that requires her hands to wash dishes?

264
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,750
What a strange hobby.

265
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,800
They say her late husband was a doctor and that she volunteers a lot at nursing homes.

266
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,540
I've always found people who are good at all things a bit intimidating.

267
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,810
- Ah, Do Hoon.
<i> - Yes, Mother?</i>

268
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,240
Apparently, her unmarried son lives in France.

269
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,830
Son?

270
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,460
I told Jae Gook the location.

271
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,800
Yes, of course. Who do you take me for?

272
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,220
Yes, he'll go there for sure.

273
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,760

<i>- Ha Yeong Eun.</i>

294
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,280
That bastard Jimmy hasn't called once.

295
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,030
He even left the necktie that I bought for him in Milan.

296
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,290
He hasn't even come back to get it.

297
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,970
I told you the reservation is at 7:00.

298
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,980
Just stay where you are for now. I'm coming right now.

299
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,570
I told you to keep it cordial and send her away, but you just had to fight it out?

300
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,580
And to top that, you lost?

301
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,880
Wow, Hwang Chi Sook, there's no trace of the old you.

302
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,180
I paid for my pride in one installment too.

303
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,980
Aren't you generous?

304
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,680
I invested so much money at the salon to keep from getting old.

305
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,550
My skin might look tight, but my bones are properly old.

306
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,990
Gosh, that wench! Is it because she's young?

307
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,410
She was so strong and tough, too.

308
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:25,030
It'll take too long to get your hair done, but we should make it on time if we just fix your makeup.

309
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,780
She was so confident.

310
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,880
She said that I was just a brand name bag to Jimmy.

311
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,460
She said he pitied me for not realizing it, so he just went along with it.

312
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,530
He was the CEO's hometown senior and a great doctor while he was alive.

313
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,020
Because he's the son of someone like that, his mom is probably expecting a lot from you

314
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,350
in terms of your personality and family reputation.

315
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,650
If you're sure you can handle the consequence of not showing up, complain away.

316
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:55,010
You know, Yeong Eun, even though I got him by spending tons of money,

317
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,650
I thought he was sincere enough to cover at least the amount of interest.

318
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,260
Let's lament about your lack of judgment skills later.

319
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,920
Since you've already suffered like this,

320
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,770
how about you let go of playing with such dangerous emotions

321
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,950
and start living in a safe and healthy manner?

322
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,650
What's the big deal about men?

323
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:23,720
Hey, how do you know if I was playing with Jimmy or if I was sincere?

324
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,590
Men? That's right, I'm hungry for a man!

325
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,900
Are you not?

326
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,230
You were the one with your phone off yesterday, doing who knows what.

327
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,820
Don't act so classy.

328
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,910
Just because you keep quiet, you think you're any different?

329
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,360
I am different.

330
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,010
Although you believe in such false hope like love and men, I don't.

331
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,680
Having one experience is enough.

332
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,600
You terrible thing.

333
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,160
How come you've never once been a friend to me?

334
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,740
And you never say, "I'm sorry."

335
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,510
Yet here I am thankful that it was water and won't leave a stain.

336
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,220
That's the kind of relationship you and I have.

337
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,090
Wanting friendship would be too greedy.

338
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,220
You value my father's trust over friendship.

339
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,670
Unlike someone, I have no choice since I don't have money for investment.

340
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,650
Even though I haven't eaten anything all day because I don't have five minutes to eat some bread, I have to keep going.

341
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,900
You don't see that I'm miserable enough die, huh?

342
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,750
Still, I'm always grateful to you.

343
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,330
Since I get paid so well.

344
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,740
If you get some fresh air, you'll get a bit sober.

345
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,610
No, I can't go. No, I'm not going.

346
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,790

348

How can I go anywhere in this state?

349
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,220
He'll hear immediately, "Your daughter showed up drunk and all bruised up."

350
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,990
He'd be delighted to hear it.

351
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,010
At least we can make up an excuse for it later.

352
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,190
But, if you don't show up, that's all your fault.

353
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,160
Then you go.

354
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,690
You can go instead of me and be Hwang Chi Sook.

355
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,230
Tell the CEO yourself.

356
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,750
If he orders it, I'll do it.

357
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,570
Do that then.

358
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,690
Do it?

359
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,150
He's just going to blame you

360
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,540
- for not taking care of me well. Is that okay?
- Director Hwang!

361
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,940
So, let's just keep this between us and quietly move on, okay?

362
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,570
This morning, I was rejected by a man who only cared about my money,

363
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,830
and tonight, I have to meet a man who only cares about my father's money.

364
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,790
That's something I just can't do.

365
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,520
We're going to start setting up for the event.

I'm sorry I had to make that request of you when you're so busy.

I can't just sit back and do nothing as his mom when he keeps getting older,

383
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,670
so I made that shameless request.

Oh, I'm glad you did.

385
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,150
But, Mother, who is he meeting with?

To be honest, there are some problems going on at work right now.

392
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,710
I know it's rude of me, but I'll have to...

393
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,110
"I'll have to" what?

394
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,750
Since you went through the trouble of making a reservation

395
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,130
and it looks like there is some effort put into this,

396
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,370
I'll have dinner before we call it a night.

I didn't even swallow yet.

403
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,770
Stop going to classes. It'll be better to buy it

Is there someone?

I asked some of the women I take classes with,

411
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,020
and there seems to be someone

412
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,340
from a good household, and the mother seems nice, too.

413
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,150
He works for a foreign company,

414
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,180
so he seems to be pretty capable, too.

415
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,170
It also sounds like he's got a good personality.

416
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,910
Really?

417
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,910
Na Ri, did you check which brands asked Olivier for a collaboration?

Tell me.

419
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,180
And the hangers?

420
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,750
Once we convince Olivier, we have to go immediately into the next season,

421
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,630
so whatever looks good to you in person, order the samples right away.

422
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,160

We might have met already

434
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,930
since photographers and designers cross paths during this period.

435

Well, yes.

You must not have such a great eye for a designer.

I don't usually forget a face once I see it.

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,920
I checked the team leader's and the manager's desks,

00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,320
We have extra time and the samples are all here, so we can shoot tomorrow.

460
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,810
- Then I'll try to gather some models.
- What about the photographer?

461
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,150
All the photographers who worked with us on the shoot are involved with the shows,

462
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,510
<i>so they won't be available.</i>

463
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,130
<i>What should we do?</i>

464
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,690
<i>I'm a freelance photographer. I shoot fashion pictorials.</i>

465
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,480
Hold on a sec.

466
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,850
Who are you looking for?

467
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,610
Do you have time tomorrow?

468
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,390
- Do you want a part-time gig?
- A what?

469
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,840
You said you shoot fashion pictorials.

470
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,750
I'll give you an opportunity to experience it.

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,980
I see. So?

474
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,420
It's not public yet, but we're getting ready for a collaboration with Olivier.

475
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,050
I think it'll be a great opportunity for you.

476
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,730
I'm not sure.

477
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:18,860
I usually choose whether I want to work or not on my own.

478
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,950
It will give you pride to have worked with professionals like us.

479
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,620
That's for me to decide.

480
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,690
Having various experiences under your belt

481
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,430
will come in handy when you sign with

482
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,610

<i>That's right. You're all we've got.</i>

485
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,870
There's not much to go off of to trust him for this job.

486
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,140
His camera cover looked old.

487
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,860
It means he's used it a lot.

488
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,350
I'm sure he's not a novice.

489
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,300

490
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,980

- The colors were too similar earlier so...

What?

537
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,460
You must have recruited using Director Hwang's name.

538
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,110
After all, all of the staff hiring were signed off by the Director anyway.

539
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,960
Yes, I will do that.

540
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,190
Good.

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,260

542
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,460
Wow, his form is totally professional.

00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:13,000
Lucky you. Someone is wiping the floor

546
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,450
while someone else is enjoying coffee by the ocean.

547
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,080
Yes, I am depressed.

548
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,580
I'm afraid it might be menopause.

549
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,710
It's about time. They say that it comes earlier these days.

550
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,820
I know. I hoped to look younger than my age once I got older, but unwelcomed menopause came instead.

551
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,930
Hey... looking at your photo, you became more beautiful in a few days' time.

00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,630
Something happened, right?

553
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,560
Who is he? Is he handsome?

554
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,900
Just... for my skin that stretches if I let my guard down for a moment

555
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,420
and my body that tries to become lazy,

556
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,330
it's the motivation to maintain the right amount of tension.

557
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:55,600
"Hold on," "stay alert," and "you are still okay." Self-persuasion.

558
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,490
Sly self-comfort.

559
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,130

00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,910
In the end, you don't have a man who will scratch your back when you wake up from your sleep?

561
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,590
Because of that, I'm free.

562
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,390
I'm jealous.

563

He's better than Mr. J. Where did you find him?

567

We will start the post-processing.

568

If he finds out Mister Cookie is my brother, he will be totally surprised.

615
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:57,340
Wow... someone says she will hire me, and someone else says he will make me his brother.

You are employed? Where?

617
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,960
Do you know Hwang Chi Sook from The One?

618
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,900
Yes, I know her. She's one of our clients.

619
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,670
Ah, right! Did the blind date go well?

620
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,360
Are you joking? I held it in because it was only once.

621
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,730
If it's twice, I really won't see your face.

622
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,580
I did it because it was only a one-time thing.

623
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,620
If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to face your mother. Let's go.

We have a lot of talented artists.

634
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,710
I hope we get a chance to show off Olivier's amazing designs

635
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,840
through collaborations with our Asian stars.

Olivier already signed with Viace.

639
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,280
The pictorial was an excuse to buy time trying to evade giving a difficult answer.

640
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,760
You said we were the number one choice.

641
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,310
You said he wanted the pictorial!

642
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,330
We worked so hard on the shoot!

643
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,750
How could this happen?

644
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,260
So what were you planning to do that you took pictures of undisclosed designs?

645
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,100
- To upload them online so he'd be ruined.
- Na Ri.

646
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,040
I'm sure he'll understand once the designs are copied over the weekend

647
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,020
what it means when all efforts were made in vain.

648
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,890
I understand how you feel. I get it, but you're a designer.

649
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,480
Don't you know what copies mean to a designer?

650
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,180
A year's worth of effort becomes nothing in one moment.

651
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,110
How could you, a designer of all people, think about doing such a thing?

652
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,610
- But Team Leader.
- Delete them yourself.

653
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,640
- Team Leader.
- Do you know why a luxury brand is a luxury brand?

654
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,920
That designer's pride and self-respect about their own designs.

655
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,830
Let's not make ourselves look bad.

All I'm asking is that you at least take a look.
<i>(in French)</i>

689
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,400
Regrettably, the deal with Viace is done,
<i>(in French)</i>

690
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,680
and we've already opened the champagne and made a toast.
<i>(in French)</i>

691
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,830
From the design to production, it was all done in Korea without OEM.

My youth. The passion I poured out.

And fashion?

My dream that still remains. One that I don't want to throw away.
<i>(in French)</i>

699
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,880
No, it's money.

01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,590
<i>Senior Manager, you already sent the full invitation list to The One, right?</i>

765
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,850
<i>The fitting starts tomorrow.</i>

766
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,740
<i>I'll try to convince her again.</i>

767
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,420
<i>This is so fitting for a domestic brand.</i>

768
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,260
<i>It's 15 minutes before the event starts. Is the main celeb even coming?</i>

769
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,380
<i>Shin Yoo Jeong!</i>

770
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,900
<i>I'm Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun of The One.</i>

771
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,440
<i>You're always leading a diverse and hard-working life whenever I see you, Ha Yeong Eun.</i>

772
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,930
<i>What happened with the photographer?</i>

773
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,380
<i>Whose photo is this?</i>

774
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,160
<i>It's an unknown artist's work.</i>

775
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,450
<i>The exposure is a mess, and the composition isn't good either.</i>

776
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,040
<i>- Yoon Jae Gook.
- I decided to take on this photo shoot.</i>

777
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,290
<i>- By any chance, do you know someone named Yoon Soo Wan?
- I had forgotten.</i>

778
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:37,410
<i>Or I thought I had forgotten that name, but the name came to me again.</i>

779
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,720
