Nice to meet you. I'm Ha Yeong Eun.

I don't know what others might say,

but Jae Gook is a very precious son to me.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
He lived his entire life feeling small because of mistakes made by his elders.

14
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,280
On top of that, once the whole world finds out whom he loves,

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,740
he'll have to live out the rest of his life the same way.

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,440
So as his mother, I couldn't just sit idly by which is why I asked to meet you.

It's love.

21

I didn't give birth to him, but he's a brother to Soo Wan.

22
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,420
And I've already confirmed that

23
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,470
my feelings won't change because of that fact.

24

It was not what I expected.

But now there is a different concern about how I can convince her of my feelings.

No. It was completely my idea.

118
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,030
You must be hungry. What would you like me to make? What do you feel like eating?

119
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,630
Spicy noodles. I came because I want to eat that, Mother.

120
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,750
Okay, I understand. Wait here then.

121
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,960
These pants only go up to size 66?

122

Yes, ma'am.

123
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,800
But it comes oversized, so even sizes 66.5 can wear it.

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,940
I couldn't even zip it up.

125
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,670
Excuse me, do you have one half size bigger?

126
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,870
Oh, we don't have half sizes.

127
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,510
You're really not going to make more sizes?

128
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,160
You know it's not that simple.

130
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,800

135
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,600
It's not just me. Bigger store managers got offers too.

136
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,490
The world has become so diverse,

137
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,520
but why do clothes still only come in three sizes: small, medium or large?

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,070
I'll make a strong proposal.

139
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,280
Don't make a proposal. Give me the result.

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,730
Who cares if the sales department keeps going on about

141
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,820
how the sell-through percentage has to be over 60% to make a profit?

142
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,720
You have to let us be able to sell. Don't you think?

143
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
Okay. I understand what you're saying.

144

So she wants to strike while the iron's hot.

145

Do different sizes appear out of thin air?

156

We need to make separate patterns and run different factories.

That's all money! Money!

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,790
So customers are able to pick a size that fits them the best because there are many choices.

161
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,190
That's because so many different races live in the US.

162
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,560
At this rate, why don't you go visit each person and make them clothes to measure?!

163
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,290
I asked you to make something for Paris. What's this nonsense?

164
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,700
Stay true to your job!

165
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,390
Making clothes that suit the customers' needs

166
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,910
is also one of my jobs.

167
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,340
Hey, Team Leader Ha.

168
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,110
If we lose a competent store manager, we'll lose customers, too.

169
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,420
Please consider it earnestly, Chief.

170
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,150
We don't get along. We really don't get along!

171
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,800
Got over one hill...

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,300
Team Leader Ha! Yeong Eun!

173
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,420
Another hill to climb over is approaching me.

174
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,160
Has my father said anything?

175
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,340
Did you cause a problem? Why?

176
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,290
What is it? Who is it this time?

177
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,730
What problem?

178
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,890
Hey, CEO Seok confessed that he likes me.

179
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,460
What's with that expression? I'm offended.

180
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,640
Since when? Are you serious about him, too?

181
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,760
Hey, not me! You know he's not my type.

182
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,910
But how does CEO Hwang know about this?

183
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,880
Well... there was something...

184
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,410
Anyway, you're saying you did cause a problem.

185
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,460
With the CEO of one of our subcontractors at that.

186
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,830
Wench, you always think that you've got me figured out.

187
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,650
But there is something I can do that you don't know about.

188
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,020
Where are you going in the middle of the conversation?

189
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,450
Don't you have to report to Father?

190
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,490
I'll go get the answer for you to write down.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
<i>I know how foolish and reckless this emotion is. </i>

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,760
<i>But if I am this way regardless, it is because I am serious about Yoon Jae Gook. </i>

193
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,400
<i>But this self, this foolish and reckless self... I welcome it.</i>

194
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,910
<i>Why are you so reckless? Why are you so foolish?</i>

195
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,270
<i>Even if we go through this marriage, we can't be happy.</i>

196
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,150
<i>I thought I loved you but found out it's something else.</i>

197
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,140
<i>What we have is comfort from knowing each other for so long. Like a sibling or a friend.</i>

198
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,210
<i>Our engagement period was too long,</i>

199
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,510
<i>so you can think that.</i>

200
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,420
<i>I'll try harder.</i>

201
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,460
<i>To me, you are still a man.</i>

202
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,010
<i>And I love you.</i>

203
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:49,590
<i>With someone else in my heart, accepting you out of responsibility and duty...</i>

204
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,040
<i>- That's not right.
- It doesn't matter.</i>

205
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,430
<i>It doesn't matter to me! So stay by my side.</i>

206
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,150
<i>Don't go, Soo Wan.</i>

207
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,330
<i>[Yeong Eun]</i>

208
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,490
Soo Wan, you were the one who did me wrong.

209
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,330
She did me wrong.

210
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,010
I always watch the ending credits.

211
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,070
Sometimes, those names that go up endlessly

212
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,330
are more touching than the movie itself.

213
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,260
Because I can see

214
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,400
how many people's time and effort went into this one movie.

215
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,700
Missing the post-credit scene does feel quite terrible.

216
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,520
I like this music.

217
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,060
♫ <i>I'll give all I can to you</i> ♫

218
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,700
♫ <i>You'll always be the one I remember</i> ♫

219
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,780
♫ <i>You'll always take my breath away</i> ♫

220
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,800
♫ <i>You'll always be my heart, my life</i> ♫

221
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,590
♫ <i>Every second, every day</i> ♫

222
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,430
What should we go eat?

223
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,570
Should we get Korean? Then what?

224
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,420
- Today, I feel like—
- Are you... Jae Gook?

225
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,350
Soo Wan's little brother, Yoon Jae Gook, right?

226
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,540
- Hyung.
- Hey! How long has it been?

227
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,230
You know Soo Wan, right? He's Soo Wan's brother.

228
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,200
This is my wife.

229
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,140
Hello.

230
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,200
It's hectic at the hospital,

231
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,980
but this kiddo wanted to watch an animated movie for her birthday present.

232
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,750
Was it the anniversary of his death recently?

233
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,130
Is that why you came back?

234
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,680
Yes.

235
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,710
I'm too busy with life that I keep forgetting.

236
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,830
- It's okay.
- By the way, you're resembling Soo Wan more and more.

237
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,930
Like people won't know you're brothers, huh?

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Who is she?

239
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,410
This is my girlfriend.

240
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,710
Oh, hello. I'm friend of Jae Gook's brother, Soo Wan.

241
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,450
Hello, I'm Ha Yeong Eun.

242
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,460
Goodbye.

243
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,620
Reality hit me straight in the face.

244
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:23,720
Hearing the name Soo Wan out of the blue nearly made my knees buckle.

245
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,340
Is that so?

246
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,940
I think I lost about half of my fighting spirit too.

247
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,050
You still have the other half left.

248
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,010
Why are there so many hills to climb over?

249
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,250
Since you're climbing anyway, let's go over one more hill.

250
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,720
I want to meet

251
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
your mother too.

252
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,760
What did you just say?

253
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,620
Help me out until the Paris deal is wrapped up.

254
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,230
After it's all done, we say goodbye?

255
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,770
Yes, like it's no biggie.

256
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,860
I think that proposal is a little too harsh for me.

257
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,810
I got rejected when I confessed, and now we'll break up after the contractual relationship ends?

258
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,100
Don't you also have to get to Paris safely?

259
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,990
Wait till my father finds out.

260
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,150
He hates being deceived the most.

261
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,130
It happened regardless of my will,

262
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,460
so why should I take responsibility together with you?

263
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,960
After conquering Paris, shouldn't we proceed to Milan, London, and New York?

264
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,550
Anyway, you're saying we should start dating?

265
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,660
It'll be a short-term contract.

266
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,560
I would say we are a show window couple for business reasons.

267
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,270
So what should I do?

268
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,190
First of all, you need be seen often at my company.

269
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,490
And how outwardly passionate?

270
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,940
Just enough heat from both of us.

271
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,780
On some circumstances, an appropriate amount of physical touch may be needed.

272
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,460
To what extent?

273
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,620
Let's consent up to light kisses.

274
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,780
We already did all those.

275
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,950
Then I'll take that as a yes,

276
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,980
and until our contract is up, let's do well.

277
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,490
Let's do that. Let's go for it.

278
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,960
We can never get caught, okay?

279
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,040
My dad hates being deceived the most.

280
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,510
Yes, come in.

281
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,300
Soo Ho. Then I'll leave you two to work.

282
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,260
<i>[Resignation letter]</i>

283
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,490
Senior Manager Gwak, what is this?

284
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,520
It's a resignation letter.

285
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,940
Why so suddenly?

286
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm sorry to have made this decision so suddenly.

287
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,090
I've organized all of the ongoing projects I am on,

288
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,750
and I'll make sure my absence won't make a big—

289
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,670
Have you been scouted somewhere else?

290
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,190
What was their condition?

291
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,160
If there was something lacking on my part, you should've talked to me first.

292
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
This is what you give me after all the time and effort

293
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,490
we put in to build up this company from when there were just five of us?

294
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,460
My wife...

295
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,940
is sick.

296
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,410
What are you saying, Soo Ho?

297
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,300
Mi Sook is sick?

298
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,480
- Where is she sick?
- Senior Manager.

299
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,470
What? What is it this time?

300
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,030
What is it that you're like this?

301
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,300
Did something not go well with CEO Seok?

302
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,220
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,100
What didn't I tell you this time?

304
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,970
I heard Mi Sook...

305
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,930
is sick.

306
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,140
You wenches. Just between you two.

307
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,470
Always sharing between you two and leaving me out!

308
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,090
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

309
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,210
I was the only one who didn't know.

310
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,960
You wenches.

311
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Mi Sook can't be sick!

312
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,580
Why is she sick? Why?

313
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,090
What are you doing?

314
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,380
Where have you been? Why didn't you answer the phone?

315
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,670
I went to Mom and got some side dishes.

316
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,260
Then I went to Ji Min's preschool and took her to her piano lesson.

317
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,990
I didn't hear the call.

318
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,190
But why are you home at this hour? And what is all this?

319
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,230
From now on, we'll just eat brown rice.

320
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,020
Did you take the day off to do this?

321
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,540
Did you miss work?

322
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,410
I quit.

323
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,230
What?

324
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,940
Please don't be flustered.

325
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,790
We'll leave his desk as is.

326
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,620
Senior Manager Gwak must return here, to this desk.

327
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,490
We don't know when that'll be, but till then, this desk will remain as is.

328
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,680
Please get back to your work.

329
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,220
Are you nuts? Should all three of us stop living?

330
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,570
Let's get you admitted to the hospital. I can't part with you like this.

331
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,910
- Honey.
- I won't let you be in pain by yourself and collapse again.

332
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,310
Hey, Gwak Soo Ho!

333
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,320
I'm sorry, Mi Sook.

334
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,200
What are you doing right now?

335
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,150
I was a bastard.

336
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,990
Ji Min's dad!

337
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,570
They said you're dying,

338
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,630
but the first thing that came to my mind was

339
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,150
"What happens to me now?"

340
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,710
Then "What happens to Ji Min?"

341
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,420
Then finally I worried about you.

342
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,680
I'm a total bastard.

343
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,930
I'm a selfish bastard

344
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,950
who only cares for me.

345
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,930
Don't do this.

346
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,070
What do I do with you?

347
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,780
What do I do with you?

348
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,990
Are you done crying?

349
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,050
Drink this.

350
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,620
You wench.

351
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,470
You can stop there.

352
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,010
I don't have the energy to listen to any more of that.

353
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,850
I'm going to find the best doctor in that field.

354
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,260
I'm going to get her a VIP room at the hospital and use all of my connections,

355
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,440
so be responsible for bringing Mi Sook. Got it?

356
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,940
- Chi Sook.
- Don't exclude me ever again!

357
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,850
I'm going to...

358
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,180
Bring Mi Sook, got it?

359
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,220
♫ <i>Stay my shiny dreams</i> ♫

360
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:04,420
♫ <i>My close friend, you will come find me, right?</i> ♫

361
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,320
Assistant Manager Seo.

362
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,360
I'd like you to handle the Sonó pop-up at Galeries Lafayette.

363
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,940
- Me?
- You've been working with Senior Manager Gwak this whole time,

364
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,910
- so you understand the work you need to do, right?
- What?

365
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,180
- Yes.
- We can't ignore the impact of a call-to-action,

366
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,890
so keep in touch about the first floor show window,

367
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,510
and before we go into the art work concept meeting,

368
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,320
get the drafts ready.

369
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,810
Okay.

370
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,380
Oh, right.

371
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,960
Could you also manage Cookie's schedule?

372
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,470
Okay.

373
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,310
<i>Senior Manager, please contact me.</i>

374
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,660
<i>A letter of resignation? What on earth is going on?</i>

375
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,200
<i> How could you do this to me?</i>

376
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,220
Gosh, seriously.

377
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,070
You got dessert today?

378
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,120
I got it after waiting a long time in line, so please enjoy.

379
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
Did that woman suggest this as well?

380
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,550
She didn't suggest it,

381
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,740
but it's true that we bought it together.

382
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,350
Give me a moment.

383
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,480
Yes, Yeong Eun?

384
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,490
Yes.

385
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,080
Yes, I got it.

386
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,890
That sounds good.

387
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,980
I'll do that.

388
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,660
All right.

389
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,910
What sounds good?

390
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm...

391
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,580
going to meet Yeong Eun's parents tomorrow.

392
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,680
It's the end.

393
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,710
It's the beginning.

394
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,230
What's so great about white rice

395
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,560
that I spent my youth inhaling half air and half chalk dust

396
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,330
because I was so afraid of running out of it?

397
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,660
Now I am going to enjoy the rest of my life with my pension.

398
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,000
You know, they say the middle of your life starts at 60 years nowadays.

399
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,760
They say medicine has improved so you could easily live to 200.

400
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,190
You should eat up lots.

401
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,090
I couldn't even be sick with a cold comfortably.

402
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,470
I've lived a sincere life

403
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,360
all for the sake of my family.

404
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,550
Why are you eating that?

405
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,690
Every morning, I cooked this white rice and made soup.

406
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,820
All year, I ironed dress shirts.

407
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,270
- So I, too, have worked hard.
- That's mine though.

408
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,010
Did you put your name on it?

409
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,850
Who said it's yours?

410
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,660
I need to eat well too

411
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,240
so that I can get energy to move around.

412
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,870
- What will you do?
- As of today,

413
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,990
you're retiring from my life.

414
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,730
I'm going to send Yeong Eun off to marriage.

415
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,000
It's so good!

416
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,250
So this is what it tastes like!

417
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,780
To those who came to the Sambong Middle School's retirement honoring ceremony,

418
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,040
we thank you once again.

419
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,300
Next, we're going to be hearing a speech from

420
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,690
the president of the alumni association.

421
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,600
<i>[Thank you for all of your hard work]</i>

422
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,960
Teachers, you have taught us with warm love for so long,

423
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,750
and for that we thank you.

424
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,590
Our alumni association sends a round of applause to cheer

425
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,520
as you stand at the starting line of your new future.

426
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,310
Next up, we will hear

427
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,620
the retirement speech from vice principal Ha Taek Soo.

428
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,850
When will you show me?

429
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,060
- It's Dad's retirement ceremony. You should focus on him a little.
- As I stand here today,

430
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,590
rather than what I did well,

431
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,760
what I regret

432
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,080
comes to my mind more.

433
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,190
Now, my life as a teacher comes to an end,

434
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,550
and this second chapter of my life that I've been given,

435
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,830
I wish to write it anew

436
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,570
with my life's forever companion.

437
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,060
He wants to start a new life with you.

438
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,020
Why did he decide on such an important thing

439
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,640
however he wanted without asking me?

440
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,110
Is it a second chapter just in your life?

441
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,980
I have my life, too.

442
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,500
Teacher.

443
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,180
- You've worked so hard all this time.
- Thank you.

444
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

445
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,560
Stop being so late to school.

446
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,670
How great would it have been if there were four of us

447
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,290
including your husband on a day like this?

448
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,210
It's always just the three of us.

449
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,100
Oh, here.

450
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,870
Hello.

451
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,000
Say hi. These are my parents.

452
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,070
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Jae Gook.

453
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,320
Oh, yes, hello.

454
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,580
<i> This is Mrs. Min's son?</i>

455
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,160
<i> Why is Mrs. Min's son...?</i>

456
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,510
He's the person I'm dating, Mom.

457
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,040
Mother.

458
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,450
Jae Gook and that girl, their feelings are resolute.

459
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,410
Soo Wan died.

460
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,710
If that woman hadn't called for him that day,

461
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,040
I wouldn't have lost my fiancé,

462
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,660
and you would still have your son.

463
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,250
Yet you're saying you'll accept her?

464
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,000
- As Jae Gook's woman of all people?
- I can't lose my child again.

465
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,020
The only child I have left is Jae Gook.

466
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,300
- Mother.
- Even in my dreams,

467
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,970
I've never lived a day without remembering Soo Won.

468
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,720
Because

469
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,510
I'm a mother.

470
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,160
So that's why, Yoo Jeong,

471
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,560
in the end,

472
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,150
those two will not work out.

473
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,290
One, two.

474
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,310
- Looks great.
- We're finally four.

475
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,360
Yes, it looks good.

476
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,840
I can take a family picture.

477
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,510
Yes!

478
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,840
Him too.

479
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,440
We should take it together. Let's take it together!

480
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,910
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

481
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,890
Could you take a picture for us?

482
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,600
Yes.

483
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,970
Honey. Here.

484
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,450
- Taking it now.
- Get closer.

485
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,350
Sit here.

486
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,480
Up to what point did you two discuss about your relationship?

487
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,880
Seeing how you introduced us to him,

488
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,090
you guys are thinking of marriage, right?

489
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,250
I can't believe it.

490
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,570
How could you two be together?

491
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,650
I'm all for it.

492
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,650
I like him no matter what.

493
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,020
Mom, regard us keeping just what you saw

494
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,890
and felt today in mind.

495
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:14,230
- I'm asking this of you.
- I can't look at something else?

496
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,100
What's wrong?

497
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,030
What?

498
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,950
What did you just say?

499
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,950
Who?

500
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,890
Yoon Soo Wan.

501
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,230
He's my older brother.

502
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,320
It was ten years ago. The relationship only lasted two months.

503
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,520
- Close that mouth.
- It's not like it's been decided,

504
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,410
who I can like and who I can't.

505
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,290
He's his younger brother.

506
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,990
Does this look normal to you?

507
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,580
What's normal?

508
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,260
What's abnormal?

509
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,010
Who decides?

510
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,920
- Yeong Eun.
- Mom.

511
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,910
There are so many people in this world.

512
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,120
They all look, think, and live differently.

513
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,890
So how can there be a right answer?

514
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,600
Whose thoughts are right?

515
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,300
The wide path that others walk on is the correct one.

516
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,280
It is a flat and well-paved road.

517
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,510
Going on that road is correct.

518
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,020
The world is changing. Ways of thinking are changing too.

519
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,730
Things from your time that were not accepted are accepted now.

520
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,010
You're so blinded.

521
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,310
Why am I alive?

522
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,810
What have I been living for?

523
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,720
You should have fooled us completely instead.

524
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,510
I didn't want to do that to her parents.

525
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,210
It's not enough that just you two are happy.

526
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,670
You don't live alone in this world.

527
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,070
I heard you came from Paris.

528
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,940
You have a place to return to whenever you want.

529
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,410
If you leave like that, what about my daughter?

530
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,230
What about Yeong Eun?

531
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,860
Go to work. That's the way to help me.

532
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,800
All I did was to take you as my wife.

533
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,990
I never did anything for you.

534
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:49,590
Ji Min's dad, please at least let me feel comfortable.

535
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,940
If you're done eating, go lie down.

536
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,760
I'll go pick up Ji Min, so get some sleep.

540
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,230
I looked into a hospital.

541
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,690
I already took care of it so that you can get hospitalized right away. So pack what you need to take, got it?

542
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,710
Not you too.

543
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm tired of repeating myself.

544
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,430
- Hey, Jeon Mi Sook, this isn't the time to be—
- Hanging up.

545
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,860
Why not hang up the clothes he wore instead?

546
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,200
<i>I'm in front of your apartment.</i>

547
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,360
I told him to send them for dry cleaning right away.

548
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,450
Are you crazy? How dare you come here?

549
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,340
Since you haven't replied to my texts after reading them!

550
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,790
Go. Hurry up and go.

551
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,390
What about me?

552
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,950
Let's go. Let's talk outside.

554
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,560
Hello.

555
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,050
Why did you come out?

556
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,670
It's cold. Go inside.

557
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,480
The CEO told me to come since there were some tasks still left to be transferred over to me.

558
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,790
I'm sorry. He'll be back at work soon but we made you come all this way.

559
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,930
It's okay.

560
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,970
Come in. Come in and talk.

561
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,350
No, no. We'll talk outside.

562
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,430

563
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,880

Okay.

570
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,880
If you had called, I would have prepared something.

571
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,580
I couldn't get a hold of him. It seemed like he was very busy.

572
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,390
I stopped by while heading home.

573
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh no. He keeps creating problems for you.

574
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,280
It's okay.

575
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,950

Honey, go in and get some rest.

578
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,280
Oh, look at me. I talked too much when she came by to see you.

579
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,380
- It's okay.
- Take your time.

580
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,460
I'll go to the dry cleaners then.

The sizes 55 and 66 were made in 1981.

603
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,790
That time, the average female height was 155 cm and bust width was 85 cm.

604
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,920
Size 55 was created by taking the last digit of the two values.

605
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,790
What? We were being pessimistic about not fitting into a size defined 40 years ago?

606
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,220
Based on last year's numbers, the average female height has increased by 6 cm since then.

607
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,350
Using a system from 40 years ago is just too much.

608
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,660
People buy to fit their hip size then get the waist size altered.

609
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,000
For coats, they buy to fit their shoulder width, then take the seam allowance to increase the sleeve length.

610
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,120
It's wrong to take that as a given.

611

Body types and builds have become diverse.

612
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,160
It's only right for us also to make different sizes.

613
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,580
The report should focus on the problem of the sizing system and the need to increase number of sizes offered, right?

614
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,030
Yes.

615
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,670

but I'd like it if you didn't use me as an excuse.

633
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,130
It's offensive that someone, who thinks living life is the easiest thing because he will become an assistant manager

634
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,240
and then a senior manager when the time is right, is using me, who works hard, as an excuse.

635
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,790
- Excuse me.
- I moved all of the boxes by myself.

636

00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,330
Ah, changing the pants length per hip size.

639
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,190
Adjusting the sleeve length based on the shoulder width, too?

640
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,960
Sonó is such a friendly brand.

641
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,320
When sizes change and new patterns are created, we need to make at least 100 copies for training!

642
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,760
To make one blouse, we draw it a hundred, a thousand times until we get it right.

643
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,540
Then, we alter it. And after quality check, we make more alterations.

644
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,560
To achieve this, we need three factories operating. Then what will happen to the other clothes in the meantime?

645
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,660
And after all that, what if stock just piles up?

646
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,390
Will you take all of the responsibility?

647
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,530
How much longer will we hold on to an outdated sizing system from 40 years ago?

648
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,120
Body types have changed, and the clothes that people want are changing.

649
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,750
Despite that, people fit themselves well into the sizes and buy them just fine!

650
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,990
Why does the body have to fit to the clothes?

651
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,410
- The clothes should fit to the body.
- Really, will you keep talking back to me?

652
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:06,700
Should I bring it up to the director or the CEO directly?

653
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,560
Ah, seriously... seriously!

654
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,320
I'm going to think about it for one more minute.

655
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,770
She's back.

656
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,730
How did it go?

657
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,460
<i>[Approval request: Chief]</i>

658
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,550
Awesome!

659
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,690
- Great!
- All right, let's get busy again.

660
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,200
- Yes!
- Yes!

661
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,360
Let's go!

662
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,370
Here.

663
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:56,300
Did you come here today to ask me to go easy on her again?

664
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,770
That'd be nice.

665
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,990
But I really did want to eat with you.

666
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,990
It'll get cold. Hurry and eat.

667
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:14,110
Oh, and... I'm going to start a new job.

668
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,600
What job?

669
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,420
Now, I want to take pictures of people, not clothes.

670
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,720
<i> Let's take it together.</i>

671
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,050
<i>I was always wandering around.</i>

672
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,000
<i>Get closer. Closer.</i>

673
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,810
<i>Because there was no place to settle my heart.</i>

674
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,490
<i>Because there was no place to put it.</i>

675
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,790
Being too close to, bumping into, and bothering each other.

676
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,220
It felt nice. I wanted to keep doing it.

677
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,160
To take pictures of people, you need to know who they are,

678
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,020
what they're like, and what they like in order to express them.

679
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,880
Are you two perhaps even thinking of marriage?

680
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,400
If she wants to.

681
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,870
Do you want to bring her home once?

682
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,040
I want to make her a meal.

683
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,540
Mother.

684
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,450
Bring her home.

685
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,230
What's all of this?

686
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,330
You want to go back to your student life in Paris?

687
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:03,190
It's been a while but I'm using the skills I had to practice twice because I had to do your homework too.

688
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,140
It will take too long to complete by myself, so you can assist me this time.

689
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,690
I'm already feeling so upset and sad from thinking about Mi Sook.

690
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,600
I don't want to feel annoyance from assisting you on top of that.

691
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,840
Whatever it is, work hard.

692
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,980
These are clothes for Mi Sook.

693
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,310
The clothes she bought with courage,

694
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,400
the clothes she rashly bought when she was happy,

695
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,550
the clothes she wore for the preschool event,

696
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,510
and the clothes she wore to look cool on her wedding anniversary.

697
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,050
These are all a part of her past,

698
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,960
so I couldn't just leave them in the donation box.

699
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,450
If they're too big, we can make them smaller.

700
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,540
If they get bigger, we can re-make them even smaller.

701
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,630
What should I do?

702
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,910
We need to shorten the length, so cut the hem.

703
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,580
I'm the best with scissors.

704
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,960
- From here?
- Yeah.

705
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,660
How is it? Do I look good?

706
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,500
As expected, whoever the designer was that reformed it is amazing.

707
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,360
Can you tell whoever it is that she wouldn't have been able to finish if it hadn't been for the assistant?

708
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,260
Hey! I used to be a rising model years ago.

709
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,840
Even though it was for a short time.

710
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,640
Anyway, this skinny body

711
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,800
is completing your work. What do you say?

712
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,060
- You're right.
- 100%.

713
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,460
It's so pretty.

714
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,990
When did you wear this?

715
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,480
For Ji Min's first birthday photo shoot.

716
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,410
Oh, this is that?

717
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,720
Try this on, too. This will complete the look.

718
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,850
Wasn't this long before? Did you buy it?

719
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,500
- No... Is this the long coat?
- Yeah.

720
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,770
I cropped it.

721
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,240
- She's acting like she did it all by herself again!
- It's a disease. A disease.

722
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,510
I did the scissoring myself.

723
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,310
Oh, you're all so skilled.

724
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,680
It makes your legs look long. It's pretty.

725
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,310
Yeah, I wanted to buy something like this. People wear it a lot these days.

726
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,450
A cropped jacket like this.

727
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,060
I think I'll get treatment.

728
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,070
Mi Sook.

729
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,510
Jeon Mi Sook!

730
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,220
I was just thinking about throwing it away.

731
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,360
I didn't know there were other methods.

732
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,740
If I want to say goodbye well,

733
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,560
I need to live well first.

734
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,060
I'm going to try till the end.

735
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,770
"You did well."

736
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,880
"You did all that you could."

737
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,600
So I won't have any regrets.

738
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,850
Thanks, Mi Sook.

739
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,360
Thank you.

740
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,680
Go to the VIP room.

741
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,810
Yeah, let me use that money of yours.

742
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,910
Hey, these clothes are calling for you to walk. Go walk!

743
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,950
Show us your walk.

744
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,250
Let's go with the power walk.

745
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,780
Oh, your walk is still great.

746
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,190
- Your talent didn't go anywhere!
- It's still great!

747
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,470
Let's see.

748
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,030
What is that?

749
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:07,260
Hey, it's good that I lost weight! It makes these clothes look so good.

750
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,940
Saying goodbye is also a method of love.

751
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,980
It's been 20 years, since I was 18.

752
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,420
I've spent half of my life with her.

753
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,060
"Okay, yeah."

754
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,860
"Goodbye."

755
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,620
How can I do that?

756
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,930
Does saying goodbye

757
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,120
always have to be mushy and full of affection?

758
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,660
That's just a stereotype.

759
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,750
You should ease her heart before she passes.

760
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,960
That's love, too.

761
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,030
Love doesn't have just one side to it.

762
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,490
Can I lean on you?

763
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,800
Why do you even ask?

764
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,720
My shoulder is yours whenever you need it.

765
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,720
Whenever.

Nice to meet you.

773
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,310
I've come to see Director Hwang Chi Sook.

774
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,500
- You're going to drink coffee, right?
- Yes.

775
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,000
I've come to see Director Hwang Chi Sook.

776
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,020
Hello, CEO.

777
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,440
I actually had a reason to come here, so I thought I might as well.

778
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,230
Do you like flowers, by any chance?

779
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,690
Follow me.

780
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,780
<i>[Seok Do Hoon]
[Experience]
[Education]</i>

781
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,270
You were born in 1982, the year of the black dog.

782
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,560
Is that true?

783
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,760
Although I look young for my age, that's right.

784
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,240
When was your company established?

785
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,050
Yes! Vision PR was established eight years ago with the spirit of five members.

786
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,320
We currently have about 400 employees,

787
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,270
and as the center of the domestic fashion industry,

788
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,920
we are in charge of top tier brands' shows.

789
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,430
Do you know that Chi Sook's unrequited love

790
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:11,180
was always rejected?

791
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,920
Is that so?

792
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,030
She's only liked people who look like models.

793
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:19,300
But... she's dating you?

794
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,320
If you get to know me, I'm pretty charming.

795
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,120
The incident from that day.

796
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,890
Was it mutual or one-sided?

797
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,320
Oh, that incident.

798
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,140
If you think it's mutual, it's mutual.

799
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,770
If you think it's one-sided, it's one-sided.

800
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,080
You two planned it, right?

801
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,560
<i> It's a short-term contract.</i>

802
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,490
<i>I would say we are a show window couple for business reasons.</i>

803
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:40,970
<i>We can never get caught, okay?</i>

804
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,240
<i>My dad hates being deceived the most.</i>

805
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,890
Why aren't you answering?

806
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,840
I'm sorry.

807
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,670
You can't lie?

808
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:53,770
I'm sorry.

809
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,180
So how sincere are you?

810
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,290
I am 100% sincere.

811
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,850
I confessed my feelings...

812
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,620
but I was rejected.

813
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,870
You truly have the desire to date Chi Sook?

814
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,230
Although we are a short-term couple by contract,

815
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:13,430
I want to be with her in that way at least.

816
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,590
Keep me updated from now on.

817
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,630
- What?
- Hey! If you want to date her,

818
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,340
you need to do something with that hair first.

819
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,910
Oh, this is my signature.

820
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,170
You don't like Chi Sook that much?

821
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,240
CEO, please respect my hair.

822
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,150
You little rascal, my kid only looks at the face alone!

823
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,780
What kind of style would be best?

824
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,600
Foreigners will order thousands of yards so why would I sell just a little?

825
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,610
It's not like you will even pay full price.

826
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,780
You'll try to lower the price from the beginning saying it's domestic.

827
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,760
We won't sell less than 1,000 yards.

828
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,220
We don't want to have too much in stock.

829
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,970
So basically it's hard for both sides right now.

830
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,130
Then there's no other way. It has to be done the way it has been done.

831
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,450
How many yards of the tweed do you want?

832
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:22,120
Even if we start developing new materials, it'll take at least three months.

833
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,570
What if the result is not really anything good?

834
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,680
It's not like we can take responsibility for all of it. We can't do this.

835
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,360
We have the skills to easily outdo the Japanese or Italians.

836
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,980
But it feels quite stifling to know that we have to keep this for another time.

837
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,630
For now, set up the meeting. Maybe we'll find a solution then.

838
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:38,570
So Yeong, take Chi Hyeong with you and go to the warehouse.

839
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,120
It seems like they are complaining about not getting any support.

840
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,660
Okay.

841
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:48,350
Noona, I am very sensitive to dust and scents.

842
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,980
Wear a mask and go.

843
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,330
Hold it properly.

844
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,550
Here.

845
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,610
With this, I'm done.

846
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,100
The dust here is no joke.

847
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,740
Let's shower my throat with iced Americano.

848
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,130
We have to quality check and separate out the ones that don't meet expectation.

849
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,310
What is that?

850
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,950
Ones that came out smaller than the spec sheet due to shrinkage and ones that have dyeing faults.

851
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,530
We have to separate them out and return them.

852
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:44,040
Look here... if you live without resting, your joints will give out.

853
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,730
- You guys are Sonó's newest employees?
- Yes.

854
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,880
After the quality check, trim the hanging threads too.

855
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,900
There's a thread snipper over there.

856
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,030
Us?

857
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,770
I will give a good report to your team leader.

858
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,480
I can't do this any longer.

859
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,840
Before I shrink, I will leave now.

860
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,990
Stop right there!

861
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,250
You need to do your part before leaving.

862
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,680
I said that I don't have any intention of doing more.

863
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,490
I don't want to do it.

864
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,880
Do it.

865
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,030
I said that I won't do it.

866
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,960
You came? What about Jae Gook?

867
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,410
There was suddenly an opening for a photo studio,

868
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,290
so he said he would come after looking at it.

869
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:31,030
He's probably on his way.

870
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,320
I see. Come inside.

871
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,470
I bought something that's not too sweet.

872
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:40,400
Place it down anywhere in this area.

873
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,850
Should I help you with anything?

874
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,000
Wash your hands first.

875
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,800
The bathroom is at the top of the stairs.

876
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,040
Yes.

877
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,210
Because a child is not something that can be erased or swept aside.

878
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:06,890
I am the same as I was 10 years ago.

879
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,590
Jae Gook is probably the same.

880
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:16,560
Soo Wan will always be next to Jae Gook.

881
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:21,400
The people who know Soo Wan and traces of Soo Wan

882
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,250
will probably remain forever.

883
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,320
Saying that you want to go all the way with Jae Gook

884
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,910
means that you will endure it all.

885
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:34,000
As if you are not fazed, shamelessly...

886
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,700
Will you be able to do that?

887
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,440
<i>A scary but clear reality.</i>

888
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,210
<i>A persistent and harsh perception.</i>

889
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,090
Mother, I am here.

890
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,570
Yes, Jae Gook. It's all done. Come on in.

891
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,780
Yeong Eun, I ran over because I thought I was going to be late.

892
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,360
The table is ready. Come and sit down.

893
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,940
I'm sorry.

894
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,390
I'm sorry. I will leave first.

895
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,160
For what reason did you leave it opened?

896
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:10,360
I wanted to confirm if she can really overcome Soo Wan.

897
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,300
I told you she can't.

898
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,270
She won't ever overcome it.

899
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,610
Let's go together.

900
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,880
- You see, I...
- I know.

901
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,490
I know why you are acting this way,

902
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,720
so you don't have to say anything.

903
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,700
Stay together with me.

904
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:15,320
<i>[Our Photography Studio]</i>

905
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,450
It's my photo studio.

906
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,740
I did run away.

907
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,520
When I saw Soo Wan's room,

908
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,960
I totally lost my will to fight.

909
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:39,740
For two months, I am going to do a pop-up here where I only shoot photos of people.

910
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:43,650
Your mother was right.

911
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,970
How can I overcome this?

912
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,410
After that, if I want to shoot more photos, I might just settle down here.

913
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:56,620
Imagining it in your head...

914
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:01,560
and experiencing it in real life were really this different.

915
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:08,360
I didn't try to get permission from my mom.

916
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,280
If she really must disapprove, then there's nothing that we can do.

917
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,890
No matter what anyone says...

918
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:23,210
I will go on my path with you.

919
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:31,250
<i>The four of us can't live together.</i>

920
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,710
<i>Burying one child in my heart,</i>

921
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:36,320
<i>and seeing the woman who took him away from me</i>

922
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,310
<i>smile with the child I have left...</i>

923
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,260
<i>As a mother, I just can't bear to see that.</i>

924
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:46,350
<i>Is this something that cannot be possible to this extent?</i>

925
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:49,630
<i>But if you still say you will go, then you must go.</i>

926
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,800
<i>What can I do?</i>

927
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:58,220
<i>But I... will be gone.</i>

928
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:02,050
<i>Is this something to be this cruel about?</i>

929
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,280
I regret it...

930
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:18,640
To the point where I want to cut out those two months from ten years ago...

931
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,990
I regret it so much.

932
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,020
To the point that I regret all those times for the first time,

933
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,140
I love you.

934
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,230
That's why I'm so sorry.

<i>Just wait, Chi Sook!</i>

955
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,640
<i>While you're at it, why don't you seal the deal?</i>

956
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,430
<i>Tonight?</i>

957
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,600
<i>I'm confused.</i>

958
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,140
<i>My body speaks to me everyday with aches, Yeong Eun. </i>

959
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,250
<i>We're near my house.</i>

960
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,250
<i>I still need you.</i>

961
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,810
<i>So this is the place where my Cookie wants to start his new life.</i>

962
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,950
<i>We want to take a picture.</i>

963
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:00,080
<i>You said that you wanted to take a picture before you started chemotherapy.</i>

964
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,800
<i>- Okay.
- Leave your body to the rhythm of the music.</i>

965
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,040
<i>Look at me, look at me. </i>

966
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,470
<i>Those who are left behind have to live with only the memories of their passed one.</i>

967
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:09,920
<i>You are quite selfish. That isn't love. That's greed.</i>

968
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,340
<i>What's your reason for going this far? Why exactly are you doing this?</i>

969
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:16,750
<i>It seems that you don't know anything. Ten years ago, Hyung had already...</i>

970
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,720
♫ <i>Do you know the love drawn inside me</i> ♫

971
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,870
♫ <i>I am waiting only for you</i> ♫

972
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:29,450
♫ <i>After this long night ends</i> ♫

973
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:39,370
