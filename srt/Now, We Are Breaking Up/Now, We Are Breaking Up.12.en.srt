I'm going to get this month's paycheck and then go.

They said that they'd give us a better deal if you and I move as a team.

35
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,620
How could you? What if the team leader finds about this?

Whose side do you think the team leader will be on?

Still, this isn't right, Ahn Seon Joo. This is stabbing somebody in the back.

No, not yet.

What are you two doing?

50
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,840
You see, Team Leader, it is hard to concentrate on work,

51
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,150
and it keeps feeling unstable to work here, so...

52
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,880
There was an article this morning saying even Jangseo Group was sold.

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,160
There are rumors circulating that The One is up next on the chopping block.

54
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,000
- So?
- Team Leader Oh In Na is even submitting medical leave for fibroids.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,200
She's basically announcing that she's taking time off to go on interviews.

56
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,110
The company won't tell us anything, and these rumors keep circulating,

57
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,660
so it's true that we're anxious, Team Leader.

58
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,000
So there is no reply from Lafayette yet?

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,180
Even if Lafayette were to respond, so much time has passed

60
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,780
that it's difficult to meet the deadline within the month they gave us.

61
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,530
We won't be able to do it, Team Leader.

62
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,840
Director Hwang or the CEO will probably take care of you whether the company is sold or not,

63

- You all may be able to give up this easily, but I can't.

70
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,770
You're trying to survive by going to interviews and making portfolios,

I'm just saying you should not work so hard.

You don't always get rewarded for it.

99
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,730
I'm not working hard for the company. I'm working hard on my job.

100

"I like sticky rice"?

136
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,770
You asked me why I always ate my rice mixed with water.

137
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,140
It's because I couldn't swallow it.

138
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,330
So you want to separate over something so trivial?

139

Something so trivial? Everything written there is trivial?

140
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,530
You said nothing all this time, and now that I'm old and jobless,

141
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,280
you want to divorce immediately.

142
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,310
You're so ungrateful that I can't give you one cent of this house or my pension. Not one cent!

143
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,470
Why can't you give it to me? Why won't you give it to me?

I can't give it to you. It's all mine.

You only earned it. Did you try saving even a cent?

You always stood as a guarantor for people and lost all our money.

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,490
<i>He has never once introduced me with my name.</i>

157
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,760
<i>For 40 years, the two names "wife" and "mother"</i>

158
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,840
<i>were the only names I lived under.</i>

159
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,670
<i>At the culture center, I had to write what I am good at.</i>

160
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,240
<i>But all I know how to do are</i>

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,100
<i>to cook, to do laundry, and to clean...</i>

162
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,510
<i>so I could not fill it out until the end.</i>

163
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,110
<i>Looking at the other wives, they had various hobbies like</i>

164
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,760
<i>flower arrangement and cross-stitching.</i>

165
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,980
<i>The day before yesterday at our savings club meeting, people said we should go on a trip.</i>

166
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,330
<i>My husband asks</i>

167
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,280
<i>"Where would you go leaving the kitchen unattended?"</i>

168
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,950
<i>"What would I eat before going to work?"</i>

169
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,230
<i>Giving an excuse that we're busy,</i>

170
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,120
<i>we didn't go.</i>

171
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,140
What kind of money do you have that you would have your eyes on a super car worth over ₩100 million?

172
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,460
If the company gets sold, something should come my way.

173
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,220
What have you done for the company?

174
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,970
You're a new hire.

175
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,490
What have you done?

176
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm a director.

177
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,180
You're only a director in title. In practice, Yeong Eun is the one who did everything.

178
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,250
Anyway, there will be nothing left for you if I am to open a specialty boutique,

179
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,700
so drive around carefully in the car you have.

180
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,720
Specialty boutique?

181
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,650
Shopping is my hobby and specialty.

182
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,670
I'm going to gather and buy all the luxury brands at once. A big buyer.

183
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,420
Who would trust your taste?

184
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,090
That's because my hands aren't great, but my taste is properly high class.

185
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,470
Even so, Hwang Chi Sook without Ha Yeong Eun

186
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,010
- is a snail shell without a snail.
- That's it!

187
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,740
Would the two of you stop?

188
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,040
Oh!

189
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,520
What brings you here?

190
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,030
Who is he?

191
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,130
I'm Seok Do Hoon,

192
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,300
the CEO of Vision PR and Director Hwang Chi Sook's current boyfriend.

193
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,890
Noona, are you crazy?

194
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,310
Why are you presenting your boyfriend at a lunch appointment called by our dad?

195
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,680
I... didn't call him though.

196
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,650
CEO Hwang called me.

197
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,740
- My dad did?
- Our father did?

198
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,200
After listening to your conversation for a bit while waiting for the CEO outside,

199
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,850
it was so ridiculous beyond measure

200
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,970
that I had no choice but to step in.

201
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,090
What?

202
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,700
With the rumor going around that this company is being handed over,

203
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,480
the children of the company owner are talking about specialty boutiques

204
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,420
and super cars?

205
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,680
Do you know how nervous the employees are right now?

206
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,770
There are heads of family worried about their children's after school program fees for the upcoming month.

207
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,970
How many months will they be able to afford on severance pay? Will they be rehired?

208
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,890
There are colleagues who are sleeping fitfully at night wondering about those.

209
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,930
Do you not feel a single bit of responsibility for those people?

210
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,810
I'm making new plans so I can take responsibility for my own life.

211
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,730
And that will be through buying luxury goods with the money from the company sale?

212
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,940
Hwang Chi Sook, have you always been in that position with that mindset?

213
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,960
Pretty sure she has been.

214
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,060
An owner is not someone who only deliberates over how they will live.

215
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,450
Increasing the value of the company

216
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,460
and giving the employees faith that they will be able to work here in the future is what an owner does!

217
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,740
That's why they get a large room and a nice chair.

218
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Because the weight of their role on their shoulders is heavy and burdensome.

219
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,300
There is no need to raise your voice.

220
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,400
My sister can't understand anyway.

221
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,010
You don't know what he's talking about, do you?

222
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,410
Sister, you say?

223
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,230
Where is your sister here?

224
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,070
Excuse me?

225
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,470
Wow, it appears that these siblings don't know about the three principles and five virtues of Confucianism

226
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,680
or that elders come first.

227
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,280
Please treat each other with respect!

228
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,820
If this were my company–

229
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,100
And if you were my younger brother–

230
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,600
Hold on there.

231
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,260
I'm not "there" nor am I "here." I am Vision PR's CEO Seok Do Hoon.

232
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,050
What I'm saying is, CEO Seok Do Hoon–

233
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,270
Take your hands out of your pockets!

234
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,740
Responsibility.

235
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,880
Take it on.

236
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,160
Yes.

237
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,290
Ah, you have arrived, CEO.

238
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,020
Dad...

239
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,430
Hi...

240
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,840
Sit.

241
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,830
Great job!

242
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,400
Did I go through all of that raising you for you to come out like this?

243
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,020
What's a man doing working in the kitchen?

244
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,860
- Mom.
- Look at you!

245
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,670
What is this?

246
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,990
- Seriously!
- Mom...

247
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,790
Honey...

248
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,340
And you were sleeping?

249
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,040
You came, Mother-in-Law?

250
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,910
You should have at least called.

251
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,030
Was I in the situation to?

252
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,040
I've been shocked twice today.

253
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,390
I went near his work and gave him a call, but what do I hear?

254
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,050
He resigned?

255
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,520
Wondering if he was sick, I came all the way here without stopping, but you've got it made!

256
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,690
You're sleeping while my precious child is making food?

257
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,520
Mom, that's not it. Ji Min's mom isn't doing too well.

258
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,330
- So I–
- It's always this hurts or that hurts!

259
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,290
Those exact words prevent a man working hard outside from succeeding!

260
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,720
Mom...

261
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
What benefit has my son received by being with you?

262
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,510
Did you work to contribute to the household or was your family wealthy enough to be helpful in getting a bigger house?

263
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,770
Please go, Mom! She's actually sick!

264
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,900
- Please don't be like this!
- Let go!

265
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,840
I didn't receive it.

266
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,710
In order to help contribute to buying our house,

267
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,290
my mother pulled out her retirement savings. How could I accept that?

268
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,930
If you're married, you're an adult,

269
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,810
so we should take care of it on our own.

270
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,520
So taking care of it is

271
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,100
making your husband resign while you lie down getting fed?

272
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,820
Mother!

273
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,000
Whether he writes a resignation letter or I get fed

274
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,530
is our business, and we will decide it.

275
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,160
Look at how this girl speaks!

276
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,560
So what? I should keep my mouth shut?

277
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,730
Is that what you're saying?

278
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,530
I'm telling you to stop! Please!

279
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,460
Why? Now while you're at it, just say that I shouldn't come at all!

280
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,210
Would you be able to do that?

281
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,050
Then if you could do that for me, it would be great!

282
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,540
Wh-Wh-What did you say?

283
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
I'm going to get some air and come back.

284
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,880
Ji Min's mom.

285
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,270
What is she doing right now?

286
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,660
Mother, please!

287
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,390
I really can't believe the likes of that one.

288
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,040
So you came without even eating?

289
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,680
I came here suddenly, but you have a lot of side dishes.

290
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,740
I visited my mom.

291
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,470
I don't even eat that much but she always packs so much. You know.

292
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,840
At least my mother made us side dishes.

293
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,380
What exactly did she do?

294
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,700
If someone heard, they would think that she had at least bought us a house!

295
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,330
But we bought our house through Soo Ho's loan and my marriage fund!

296
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,600
You should have said that you two paid back the loan together, but your marriage fund was yours to begin with.

297
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,850
I was worked up, so I didn't think of it.

298
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,420
I mean, about having kids too...

299
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,840
Did we have just one because we wanted only one child?

300
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,040
It's already so expensive to raise one child.

301
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,060
If you're dating, it's "when are you getting married?"

302
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,240
If you're married, it's "when will you have kids?"

303
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,380
If you have a kid, it's "when are you having a second?"

304
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,640
It's not like they're going to live life for you, but they tell you to do this and that.

305
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
They have so much to say.

306
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,380
If she had changed Ji Min's diapers even just once, I would have held it in.

307
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,610
Did Soo Ho really say he won't go to work?

308
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,080
Yeah.

309
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,270
He doesn't listen.

310
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,440
It's because he's worried about you.

311
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,150
Living well would be helping me.

312
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,930
Rather than myself losing weight,

313
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,720
it pains me more to see Ji Min's dad's shoulders sag.

If I didn't have you at times like this, what would I have done?

So?

320
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,160
Did you say that you would go?

321
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,190
Should I go?

322
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,710
Just like that?

I have been thinking about it since then.

329
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,350
Did I really love Soo Wan?

330
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,330
Could it have been an obsession?

331
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,320
Or... did I dislike being rejected?

332
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,840
If it wasn't for Ha Yeong Eun,

333
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,160
would Soo Wan and I

334
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,980
really not have any problems?

335
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,370
Would we be...

living happily until now?

Even still, I have no choice

338
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,900
but to still have lingering feelings about

339
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,260
a road I was not able to take.

340
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,700
And even still, I have no choice but to resent Ha Yeong Eun.

341
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,900
I know.

342
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,760
And I still...

343
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,460
long for Soo Wan so much, Jae Gook.

344
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,970

your love is not something that I can call into question.

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,620
Yeah.

I told her earlier.

369

She was asking me why I didn't tell her sooner.

what she truly wants

is for you to act like nothing's wrong.

I didn't know how much I loved her.

I've looked into a few places where we could stay in Paris.

393
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,380
There's one that is next to an art museum and some with good infrastructure.

394
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,280
And this one has a lot of parks.

395
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,940
There is one near a pretty cafe, too.

396
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,710
I know where this is. When I was studying abroad,

397
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,450
I told myself that I'd earn a lot of money and live there one day.

398
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,190
You can live there now. With me.

399

That'll be fun.

400
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,590
I'm going to call them right now and sign the contract then.

401
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,050
My mom wants to get a divorce.

402
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,370
There is a high chance that my parents will take it to court.

403
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,300
I tried to stop them,

404
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,140
but after reading all of the details that my mom wrote out,

405
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,710
I am not sure if stopping them will solve anything.

Trying to find new jobs,

410
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,620
my team members have been looking into other companies.

Let's stop waiting.

446
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,840
If they're not giving a response,

447
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,950
it's because they're unsure as to whether our clothes will come out well or not.

Then we'll have them look at it directly and decide.

Are you going to alter the sample and send it over?

Wow, the scale.

455

You always exceed expectations, Team Leader Ha.

456
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,790
We can't waste time waiting for a response.

457
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,070
Nothing will happen if we just keep altering things based on what they say,

and the end result won't turn out well.

Since we are confident about what we make, instead of doing that,

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,830
we can just tell them to take a look then decide how they want to judge us.

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,030
A buyers show?

475
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,220
The goal of the Lafayette pop-up was to increase awareness of our clothes.

476
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,510
I think it's more efficient to show them directly to the buyers.

477
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,090
To bring in one purchasing buyer, it costs tens of millions to over a hundred million won.

478
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,530
And on top of that, there's the cost of models, staff, and personnel.

479
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,930
The burden of the costs is too high.

480
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:25,180
But what the buyers are looking for the most is a skilled designer, isn't that true?

481
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,900
I'm a director.

482
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,830
I'm thinking on behalf of the company.

483
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,790
If you think they won't come because of the lack of brand awareness,

484
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,390
let's take off the labels and tell them to just look at the clothes.

485
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,300
- What?
- Even for designer luxury items,

486
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,350
if we take off the labels and logo...

487
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,950
There are lots of people who think

488
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,720
"You're going to pay millions of won to buy this? You must have money to throw away."

489
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,690
What do you think, CEO Seok?

490
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,880
I think it's a good idea.

491
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,240
One of the greatest obstacles for domestic brands is brand power.

492
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,980
If you take that away and compete only using the clothes,

493
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,470
you will be able to receive a proper evaluation without prejudice.

494
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,180
If you're going to go for it anyway, going all out

495
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,550
will be helpful in attracting people's attention.

496
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,190
If we invite 50 buyers from Europe, the United States, and China,

497
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,660
the anticipated cost is 400 million won.

498
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,920
We're going to proceed with a virtual, online show.

499
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,500
The anticipated cost is zero.

500
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,940
Like Vivienne Westwood, Balenciaga, Vetements, and other luxury brands?

501
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,310
The camera catches even the texture of the clothes, so the buyers prefer it very much.

502
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,180
Will they come just because we asked them to?

503
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,440
As to that point, I think you can trust us, Vision PR.

504
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,300
Then go ahead with it.

505
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,530
CEO, the show itself has a cost that shouldn't be taken lightly.

506
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,640
The investment has been decided.

507
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,240
<i>We have found that many directly managed stores are losing money.</i>

508
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,570
<i>Can we get a list of directly managed stores and other retail stores?</i>

509
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,130
The auditors you guys were worried about were actually an investment group.

510
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,490
What?

511
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,390
Yes.

512
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,400
What? We're receiving an investment?

513
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,510
Oh, I understand. I'll come back.

514
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,870
<i>[Jeonghan Private invests 15 billion won in The One]</i>

515
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,710
<i>[Auditors not to sell but to invest]</i>

516
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,360
Taxi! Taxi!

517
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,370
- Driver, I'm going to The One.
- Okay.

518
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,550
The financial performance of the company, the future market opportunities of Sonó,

519
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,050
and the skills and hard work that you've poured into Sonó, Yeong Eun.

520
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,940
The investment group assessed them objectively and acknowledged them positively.

521
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,120
Knowing that we won't be able to protest,

522
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,970
The Parisians are neglecting us and treating us carelessly.

523
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,890
But, Yeong Eun, the one who accepts neglect as the default and starts with their head bowed

524
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,750
is the worst.

525
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,930
Since CEO Seok acknowledges Chi Sook's idea, I will believe in it too.

526
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:59,230
Okay, you three make those punks who lord over us rue their day.

527
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,550
Go cause some trouble.

528
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm so excited.

529
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,940
I'm really going to cause some trouble.

530
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,900
Thank you.

531
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,430
We should be popping the champagne.

532
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,440
Thank you for taking my side in front of my father.

533
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,690
I didn't take your side.

534
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,630
I only said it was a good idea because it was.

535
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,410
Do you know why I couldn't give up dating?

536
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm only a pathetic person to Father and Chi Hyeong.

537
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,290
But I wanted to show them that there is someone

538
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,880
who acknowledges me and who sees me clearly.

539
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,260
But I was always dumped.

540
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,850
Ms. Hwang Chi Sook.

541
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,380
You're not a pathetic person.

542
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,480
Don't try to meet your father's expectations.

543
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,980
Chi Sook, you're not some common "off the rack"

544
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,500
but a very unique limited edition kind of person.

545
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,110
You are a woman who means that much to me.

546
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,080
I'm so happy that you're my man.

547
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,830
Me too. I'm very glad because I'm yours.

548
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,950
Yes.

549
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,140
Yes, I understand. In an hour?

550
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,270
What I saw was a bit strong. How about going with this color?

551
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,070
- Iced Americano.
- Thank you!

552
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,670
No, that's—

553
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,440
Drink this.

554
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,950
So you must really like fashion shows.

555
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,690
It's not that I like shows but because I can keep doing the work I like.

556
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,900
The samples are priority.

557
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,690
Na Ri, take charge of the development room and Seon Joo, get the invitation list.

558
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,510
- Okay.
- So Yeong, gather all of Sonó's sample photos.

559
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,320
Why do you need the sample photos?

560
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,650
If we use our brand name and tell them who we are, they are sure to have prejudice.

561
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,530
Instead, let's send the invitations with the photos of our clothing.

562
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,460
Let them decide if they'll come to the show or not after looking at the clothes.

563
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,230
Okay.

564
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,380
Then everyone work hard. I'm going to go recruit someone.

565
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

566
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,450
Seon Joo, check the invitations again.

567
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,460
- I'll go to the development room and then directly to you, okay?
- Okay.

568
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,950
- What invitations?
- For the buyer show.

569
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,350
They said Chief Go decided to support them.

570
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,270
Chief Go did?

571
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,620
- Good shot.
- You signed off on it.

572
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,340
Yes.

573
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,150
Your must feel a lot of responsibility.

574
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,240
You decided after weighing all the factors, right?

575
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,000
I will make sure to take care to reduce risk.

576
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,820
Birdie.

577
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,390
Stop! Everyone, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

578
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,050
You haven't released the budget yet, right?

579
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,490
I did, just now.

580
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,630
Hey, the invitations.

581
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,270
It will take time to send out the invitations, right? Let's be careful.

582
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,420
I've already sent them via email. It's the digital age.

583
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,920
Gosh, they're doing their work so well...

584
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,860
You haven't started the set design yet, right?

585
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,300
Don't do it. Don't do it. Stop!

586
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,200
Oh, it's already done.

587
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,960
Everything is falling into place so well, isn't it?

588
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,780
Don't laugh, don't laugh!

589
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,620
Honey, Ji Min's dad,

590
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,440
did I hear correctly?

591
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,710
We must have heard wrong.

592
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,520
I'm not using difficult words, so why are you hearing it wrong?

593
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,250
Jeon Mi Sook, please be a model for our show.

594
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,780
The clothing came out really well.

595
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,170
You'll have to wear them for us and make them shine.

596
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,760
These crazy women.

597
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,070
My size came back to being a model fit just in time.

598
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,890
The timing is incredible! Why not? I should do it!

599
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,080
Ah, seriously.

600
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,560
Hey, you guys look forward to it. I can walk really well.

601
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,820
Hey, you're going to be wearing this while walking!

602
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,930
Since you're going to be wearing clothes like this and walking, you should practice your walk first.

603
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,670
I should practice a little, shouldn't I?

604
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,390
- You're too old-fashioned.
- True. Kids these days are different.

605
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,860
Thank you, Yeong Eun.

606
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,410
I didn't know that Mi Sook would like it that much.

607
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,130
You will host this show for us, right?

608
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,860
Just try to decline.

609
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,790
- I definitely won't overlook my anger and my friend's sadness.
- Excuse me?

610
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,620
The reason you put in your resignation and are at Mi Sook's side now is because you feel sorry for her.

611
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,390
Of course I feel sorry. I'm thankful and shameless...

612
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,610
I find people who only show things through words the most annoying.

613
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,840
Do it through your actions! Show it with your body!

614
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,930
How can we know and feel your heart? Are you a transparent human?

615
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,640
Anyway, I have a lot of things that I want to say,

616
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,300
but for Mi Sook, I won't say them because I'm a third party. Just know that.

617
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,250
You have to come host this show no matter what, Senior Manager Gwak.

618
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,170
Or else I'll just–

619
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,520
I'll assume that we will be working together.

620
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,060
Did you get kicked out by Mom?

621
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,400
Kicked out? That house is in my name.

622
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,780
Then what brings you here?

623
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,590
My legs hurt. Open the door.

624
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,540
Is your dad over there?

625
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,120
This human hasn't come home for two days.

626
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,820
Don't worry. He's here.

627
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,140
Got it.

628
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,860
I was already planning on taking over some fruit. Sleep.

629
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,880
Where did you sleep yesterday?

630
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,390
I have countless classmates

631
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,000
who are alone because they got divorced or were bereaved.

632
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,260
After saying you wouldn't give her anything,

633
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,510
it looks like you're giving her the house.

634
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,020
Give what? As if.

635
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,570
Then why did you come out?

636
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,820
Actions that I've done without thinking

637
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,310
made your mother tired and sad.

638
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,980
It's not like I can tell her to get out.

639
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,480
Divorce Mom, Dad.

640
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,880
What?

641
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,750
To us, they seem like really insignificant reasons,

642
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,100
but that makes them all the more upsetting.

643
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,430
That those insignificant things were so difficult.

644
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,740
Did I do it intentionally?

645
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,550
Did I do it on purpose?

646
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,020
Since Mom loves you,

647
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,790
she's asking for a divorce in order to not hate you more.

648
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,690
Exactly whose side are you on?

649
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,300
As for you, break up with that guy.

650
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,630
In Ha Taek Soo's life, there are no failures. In work or love.

651
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,790
You love Mom too.

652
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,130
That's why you aren't going back in the house for her.

653
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,320
What about love...

654
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,170
Why is your face getting red?

655
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,660
What are you talking about? I have to watch the news.

656
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,920
<i>Crime through romance scams is getting increasingly worse.</i>

657
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,160
<i>Recently, cryptocurrency is even used as a new method...</i>

658
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,670
Why? Why would Sonó, a non-designer brand, have a buyer show?

659
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,930
Is that what you're saying?

660
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,730
I didn't say that yet.

661
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,160
It's a new form of show combining an event and fashion film.
<i>(Fashion film: short videos made by fashion brands and businesses with the intent to advertise products.)</i>

662
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,050
It would be great if you would work with us.

663
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,250
The Parisians won't respond, and time just keeps passing.

664
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,340
"At this rate, will this project end without my being able to try anything?"

665
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,180
"If this is the last day I'm given, what will I do?"

666
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,420
"What do I have to do?" are what I thought.

667
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,780
And your conclusion is?

668
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:28,050
I want to make the clothes that I like and work with the person I like.

669
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,120
That's all for now.

670
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,340
So when should I start work?

671
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,150
Immediately, right now.

672
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,750
You really are just doing whatever you want, however you want.

673
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,190
That's because you're the only man in the world whom I can whine to.

674
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:51,260
Yoon Jae Gook, I can do that to you, right?

675
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,290
Whenever you want.

676
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,540
As much as you want.

677
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:25,340
All right! Since this stage's equipment and technological aspects are very experimental, everyone should stay on their toes!

678
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,400
- Yes!
- Okay, good.

679
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,790
Senior Manager! Are you back?

680
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,270
Senior Manager, I knew you would come back!

681
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,730
Why are you only coming back now?

682
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,300
It's really great that you're back.

683
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,030
All right! A welcome round of applause, everyone!

684
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,620
Things progressed this far because I lost my mind for a bit,

685
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,060
but I have to control the risks.

686
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,420
Are there fallback measures planned out?

687
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,580
Fallback measures?

688
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,410
Is there a guarantee that the clothing will sell well just because you held a show?

689
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,690
What if inventory just piles up because we made so much recklessly?

690
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,110
The stock will become a loss.

691
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,510
We will receive orders in real time, on location from buyers.

692
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,470
We will only produce as much as we receive.

693
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,950
What if orders don't come in?

694
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,520
We will have to make the clothes prettily and well to prevent that from happening.

695
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,670
How many buyers said they were coming?

696
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,140
Call a lot to start, since we don't know how many will buy.

697
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,480
I have a concept meeting.

698
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,750
Your size shrunk again.

699
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,930
Hey, we will measure the size later. Look at this walking first.

700
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,980
We have to measure size first.

701
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,400
After taking measurement...

702
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,090
The concept is urban secret garden.

703
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:49,950
So make that big studio into a city? With a garden?

704
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,830
With this budget?

705
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,580
With a white wall that feels architectural and structural.

706
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,890
For the highlight, special effects should go in, right?

707
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,560
Extravagantly without holding back.

708
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,120
Ah, headache... Senior Manager Gwak, you say something.

709
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,230
Director Hwang, is it all right if we find a sponsor for the jewelry?

710
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,430
The limited edition piece where only three exist domestically.

711
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,680
- Ah, shoes too?
- Yes.

712
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,790
Ah, my heart...

713
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,730
Since we will be doing the live and fashion film at the same time,

714
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,410
please carefully select skilled professionals in this field.

715
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,320
You know I don't work with amateurs.

716
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,690
Nutritional supplements... I think I need nutritional supplements.

717
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,260
- I'll fully mobilize my connections.
- Okay, let's make it happen.

718
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,860
Sorry, I made you alter it so much.

719
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,750
You are sorry about everything.

720
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,210
Fixing it, ripping it out, and fixing it again is my job.

721
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,040
Hey, you should stop losing weight.

722
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,090
Hey, look at her. She is probably 3 kilograms lighter than me.

723
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,870
I guess I need to work harder.

724
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,030
- Forget it.
- You're enough right now!

725
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,520
Hey, my poses are too old, aren't they? Something like this?

726
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,370
So these days, don't hold your angle so sharply, but make it a little more... how should I say it?

727
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,610
By the way, when are you going to Paris?

728
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,310
She's working quite hard for someone going to Paris.

729
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,160
She said she's not going.

730
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,220
She said she's not going?

731
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,040
What about you then?

732
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,370
Right?

733
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,170
What should I do?

734
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,210
I saw the reference too.

735
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,400
Try walking.

736
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,340
Ji Min's dad!

737
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,600
So pretty!

738
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,460
Do you like it?

739
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,530
Of course, it's so pretty.

740
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,800
<i>How... do I break up?</i>

741
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,820
<i>[Yoon Soo Wan]</i>

742
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,000
<i>Hyung,</i>

743
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,230
<i>do you hate it that much?</i>

744
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,270
<i>Ha Yeong Eun and I...</i>

745
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,390
<i>are we really not meant to be?</i>

746
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,010
<i>[Yoon Soo Wan]</i>

747
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,580
Senior Manager, they are almost done getting dressed.

748
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,160
After you check their order, we'll go straight to rehearsal.

749
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,470
Yes, understood. The rehearsal will start soon!

750
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,940
Okay!

751
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,470
- Mom!
- Ji Min! You shouldn't run around!

752
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,820
- How does Mom look?
- Pretty!

753
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,960
My hair is cool, isn't it?

754
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,050
If we just start with these three people, that should be good...

755
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,550
- Hello.
- Hello, Assistant Manager Seo!

756
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,230
I'll leave it to you to confirm.

757
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,120
Ji Min, say hi! She's an auntie that's close to your dad!

758
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,710
Hi, Ji Min.

759
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,670
So you're Ji Min, you look pretty!

760
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,660
Gwak Ji Min, you should greet her. Loudly.

761
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,090
Hello.

762
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:47,970
Hi. Handshake?

763
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,460
Hey, Assistant Manager Seo.

764
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,870
I know you're busy, but could you watch Ji Min for a second?

765
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,880
Oh, of course...

766
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,830
Don't worry, and please focus on the show.

767
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,830
Thank you.

768
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,820
Ji Min, do you want to come with me and watch what your mom will do?

769
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,590
Let's go.

770
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,930
- You've worked hard, Team Leader.
- Thanks.

771
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,380
- The lighting set up is going well, yes?
- Yes.

772
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,530
Alright, our camera team and sound team have no issues, correct?

773
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,420
Show me the moving shot one time.

774
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,340
Jeon Mi Sook, it is your turn for fitting!

775
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,490
Got it!

776
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,290
Ready.

777
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,610
Be sure to maintain your spacing.

778
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,730
Good.

779
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,330
I'll leave the time check to you.

780
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,660
How is the connection rate?

781
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,650
It's under 20 percent. None of the big buyers showed up yet.

782
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,760
I'm going to lose it.

783
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,360
Time check, time check.

784
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,780
Team Leader Ha, a characteristic of the live show is that buyers can come in right in the middle.

785
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,010
- Yes.
- Just in case, I sent the mass email again,

786
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,420
asking them to please attend since the show starts in 20 minutes.

787
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,270
- And the fittings?
- We're all good after you do the last check.
