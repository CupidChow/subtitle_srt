<i>The start of 42 trillion won traces back to when the desire is recognized.</i>

Wearing bold styles by using neon colors like chartreuse or leather on leather

shows people's mentality of wanting to break out of harsh reality.

So Yeong, you can take care of the basic T-shirts, and you can take care of the dress.

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,030
All right, let's begin this emergency meeting.

46
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,710
Here are the sales rankings from 1st to 13th place from the top 3 department stores.

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,480
In the young casual zone, Ether is third place like last month.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,950
In the career zone, Lamong went up from fifth to fourth place.

49
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,460
And Sonó lost its first place for the first time.

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,010

<i>about how there weren't enough of this season's ethnic blouse.</i>

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,750
<i>So we definitely put the order in with the factory.</i>

<i>Director Hwang forgot to pay for it and went to Busan, so the clothes weren't made.</i>

Team Leader Ha, how will you handle this?

64
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,700
It's just been a week.

65
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,070
The difference between us and the first place spot is only 0.8%.

66
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,950
Does 0.8% not count as a decrease?

67
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,020
This is why you lost out on the deal with Olivier. It's because of your complacent attitude!

68
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,150
That's why you should've waited until I got there.

69
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,410
It happened without your knowledge, Director Hwang?

70
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,830
Team Leader Ha, are you unaware of your own position?

71
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,870
We put you in that spot so you could work hard.

72
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,260
Who said you could do whatever you want?

73
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,960
We couldn't pay what they wanted.

74
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,000
The royalty proposed by Viace was 3 times The One's.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,730
If we wanted to outdo that, we'd have to at least double it.

76
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,510
That would be 6 times the original royalty we proposed.

77
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,690
Chief, can you handle that?

78
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,750
So you're saying you didn't lose it, you let go of it?

79
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,680
They also asked for control over business decisions and the rights to the design.

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,990
That means they'd also be in charge of distributing profits.

81
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,220
That just means we would be collaborating while volunteering our skills and gaining nothing.

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,790
- Do we have any reason to do it?
- Listen, Team Leader Ha!

83
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,150
"I'm sorry." "It's because I'm incompetent." Just one word from you would have ended this.

84
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,890
How dare you talk back!

85
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,190
All I did was present you with the evidence for my decision.

86
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,890
Since you're so smart and you like evidence, let's hear it.

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,700
The 30th founding anniversary event is in two days.

88
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,100
It just so happens that Lucia is also hosting a large show at the same time as us.

89
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,280
All of the domestic brands already complain about how they have no place in the fashion industry.

90
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,990
So how are we expected to promote this if we don't even have Olivier?

So Yeong, were you able to confirm the recruit?

96
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,900
Yes, thank you.

97
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,720
Yes, it's all done.

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,180
Okay.

99
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,140
Okay, you check their height, weight, and size.

100
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,040
As soon as I'm done checking, I'll create their outfits.

101
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,530
One outfit is worth 10 million won. Make sure they hashtag The One.

102
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,190
Is it guaranteed that dressing them will have the marketing effect that we intend?

103

These are influencers who have amassed over 300,000 followers on average.

Even if there are overlapping followers,

105
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,250
we can still expect to have advertised to over 1,600,000 people overall.

106
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,050
Are you saying we're going to proceed with this event with those small fry?

107
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,170
We need at least one big shot like Olivier to—

108
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,690
The wannabe icon for women, Hye Rin.

109
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,620
She's the main celebrity for this event.

110
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,890
I heard Lucia gives invitation letters inside their new wallets.

111
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,020
This is so fitting for a domestic brand. How senseless of them.

112
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,700
But, still, this is their main clothing line.

113
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,810
They're giving you priority, too.

114
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,190
Who said it's the main?

115
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,020
I have to wear it for it to become the main.

116
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,950
Whatever. Just tell them to resend 20 sets from their new season with 20 pairs of matching shoes and 10 purses.

117
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,180
Well, if you take all of those, what will the others wear?

118
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,100
Make sure nobody will wear any of the clothes' other colors.

119
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,590
I absolutely hate those who wear the same style as me in different colors.

120
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,900
Anything else you'd like to tell me?

121
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,480
We'll end it here.

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,450
Team Leader Ha, I need to speak with you.

123
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,360
This is why you shouldn't be so good at everything.

124
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,030
He favors you because you're good, but he also feels threatened because you're good.

125
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,870
That is the duality of a group owner.

126
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,670
Signing off on payments is always a hassle.

127
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,090
They already did it well on their own, but they insist on the facade of process.

128
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,920
You already know when to speak up and when to hide,

129
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
so why did you do it?

130
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,630
To overturn the situation or not,

131
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,070
you needed to have Chi Sook handle it.

132
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,490
Chi Sook has her own tasks to do, and so do you.

133
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,120
I did not think that far.

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,880
At the 30th founding anniversary, make sure Chi Sook plays her designated role.

135
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,180
I'll make sure it happens flawlessly.

136
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,690
Director Hwang is entering.

Is it time for one-on-one talks already? What is there to discuss alre—

138
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,620
He didn't say he didn't like you the other day.

139
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,940
Did you make plans to meet him again?

Well, I'll handle whom I spend the rest of my life wi—

141
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,110
It doesn't seem like you don't have feelings for him, so keep it up.

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,550

146
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,280

<i> I'll be going up to Seoul on Monday.</i>

150
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,520
<i> Hope you have a nice vacation.</i>

151
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,570
<i> I arrive in the morning.</i>

152
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,400
<i> - I didn't ask.
- I'll be at Sate Hotel.</i>

153
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,730
<i> I didn't ask for that either.</i>

154
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,690
<i> I don't have anything else scheduled, so I'll be very free.</i>

155
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,610
<i> I have roaming enabled, so my number is the same, too.</i>

156
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,160
<i>Aren't you going to tell me your room number?</i>

157
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,550
<i> Ah, that's too much.</i>

158
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,720
That man... I guess he liked you a lot.

159
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,870
It's not hard to like me.

160
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,990
That must be nice. Thanks to you, the problem just got bigger.

161
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,700
It seems like the CEO is going to check on this himself. What are you going to do?

162
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,720
Do you expect me to tell the truth right now or start a long distance relationship?

163
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,530
That is for people who are full of energy.

164
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,970
We are not talking about Seoul to Ilsan. He's from Paris!

165
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,450
Oh my god. Would I ever even hold his hand?

166
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,430
I'm going to take that as you've given me permission to settle that matter on my end.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,050
Why don't you use that brain for your work?

168
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,750
Well, it's because something that should have already ended in Busan is still in progress.

169
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,630
It's not like you.

170
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,920
Why don't you ask him yourself?

171
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,510
The secretary's office should have his number.

172
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,720
They said it's waterproof, but it smudges whenever I yawn.

173
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,460
Forget that.

174
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,970
I'm working out-of-office.

175
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,490
<i>[Yoon Jae Gook]</i>

176
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,640
<i>I'm free until Friday.</i>

177
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,470
- Who is it?
- What?

178
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,660
<i>[Manager Nam Na Ri]</i>

179
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,260
Hello?

180
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,720
- Did you borrow from loan sharks?
- Just recruiting inquiries for next season.

181
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
Wow, imagine not having to go around asking for work. I'm jealous.

182
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,860
Honestly, when you first said you wanted to get into photography,

183
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,360
who knew it would've turned out like this?

184
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,590
The golden age is temporary.

185
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,190
Make lots of money while people seek you out.

186
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm not sure if it's a good thing that many people seek me.

187
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,220
It's good to be known, but that means my work will become more common.

188
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,630
There is always someone who will recognize good artwork.

189
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,800
<i>You take better photos than I thought.</i>

190
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,540
<i>I really like your photos.</i>

191
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,120
- Yes, Senior Manager?
- <i> What should we do? Hye Rin is saying she'll go to Lucia.</i>

192
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,250
What? She already received her pay, so what are you talking about?

193
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,450
Are you able to reach Hye Rin's manager right now?

194
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,880
I'll be right there.

195
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,390
- This isn't the direction of the hotel.
- This is an emergency. I have to go to the company first.

196
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,600
I told you I'm busy. I have to meet someone!

197
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,970
That's why we're going to the person you have to meet right now.

198
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,480
You're The One's director, so put some pressure on them to do a good job.

199
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,280
Can't you just take care of those difficult matters yourself?

200
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,310
- I'll just get off over there.
- Please stop the car.

201
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,740
- CEO Seok Do Hoon?
- Yes, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun?

202
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,520
Just wait here. I'll get this settled right away and then drop you off.

203
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,220
Yes, did Manager Kim arrive? Okay!

204
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,960
I've already explained that we've already gotten our pay and talks are finalized.

205
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,490
But she is throwing a fit saying how can she dare to wear a domestic brand

206
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,940
when all those who are less popular than her are going to Lucia.

207
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,480
I feel like I'm going to die, too.

208
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,830
Senior Manager, you already sent the full invitation list to The One, right?

209
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,920
The fitting starts tomorrow.

210
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,940
Okay, on top of pay, we'll also prepare gift cards.

211
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,390
She can be the last one at the photo wall.

212
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,950
She'll also ride the best possible limousine.

213
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,680
We'll also post additional bodyguards.

214
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,620
Yes, well I'll try to convince her again,

215
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,260
but you know what Hye Rin is like.

216
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,760
The headline copy for the press coverage will be

217
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,860
"She shows conviction by choosing to wear a domestic brand while everyone goes to Lucia. Thoughtful Celebrity Hye Rin!"

218
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,200
That's what the title will be.

219
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,130
Rather than being a part of the crowd by going to Lucia,

220
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,850
I think this will be way more impressive.

221
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,660
I think Hye Rin will like that.

222
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,210
We have 17 hours until the fitting starts. Please.

223
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,520
I ask this of you.

224
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,930
Alright, please see him out now.

225
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,020
This way, please.

226
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,400
Did I go overboard with the gift cards?

227
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,820
Gosh, my blood sugar level is dropping.

228
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,130
I'm saying I've come to see CEO Seok Do Hoon.

229
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,240
You're seeing him right now.

230
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,680
Vision PR's CEO Seok Do Hoon.

231
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,760
Yes, that's me. For your information, I'm the only Seok Do Hoon at Vision PR.

232
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,690
Yeong Eun, what did this person just say?

233
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,420
Director Hwang, you must be mistaken.

234
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,310
This is CEO Seok Do Hoon.

235
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,880
Stop messing with me.

236
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,600
Me? I'm messing with you?

237
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,450
No, no... it wasn't this face.

238
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,180
Seok Do Hoon isn't of this quality.

239
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,470
Team Leader Ha, must my existence bear such injustice just because I messed up on recruiting a celebrity?

240
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm really so upset.

241
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,430
I think Director Hwang is just mistaken. Director.

242
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:46,120
Hold on. Seok Do Hoon isn't supposed to... have this kind of face.

243
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,830
No, but why? I'm fine with it. Why?

244
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,750
Director.

245
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,720
Oh! That's it.

246
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,570
That high nose bridge.

247
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,330
That side profile.

248
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,220
It was just like that.

249
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,350
We can take our time talking while we drink coffee.

250
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,480
Is there Americano?

251
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,510
Is this fate?

252
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,360
It seems that fated people can't help but meet again.

253
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,650
I guess that's true.

254
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,080
We meet again like this.

255
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,150
How are you going to handle this?

256
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,790
Ah, I'll make sure everything goes back to how it should be.

257
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,200
Seems like you're in a difficult situation.

258
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,680
Not yet.

259
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,110
By the way, aren't you supposed to be in Paris right now? How are you here?

260
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm here for personal work.

261
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,150
Oh, work. What kind of work do you do?

262
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,640
Photography.

263
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,050
- Photos.
- Oh, you're a photographer! I love photos too.

264
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,720
When you just look at them, photos of beautiful nature really are healing.

265
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,370
- I do fashion photography.
- Of course, if you take photos, it better be of fashion!

266
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,270
About recruiting Hye Rin, please take care of it without a problem.

267
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,160
We aren't done talking though, Team Leader Ha.

268
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,730
She's saying we're not done talking yet.

269
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,210
Yes, she is. I guess we need to settle things.

270
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,120
Although this may be baffling, shall I introduce you?

271
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,840
This is Yoon Jae Gook, the son of your father's acquaintance.

272
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,550
This is Director Hwang Chi Sook.

273
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,990
Hey, my dad knows many of his acquaintances' sons.

274
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,190
He knows someone whose son is in Paris... Oh, my!

275
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,510
Oh, this is crazy!

276
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,980
So this is how you want go about this.

277
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,540
A lighting attack to resolve things.

278
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,240
I have a lot of things to do.

279
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,580
Yes, Nam Na Ri?

280
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,290
Since the situation is resolved, just proceed as before.

281
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,190
See you tomorrow.

282
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,830
Yes? Hello.
<i>(in French)</i>

283
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,400
Yes, Mother?

284
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,020
Hello, this is Seok Do Hoon.

285
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,010
Do you always leave after saying what you came to say?

286
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,310
I want to prevent further useless misunderstandings.

287
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,000
But I haven't said anything yet.

288
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,720
Why are you getting so ahead of yourself?

289
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,300
I didn't ask you out or propose to you.

290
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,490
I haven't asked anything of you yet.

291
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,080
- Which way are you going?
- Why?

292
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,670
So I can go in the opposite direction.

293
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,530
<i>[Mother]</i>

294
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,420
You should have come home right away.

295
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,080
I have hotel reservations.

296
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,650
Did your blind date go well?

297
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,610
Since you can't judge a person from just one meeting,

298
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,300
you should make some time to meet her again even if you're busy.

299
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,000
I told you to stop making such arrangements for me.

300
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,350
I don't have anyone by my side.

301
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,190
Less than three years after your father died, your older brother died too.

302
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,420
I'd just like to see you have a family, at least.

303
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,840
You should have been like this to Hyung too.

304
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,960
If you allowed him to live with the woman he loved, he might still be alive.

305
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,200
I'll be there on the day of the anniversary.

306
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,760
He must be your son.

307
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,830
Ah, yes.

308
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,580
Is he the son who lives in France?

309
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,410
<i>So there is one! I thought all of them were taken,</i>

318
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,480
He lives in France apparently.

319
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
It's so lucky.

320
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,890
Someone would've taken him away if he lived here still.

321
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,630
If he couldn't find anyone there either, doesn't that mean there is something really wrong with him?

322
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,000
What about you? Are you just so well-off with no problems that you're like this?

323
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,420
It looks great. It suits you well!

324
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,370
Your daughter made a good choice for you.

325
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,920
My daughter works at a fashion company. She's the team leader for design.

326
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,690
No wonder, she has a great eye.

327
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,370
It's not just her good eye. She's smart and great at what she does.

328
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,820
I don't envy any other household's children.

329
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,150
Would you like me to wrap this up for you?

330
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,570
It's a hassle to try on multiple sets.

331
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,120
Are you going to buy an outfit worth millions of won just to wear it once?

332
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,170
Think of how hard she'll have to work, will you?

333
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,830
What do you mean just for a day?

334
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,260
I'll wear this when I meet Yeong Eun's future husband,

335
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,360
at her kid's first birthday, and even on your 70th birthday.

336
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,000
- What would you like to do?
- We'll buy it.

337
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,060
Hey, it's too expensive!

338
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,350
What does it matter? This is for Dad's retirement ceremony.

339
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,830
I'm his only daughter. Am I not allowed to do this?

340
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,950
Your daughter can at least afford this, Mom.

341
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,230
Oh, you're so lucky.

342
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,530
I'll pay for it in interest-free, three monthly installments.

343
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm in the red next month, too.

344
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,780
What can I do?

345
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,680
Fulfilling my parents' expectations of a well-off daughter is also one of my roles.

346
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,580
Oh, why is there so much I have to pay for?

347
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,800
The money coming in is tiny. The money going out is terrifying.

348
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,660
Your dad must have raised his shoulders sky-high.

349
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,200
Anyway, it's so great of you to pay off all of your father's debt.

350
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,650
There's still some house loans left.

351
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,920
The bank still owns the porch and the bathroom.

352
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,210
There's not much time left until your dad's retirement ceremony, right?

353
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,950
I'll be the family breadwinner soon.

354
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,980
So I have to hang in there no matter what.

355
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,020
I need to make sure nothing goes wrong with the event in two days, too.

356
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,550
My promotion depends on it.

357
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,460
Hey, your groans at this hour of the night are embarrassing.

358
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,300
You age more as you get lazier.

359
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Then how diligently am I living right now?

360
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,800
Hey, let's hang up. I need to take care of myself if I'm to last.

361
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,370
You lead such an exhausting life.

362
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,020
What can I do?

363
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,000
It's a vicious world where if a designer gets old or gains weight,

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,820
they immediately say you have lost your touch.

365
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,690
I praise your ability to be so hard working,

366
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,490
but leave some room in your heart, okay?

367
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,610
You never know. A worthwhile man might fill it up.

368
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,490
Oh, quit it. Even without a man, my life is

369
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,490
full of cellulite that starts invading if I let down my guard for a moment.

370

00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,120
That's just unrealistic.

456
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,330
Jeong Yoon Gi's schedule is already fully booked.

457
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,620
And he's not someone who can just come

458
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,790
when I ask him to come.

459
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh, so it can't be done?

460
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,820
Then, I can't wear it.

461
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,030
Hey, Hye Rin.

462
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,090
I'm a pro at this, too.

463
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,430
I'm valued for my good eye,

464
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,970
so I can't just wear anything.

465
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,400
I thought you promised yesterday that it would all be neatly settled.

466
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,790
Team Leader Ha, the preparations for tomorrow's event are going well, right?

467
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,230
Yes, the fitting is going on right now.

468
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,090
The higher ups have already been informed that Hye Rin will be there. Make sure it happens no matter what.

469
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,860
She's trying to change the design.

470
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,160
It's not something I can't fix on my end.

471
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,000
She's still there, right? Just keep her there for now.

472
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,210
I've got no energy. My blood sugar level is dropping.

473
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,000
You said we'd eat lunch together, yet you're eating the appetizer first by yourself?

474
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,330
Ah, lunch, right. I'm sorry.

475
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,650
We can't eat together. You're fine with eating alone, right?

476
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,330
What about the matter from yesterday? Did it get resolved well?

477
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,370
Nope. It looks like it's about to start now.

478
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,430
The sleeves should go up to here. And this, to here.

479
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,250
Did you write it down?

480
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,010
Classic is the concept Sonó is aiming for right now.

481
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,690
Then, put it on a mannequin.

482
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,650
I wear things in my own style.

483
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,820
It would be difficult make alterations as it would change our design.

484
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,770
Does putting designer on your business card make you a designer?

485
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,470
Honestly, who wears domestic brands like these nowadays?

486
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,220
If it wasn't for the contracts that my company signed, I would never wear them either.

487
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,440
It's embarrassing.

488
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,940
It's embarrassing?

489
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,890
What makes you so great?

490
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,760
If I wasn't so great, why would you guys be here doing this?

491
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,880
- What?
- If you don't want to alter it, then don't.

492
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,330
I just won't wear it then.

493
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,440
We've done QC seven, eight times just to make that one jacket,

494
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,990
and thrown away yards of fabric to adjust the location of the pocket by 1 mm.

495
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,270
There's a whole lot of time, effort, and people

496
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,170
that went into making those clothes that you threw down.

497
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,430
Doesn't everyone put in at least that much effort to earn a living?

498
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,280
Why are you whining about that to me?

499
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,300
Manager Nam.

500
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,650
Team Leader.

501
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,630
Stop and apologize.

502
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,730
- Team Leader.
- Apologize.

503
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm sorry.

504
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,460
I accept your apology, so now tell me you'll fix it.

505
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,470
I didn't pay for my 1,000,000 followers, you know?

506
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,530
I'm not abusing my power or making a scene.

507
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,480
I'm just taking responsibility for my job and doing my best, too.

508
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,290
I'm sorry.

509
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,860
I won't be able to continue with the fitting anymore because I have another appointment.

510
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,960
You can send a picture when the design has been adjusted.

511
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,460
I'll decide whether I'll wear it or not after I take a look.

512
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,560
There will be no alterations to the design.

513
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,200
Then, I won't do it either.

514
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,320
I'll talk to CEO Seok about getting a jewelry sponsorship with Cartier.

515
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,940
One of the three limited edition pieces in Korea.

516
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,800
Let's compromise here.

517
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,390
Did I hear that correctly?

518
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,320
Tell me so.

519
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,650
She said it's a Cartier limited edition.

520
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,990
Only three exist in Korea.

521
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,960
Oh, I'm drained of energy.

522
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,720
It's okay. You can do it.

523
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,620
Without the alteration I want, there will not be a compromise.

524
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,070
Send the picture by tonight, or else I won't wear it.

525
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,140
Hye Rin, if you leave like this, we can't help but feel hurt.

526
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,250
Let's talk reasonably and rationally. Okay, Hye Rin?

527
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,750
I'm sorry. The way she acted just... crushed my pride.

528
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:21,500
For our collection, we've made 32 sets... so a total of 64 pieces, right?

529
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,440
Na Ri, you've been running around since last year trying to get the fabric.

530
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,620
Seon Joo and So Yeong, you were turned down by fairs and shop managers.

531
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,830
You stayed up every night for two months to alter and alter again.

532
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,710
But no matter how well we made these clothes,

533
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,270
there is no meaning if they are piled up unsold at stores.

534
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,240
I didn't bow my head to Hye Rin because I wanted to dress her in these clothes.

535
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,880
It's because by dressing her, hundreds of thousands of people

536
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,610
can recognize your hard work and skills.

537
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,210
If people wear our clothes and realize,

538
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,440
"Ah, this is great. They made it so well. It's pretty."

539
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,750
Then that's good enough.

540
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,180
That's our pride.

541
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,450
Hye Rin asked for alterations, but we won't do that.

542
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,030
So even though it's late, we will look into recruiting other celebrities.

543
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,170
- So Yeong, bring your phone and follow me.
- Okay.

I'm Manager Nam Na Ri from The One.

547
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,930
- Yes, yes, yes.
- I'd like to speak to Lee Hye In.

548
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,870
- You're not free? I see.
- I was wondering what Tae In's schedule is like tomorrow?

549
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,450
We were caught up in a situation.

551
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,840
Oh, the true celebrity is you, La Ra.

552
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,120
You can't even call that an event without you.

553
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,270
You're not a fill-in. There was a mistake in the logistics. Cartier's limited edition?

554
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,860
You'll consider it if we gift you that precious one of the three that exist in Korea?

555
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,310
Oh, she's not falling for it.

556
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,850
Hi, I was wondering about Yeo Ji Yoon's schedule.

557
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,660
It's Ha Yeong Eun. How have you been?

558
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,260
Oh, you're in New York.

559
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,830
It's Ha Yeong Eun from The One. Do you remember me?

560
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,090
Yoo Na?

561

It's an unknown artist's work.

591
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,860
The exposure is a mess, and the composition isn't good either.

592
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,830
You can immediately tell that the photographer is an amateur.

593
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,360
There is lens flare from the streetlights.

594

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,330
<i>What if the CEO finds out about this?</i>

609
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,880
<i>We're not there to mingle with celebrities tomorrow.</i>

610
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,160
<i>You're there as the junior of the design team, to assist your seniors and learn directly.</i>

611
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,610
<i>You can do that for me instead.</i>

612
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,170
<i>- Chi Sook.
- This is why my dad paid for your overseas tuition.</i>

613
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,940
<i>Otherwise, how would you have been able to study fashion abroad in Paris for three years?</i>

614
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,200
<i>That was the money I received to help you study, and I already did more than enough in return.</i>

615
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,780
<i>I never slept more than three hours because I was doing all your homework.</i>

616
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,660
<i>You must be quite skilled then.</i>

617
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,710
<i>So just keep doing well, okay, Yeong Eun?</i>

618
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,890
I'm afraid that I'll go back to that time

619
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,900
and end up in a hopeless situation again. That's why.

620
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,170
Although a callus takes a long time to form,

621
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,730
you can get scratched in an instant.

622
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,850
That's why I'm charging forward with all my strength.

623
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,390
But doesn't it get hard when you try your best yet no one acknowledges it?

624
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,920
Everyone says that only the designers who create their own brands are amazing,

625
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,850
but those of us who create under a company name have 12 fairs in a year.

626
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,880
- We've never made the same clothes twice.
- I know.

627
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,030
I take photos for countless fashion shows and magazine covers in a year.

628
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,680
If a superior orders for clothes that sold well in the summer

629
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,060
to be sold again in the winter with longer sleeves, it'd be profitable.

630
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,560
But then they shouldn't be designers.

631
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,630
Oh, of course. Creators have their own pride, after all.

632
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,110
It's a job losing its popularity,

633
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:24,480
and although people may not know that people like me exist, it's fine.

634
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,420
What is there to prove to others?

635
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,810
I can just prove my worth to myself.

636
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,230
You were cool in Busan,

637
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,160
and you're cool here, too.

638
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,540
Yes, Na Ri? No updates on Shin Yoo Jeong yet?

639
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,470
Alright.

640
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,830
Let's not waste our time feeding useless hope. Let's go.

641
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,550
I need to go back to the office and confirm some things for the event.

642
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,220
Can you help me?

643
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,340
It's a precious set.

644
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,870
Oh! It'll drag on the floor.

645
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,970
This is not what I expected when I decided to come all the way to Korea.

646
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,220
I started getting frozen shoulder after holding my phone for too long.

647
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,560
And you said that you don't have much going on, and that you're free.

648
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,190
I meant that I'm only available for Ha Yeong Eun.

649
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,500
If I had heard that a long time ago, my heart would've fluttered.

650
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,990
Why not now?

651
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,850
Because you were my boss's blind date.

652
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,390
Me at this age, with a man whom my superior chose for his son-in-law?

653
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,890
Our industry is tiny, so rumors would spread like wildfire.

654
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,660
I'd have to leave my job.

655
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,260
Because of the rumors, there wouldn't be anywhere to go.

656
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,700
I don't want to go through any of that.

657
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,520
In your reasons for not wanting to, I'm not included, right?

658
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,820
My hormones did react.

659
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:57,560
But a movie ending that's been spoiled is no fun.

660
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,660
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.

661
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,560
Can't you be honest with me just once?

662
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,200
If not now, there'll be no reason for us to see each other again.

663
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,200
It's a shame you're Yoon Jae Gook out of all people.

664
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,020
That's as far as I can go in response.

665
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,520
Will you come to Paris in the spring for fashion week?

666
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,650
If I'm not fired and have endured until then?

667
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,960
Then I guess you can't get fired.

668
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,370

Oh my, nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Chi Sook.

Hey, are you joking right now?

Did you guys just turn me down?

708
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,930
Let's get this straight. We're the ones that got turned down.

709
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:50,290
You contacted me this morning saying you weren't going to attend.

710
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,780
Then how was Shin Yoo Jeong able to attend on such short notice?

711
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,930
Clearly, you were two-timing me!

712
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,970
Two-timing? No. Shin Yoo Jeong just has high standards.

713
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,920
She recognized The One's worth, so knowing she was a fill-in,

714
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,750
willingly and very, very happily, she came all the way over here.

00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,790
At least find a man.

761
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,600
I found one.

762
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,780
There she goes again.

763
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,580
It really made my heart flutter.

764
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:11,220
Those looks, manners, and his physique hidden under his shirt.

765
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,850
You've managed to see under his shirt already?

766
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,620
Were you able to check all his organs too? They're all in place?

767
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,760
If you had slept with him, I would've had to go mourn after your death from overworking your heart.

768
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,580
I want to sleep with him.

769
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,160
You crazy girl.

770
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,820
When he grabbed me,

771
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,500
do you know what I heard?

772
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,550
The sound of my knees cracking.

773
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,570
Stop the botox and move onto cartilage injections now. We're at that age.

774
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,920
It really scared me.

775
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,510
This is what aging means! You know what?

776
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,960
While I'm still a day younger,

777
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,820
I'd like to be touched by someone who really, truly loves me

778
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,880
and touch and hug him back. That's what I'd like to do.

779
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,820
That way, I think I'll be less sorry towards my body.

780
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:03,080
So I'm going to sleep with that man.

781
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,350
I'm going to sleep with him no matter what.

782
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,300
I'm a bit jealous though.

783
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,960
The fact that you still get excited over a man and make such a fuss over it.

784
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,850
That's dangerous of you to say, for someone who has a husband.

785
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,820
A husband is not a man; he's family.

786
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,730
Your spouse is not someone whom you get excited over.

787
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,580
He's someone who makes you feel lonely even though he's there.

788
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:30,290
So enjoy it to the fullest while you can.

789
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,510
<i>Team Leader, today was amazing!</i>

790
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,130
<i>The responses regarding Shin Yoo Jeong are on fire!</i>

791
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,540
<i> Time to become the director and executive next!</i>

792
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,520
<i> - Team Leader, please treat us to something!
- Wow, no way!</i>

793
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,710
<i>Congratulations!</i>

794
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:12,380
<i> Rather than a man, having tangible, material things is more exciting to me.</i>

795
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,120
<i> You're so materialistic.</i>

796
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,080
<i> Those who say money can't buy happiness are usually those without money.</i>

797
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,560
<i>How cruel of you.</i>

798
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,120
<i>Men and love...</i>

799
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,910
<i>To me, those are just our hormones playing pranks.</i>

800
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,560
<i> That breaks my heart.</i>

801
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,720
<i> Hey, I really don't have many years left.</i>

802
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:39,150
<i> During that time, I need to get promoted to prolong my lifespan.</i>

803
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,550
<i> During my 20s, I had no job.</i>

804
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,720
<i>During my 30s, I had no house.</i>

805
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,310
<i> I'm nearly at my forties, yet I have no future.</i>

806
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,030
<i> Life is such a joke.</i>

807
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:01,160
<i> The fatigue from life overtakes my pheromones.</i>

808
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,390
<i> So I'm unable to feel excitement.</i>

809

810
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:24,610
Manager Nam, the samples of the main outfit in other colors are here, right?

811
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,710
While the reactions to Shin Yoo Jeong are big, we need to deliver the photo books to the stores.

812
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,280
So we need to work quickly today.

813
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,630
But, Team Leader, what happened with the photographer?

814
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,610
What do you mean?

815
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:49,490
Mr. Yoon Jae Gook, what are you doing here?

816
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,890
Why? Is something wrong?

817
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,770
No, not really.

818
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,990
I decided to take on this photo shoot.

819
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,940
By any chance,

820
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,140
do you know someone

821
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,370
named Yoon Soo Wan?

00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,130
<i>Or I thought I had forgotten that name,</i>

825
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:02,790
<i>but the name came to me again.</i>

826
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,530
I do.

827
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,180
How do you know him?

828
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,210
<i> My once burning youth.</i>

829
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,880
<i> But a name that met its end.</i>

830
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:25,220
<i> A name I need to let go,</i>

831
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,450
<i> yet I could not let go.</i>

832
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,530
<i>So I...</i>

833
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:36,080
I am in the process of breaking up right now

834
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,170
with that person.

<i>Can I ask how you know him?</i>

837

<i>Can I ask why I need to answer that?</i>

838
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,330
<i>That Mr. Paris is J?</i>

839
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,140
<i>An interview?</i>

840
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,970
<i>She's that Ha Yeong Eun.</i>

841
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,450
<i>Why did I return?</i>

842
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,380
<i>He knows Soo Wan.</i>

843
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,600
<i> What? How does he know him?</i>

844
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,080
<i>What did I want to ask?</i>

845
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,710
<i> He's a photographer who only works with high-end brands.</i>

846
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:57,270
<i> - It'll be the day after tomorrow at 3 PM.
- You don't seem too into it.</i>

<i>Ha Yeong Eun! Ha Yeong Eun!</i>

851
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,350
<i>I'll find out how it happened.</i>

852
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,870
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

853
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,180
<i> - Wrap it up.
- If we get caught that you went on the blind date instead of me at Busan...</i>

854
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,750
<i> - Yeong Eun!
- I'm not the only one who will be called forward.</i>

855
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,510
<i>Show Jae Gook in.</i>

856
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,570
<i>It was hard to build up my reputation, so I'll have to protect it.</i>

857
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,710
<i>Why are you suddenly getting into it?</i>

858
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:23,490
<i>I'm a little interested. There is something I need to find out.</i>

859
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,390
<i> Was the time you spent with me an uncomfortable misunderstanding?</i>

860
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,790
<i> - It was just a happening.
- Was it just a happening between you and Yoon Soo Wan as well?</i>

<i> Aren't you curious about the relationship between me and Yoon Soo Wan?</i>
