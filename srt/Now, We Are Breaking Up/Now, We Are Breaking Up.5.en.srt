I...

69
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,100
missed you.

Whether we should follow the trend or do something new...

74
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,640
Every time we prepare for a new season, it's so hard to make a decision.

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,550
If you wear clothes and makeup based on trends and take photos,

76
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,210
they stay forever as an embarrassing past. You know that, right?

77
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,490
Are you thinking about doing something new?

78
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,850
You are already late if you take the same path as everyone else.

79
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,250
Let's do it in a basic and classic style, how Sonó should be.

80
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,480
Na Ri, check the status of the fabric we ordered.

81
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,770
Seon Joo, check the fabric stock from the previous season.

82
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,690
So Yeong, I talked to the material team about some raw materials.

83
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,530
Can you find out how much we can get?

84
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

85
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,660
Clair Marie said they would do all of it.

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,900
You know that the brand is being launched in a hurry.

87
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,130
The new season is right around the corner. There's no time now to place an order to Italy

88
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,280
and send work to South America to make the clothes.

89
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,520
Sonó had already reserved it six months prior.

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,140
We already talked to the material team, and you signed off on it yourself.

91
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,590
Then, go talk to Director Hwang yourself.

92
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,750
So? What do you need?

93
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,510
Spandex and summer tweed fabric.

94
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,740
We need them to make a matching jacket and skirt set.

95
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,110
Those are going to Clair Marie though.

96
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,250
And what else?

97
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,620
Then... We'll use the gingham seersucker.

98
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,810
The budgeted funds have already been used,

99
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,800
and it's the fabric we said we'd use.

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,820
Having to find a different fabric and adjusting our timeline now

101
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,410
are just not realistic.

102
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,640
Too bad. Clair Marie's going to use that, too.

103
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,820
Director Hwang.

104
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,540
The factory in Paju that Sonó worked with before

105
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,810
will be working with Clair Marie starting this season.

106
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,990
- Chi Sook.
- What's with the serious face?

107
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,550
Over just a mere factory?

108
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,390
Honestly, should you be scared, or should I, the one launching a new brand, be scared?

109
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,640
Isn't it because you are confident that you wouldn't be fazed that you decided to stay at Sonó?

110
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,550
I've known the vice president there for 10 years since he was an assistant manager.

111
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,330
We've learned to work with each other and came this far.

112
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,190
Not you, but The One.

113
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,300
You might think that you were the one going easy on me all this time,

114
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,000
but I went easy on you many times as well.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,430
Fabrics, materials, factories.

116
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,800
Why do you think you did all of that?

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,210
They were possible because I was behind them all.

118
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,490
- So?
- I won't go easy on you from now on.

119
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,560
So on your own without me,

120
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,940
try to beat me with your abilities.

121
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,250
Can I actually?

122
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,280
Is it really okay for me to beat you?

123
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,460
Director, you have a visitor from Vision PR.

124
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,330
Oh, right!

125
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,750
- Hello.

133
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,090
<i> But the one who wants you isn't Team Leader Ha. It's Director Hwang.</i>

134
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,270
<i>It doesn't matter. I've decided to stay in Seoul.</i>

135
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,580
<i> I'll have to work hard to earn money.</i>

136
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,630
It's been a while.

137
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,630
Mr. J has agreed to collaborate with us.

138
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,780
I'll leave you to it.

Your dad's retirement ceremony is in a couple of days, so I'm getting my hair done.

143
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,220
It's time for the neutralization part now, so how can I?

144
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,200
Mom, I'm working right now.

145
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,330
He's just too gullible! That's why!

146
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,110
He left again a moment ago saying he had things to take care of.

147
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,710
It's because I have a bad feeling about it.

148
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,590
<i>Since a while ago, he has been making a big deal</i>

149
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,300
about how he will let me live in leisure once he has retired.

150
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm worried he will lose all of his retirement savings from his interest in investing.

151
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,470
I doubt he'd do something like that again.

152

<i>Well that's why I want you to go!</i>

153
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,520
Find out whom he's meeting and what he's doing.

154
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,660
I'm not in a situation to do that right now, Mom.

155

I'm busy. I'll hang up now.

156

It's not like I have two or three kids.

Good morning, Noona.

Noona, I'm the owner's son.

I'll look too time conscious.

- Sixth.

Yes, a list of good ones.

No, I came alone. Is it very serious?

From the blood work, the tumor marker CA 19-9

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,480
came out very high.

That's why we suggested a CT and a biopsy.

The results show pancreatic cancer.

202

Among pancreatic cancers, this is adenocarcinoma

commonly referred to as glandular cancer.

204

That one time in middle school when you represented your school at a math competition and won the grand prize...

He used to boast so much about you.

255
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,010
- That too was probably my brother.
- What?

256
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,520

I think the gabardine and the tweed will both work,

272
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,050
but the gabardine has a heavy color,

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,450
so let's go with the tweed.

274
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,120
We can use tone-on-tone patches to cover different textures.

My brother and I have different mothers.

280
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,020
But I was never discriminated against because of that.

281
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,250
I was never hated for it.

282

My current mother is a good person.

Am I wrong?

285
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,410
Just... a little bit.

286
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,850
Either way, that means I was

290
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,870
I would like us to get dinner together.

291

Rather than a restaurant recommended on social media,

292
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,570
can you guide me to a local hot spot?

293

Well, it'd be better if you took me around, too.

Then, work well with that other team.

301

304
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,690
It's not like we're machines. We need at least a month.

This won't work. We won't be able to make the deadline.

We don't deal with temporary workers. Too unstable.

318
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,190
- They're all permanent workers here.
- Really?

319
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,930
We even deliver whatever gets finished first and make at least 80 jackets a day.

320
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,830
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

321
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,590
Why would the production department ask the designer to figure out which factory to contract with?

322
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,030
Otherwise we will have to work with whichever is assigned to us.

323
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,080
That would lower the quality.

324
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,440
Chief Choi's factory... wouldn't do, right?

325
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,670
It'd be better to ask another team to lend us their factory.

326
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,610
If we say we will work with the factory that produced our copies, people will probably throw a fit.

327
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,840
Clair Marie doesn't even have a team set yet, but they already have Mr. J.

328
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,980
It's just that that team is on fire

329
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,390
so it's making me worry about anything and everything.

330
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,130
Haven't they filled the headcount yet?

331
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,090
I don't think so.

332
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,880
May I ask the reason for this meeting?

333
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,840
I wanted to help you make some memories in Korea.

334
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,510
It just happens that there is a good exhibition going on.

335
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,090
If we go together, you might get some inspiration.

336
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,140
- Excuse me, Director Hwang—
- Let's restart

337
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,110
our fate from the beginning.

338
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,990
Not showing up that day was purely my misjudgement.

339
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,000
Nevertheless, no one can turn back time.

340
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,520
I don't want to fuss over things that happened in the past.

341
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,510
The future is more important.

342
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,760
I don't want to live my life doing whatever the elders say.

343
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,180
I'm the same way! That's why I didn't show up that day.

344
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,360
But it turns out that there is a reason behind the elders' actions.

345
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,730
Look at me, for example. I'm regretting not listening to them.

346
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,650
Let's just be friends.

347
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,870
I have friends, though. What I don't have is a man.

348
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,010
I already have a woman I'd like to be a man for.

349
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,240
What's this? You said it was urgent.

350
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,450
So I came this way instead of going back to work.

351
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,760
Hey, what about the factory? You couldn't find one?

352
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,480
There's one place I like, but I'm not sure if it'll do.

353
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,950
But why are you buying so many clothes?

354
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,730
I thought about it, and I feel like I've never bought clothes for Ji Min

355
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,930
at the department store unless they were on sale.

356
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,880
Hey, that's too big for Ji Min.

357
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,560
Hey, kids grow so quickly. It's fine.

358
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,180
You're usually so cheap.

359
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,610
What's gotten into you that you're on a buying binge?

360
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,430
<i> If you're working right now, you should resign soon</i>

361
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,740
<i> and go through the hospitalization process.</i>

362
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,100
It's because everything just feels so annoying and unfair.

363
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,090
I was just wondering what kept me so busy

364
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,450
that I've never bought clothes for my daughter from the department store.

365
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,020
Is something wrong?

366
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,940
Why? What is it?

367
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,830
Did Ji Min's dad get himself into trouble?

368
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,160
Hey. He's too timid to do anything of the kind.

369
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,740
Are your in-laws asking for a trip abroad again?

370
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,250
Just because.

371
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,260
When Ji Min gets older, when I finish my installment savings next month,

372
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,720
when I move to a more spacious place...

373
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,170
it's always "next time."

374
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,080
Turns out that now my daughter doesn't have a jacket that all the other kids have,

375
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,330
and I'm in this shape.

376
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,100
It all just feels so crappy and annoying.

377
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,440
It just means you lived well and frugally.

378
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,460
Maybe it's depression related to menopause.

379
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,160
So I am planning on living however I want.

380
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,970
No matter what I do, just let me be and accept it.

381
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,440
I'll buy this one for Ji Min.

382
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,470
When you want to go all out, you should.

383
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,570
So you should just go all out, too.

384
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,460
Who cares if he's Soo Wan's younger brother?

385
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,480
What matters is that you like him.

386
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,010
No one can live your life for you.

387
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,540
Excuse me.

388
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,120
- I'll have those and these, please.
- Okay.

389
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,020
You said you never bought new bedcovers after getting married.

390
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,200
That's true. Should I change the whole bedding while I'm at it?

391
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,710
Doesn't this one give more of a newly-wed feeling than that one?

392
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,800
What do you mean newly-wed? That's gross.

393
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,080
Who knows? You might have a second child.

394
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,950
You don't need anything? You should look, too.

395
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,490
I'm fine. I live alone, anyway.

396
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,720
♫ <i>When we're together they don't stand a chance</i> ♫

397

408
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,820
I just have to send it over by tomorrow, right?

409
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,700
They said they'll use it for the homepage banner.

410
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,060
Oh, and the client is pretty strict,

411
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,280
so make sure you have a few best cuts ready to go.

412
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,940
What's next on the schedule?

413
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,020
Kitchenware brochure isn't your specialty.

414
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,400
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

415
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,060
Hey, we're talking about frying pans.

416
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,860
I'm not going to be picky about work.

417
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,280
I need to earn money to settle down.

418
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,530
So do the work that'll get you a lot of money.

419
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,430
There are so many places that want you for their photo shoots.

420
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,620
That's no fun.

421
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,250
<i>[Mother]</i>

422
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,700
I'm getting a call. Text me my schedule once it is figured out.

423
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,970
- Yes, Mother?
- Are you busy right now?

424
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,760
I thought you might be busy meeting your girlfriend.

425
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,060
How's it going? Making some progress?

426
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,060
Why are you laughing?

427
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,720
It's just weird that you're asking this.

428
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,310
But it's also new.

429
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,160
My son has someone he likes, so of course I'm curious.

430
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,460
I'm trying hard to make some progress right now.

431
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,630
I'd love to meet whomever she is. Make a good effort.

432
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,130
Hey, stop right there! Stop there!

433
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,630
Stop there, you punk!

434
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,850
Hey, you! Stop right there!

435
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,260
Oh, go ahead and work.

436
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,790
Mother?

437
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,460
Have you been well?

438
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,490
I have been well. You've been well too, right?

439
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,030
If I'd known that you have been coming to our culture center,

440
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,140
I would've already arranged to have a meal with you.

441
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,650
I'd be sorry to impose upon such a busy person. It's fine.

442
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,280
Let's meet next time with Jae Gook.

443
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,520
Yoo Jeong, Jae Gook has a woman he likes.

444
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,130
Have you met her?

445
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,230
No, he said she's not into him yet.

446
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,640
It seems that only he has completely fallen for her.

447
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,480
It's the first time he's talked about a woman like that.

448
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,860
<i> - Let's take it. This is a video, right?
- Of course.</i>

449
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,360
<i> [Ten years ago]
- Look here.
- It's so pretty!</i>

450
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,650
<i> Hello! Hello!</i>

451
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,520
<i> Press that.</i>

452
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,390
<i> I'm going to kiss you.</i>

453
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,950
<i>I want to concentrate!</i>

454
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,610
<i>- Come on!
- I'm concentrating!</i>

455
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,290
<i>Hold still.</i>

456
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,230
<i> What are you doing, you thief?</i>

457
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,680
It was my first time seeing him so happy.

458
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,280
I wonder what kind of woman she is.

459
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,140
This time, no matter who it is, I will definitely accept her.

460
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,550
No matter who she is?

461
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,840
Jae Gook says he likes her.

462
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,670
That's enough. I won't be greedy.

463
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,660
I am not going to hurt him over such things anymore.

464
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,520
I just want Jae Gook to be happy.

465
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,620
I'd take joy in life by seeing that.

466
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,810
Team Leader, which button is better?

467
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,780
The one without the shine is prettier.

468
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,730
Alright.

469
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,220
How long will you keep dawdling?

470
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,140
Don't you want to grow in a successful team?

471
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,950
There are a lot of juniors from Lamong who are saying they'll take the spot if you won't.

472
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,450
I can't wait for much longer.

473
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,160
Bring me what Team Leader Ha is doing by tonight.

474
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,400
Interesting.

475
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,370
I was just going my usual way,

476
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,830
and this old man assaulted me out of nowhere!

477
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,840
Who hit whom?

478
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,540
You just fell while running, you liar!

479
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,040
I'm going to go crazy. Do you know me?

480
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,560
You stole my money and ran off!

481
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,200
It's my first time seeing you.

482
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,080
You were the one who hit me first.

483
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,770
Who are you calling a liar?

484
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,400
- Geez.
- Did you confirm?

485
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,840
- There's nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nope.

486
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,780
There are no CCTV cameras nearby.

487
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,420
This conversation might get longer,

488
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,940
so for now, let's talk at the station, both of you.

489
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,950
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

490
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,260
Forget "elders first." I won't let you be.

491
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,510
I'll make sure you go to prison for assault.

492
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,150
There won't be any settlement, all right?

493
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,920
Oh, I can't believe this.

494
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,340
Excuse me.

495
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,540
- What is it?
- I filmed something interesting.

496
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,860
In high-definition. Clearly.

497
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,220
<i>Hey, you! Stop right there!</i>

498
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,790
Okay, I understand.

499
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,970
Can everyone bring me their sketches?

500
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,180
It's not bad. It's got some sense.

501
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,850
As expected, Manager. It looks good.

502
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,120
Isn't it too basic?

503
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,010
You could choose a lining with print on it.

504
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,160
Please take a look at mine too.

505
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,220
I wanted to work on a set, so I stayed true to my passion.

506
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,090
How did you hold back all this time?

507
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,360
I know, right?

508
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,290
So Yeong, what about you?

509
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,980
I... don't have anything yet.

510
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,420
Why? Is it not going well?

511
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,480
I'm sorry.

512
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,110
In that case, would you like to use this as reference material?

513
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,260
When I was your age, I drew these for my graduation project.

514
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,080
Wow! Those look great.

515
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,690
You sketched them when you were So Yeong's age?

516
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,030
No wonder you got into ESMOD.

517
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,750
You keep feeling impatient, right?

518
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,520
Pardon?

519
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,740
You want to do well, but you also don't want to miss out on any opportunities.

520
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,320
But, So Yeong, there's no need to rush.

521
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,260
So what if it takes you longer?

522
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,160
So what if you don't do that well?

523
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,740
Just think of pretty clothes and good clothes.

524
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,200
Opportunities will follow naturally after.

525
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,990
You have so much ahead of you, so why are you uneasy about not getting an opportunity?

526
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,540
Don't be so uneasy. We have so much work set out for you.

527
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,650
If someone asks you to do something crazy, come tell us right away.

528
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,740
A good mentor only wants your talent.

529
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,550
They will not make you do something you shouldn't.

530
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,570
Make sure the revisions are done by tomorrow morning for me to review.

531
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,910
Keep working hard.

532
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,410
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

533
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,360
You are really naïve.

534
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,190
Do you really believe that will make Jeong So Yeong stay?

535
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,380
You didn't see or hear anything, okay?

536
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,000
Consideration becomes a right before you know it. If you treat them well, they will walk all over you.

537
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,920
If you let it go once, they will expect to be excused again. That's how people are.

538
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,860
All right. If you're late to work again,

539
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,670
it'll be reflected in your performance assessment right away.

540
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,710
You can't treat your informant like this.

541
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,710
Yes, what is it now?

542
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,360
<i>I told you to go to your dad, didn't I?</i>

543
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,030
<i>He's at the police station right now.</i>

544
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,730
Dad.

545
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,060
It's a case related to fraud and assault.

546
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,190
Your father bought a one week vacation package to Europe.

547
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,410
He made a prepayment to the travel agency, but it was a paper company.

548
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,420
I was going to travel around Europe with your mom once I retired.

549
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,910
They said they'd give me half-off on many of the additional services

550
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,260
and give me a big discount, too.

551
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,330
I didn't even get to see any of that money.

552
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,460
All I did was speak to you on the phone.

553
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,040
It was just a part-time job. That's all.

554
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,880
But why is this person here?

555
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,270
Oh, he's the witness.

556
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,860
If it weren't for him, I would have been in big trouble.

557
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,230
<i>[Seoul Yeoksam Police Station]</i>

558
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,120
You're extremely nosy.

559
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,700
Thanks to this, I happened upon an unbelievable coincidence.

560
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,560
What would you have done if your camera got broken?

561
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,510
Are you worrying about me on top of that?

562
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,210
No, it's not worry.

563
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,090
Oh, I was on your mind again, right?

564
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,620
All right, I got it. Okay.

565
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,760
It's your mom.

566
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,290
It was really nothing.

567
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,950
Don't raise your voice.

568
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,000
I heard he was a vice principal.

569
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,040
- He'll be retiring soon.
- It has been taken care of.

570
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,520
You take after your father.

571
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,690
I got it. Let's talk when I get back.

572
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,090
Your mother is really freaking out.

573
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,920
I made a separate report for the fraud, like they suggested.

574
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,760
It'll take about two to three months for the police to investigate their bank accounts and provide results.

575
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,690
They said they'll also re-investigate the assault case, so just keep that in mind.

576
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,760
You were brought up so well.

577
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,620
Stepping up to help like it's your own business in this kind of world we live in.

578
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,100
I would at least like to buy you a meal. What do you like?

579
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,870
This person is a busy person.

580
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,130
I'm okay. I'm not busy.

581
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,750
I've been abroad, so I like anything Korean.

582
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,480
I have to eat anyway.

583
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,710
It's your mom.

584
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,040
Why don't you go home now?

585
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,650
Still, he helped me. I can't just leave.

586
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,880
I'll buy him a meal, okay?

587
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,250
Aren't you busy?

588
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,680
Just go home. Mom's worried.

589
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,550
Okay then. Let's talk another time.

590
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,440
Thank you.

591
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,370
But do you two know each other?

592
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,720
- No.
- Yes.

593
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
- Excuse me.
- He asked.

594
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,960
The secretary's office scheduled this, so they'll check if I came here or not.

595
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,070
Ah, yes. It's good that you did. Well...

596
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,100
As a person who is a leader in the arts,

597
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,660
I use exhibitions or music to recharge and get inspiration from time to time.

598
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,550
And today just happens to be exactly the time for that.

599
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,110
Did I call you out when you're busy?

600
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,410
If that's the case, then I'm sorry.

601
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,290
Oh, I'm not busy.

602
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,820
My schedule was completely free today, yes.

603
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,400
<i> Where are you? You have so many things to sign off on!</i>

604
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,250
<i> Are you even coming in today?</i>

605
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,110
<i>[Power off]</i>

606
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,510
Director Hwang?

607
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,170
I don't expect much.

608
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:49,000
Meeting someone by fate, then living and loving passionately.

609
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,480
That's all I need.

610
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,000
But is that too much to ask for?

611
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,620
No, it's not. It's a very understandable wish.

612
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,180
But why is it so hard?

613
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm just...

614
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,890
Why is it...

615
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,760
Is it because I'm too sad or because my life is bitter?

616
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,950
This liquor is so bland.

617
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,140
In life, there are days when liquor tastes like water.

618
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,380
Just brush it all off.

619
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,540
You like Yeong Eun too, right?
<i>(informal)</i>

620
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,020
What do you mean "you <i>(informal)</i>"?

621
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,180
Oh, and Team Leader Ha? No, not me.

622
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,620
Why not? Did you give up because of Mr. J?

623
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,710
Why are you continuing to talk informally?

624
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,690
Also, I've never liked her from the get go.

625
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,290
She's not my type at all.

626
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,460
- She's not your type?
- No.

627
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,030
No, she is not my type at all.

628
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,290
I got dumped today.

It's a very dire situation right now since we haven't even found a factory to work with yet.

I told the team not to worry, but I'm actually really scared.

So why hesitate?

710
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,960
There must be a good reason why you would choose to entrust someone who made copies.

711

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,910
Helps to ease the mind and body.

785
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,440
Drinking tea alone with a woman very late at night in an empty place.

786
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,670
What a peaceful sight.

787
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,490
It's making me take another look at you.

788
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,720
Although we had an accident,

789
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,810
I don't behave like the others just because I can.

790
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,160
Your taste is also very elegant.

791
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,100
I'm like that from all aspects.

792
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,320
Elegance, class, and beauty are precious.

<i>[Elton John live in]</i>

796

Was that it?

797
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,540
Pardon?

798
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,060
If you have something to say, just go ahead.

799
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,200
I feel like I can completely understand you now.

800
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,800
About what?

801
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,760
I can catch onto that much.

802
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,440
How refreshing.

803
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,740
I don't like it too sweet. Does it suit your taste?

804
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,180
It isn't perfect, but I still respect it.

805
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,940
Everyone has their own preference.

806
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,480
<i> It was good to see him.</i>

807

<i>It's been a while.</i>

808
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,360
<i>I was curious.</i>

809
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,640
<i>I wanted to know.</i>

810
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,870
<i>I was on your mind again, right?</i>

811
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:02,750
<i>If you apply this, it will heal quickly without a scar.</i>

812

<i>As soon as you get home, wash up and apply it.</i>

<i>My heart keeps trying to take over my mind.</i>

815
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:25,170
The end will just be lame either way.

816
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,870
Liking someone, thinking that it can't be anyone else but that person...

817
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,470
That kind of burning passion will be temporary.

818
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,050
In the end, you get tired and fight.

819
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,320
You ask yourself, "Why did we like each other?"

820
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,340
"Did we really like each other?"

821
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,880
"This is who you are?"

822
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,140
You'll be disappointed and regret it.

823
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,620
That will probably happen.

824
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:58,120
I don't want to do that again.

825
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,280
How would you know when you haven't gotten there yet?

826
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,390
A man, a woman, and love.

827
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:17,050
The beginning and the end are all predictable, no?

828
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,690
We can be different.

829
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:22,990
People are fooled by that, and that's why they start.

830
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,420
Hope you get home safely.

831
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,800
You went through a lot of burden today without my intention.

832

<i> You should change your background now.</i>

<i>[Yoon Jae Gook]</i>

834
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,990
Like you said, the road I took a picture of 10 years ago

835
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:14,670
was vague and vast.

836
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,740
It was a road that left me confused.

837
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,360
But this road I'm on now is clear.

838
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:39,430
Where I should go. What's awaiting me at the end.

839
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,440
You were the one...

840
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,810
who took that picture?

841
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,830
Because of a woman who bought that picture,

842
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:53,830
I was able to endure 10 years.

843
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,430
By coincidence, I met that woman, and my heart started beating like crazy.

844
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,140
<i>Because of that woman, I canceled my flight like a crazy man.</i>

845
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,630
Because that woman is here,

846
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:15,110
I decided to stay here as well.

847
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,540
<i>But if these reasons aren't good enough,</i>

848
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,130
if they're still not good enough...

849
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,710
then we...

850
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,100
can break up.

851
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,620
Our relationship, which started 10 years ago...

852
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,710
Let's say we're in the middle of breaking up right now.

853
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,580
I don't know how long it'll take,

854
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,890
but at least while we're breaking up,
