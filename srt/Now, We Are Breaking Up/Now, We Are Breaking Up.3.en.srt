Yes, I scheduled it.

48

Of all the people in the world, he is the one I somehow ended up meeting

49
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,630
right there in Busan of all places.

50
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,860
Then when I got to Seoul, he was here, too!

51

So if you let it pass by, it's coincidence, and if you grab onto it, it's fate.

I'm asking to make some real progress.

By "progress" you mean...

98
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,370
I'd like to write out the future together.

99

Wow, the photos are great!

105
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,410
As expected from Cookie, your work is different.

106
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,100
There's just a different feel to it.

107
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,630
Will you be done after selecting the photos?

108
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,320
Do you have something to say to me?

109
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,980
Hey. Who are you?

110
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,800
You're Mr. J, Cookie, and even Mr. Paris who swept across New York, London, and Paris.

111
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,740
That's who you are yet you worked on a domestic brand for the first time,

112
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,970
so it's just a shame for you to end it like this.

113
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,390
What is it?

114
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,130
Actually, I have a request.

115
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,180
An interview?

116
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,880
With Yoon Jae Gook?

117
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,630
I told him all about it.

118
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,720
Mr. Paris is Mr. J.

119
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,970
He's a photographer who only works with high-end brands.

120
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,650
Even if we propose an interview, I'm unsure if he would accept.

121
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,670
- Did you get a definite answer?
- It'll be the day after tomorrow at 3 PM.

122
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,040
I even got a text from CEO Seok stating that the editor-in-chief of ELLE will come herself.

123
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,590
Yoon Jae Gook agreed to do this?

124
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,150
He must be well-connected with foreign celebrities, too.

125
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,900
If they post about it on Instagram,

126
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,500
Hye Rin doesn't even compare to their class level.

127
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,010
And yes, I accomplished this hard feat.

128
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,390
Team Leader Ha, what do you think?

129
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,070
I think it'd definitely help with increasing The One's brand worth.

130
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,560
I'll prepare the materials for the interview separately and send them to the marketing team.

131
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,650
Team Leader Ha, go and support them in person.

132
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,520
For once, Director Hwang enthusiastically got this opportunity for us.

133
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,750
Make sure you see it through without any problems.

134
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,640
Okay.

135
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,590
You're not meeting him just because of work.

136
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,960
Don't forget that it's a relationship between two families.

137
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,490
Okay.

138
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,200
You don't seem too into it.

139
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,300
Feeling flustered is more accurate.

140
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,790
What is there to be flustered about?

141
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,840
You can just keep doing what you were doing, right?

142
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,470
I'll talk to the marketing team and send the promotional materials to your office.

143
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,560
Before that, let's settle things.

144
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,820
If we get caught that you went on the blind date instead of me at Busan...

145
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,260
I won't be the only one being called in.

146
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,980
I'm sure.

147
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,120
Since you're his daughter, you'll just get a slap on the wrist,

148
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,370
but in my case, it'll be reflected in my performance assessment.

149
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,430
So what will you do?

150
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,690
It was hard to build up my reputation,

151
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,420
so I'll have to protect it.

152
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,800
Oh, you'd like to eat first?

153
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,930
Yes, of course.

154
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,850
Yes, it'd be good to get to know each other before the interview.

155
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,320
That'd help with the atmosphere, too. That'd be nice.

156
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,540
I'm not going.

157
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,000
But what can I do?

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,360
Mr. J. is a loner who likes seclusion.

159
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
He likes eating by himself.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,330
I'm sorry, Team Leader Ha.

161
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,390
It's just an ordinary pre-meeting meal.

162
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,620
There's no need to feel pressured about it.

163
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,270
When should we meet?

164
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,690
If you tell us when it would be convenient for you, we will work around your schedule.

165
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,590
Let's meet tonight.

166
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,460
Alright then. I'll contact you again to confirm the time and location.

167
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,220
I'll be waiting.

168
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,290
Why are you suddenly getting into it?

169
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,780
It's just... I'm a little interested.

170
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,320
I also needed an excuse.

171
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,830
An excuse?

172
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,810
There is something I need to find out.

173
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,300
What is it?

174
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,980
We got a message from Elle.

175
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,330
They want to know if you'll use Mr. J, Cookie, or real name Yoon Jae Gook.

176
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,790
Okay. Cookie? J?

177
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,150
What is the name that I can call you by to turn you into a flower?

178
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,700
The person I met that day wasn't Ha Yeong Eun,

179
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,850
but Hwang Chi Sook?

180
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,690
At a company, the one who carries out the action and the name that reaps the credit are often different.

181
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,660
What I do is the same as Director Hwang having done it.

182
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,410
How your company works isn't my problem.

183
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,020
But I can't lie.

184
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,910
Misunderstandings are uncomfortable, and explanations are inconvenient.

185
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,560
Were they uncomfortable misunderstandings?

186
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,330
The times you and I spent in Busan and Seoul?

187
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,150
They were happenings.

188
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,190
Was it just a happening between you and Yoon Soo Wan as well?

189
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,240
This is The One's company profile. We're working together,

190
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,590
so I thought you should at least know basic information.

191
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,660
Aren't you curious

192
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,310
about the relationship between me and Yoon Soo Wan?

193
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,280
This is information on this season's items and their press release.

194
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,930
You can refer to these for the interview.

195
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,590
<i>[Director Hwang]
I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

196
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,210
<i> You've made the atmosphere all nice and warm, right?</i>

197
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,990
Director Hwang will be arriving soon. I'll excuse myself.

198
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,270
You like to enjoy,

199
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,320
yet you don't want to take responsibility afterward.

200
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,120
You don't like being lonely,

201
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,780
but you hate getting serious.

202
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,450
I can understand because I'm the same way.

203
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,420
You just crossed the line right now.

204
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,410
But you should've considered whom you're dealing with.

205
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,970
Men aren't all like me.

206
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,620
- Yoon Jae Gook!
- Yoon Soo Wan

207
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,470
said he was serious.

208
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,610
Did you know that?

209
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,730
Your guest has arrived.

210
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,380
Oh my, I hope I'm not too late?

211
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,100
I already explained the situation.

212
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,580
Then, please enjoy your conversation.

213
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,970
Team Leader Ha, eat before you leave.

214
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,680
Let's eat. We work so we can eat.

215
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,150
Team Leader Ha doesn't really like course meals.

216
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,260
She works for me, but I shouldn't mess with her dining style.

217
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,420
This looks delicious.

218
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,360
<i>Yeong Eun, why do you eat with such haste?</i>

219
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,620
<i>[10 years ago, Paris]</i>

220
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,830
<i>I have little time but a lot of work.</i>

221
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,890
<i>I lead a life that requires me to use 24 hours like they are 48 hours.</i>

222
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,040
<i>Setting aside time to eat is a privilege to me.</i>

223
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,990
<i>Now I can live.</i>

224
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,510
<i>Is it good?</i>

225
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,830
<i>Ta-da.</i>

226
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,770
<i>I followed the recipe, but I can't guarantee the taste.</i>

227
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,590
<i>At least once a day, enjoy an actual meal.</i>

228
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,980
<i>You can allow that much in your life.</i>

229
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,620
<i>It's delicious.</i>

230
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,900
Jerk.

231
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,200
<i>[The One]</i>

232
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,390
You don't have to do this all the time.

233
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,560
You said you're releasing other colors.

234
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,780
Aren't you working till late tonight too?

235
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,500
Eat it with your ramyeon.

236
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,080
It's because I feel bad.

237
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,210
Team Leader Ha and I don't have that kind of relationship.

238
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,080
No need to feel bad.

239
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,720
You must be busy. Go ahead.

240
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,980
I'll leave after organizing this.

241
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,420
We'll enjoy it. Thank you!

242
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,010
Team Leader Ha knows all kinds of people.

243
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,400
Celebrities help her, and you support her so well.

244
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,270
Team Leader Ha can eat some and you can eat some.

245
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,250
I brought plenty so that everyone here can have some.

246
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,930
You came because you heard people were saying good things about Sonó's new item, right?

247
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,580
But getting the CMT job for that will be hard.
<i>[CMT: cut, make, trim; making the garment after fabric selection and design is done]</i>

248
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,930
They had to make everything happen so quickly that they already decided on the toll processing subcontractor.

249
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,520
Still. I'm sure Team Leader Ha will give us some work, too.

250
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,840
In any case, I would need the spec sheet to even calculate the headcount.

251
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,700
So Yeong, say hello.

252
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,780
She's Chief Choi from one of the subcontractor companies that handles everything but the design.

253
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,550
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

254
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,430
She's our newest employee.

255
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,740
It'll be quicker to ask her for any references.

256
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,060
Oh, nice to meet you. I hope we can work together.

257
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,600
Me too.

258
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,450
But... is that the spec sheet?

259
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,500
Yes.

260
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,100
Chief Choi!

261
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,110
I heard you were out. Are you just getting back to the office?

262
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,480
What brings you here at this hour?

263
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,910
I made some kimchi.

264
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,910
I told you, you don't have to.

265
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,090
I know you always make so much effort to get me work.

266
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,060
Sharing some kimchi is the least I can do.

267
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,840
Take the taxi.

268
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,540
If you continue to do this, I won't be able to come anymore because I feel bad.

269
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,830
You said your knees hurt. Ride comfortably.

270
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,060
I'll contact you soon.

271
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,870
- Welcome back.
- You're back.

272
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,830
Are all the labels taken care of?

273
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,310
Yes. We're cross-checking the number of labels that were sent to the factory with the number of clothes produced.

274
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,250
It's a race against the clock from now on. It's only a matter of time before copies show up.

275
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,890
That's why I am going to go keep watch by going to the factory right after work.

276
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,030
Protect the spec sheets well so no one can take the labels to put on copies.

277
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,990
Got it.

278
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,320
Oh no! No, I can't believe it.

279
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,590
Both of our free evenings are filled with housework.

280
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,720
That Chi Sook wench is enjoying herself at a wine bar.

281
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,710
<i>Day 1 for him and me. I want to get drunk tonight.</i>

282
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,210
What? The guy is good-looking.

283
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,190
How do you know?

284
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,710
What fun they're having.

285
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,210
And my husband is busy keeping everyone happy.

286
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,810
Yeong Eun, you know what? My husband actually...

287
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,050
He even knows a lot.

288
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,000
He's also an intellectual? How attractive.

289
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
He knows Soo Wan.

290
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,650
What?

291
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,890
How does he know him? So where is that guy and what's he up to these days?

292
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,710
What good would it do to know that now?

293
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,590
He ruined your life. You should at least get to throw a glass of water on him.

294
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,400
If you had stayed in Paris, you would have done fashion shows every season

295
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,820
and been interviewed by Vogue!

296
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,950
Soo Wan didn't force me to come back. I chose to.

297
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,650
I'm just angry that with your talent, you have to clean up after Chi Sook all the time.

298
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,220
I agree, I'm wasting my talent too much.

299
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,520
You're basically giving it away at a 90% discount.

300
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,510
But in return, I have an apartment in the middle of Seoul in my name, I own a car,

301
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,600
and I get to happily give my parents allowance once in a while.

302
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
Don't you think others will think I'm doing pretty well?

303
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,840
How long is Soo Wan going to hold a place in your heart?

304
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,730
Tell him to move out if he doesn't mind since he is not even paying rent!

305
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,570
Let's hang up now. I'm in the middle of cleaning the bathroom. I have to spray water.

306
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,550
Anyway, how does he know Soo Wan?

307
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,520
- Didn't you ask?
- Hanging up!

308
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,530
That's refreshing.

309
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,270
<i>The guy is good-looking.</i>

310
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,420
I'll get nothing in return being hung up on it.

311
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,220
Throw away what I don't need and live the way I have been.

312
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,530
That's the smart way.

313
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,640
<i>Yeong Eun! Let's have another drink!</i>

314
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,610
Why leave your expensive mattress and use mine all the time?

315
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,980
If you're that scared of your dad, go to a hotel.

316
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,920
You wench, if I set it all up for you, you should have taken care of the rest by yours—

317
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,470
I'm sorry, Team Leader Ha.

318
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,000
She said she wanted to buy us a round of drinks for securing the interview,

319
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,690
but instead she is making us rudely intrude on you like this.

320
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,000
Excuse us. We couldn't do much more to stop her.

321
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,800
Yeong Eun, show Jae Gook in.

322
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,120
- Shoes.
- Yes.

323
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,260
She says to come in.

324
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,000
Welcome to Yeong Eun's house.

325
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Do you have hard liquor?

326
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,170
There are tons of bars outside.

327
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,120
Why don't you have a drink alone with him?

328
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,920
He must massage his face day and night with ice water. He's very cold.

329
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,900
Why else do you think I called out those guys?

330
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,570
Oh, my god.

331
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,960
Your wife is probably waiting.

332
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,970
Shouldn't you go be going home early?

333
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,270
I should, but wow, I only heard from my wife.

334
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,800
The house is just... so nice!

335
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,960
Ingo Maurer. Bang and Olufsen.

336
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,410
Even the real Royal Albert...

337
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,230
Your taste is very similar to mine. Except for this photo.

338
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,300
It's an unsophisticated work of an amateur that doesn't suit your elegant taste.

339
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,920
How about it? Would you like me to choose something that would suit better?

340
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,360
These days, there are artwork that you can rent out for a monthly fee.

341
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,370
Just let it be.

342
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,820
That is the embodiment of Yeong Eun's true self.

343
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,880
- This is worth 20 euros.
- What?

344
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,610
It's an amateur's work that she bought off the street in Paris.

345
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,450
But she says it inspires her or consoles her or something.

346
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,180
Either way, whenever she's having a hard time,

347
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,070
she stands in front of that gloomy photo of pouring rain

348
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,350
for dozens of minutes making a scene.

349
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,850
I have no idea why.

350
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,630
That photo is the one thing that simply does not get upgraded.

351
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,730
So what will it be? Will you have another round here?

352
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,910
Not sure. I'm a bit drunk.

353
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,910
Let's have just one more round.

354
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,590
If you don't mind.

355
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,350
Who would mind? My relationship with Yeong Eun is not like that.

356
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,080
Yeong Eun, let's round up with one glass each.

357
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,950
Does wine sound good?

358
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,490
Great!

359
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,130
Okay, this house has a great view. Look!

360
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,350
Ta-da!

361
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,440
She is basically above the Han River.

362
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,710
<i>Jae Gook.</i>

363
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,510
- Help yourself.
- Have some with us.

364
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,650
I have a new product launch tomorrow, so I'll have to decline.

365
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,130
Don't stay standing and come over here.

366
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,980
Ah, okay.

367
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,140
- You never do what I want from you.
- Pardon?

368
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,980
Never mind.

369
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,640
What good is it to live alone in a great place like this?

370
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,520
As for me, all I need is someone who would let me use his arm as a pillow.

371
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,650
There is nothing better than comfort from sharing body temperature.

372
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,440
At least you get what I'm saying.

373
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,270
Cheers.

374
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,950
Cheers.

375
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,690
<i>No need to go all out. Come home.</i>

376
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,960
Why did he have to follow her all the way here and see my current state?

377
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,400
Actually, who cares? Doesn't matter anymore.

378
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,490
This is the reality you wanted to protect?

379
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,960
I said you guys can have another round.

380
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,940
It didn't mean that you could come in all the way here like this.

381
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,680
I wanted to see for myself

382
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,210
and confirm something as well.

383
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,660
Director Hwang is outside. I don't want any misunderstandings.

384
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,690
Are you sure that's what you're worried about? A misunderstanding? Or do you just not want to get caught?

385
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,360
- Yoon Jae Gook.
- Yoon Soo Wan.

386
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,020
Does he really not mean anything to you?

387
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,470
Are you sure he means nothing to you?

388
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,620
Just what does he have to mean to me?

389
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,030
He was serious about me. What do you want me to do about that?

390
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,150
He was so serious that he chose to ghost* me like that?

391
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,000
<i>(To ghost: to abruptly cut off contact without warning or explanation)</i>

392
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,920

but the feeling of despair and misery that I felt under the rain that day,

I'm in the process of breaking up with all those things.

Yeong Eun.

429

Ha Yeong Eun! Do we not have any ice?

430
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,050
What I'm enjoying right now... it's a prize I've earned for working so hard

431
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,470
after erasing men from my life.

432
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,900
- Yeong Eun!
- Team Leader Ha.

433
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,570
Director Hwang has chosen you.

434
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,010
The CEO who is in charge of my performance assessment

435
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,840
has ordered me to foster a good relationship between you two.

436
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,240
I need to get out there and find her ice.

437
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,540
This is my reality.

438
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,920
I've thought about it a hundred times.

439
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,620
Was my love that mediocre that I had to be dumped without given a reason?

440
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,420
Did I do something wrong?

441
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,080
Was I not enough?

442
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,820
I dwelled on it for so long. I regretted it. I got drunk.

443
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,610
But...

444
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,590
having done so, did anything change?

00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,220
So that's why

Cheers.

448
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,680
- Let's go.
- Yes, it's quite late.

449
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,780
- We should go.
- Where are you going?

450
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,150
Here, here. We'll be going now.

451
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,590
- Please excuse us.
- I can have one more glass.

452
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,490
- No, no. We can't.
- Just one more glass.

453
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,750
Next time, next time.

454
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,470
- You're not working tomorrow.
- You can take your leave.

455
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,670
It's not that expensive!

456
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,920
Oh, I'm in the totally opposite direction.

457
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,970
It's just wasting money and time.

458
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,690
She's a client, a director at that.

459
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,420
So it's good manners to match her level with the CEO on our side.

460
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,570
- Are you coming or not?
- Yes, I'm coming!

461
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,650
- One round.
- Fine then.

462
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,270
Rock, paper, scissors!

463
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,330
See you tomorrow.

464
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,150
- Jae Gook.
- I need to go back to the studio.

465
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,710
If you're not coming, then take her.

466
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,820
Yes, I'm coming.

467
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,050
Oh, hold on.

468

00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,780
<i>Perhaps all the questions</i>

471
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,410
<i>were just an excuse.</i>

472
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,550
<i>I wanted to check.</i>

473
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,420
<i> Just how much of a hold you have on me.</i>

474
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,630
<i>Just how much</i>

475
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,470
<i> I mean to you.</i>

476
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,620
That I couldn't leave...

477
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,240
You knew, didn't you?

478
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,690
What I have

479
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,300
and achieved,

480
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,870
I don't want to lose them

481
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,760
by playing with emotions.

482
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,750
I've already experienced enough of that.

483
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,510
Experience doesn't give courage.

484
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,540
It instills fear.

485
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,970
Right now, I'm scared

486
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,350
of you.

487
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,970
What's this? Hey, you—

488
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,910
If you drank, just sleep.

489
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,180
Don't start getting all bold for no reason.

490
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,720
Don't cause any damage! Sleep deeply and quietly!

491
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,860
I slept peacefully last night!

492
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,190
What's wrong?

493
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,400
Did something happen?

494
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,030
Last night, I was chaste.

495
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,870
All I wanted to do was to take Director Hwang home out of kindness.

496
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,970
<i>I don't want to go home.</i>

497
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:07,060
<i>What? You don't want to go home?</i>

498
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,550
<i>It's time we be honest.</i>

499
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,750
<i>About what?</i>

500
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,640
<i>Why did you want to come with me?</i>

501
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:23,270
<i>Oh, I lost at "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against Soo Ho earlier, so...</i>

502
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,910
<i>I'll talk first.</i>

503
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,710
<i> I liked you as soon as I saw you.</i>

504
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,040
<i> Uh, well, thank you.</i>

505
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,980
<i> Let's stop.</i>

506
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,950
<i> Oh, stop the taxi? You want to get out?</i>

507
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,770
<i> Driver.</i>

508
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,900
<i>I'm talking about flirting.</i>

509
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,950
<i>Let's not pretend anymore.</i>

510
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,890
<i> Why are you doing this?</i>

511
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:00,630
<i>Let's not suppress the desire we have for each other any more.</i>

512
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,390
<i> Wait, hold on.</i>

513
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,120
But why are you dawdling like this? Aren't you going to the interview?

514
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,160
Nope, I'm not going.

515
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,990
It's been cancelled.

516
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,290
<i>Ha Yeong Eun! Ha Yeong Eun!</i>

517
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,760
<i>[MiniShop]</i>

518
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,980
Did something good pop up?

519
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,600
Copies always exist, but getting your best product stolen really sucks.

520
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,960
Knockoffs have good quality and are cheaper these days.

521
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,100
We can't block the consumers from buying them, right?

522
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,160
Because you sang "Italy, Italy," I paid for Italian fabric.

523
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,340
You kept whining about how you had to get it made quickly,

524
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,000
so we stopped the Lamong line and handed it off to Sonó.

525
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,990
But this is what you are bring to the table?

526
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,890
If you're in the position of a team leader,

527
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,340
you should be managing these issues!

528
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,750
I'll find out how it happened.

529
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,160
I don't need to know how.

530
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,380
All I need to know is how you're going to repay the money that you used

531
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,260
and the harm you inflicted on the company!

532
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,120
How can you be so bad at protecting the spec sheets?

533
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,370
<i> You have a lot of orders, right?</i>

534
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,620
<i> - Yes, it's always overtime.
- Oh, no.</i>

535
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,040
<i> But it's feels good even though it's physically tiring, right?</i>

536
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,220
<i>Even I feel happy about how well Sonó's new products came out.</i>

537
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,810
<i> Yes, well.</i>

538
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,130
<i>But I need to prepare in advance to be of any use.</i>

539
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,980
<i> What can I do first?</i>

540
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,380
<i> My team leader hasn't said anything yet.</i>

541
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,590
<i> Oh, you must not know since you're a newbie.</i>

542
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:22,450
<i>Normally, they show us the spec sheet in advance.</i>

543
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,030
<i> Let me see.</i>

544
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,120
<i>Sure, here you go.</i>

545
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,770
<i> Oh, the line of the clothing is so pretty.</i>

546
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,840
<i> We'll have to be precise with the sleeves.</i>

547
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,590
<i> Ah, yes.</i>

548
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,210
<i>Let me hold it for you.</i>

549
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,380
<i>Gosh, thank you.</i>

550
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,400
<i>The darts go here.</i>

551
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,280
<i> We're going to use this and black as the other color.</i>

552
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,840
<i>Black? Black would look good too.</i>

553
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,320
<i> Yes.</i>

554
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,030
I'm sorry.

555
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,060
<i>[MiniShop]</i>

556
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,320
Wrap it up.

557
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,240
What about the interview with Mr. J?

558
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,620
What's the point of promoting clothes when its copies are out on sale already?

559
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,090
The products are already out.

560
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,720
So what? You'll have them laid out on display for a special sale?

561
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,970
You hate that the most.

562
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,090
If we sell at a reduced price, we would only earn a little.

563
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,310
But in the long run, it's a loss in the end.

564
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,000
The brand's image will worsen and if you raise the price later on,

565
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,290
people will think it's inflated. It'll end up being harmful.

566
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,030
- Yes, that's true.
- So just scrap it.

567
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,170
It's the first release, so there aren't that many made anyway.

568
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,610
It's something I worked so hard for though.

569
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,870
Father!

570
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,970
What's wrong?

571
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,240

<i>[Resignation letter]</i>

<i>[Resignation letter]</i>

575
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,510
Quitting won't make a difference.

576
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,740
I'm just so sorry.

577
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,720
I became a burden to the whole company.

578
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,790
It's so hard for me.

579
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,600
Then you should take responsibility.

580
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,200
What good would it be for you to run away?

581
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,740
What can I do to take responsibility?

582
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,320
Don't make a mistake like this ever again.

583
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,280
And put your best efforts into whatever you can do.

584
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,430
That's the only way you can make up for this mistake.

585
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,430
Team Leader.

586
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,140
Don't you dare try quitting like this again.

587
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,550
You'll be in big trouble then!

588
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,040
- Where are you going?
- To work.

589
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,020
This is inevitable in our field.

590
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,750
I know. Copies are day-to-day life in this field.

591
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,680
But you shouldn't have done this to our youngest member,

592
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,810
who has no decision power,

593
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:11,480
has no sense of judgement because she's walking on thin ice, and can't say no.

594
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,250
I wanted to do well and prepare ahead of time,

595
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,160
so I asked to see the spec sheet.

596
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,040
Then, you should've waited for our orders.

597
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,080
If a design is good, people change the collar or the number of buttons,

598
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,230
and copies come out within one to two weeks.

599
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,010
That's how Dongdaemun works.

600
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,410
I'm not only working with The One.

601
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:37,330
The others were asking this of me, so I couldn't refuse.

602
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,770
My kid wants to go to art school.

603
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:44,010
All I have are my skilled hands and a good eye, so...

604
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,370
Everyone has their own circumstances.

605
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,740
I don't know when you're going to give me work,

606
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,230
but I already have my child's tutoring fees to pay.

607
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,760
So I had to sit in front of the sewing machine. I'm a mom, after all.

608
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,270
I know you're a good person,

609
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,830
but you stepped on other people's time, dreams, and efforts

610
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,750
just to send your kid to college.

611
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,510
I'm not sure if that makes you a good mother.

612
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,100
We're going to be filing a lawsuit against the company that put the order in.

613
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,050
You'll have a lot of work to do then

614
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,870
since other companies will be curious about just how similar the copies are

615
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,120
and make orders so they can have it too.

616
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,000
But don't enjoy it too much.

617
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,710
I came here to tell you that.

618
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,060
Team Leader Ha.

619
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,450
Take this.

620
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,590
I didn't give this to you with ill intentions.

621
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,940
I really am thankful.

622
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,750
I brought this because I had nothing else to offer.

623
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,970
Prepare for the lawsuit.

624
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,990
And don't trust that the company that put the order in will protect you.

625
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,910
We're going to do our best to prepare for it.

626
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,950
I'm telling you this out of gratitude for your kimchi.

627
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,670
Boss.

<i>[Shin Yoo Jeong's Hot Pick]</i>

629
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,290
<i>[Shin Yoo Jeong's Must Have]</i>

630
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,270
I chose this first.

631
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,340
Excuse me.

632
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,160
These ones here.

633
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,180
Yes? Okay.

634
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,230
What's your size?

635
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:05,270
<i>Why is everything so complicated for you?</i>

636
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:10,400
<i>Just act according to your heart.</i>

637
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,440
Manager Nam, tell the factory not to scrap it.

638
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,320
We are going to release as planned today.

639
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,150
What? You're going to go through with it?

640
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,800
If we act rashly, we might end up with a lot of stock piling up.

641
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,910
That's just a guess. We haven't done anything yet.

642
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,640
What if the CEO finds out?

643
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,990
As long as the results are good, we can ask for forgiveness on the process later.

644
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,140
The internet already thinks that the knockoff is the real product.

645
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,590
<i>If we search for it, only that site shows up in the top results.</i>

646
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,970
Did you hear that?

647
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,170
This isn't something new we're dealing with.

648
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,910
It's expected every time something gets sold out.

649
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,280
<i>There will always be people who seek out our products.</i>

650
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,460
<i>Even if there's a Chanel knockoff being sold for ten or twenty thousand won,</i>

651
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,070
there are people who will buy the real product for over a hundred thousand won.

652
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,390
Because that's the original.

653
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,670
<i>Hey, Ha Yeong Eun! Do you think work is a joke?</i>

654
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,970
<i>Is there no such thing as seniority?</i>

655
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,680
I'll speak to the CEO myself.

656
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,640
You're saying you'll bypass the approval process however you like now?

657
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,550
Come back immediately! Come back immediately!

658
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,670
I'm really going to go crazy.

659
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,970
I heard there was a copy made.

660
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,380
We will reschedule the interview for later.

661
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,980
It won't be possible today.

662
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,920
Are you okay?

663
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,410
I'm not okay.

664
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,740
Even if we file a lawsuit, it'll take a few years.

665
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,650
If they move the location of the zipper and call it an homage,

666
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,080
there is nothing I can do even in a copyright lawsuit.

667
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,640
But is that why you're here? To ask if I'm okay?

668
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,520
Did you have lunch?

669
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,210
I don't have time for that.

670
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,050
I need to get back to the office.

671
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,740
Nevertheless, at least once a day, enjoy an actual meal.

672
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,990
<i>At least once a day, enjoy an actual meal.</i>

673
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,720
How do you know?

674
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,870
Yoon Soo Wan...

675
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,290
how do you know him?

676
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,960
This must be your son!

677
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,410
Yes, he's my son.
