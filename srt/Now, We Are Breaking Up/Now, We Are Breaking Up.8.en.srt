7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,030
<i>- There's someone I love.
- It's that Ha Yeong Eun.</i>

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,870
How do you think people will see you two?

9
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,470
This world is not yet tolerant of the love between you two.

10
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,270
I'm sure they'll enjoy gossiping about it for the first few days.

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,960
Do I have to give up the woman I love for fear of that short while?

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,930
If people say our relationship isn't possible in Korea,

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,990
then all I have to do is take her to Paris.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,630
You're insane.

15
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,180
You're so out of it, you can't even think straight now.

16
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,090
The one who wronged you is my brother, not her.

17
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,110
You're lashing out at the wrong person.

- So?
- So these are all yours.

How?

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,390
This came.

25
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,670
An invitation from Chairman Alexandre de Fontenay of DPHP,

26
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,070
the conglomerate that owns all of these luxury brands as subsidiary companies.

27
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,200
Honestly, the domestic PR industry is a little small for me to be in.

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,500
It's too tight.

29
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,180
You should cut the midnight snacks.

30
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,960
Straightforward.

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,420
Let's be that straightforward when signing the contract, okay?

32
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,490
You will be in charge of advertising for all of the brands under DPHP.

33
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,800
Whatever they request, say oui. No matter what, say oui. Got it?

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,610
A representative from DPHP came to meet with you personally right now.

35
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,010
From where? Paris. Voilà!

36
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,050
Some of the schedule overlaps with my current schedule.

37
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,870
We have the concept shoot with Clair Marie.

38
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,200
We'll have to push that back obviously. They'll understand.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,150
Either way, ten days is too long.

40
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,840
Change the dates.

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,150
Yo, Cookie, that's not how it works.

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,880
They are DPHP.

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,010
I looked through it, and one week should be plenty of time.

44
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,930
Cookie, your bro wants to expand to Paris.

45
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,240
Can't you just pave out a path for me without resisting?

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,480
The more stuck-up you are, the more attractive you become. That's the Paris mindset.

47
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,780
Cookie, please!

48
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,920
Hyung, do you really think that little of me?

49
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,760
People from DPHP have arrived.

50
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,610
Hello! I am CEO Seok Do Hoon from Vision PR.
<i>(in French)</i>

51
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,850
I am so glad to meet you.
<i>(in French)</i>

52
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,220
Nice to meet you. I am Cédric Roux from DPHP.
<i>(in French)</i>

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,620
Who did you say was DPHP's new head director?

54
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,700
Some say he's a rising designer, and others say he's a big shot in the fashion industry.

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,560
They say this director is quite aggressive in recruiting talented people from all fields.

56
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,100
He has already reached out to some in certain fields.

57
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,030
Look into the brands their head is contacting,

58
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,310
and let's bring them into our department store.

59
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,340
Which area should we offer them?

60
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,280
Domestic brands are no longer competitive.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,850
You can let them all go.

62
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,330
All of them? What about Notié, Mardi Mohan, and Sonó?

63
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,970
- Their sales are still—
- Send all of them a termination letter.

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,220
- Team Leader.
- Did something suddenly happen? A termination letter?

65
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,780
Apparently, The Hills contacted us in the morning stating we muct vacate our store.

66
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,030
Just because they're a department store, it doesn't give them the right to tell us to vacate our store like this!

67
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,920
Then what's the point of the contract in the first place?

68
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,460
Just how on earth are you doing your work?

69
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,800
Vacating the store at The Hills is pretty much publicly advertising that we are past our prime.

70
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,750
No one was able to foresee this until it blew up like this?

71
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,750
Do you think it's because we made it difficult for them when they asked for an increase on their commission?

72
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,120
The sales team has to take the company's profits into consideration.

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,090
It has only been a year since we raised it from 40% to 45%.

74
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,280
If we raise it again, the price of clothing has to increase to compensate for it in the end.

75
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,980
That's why you should've found an appropriate compromise!

76
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,370
Just how terribly did you manage your connections on a day-to-day basis

77
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,520
that you're just sitting here and taking this bomb?!

78
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,550
That's enough, stop!

79
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,430
Is figuring out who did right and who did wrong important right now?

80
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,470
We need to consider our next step.

81
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,480
How about we take this opportunity

82
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,830
to take all of Sonó's marketing budget and employees

83
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,580
and bring them all to Clair Marie?

84
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,850
We are riding an upward popularity trend after the jersey show.

85
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,220
We have never shown a drop in sales to the point where we'd close overnight.

86
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,240
That's what we think, but look at reality.

87
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,850
The news will spread widely about how The Hills kicked us out

88
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,370
which means all of the other department stores will start saying they'll close our stores, too.

89
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,100
Rather than becoming a local brand outside of Seoul after getting kicked out of everywhere,

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,080
it will at least look better to retire with honor.

91
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,640
- Chief.
- If you think about it, Director Hwang

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,060
has the gift of foresight for sure.

93
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,290
What would've happened if Clair Marie hadn't launched?

94
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,030
The fact that the sales aren't like before isn't Sonó's fault.

95
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,920
It's the overall situation for domestic brands.

96
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,560
We have always complied without a fuss

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,320
each time they asked for an unreasonable raise in commission.

98
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,930
Plus, Sonó does not fall under the 3-strikes-and-out system.

99
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,680
It's just an unfair contract termination.

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,360
If you're complaining to me about it being unfair,

101
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,040
- will that change The Hills' decision?
- Pardon me?

102
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,780
Instead of spending time being angry, bring more realistic next steps to me.

103
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,900
Either run headfirst into them, or bow down completely.

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,970
Do whatever you can to try and change the decision.

105
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,970
Then report back on the results. Do you understand?

106
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,980
Why are you still sitting around? Go and figure out a solution for each department.

107
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,260
You are a very consistent person.

108
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,090
Whether at home or at work, you're exactly the same.

109
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,320
You're not fake at all.

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,530
I need to relieve my hangover.

111
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,080
Where's Yeong Eun?

112
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,820
Can you even eat hangover soup when The Hills just evicted you?

113
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,550
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Are you really the director?

114
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,170
You should take the gold out from your business card.

115
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,590
Do you really plan on cutting Sonó?

116
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,660
Depending on the circumstances,

117
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,850
we cannot live with a rotting arm. Don't you agree?

118
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,840
The Hills gave us until the end of this month?

119
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,840
I, too, will see how things turn out

120
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,930
at the end of this month.

121
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
If you want to save Sonó,

122
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,660
do something.

123
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,290
Ha Yeong Eun, is it true?

124
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,850
I heard Sonó is on the brink of being evicted by The Hills.

125
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,460
By any chance, did you cause any trouble that I don't know about?

126
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,380
Trouble?

127
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,230
<i>Senseless child.</i>

128
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,860
<i>Drunk day in and day out.</i>

129
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,280
<i>It's not...</i>

130
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,960
<i>It's not like I didn't try either.</i>

131
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,710
<i>But the person he likes is none other than my friend.</i>

132
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,900
<i>It's too hard.</i>

133
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,800
<i>Love, men, women. They make my head hurt.</i>

134
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,940
Something did happen.

135
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,600
No, nothing happened.

136
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,370
Other than staying up late drinking, nothing happened!

137
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,040
Either go eat hangover soup or go to a sauna.

138
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,660
You reek of alcohol.

139
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,250
Where are you going?

140
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,170
The Hills. Whether I run headfirst into them, or bow down completely,

141
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,470
I should try something.

142
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,530
Good luck!

143
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,420
What do I do?

144
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,340
<i>[Late Yoon Soo Wan]

146
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,340
<i>It is her.</i>

<i>Does she know about it too?</i>

<i>But then?</i>

155
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,920
<i>I held on to her.</i>

156
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,090

<i>Because it can't be anyone else but her. That's why.</i>

158
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,950
<i>Jae Gook.</i>

159
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,040
<i>I know how hard it'll be for you and how difficult it will be for you to accept it.</i>

160
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,540
<i>- I'm sorry.
- What do you mean you are sorry?</i>

161
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,500
<i>Then you're actually going to...</i>

162
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,120
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,900
It can't be.

164
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,460
What? Marie Amelie as the styling director?
<i>(in French)</i>

165
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,350
And Julien Disse as hairstylist?
<i>(in French)</i>

166
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,250
After his success at the three biggest fashion weeks, he's the one everyone wants. <i>(in French)</i>

167
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,880
Shall I give you the moon as well?
<i>(in French)</i>

168
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,910
Helena Christian as the model.
<i>(in French)</i>

169
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,010
I hope you won't have any problems in getting her.
<i>(in French)</i>

170
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,200
Cookie, stop being so stuck-up.

171
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,750
If they take everything off the table and leave, what are you going to do?

172
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,610
Then we'll have the photo shoot at the Musée d'Orsay?
<i>(in French)</i>

173
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,240
It's a joke <i>(in French)</i>. A joke—

174
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,740
I mean, a Korean joke. A Korean joke!

175
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,990
I don't need 10 days. A week is enough time.
<i>(in French)</i>

176
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,040
You little con.
<i>(in French)</i>

177
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,500
I know.
<i>(in French)</i>

178
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,520
Fine. If there's nothing else, let's sign
<i>(in French)</i>

179
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,860
because if it doesn't work with your schedule, I'll charter you a private jet.
<i>(in French)</i>

180
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,350
Business class is good enough for me.
<i>(in French)</i>

181
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,420
Then it's a deal!
<i>(in French)</i>

182
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Deal!
<i>(in French)</i>

183
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,010
Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes!
<i>(in French)</i>

184
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,700
You still act as arrogantly as ever.
<i>(in French)</i>

185
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,340
As for you, look where you are now.
<i>(in French)</i>

186
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,200
You're the marketing director of DPHP.
<i>(in French)</i>

187
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,840
As promised, you're coming to Paris with me?
<i>(in French)</i>

188
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,160
A promise is a promise.
<i>(in French)</i>

189
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,250
But it was only because of you, my friend.
<i>(in French)</i>

190
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,110
Tell me, since when did you become so attached to Seoul?
<i>(in French)</i>

191
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,970
Do you have a girlfriend?
<i>(in French)</i>

192
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,350
Cédric, do you remember ten years ago
<i>(in French)</i>

193
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,170
when you ripped off a woman
<i>(in French)</i>

194
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,950
by charging her five extra euros for my photo?
<i>(in French)</i>

195
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,630
<i>Come look! Come look!
(in French)</i>

196
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
<i>How much?
(in French)</i>

197
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,250
It's that woman.
<i>(in French)</i>

198
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,060
I found her.
<i>(in French)</i>

199
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,370
What? You're kidding!
<i>(in French)</i>

200
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,480
It's a rough draft of the designs including next year's spring/summer line.

201
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,720
Please reconsider after you've looked over Sonó's potential and the profits from this season.

202
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,790
Can you lower the retail price of the Sonó wool overcoat

203
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,270
to under ₩500,000 (~US$425)?

204
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,220
That would be difficult, considering the manufacturing cost.

205
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,990
A piece where one can tell this is from Sonó without checking the label...

206
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,780
Do you have a signature like that?

207
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,300
What about a Sonó exclusive design that has never been seen overseas?

208
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,680
Foreign luxury brands make their clothes in size 44 as the standard.

209
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,750
They look pretty, but they're uncomfortable for us to wear

210
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,700
since the structure of our hips and shoulders are different.

211
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,590
We are a premium brand that uses good fabrics to make clothes that are comfortable for us to wear.

212
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,020
A luxury brand's logo makes us put up with discomfort.

213
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,050
Some luxury brands are carried by department stores without a commission.

214
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,500
We have to pay on average 40 percent to a maximum of 50 percent.

215
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,430
It would be difficult for us to lower the price more.

216
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,680
In the end, you're saying that you don't have a competitive edge.

217
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,940
I follow your social media accounts consistently.

218
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,420
You don't take sponsorships but buy the items yourself

219
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,510
from domestic brands and mention them.

220
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,830
Our clothes are good quality, but it's a shame that no one knows about it.

221
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,780
I remember you saying that.

222
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,370
However, there are realistic limitations

223
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,500
that can't be overcome.

224
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,530
I believe that is your reality and limitation.

225
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,350
So stop with the useless efforts.

226
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,190
I won't change my mind.

227
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,220
<i>[Sonó]</i>

228
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,760
<i>The pain will spread a lot towards your back.</i>

229
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,950
<i>You'll develop jaundice and lose a lot of weight.</i>

230
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,480
<i>First, we're planning on using the AG method (a combination of Abraxane, a cytotoxic anticancer drug, and Gemcitabine, an anti-metabolic drug).</i>

231
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,640
<i>After that, we will continue to check your condition</i>

232
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,450
<i> and control the dose and medication.</i>

233
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,530
<i>And because the chemotherapy is toxic,</i>

234
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,520
<i>bleeding, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea,</i>

235
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,720
<i>and hair loss are possible.</i>

236
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,610
<i>Are the side effects really that severe?</i>

237
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,200
<i>Still, you need to be strong and overcome it.</i>

238
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,070
<i>My son has just started his first round of chemotherapy.</i>

239
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,770
<i>Are the side effects really that severe?</i>

240
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,700
<i>The AC chemotherapy treatment was more painful.</i>

241
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,760
<i>I vomited and felt lethargic...</i>

242
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,260
<i>I went to my child's school wearing a hat in the middle of summer,</i>

243
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,690
<i>then turned back home because I was sorry about the way I looked.</i>

244
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,020
<i>You must be having a really hard time.</i>

245
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,310
<i>I'm rooting for you.</i>

246
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,520
Paris?

247
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,690
They said that I absolutely, without fail, must be their photographer.

248
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,940
That's what DPHP said.

249
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,500
I mean, DPHP said absolutely, without fail.

250
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,360
Wow, you're so cool. I'm jealous.

251
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,950
How long are you going to stay there?

252
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,640
I'm leaving tomorrow and staying about a week.

253
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,310
Do you want to go with me?

254
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,810
I'm a company employee.

255
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,490
You're a designer.

256
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,320
If you go with me, there are a lot of people I could introduce you to.

257
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,470
I could also introduce you to people from DPHP.

258
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,160
I would love to, but I have things I need to resolve.

259
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,670
I think it will be a bit difficult this time.

260
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,790
Why? Did something happen?

261
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,810
<i>I think that you aren't making a decision based on your personal feelings.</i>

262
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,370
<i>No, they're my personal feelings.</i>

263
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,280
<i>I don't want clothes made by a designer like you</i>

264
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,840
<i>to be hung up in my department store.</i>

265
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,760
<i>Since clothes are shaped by feelings as well.</i>

266
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,420
<i>I have lost everything because of love before.</i>

267
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,020
<i>I said that I would never do that again.</i>

268
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,740
<i>After ten years, love is asking again,</i>

269
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,360
<i>"Nevertheless, can you do it again?"</i>

270
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,290
Something happened, didn't it?

271
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,980
There are lots of things that happen when you make clothes and try to sell them.

272
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,630
A ship with the fabric that was supposed to arrive runs into a storm and can't sail.

273
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,800
Or it finally arrives and is being held in customs.

274
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,820
But that's our situation,

275
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,440
and my job is to make it work no matter what.

276
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,420
I don't want to leave.

277
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,530
Can't you just pretend those problems don't exist and set them all aside for a few days?

278
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,640
Thank you for the sentiment, but my work is here,

279
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,470
and I will be here working really hard.

280
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,960
So do a killer job that will impress those in Paris, okay?

281
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,600
Dad, you know what I said last night when I was drunk.

282
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,530
Foolish punk.

283
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,610
Is that my fault?

284
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,980
Is it a bag or shoes?

285
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,620
It's not like I can swipe a credit card to buy a person's heart.

286
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,080
That's your problem.

287
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,330
You don't have the guts to just go all out for it.

288
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,900
You don't even have the will to make him yours.

289
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,010
The one who takes it away is bad, but the one who gets it taken away is more pathetic.

290
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,990
Do you like talking to your daughter like that?

291
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,470
And it's not that Yeong Eun took him away, but our destinies crossed. Destiny!

292
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,350
You... you... you...

293
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,880
Anyhow, I don't have feelings for J,

294
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
so don't bring it up anymore

295
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,810
and don't say anything embarrassing to Yeong Eun.

296
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,970
Let's keep public and private matters separated.

297
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,270
If you get kicked out of The Hills, I'm closing Sonó down!

298
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,500
Dad? Dad.

299
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,960
Oh, this is driving me crazy!

300
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,980
My head...

301
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,670
Pardon?

302
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,280
What do you mean all of a sudden?

303
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,030
You must have a source at The Hills that you've been working on.

304
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,500
Of course, I do...

305
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,510
I mean, no matter what type of work, people are the ones behind it all.

306
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,150
Then what are you doing?

307

The saying "crisis is an opportunity." This is your time to show your abilities.

Pardon?

Are you going to stay as a chief forever?

310
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,380
An executive director or director... I guess you don't dream about a promotion at all.

311
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,980
You live a small life.

Do you do business through your computer?

314

This is why people say those who are book smart can't make it big.

What is it?

316
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,370
Learn what it means to do business by running around and sweating by seeing how it's done yourself.

317
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,090
I've already established a connection with the person who has the power to decide.

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,910
The designer should personally explain the plan for next season so that they can trust us.

Helena Christian just called me from the airport.

Where did you go that you're still not home yet?

335
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,820
I went out for some air because it felt so stuffy,

336
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,690
but there was some traffic.

337
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,100
Oh, some air? Did it feel nice?

338
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,630
Must have felt really refreshing while Ji Min was uncomfortable all day.

339
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,490
She had an accident at school, but you were the only one that didn't send an extra set of clothes.

340
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,000
I went to pick her up, and they had her wrapped up in towels.

341
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,990
Tell me the truth. Something is up, isn't it?

342
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,120
Is Ji Min sleeping?

343
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,760
You...

344
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,920
Did you invest in stocks?

345
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,660
- What?
- If not, what is all this?

346
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,160
You didn't wear this many times because you said you were saving it.

347
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,300
How much did you lose exactly?

348
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,460
Half? All?

349
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,860
How much would you even get from selling this used?

350
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,820
I can't wear it anyway since it's out of style.

351
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,960
What about all of Ji Min's clothes?

352
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,730
Why are you being so frugal that you bought such large sizes to dress her from now until later on?

353
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,120
What if I forget again?

354
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,130
Tell me. Did you lose ₩3,000,000?

355
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,490
₩5,000,000? Hey, is it more than ₩10,000,000?

356
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,000
Is that why you're so out of your mind?

357
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,520
That's why I told you not to do it!

You're right.

Think of it that way if that makes you feel better.

She went to meet someone at The Hills.

She asked not to be disturbed if it wasn't something very urgent.

Good shot! Your transition is no joke.

Try putting your left foot down a little when lift your heel up to swing.

385
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,560
The ball's direction can change

386
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,300
if you put the heel down in a different place than where it was lifted from.

387
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,500
All right, let's go to the next hole!

388

You don't have to be so harsh.

I didn't think she was!

393
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,810
I mean, is she getting revenge on Yeong Eun over a 10-year-old issue right now?

394
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,680
Oh, my god.

Real, glamorous, and sensible celeb, my butt!

396
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,970
How dare she abuse her power and act the role of an ex-fiancée from 10 years ago?

397
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,710
It might be a misunderstanding, so don't get carried away.

So besides my father, there's Shin Yoo Jeong too...

I am only saying this just in case,

401
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,330
but there isn't any way for Vision PR or myself

402
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,360

There is definitely something we can do.

408
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,350
The senior vice president's swing today was...

409
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,530
It was like seeing the never ending future of The Hills.

No, I am.

434

This is the most desperate and frantic I've ever felt in my life.

435
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,120
Which is why I waited all day for the ten minute briefing, let you touch my hand,

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,860
and stressed about whether or not I should get in a car with you alone.

Hey, Team Leader Ha!

438
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,670
In the three hours we ate, there were so many chances for you to speak or listen.

439
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,820
You're not saying you will listen to my briefing.

440

What do you want to do while having more drinks alone?

441
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,840
Don't you plan on using my earnestness and desperateness as a hotel room key?

442
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,900
But I can't do that.

443
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,830
In this situation, that's so pathetic.

444

Hey, Team Leader Ha. Don't you know who I am?

445

You were given your position through your family connections to keep Shin Yoo Jeong in check!

446

Even if you want to abuse your power, act like a man of your position.

00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,980
Mi Sook! Mi Sook!

463
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,760
What do I do? Mi Sook!

464
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,690
Mi Sook!

465
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,740
- Excuse me, is there a patient with the name Jeon Mi Sook—
- What happened?

466
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,130
The doctor will explain the results of her MRI scan once her guardian arrives.

467
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,990
First, you need to proceed to admit her to the hospital.

468
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,690
Mi Sook, are you okay?

469
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,730
Sorry. You must be busy.

470
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,460
Jeon Mi Sook, you're really...

471
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,290
Ji Min's dad.

472
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,030
Ji Min's mom.

473
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,720
What is the doctor saying?

474
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,690
Jeon Mi Sook, you...

475
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,080
Why are you here like this?

476
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,880
Mi Sook.

477
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,110
What are we going to do with you?

478
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,980
Mi Sook.

479
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,100
Mi Sook.

480
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
Mi Sook!

481
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,320
Mi Sook!

482
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,680
What time is it in Paris?

483
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,980
You must be right in the middle of preparing for work.

484
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,120
Tonight, I...

485
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,610
I don't even know what I did all day.

486
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,000
I wished for that bastard to hit the ball well

487
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,630
so that he would at least be in a good mood.

488
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,460
I stood there silently in prayer while feeling punished,

489
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,560
"Fine."

490
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,560
"I just need to pour this glass. No big deal."

491
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,490
But then he grabbed my hand.

492
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,280
"Fine, that's fine."

493
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,110
Because until I leave work to go home,

494
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,330
I need to be professional.

495
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,460
So...

496
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,070
I wondered if I should get in the car.

497
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,900
I actually thought about it.

498
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,660
But...

499
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,470
during that time,

500
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,340
my friend was in a lot of pain.

501
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,460
I'm so mad about that.

502
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,470
While I was pondering something stupid like that,

503
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
my friend

504
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,990
was suffering by herself.

505
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,690
That makes me so mad.

506
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,950
Walk a bit faster, please.

507
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,170
So that having been called a crazy bastard for not sleeping or eating and working like I'm dying

508
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,500
to condense a week's worth of work into three days can be worth the effort.

509
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,820
I missed you.

510
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,500
I missed you too.

511
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,010
The worst man in the world...

512
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,590
Didn't even know his wife was horribly ill...

513
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,440
<i>There really isn't much to life.</i>

514
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,110
<i>How this could happen to me...</i>

515
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,970
<i>Nothing felt real.</i>

516
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,980
<i>But now that I'm this sick,</i>

517
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,620
<i>I suddenly felt scared.</i>

518
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,920
<i>Let's get chemo.</i>

519
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,130
<i>Why are you giving up already without trying anything?</i>

520
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,250
<i>Ji Min is only seven years old.</i>

521
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,910
<i>Lying there after getting chemo</i>

522
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,220
<i>and making her get water for me...</i>

523
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,650
<i>Not being able to braid her hair from lack of energy...</i>

524
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,600
<i>Not being able to even put stockings on her.</i>

525
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,480
<i>"Mom, why are you always sick?"</i>

526
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,360
<i>"Mom, I'm tired of you being sick."</i>

527
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,430
<i>"Mom, I hate you."</i>

528
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:02,510
<i>Yeong Eun, I don't want to say goodbye to Ji Min like that.</i>

529
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,560
<i>I'll do it.</i>

530
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,850
<i>I'll braid her hair,</i>

531
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,960
<i>and I'll drop her off at school in the mornings.</i>

532
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,060
<i>So let's get chemo.</i>

533
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,020
<i>Even if you'll live for just one extra day.</i>

534
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,780
<i>On that day, unlike now,</i>

535
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,350
<i>do what you want to do</i>

536
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,480
<i>and everything you haven't done.</i>

537
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,770
<i>Let's live one more day, Mi Sook.</i>

538
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,400
<i>Don't give me hope like that.</i>

539
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,200
<i>They said I can't.</i>

540
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,810
<i>Yeong Eun, what will I do?</i>

541
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,450
What do you think is at the end of that road?

542
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,950
Is it hope, or is it

543
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,660
an empty end with nothing at all?

544
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,520
It's probably

545
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,980
me there.

546
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,980
No matter what path you take,

547
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,630
at the end of it, I'll always be there.

548
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,350
I won't avoid it.

549
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,410
No matter what happens.

550
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:15,430
Yoon Jae Gook, can I take advantage of you being my boyfriend just once?

551
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,780
You know, Paris is full of talented designers.
<i>(in French)</i>

552
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,370
Even though Mr. J introduced you to me, it is what it is.
<i>(in French)</i>

553
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,770
You can't persuade me with simple designs.
<i>(in French)</i>

554
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:36,300
I know. That's why I wanted to show you in person.
<i>(in French)</i>

555
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,410
<i>[Sonó x A Flow]</i>

556
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,920
What are you so nervous for?

557
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,750
You were the one who introduced her to him. He'll treat her well.

558
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,190
They don't care if we're friends or not, Hyung.

559
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,270
If it's good, it's good and if not, it's not.

560
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,150
When it comes to work, they are extremely cold.

561
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,680
Sonó. Interesting.
<i>(in French)</i>

562
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,870
Let me tell you a fairy tale.
<i>(in French)</i>

563
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,760
Once upon a time, the assistant of a famous photographer
<i>(in French)</i>

564
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,190
left this note in a young designer's portfolio.
<i>(in French)</i>

565
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:48,090
♫ <i>When you look deeply into my heart</i> ♫

566
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,650
I hope one day, passions become "sono."

567
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,640
<i>It means that I want my passion to become an echo.</i>

568
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,410
<i>Isn't it cool?</i>

569
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,370
<i>Wherever it may be, my first brand will be Sonó.</i>

570
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,920
This man became a world-famous photographer.
<i>(in French)</i>

571
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,750
And the young lady...
<i>(in French)</i>

572
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,200
She's here. She's become a marvelous designer.

575
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,690
How did it go?

576
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,920
What is it? Did it not go well?

577
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,640
That little bastard. I told him to treat you well.

578
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,060
He gave me two months.

579
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,160
He'd like to start a pop-up store at Galeries Lafayette for two months.

580
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,570
He's going to see the results before deciding to open an official store or not.

See? You never know how life will flow by.

593

That's true.

594
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,380
I never expected that the four of us would plan to go to Paris. Never.

595
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,080
I never saw it coming.

596
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,280
Then, let's all have a huge cheers.

597
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,340
Cheers.

598
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,840
Make sure you order drinks more than dishes. The margins are higher.

599
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,510
Okay, okay.

600
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,760
You used to be a chief at The One,

601
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,540
but now you're working as a boss here. Do you like it?

602
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,650
I quit because I thought it was unfair living to serve work, but now I'm serving others' needs.

603
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,360
With that being said, I'd be grateful for more orders.

604
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,320
Please market it well, CEO Seok.

605
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,650
Don't worry. I know some people in Paris.

606
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,900
You have to approach them head-on.

607
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,860
The more stuck-up you are, the more attraction they feel.

608
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,880
You learn quickly, CEO Seok.

609
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,660
Hey, I go out to Paris twice a year in the spring and fall.

610
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,180
I'm so excited.

611
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,050
I can't believe this, the Galeries Lafayette in Paris!

612
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,490
Do well or my dad will fire you.

613
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,550
Oh, did the CEO of The One say that he'll fire me if I don't do this well?

614
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:11,210
To be honest, my father found out

615
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,930
about Yeong Eun and Yoon Jae Gook.

616
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,020
Then, Team Leader Ha is going to get fired too?

617
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,160
You'd get fired over that?

618
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,020
Well, if I get fired, there's nothing I can do about it.

619
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:27,090
Enough of that. So I'm telling you to do well in Paris at Galeries Lafayette,

620
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,210
or I'll be the one getting fired this time.

621
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,990
Do you understand, CEO Seok?

622
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:36,270
You're the one who would be least affected by getting fired.

623
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,130
Anyway, whether it be personal or official, we are aiming for Galeries Lafayette in Paris.

624
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,350
We're one team until we reach our goal,

625
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,140
so let's work well as a team together. Okay?

626
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,400
Okay!

627
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,930
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

628
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,120
I told you I'd get you a taxi, but you insisted on coming along.

629
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,340
From my exhausted point of view, I can't understand you.

630
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,380
If you didn't come with me, you would have gone with J.

631
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,810
He's my roommate, so that sounds like the obvious.

632
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,790
You've never dated anyone, right?

633
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,470
You could say I'm a careful type who doesn't give his heart out recklessly.

634
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:31,090
For me, my love experiences are my life's only asset.

635
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:35,320
Must feel quite secure having such an abundance of life assets.

636
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,210
My father's scary,

637
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,400
and my younger brother is no help to me.

638
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,470
So I always filled what I needed with love.

639
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,240
Why are you speaking slower again?

640
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,870
I can't carry you on my back.

641
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,390
If you get drunk, you're too heavy.

642
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,080
Did you see earlier?

643
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,040
J stuck his fork into a fruit and gave it to Yeong Eun.

644
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,060
Not sure, I'm not too interested in Cookie.

645
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,510
Yeong Eun only looked at J, too.

646
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,220
Well, they were sitting across from each other.

647
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,830
What does this uncomfortable stare mean?

648
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,750
Paris. We're going, right?

649
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,780
It'd be nice to go.

650
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,440
Then my father has to trust Yeong Eun like he did in the past,

651
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,950
and it'd be advantageous for him to give his full support.

652
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:35,240
With adequate support, it'll be easier.

653
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,460
Will you take my side just once?

654
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,150
What?

655
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,120
Listen well.

656
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,060
What'd you say? I can't really hear you.

657
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,170
This is strictly business.

658
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,580
Me, you, Yeong Eun, and J. It's for everyone.

659
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,740
- What?
- It'll just take a moment, so trust me and follow.

660
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,470
Where are we going now?

661
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,410
It's him again?!

662
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,980
Chi Sook! Come in this instant!

663
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,120
Are you rebelling on purpose for me to see?

664
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,710
Are you not embarrassed? How could you, in front of the house?

665
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,970
Because I love him and I feel passionate.

666
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,820
Is it love if you're afraid of others' gazes?

667
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,130
Quiet!

668
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,480
That man won't do! End it immediately.

669
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,960
There probably is no other country besides ours where people interfere in others' dating lives to this extent.

670
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,680
Am I a stranger?!

671
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,660
Anyway, when it comes to love between a man and a woman, you're a third party.

672
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,360
Oh, you little!

673
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,960
But, Dad, you're going overboard.

674
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,740
Yeong Eun and Jae Gook both like each other, but if you hold a grudge

675
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:12,920
and act mean to her, driving her to a corner, that's going way overboard.

676
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,030
Wash up now and go to bed. We'll talk again tomorrow.

677
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,510
Please help Yeong Eun, Dad.

678
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,180
She didn't steal him, Dad.

679
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,260
I didn't show up at the meeting that day.

680
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:29,720
Yeong Eun is only guilty of helping me and cleaning up after my mess.

681
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,620
I don't want to lose my only best friend because of you, Dad!

682
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,890
So clumsy...

683
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,200
<i>[A source from Sonó stated that they are planning to open a shop in Galeries Lafayette]</i>

684
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,290
<i>[Is Sonó offcially entering Galeries Lafayette?]</i>

685
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,340
<i>[The One is planning on opening a Sonó pop-up shop in Galeries Lafayette]</i>

686
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,360

687
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,740
Assistant Manager Seo, how's the press release coming along?

688
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,350
- It's almost done.
- Okay!

689
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,860
The articles are concise, accurate, and strong!

690
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,880
This is Vision PR and Sonó coming together!

691
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,050
Everyone, let's go for it!

692
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,000
<i>Sonó is going to be in the same space as Givenchy and Tiffany's pop-up stores?</i>

693
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,650
<i>K Fashion finally enters the Paris market!</i>

694
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,240
<i>It's properly showing that Korea is a fashion powerhouse.</i>

695
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,820
<i>- Buy me a Sonó dress for my birthday.
- My wife is a Sonó fanatic.</i>

696
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,580
<i>Sonó's jersey dress is still sold out. When are they going to restock?</i>

697
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,850
If you wait just a little longer...

698
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,800
We are open to the possibility of...

699
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,850
We will consider it positively.

700
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,000
What happened?

701
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,250
DPHP was looking for a brand,

702
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,110
and it seems to have been impressed by Sonó's jersey show.

703
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,570
So you're telling me that Sonó approached their head director whom we couldn't identify

704
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,780
before we did?

705
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,530
A photographer named Mr. J was the bridge between the two.

706
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,360
Galeries Lafayette in Paris okayed the pop-up?

707
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,170
DPHP recognized it right away.

708
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,250
I may not make clothes well, but I have a good eye.

709
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,540
I okayed each and every one of those pieces.

710
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,390
It's not surprising, is it Team Leader Ha?

711
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,460
Her discerning eye helped a lot, too.

712
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,390
Not only that,

713
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:04,420
everyone is going crazy right now.

714
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,980
The department stores where Sonó has a retail space are asking to extend the contract and offering cuts in commission.

715
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,540
Hanseong is asking for exclusivity,

716
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,540
and places that aren't finished with their construction are asking us to choose a space.

717
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,810
Nothing from The Hills?

718
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,750
I think we need to make the decision this time.

719
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,760
You have something to say.

720
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,290
There is something you misunderstood.

721
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,110
You said that domestic brands have a limitation.

722
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:32,930
To me, it looks like The Hills has a limitation.

723
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:37,940
Your groundbreaking initiative was merely importing many foreign brands,

724
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,430
so the commission you couldn't receive from them, you took it from domestic brands.

725
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:46,450
Retail prices rose and customers left again.

726
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:50,740
Jae Gook helped you get a pop-up at Galeries Lafayette,

727
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,370
so it will be great for a month.

728
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:56,680
But how long do you think that will last?

729
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,420
It won't change at once.

730
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,190
So I am going to try two, three more times.

731
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,520
I am going to try until I succeed.

732
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,000
You are much more reckless than I thought.

733
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,980
Perhaps.

734
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:19,970
Yes, I lost to love and experienced losing my dreams, my future, everything.

735
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,310
I know how foolish and reckless this emotion is.

736
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:30,450
But if I am this way regardless, it is because I am serious about Yoon Jae Gook.

737
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:34,720
But this self,

738
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,390
this foolish and reckless self...

739
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,360
I welcome it.

740
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,300
Don't retract the termination letter.

741
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:52,000
We, Sonó, will not sell at The Hills.

742
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,630
It's not that The Hills is firing us, but we are cutting off The Hills.

743
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,110
Thank you, my friend.
<i>(in French)</i>

744
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,280
No, I don't accept your thanks.
<i>(in French)</i>

745
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,780
We didn't choose her because of you. It was her talent.
<i>(in French)</i>

746
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,350
You know me. I don't mix the friendship and business together.
<i>(in French)</i>

747
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:09,420
As expected, you have an eye for talent.
<i>(in French)</i>

748
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,940
You deserve your place at DPHP.
<i>(in French)</i>

749
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,520
I really liked her creativity and style.
<i>(in French)</i>

750
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,400
Really, I won't let her go.
<i>(in French)</i>

751
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,020
It's true. She has style.
<i>(in French)</i>

752
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,750
You've got everything, don't you? Do you know how lucky you are? <i>(in French)</i>

753
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,020
<i>I've never once had it all.</i>

754
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,110
<i>When I was born, my father wasn't there.</i>

755
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,780
<i>When I turned two, my mother disappeared.</i>

756
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:48,390
<i>My life... was not envied by anyone else.</i>

757
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:09,180
Because I'm thankful. Immensely and crazily thankful.

758
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,850
It wasn't because of me.

759
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,410
He said your clothes said it all.

760
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:26,340
Good job. You did really well.

761
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,080
Good morning.

762
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,190
You're here.

763
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,370
Hello, Ha Yeong Eun speaking.

764
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,590
<i>Hello?</i>

765
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:29,720
Hello? Please speak.

766
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,600
I'm... Soo Wan's mom.

767
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:43,820
Let's... meet.

768
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:55,160
If you're Soo Wan's mother,

769
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,720
there's no reason why we should meet.

770
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,960
But...

771
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,220
if you're Yoon Jae Gook's mother,

772
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,870
yes, I'll meet you.
