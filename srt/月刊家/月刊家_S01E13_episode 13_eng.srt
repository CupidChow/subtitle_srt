1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,460

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,160

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,050

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,360

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,480

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,300

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,160

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,700

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,400

10
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:00,930

11
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:10,760
I wish someone could go to work instead of me.

12
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:19,099
No... No.

13
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:24,299
Even if is for the sake of Sunbae Ui Joo and Photographer Shin who worry for me,

14
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,233
I shouldn't be like this.

15
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:31,360
I shouldn't be like this!

16
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,499
What's this?

17
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,733
What are you doing?

18
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:45,200
Pull yourself together, Na Young Won.

19
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,566
Sir, congratulations.

20
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,233
What?

21
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,866
Damyung Construction called to tell me

22
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,598
they're accepting your investment.

23
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,467
That's a relief.

24
00:01:56,467 --> 00:02:00,331
You put so much time and effort into it. I thought you'd be ecstatic.

25
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,633
Is something wrong?

26
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,366
No.

27
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:07,433
Everything's fine.

28
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,265
Hello, Editor Nam?

29
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,232
Why are you calling when you should be at work?

30
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:18,465
What? An outside meeting?

31
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:19,732
Oh, okay.

32
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,266
Don't be late for our meeting. Bye.

33
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,830
Where's the material...

34
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:32,330
What's all this? Well?

35
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,790

36
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,360
Yook Mi Ra!

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,690

38
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,599
How can you eat and sleep at the office?

39
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,131
This is Monthly Magazine Home, not Yook Mi Ra's home.

40
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,399
She said it was because she couldn't pay rent.

41
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,767
Still, this is unacceptable.

42
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:52,400
How long has it been?

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,065
About two months...

44
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:56,099
What? That long?

45
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,698
Weren't you scared?

46
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,032
It's dangerous, being all alone.

47
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:00,899
I was going to get a new place soon.

48
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:02,732
Yes, get a new place quickly.

49
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,567
- Before the CEO finds out... 
 - Stop.

50
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:09,066
Why are you all chatting and not working?

51
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:10,167
Oh, sir.

52
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,499
We were about to start working.

53
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,331
Focus on your jobs.

54
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:17,399
I'm not paying for electricity so you all can chat.

55
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,630
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,400
I guess he didn't hear.

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,732
You're lucky the CEO didn't catch you.

58
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:27,667
Right.

59
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:31,565
If he did, knowing him, he would've told you to pay

60
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:33,566
for the electricity and water you used.

61
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,833
Get a new place right now, okay?

62
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,232
Yes, sir.

63
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:39,990
I'm really sorry.

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,266
Are you all right?

65
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,033
Yes.

66
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,165
You should've told me.

67
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:59,065
Come live with me until you find a new place.

68
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:01,566
I didn't tell you because I knew you'd say that.

69
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,833
What?

70
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,266
I didn't want you to worry about me.

71
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,166
Come on.

72
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,832
Then is it okay to live here, always nervous?

73
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,700
It must've been hard.

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,333
But I was able to save up on rent.

75
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,832
The rent in Seoul is atrocious.

76
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:26,067
True.

77
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,999
Rent is one thing.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,865
So much time is wasted on the commute.

79
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:35,599
I wanted to use that time to focus on my job.

80
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,132
I want to become a great editor like you quickly.

81
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:40,199
What?

82
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,665
I told you.

83
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,640
You are my role model.

84
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,232
How's the interior design article coming along?

85
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:58,064
How about indirectly experiencing remodeling in VR?

86
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,233
People in their twenties and thirties...

87
00:04:59,233 --> 00:04:59,932
 Only by words?

88
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,965
 Set me up with someone, you, Nam Sang Soon!

89
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:05,020
 Huh? Set me up.

90
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,999
 What was that?

91
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:14,600
 My heart was pounding like crazy.

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,233
 Do I...?

93
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,331
I think this is a good time to cover that.

94
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,365
 No. That doesn't make sense.

95
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,500
What do you think, Editor Nam?

96
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,298
It doesn't make sense.

97
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:26,599
- What? 
 - What?

98
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,931
- Why does it not make sense? 
 - What?

99
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:32,266
- You just said that it doesn't make sense. 
 - I did?

100
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,798
Yes, you did.

101
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:38,166
Jeez, Editor Nam. Focus on the meeting!

102
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,699
I... I... I... I'm sorry.

103
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,832
I need to go to the bathroom.

104
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,332
What's up with that fool?

105
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,432
The installment payment's been settled. What is it now?

106
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,832
I know.

107
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:59,890
Why is he so out of it?

108
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,064
What is wrong with me?

109
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:17,865
No way...

110
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:22,540
It's not true, right, Sang Soon?

111
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,332
Of course, it's not.

112
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:42,434
 I want to become a great editor like you quickly.

113
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:46,367
 You're my role model.

114
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,333
I'm ashamed.

115
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:55,134
Any human being should be ashamed.

116
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,360
Pull it together for real.

117
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,740
♫  I like the bright mornings  ♫

118
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,790
♫  You like the starry nights  ♫

119
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,640
♫  We’re so different  ♫

120
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,680
♫  Like putting one ice cube in an americano  ♫

121
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,860
 I'm embarrassed of having fallen apart so much.

122
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,460
♫  We’re so different,  ♫

123
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:39,167
 I will go back to square one and make each day count.

124
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,780
 I will do my best in the tasks I'm given.

125
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,840
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

126
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,290
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

127
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,831
 Because the position I took for granted

128
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,980
 could be someone's earnest dream.

129
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,031
I checked that part so take a look...

130
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:15,180
 I will forget the painful memories and make a fresh start.

131
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,130

132
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:32,899
The survey result shows 83% of young people aren't satisfied

133
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,498
with where they live.

134
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:39,498
To find out why I want to investigate their residences.

135
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,866
You did a lot of research.

136
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:43,899
It won't be difficult to get a source.

137
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,532
Our assistants volunteered to help.

138
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,800
It'll be meaningful and entertaining.

139
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,799
Isn't it perfect?

140
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,400
What use is it if it's perfect?

141
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,400
It won't make money.

142
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,265
What?

143
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,531
We should cover captivating, luxurious homes

144
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,331
and stick more ads after them.

145
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,299
What's this? Jeez.

146
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:04,865
Right, sir? I did well, right?

147
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,699
No. Proceed with the story.

148
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,733
Get me more details.

149
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:09,734
Really?

150
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:11,499
This is clearly an article that doesn't make money.

151
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,766
You're writing the article that makes money.

152
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,631
This is to keep up our image.

153
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:18,966
To not be considered a tabloid.

154
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:22,200
You have such good judgment.

155
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,631
Then calmly carry it out, Editor Na.

156
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,232
Okay.

157
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,998
Here are the details you asked for.

158
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:38,132
Thank you. You may leave.

159
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:40,633
Sir.

160
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,032
Thank you for permitting the special article.

161
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,366
No need.

162
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:48,300
As I said, it's to keep up our image.

163
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,867
Okay.

164
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:55,231
Also, I'd like to cancel what I said before.

165
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,633
 That will never happen again.

166
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,600
 But if I do something ridiculous like that,

167
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,033
 please be cold to me like you are now.

168
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:16,367
 That way, I won't have any lingering feelings.

169
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:23,633
I think I made you more uncomfortable.

170
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,360
Treat me however it makes you comfortable.

171
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:32,067
It doesn't matter how you treat me.

172
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:35,366
I don't think I'll have any lingering feelings anymore.

173
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,970
Good day.

174
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,400
♫  I’m so lonely and you were my only light  ♫

175
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:53,030
♫  But why aren’t you next to me? Why are you 
 leaving me alone?  ♫

176
00:10:53,030 --> 00:11:05,550
♫  Why are you relying on my deepened faith 
 to give endless excuses?  ♫

177
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:13,390
♫  I want to leave everything behind and go next to you  ♫

178
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:19,680
♫  Because I think I can forget all the painful times  ♫

179
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,000
♫  I’m looking for you like this  ♫

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,140
 You're here.

181
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:32,566
 Sir.

182
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,790
 A gift for you.

183
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:40,390
♫  Leaving me behind here?  ♫

184
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,370
 I don't think I'll have any lingering feelings anymore.

185
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:54,031
Wow, what good weather!

186
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,398
Secretary Hwang. Long time no see.

187
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:56,433
Hello.

188
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,400
What brings you here?

189
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,266
The CEO said he'll drive himself to cover the story.

190
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,498
I know. I just have something to give him.

191
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:04,332
Oh? What is it?

192
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,998
What's this? Damyung Construction?

193
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,633
It's a company CEO Yoo invested in.

194
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:12,067
They sent a gift to celebrate the contract.

195
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,131
Lucky him. He can invest so easily.

196
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,899
And receive gifts so easily.

197
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,198
It wasn't easy.

198
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:20,199
It almost fell through. He worked hard for this.

199
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,220
- Then goodbye. 
 - Bye.

200
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:30,264
So that's why he came here on the weekend

201
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,865
and moved his desk and cleaned the place.

202
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,580
To put the investment out of his mind.

203
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,460

204
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,666
This is my house. Isn't it perfect?

205
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,898
A rooftop party in the city.

206
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,964
Yes.

207
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:50,099
Enjoying the city nightscape in the open space,

208
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:53,433
having a barbeque party and drinking cold beer.

209
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:57,699
A rooftop house is a dream for youth on their own.

210
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,399
That is nonsense.

211
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,431
I want to run away from her as soon as possible.

212
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,465
What?

213
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:06,532
That kind of dream is an illusion made in TV shows and movies.

214
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,331
It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter.

215
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,600
It's infested with bugs.

216
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,032
And when it rains—

217
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,267
it floods and becomes a water park.

218
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,498
Oh? How did you know?

219
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:17,331
I lived in a rooftop house, too.

220
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,931
I see.

221
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,566
Want some tips so you can live here a little less uncomfortably?

222
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:26,366
 Put a bubble wrap on the front door and put the furniture against the outer wall.

223
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:28,999
 It will help to retain heat.

224
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,799
 Put up black-out curtains to prevent

225
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,199
 furniture and clothes from losing color.

226
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,866
 And if you clean the drain in advance

227
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,799
 it won't become a water park when it rains.

228
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,167
 Oh! You must install a filter.

229
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,865
They're great tips.

230
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:50,500
It's know-how from a person who experienced it.

231
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,733
When will my apartment get reconstructed

232
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:01,966
and become a new apartment like that?

233
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:06,966
Do you know my apartment's reconstruction is on hold?

234
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:09,199
There's so little chance

235
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,598
that even the resident representative moved.

236
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,965
Really?

237
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,165
Shocking, right?

238
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:19,431
What's more shocking is that no one wanted to take the job.

239
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:22,232
What's even more shocking

240
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:25,164
is that my wife ended up taking the job.

241
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,266
Really?

242
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,800
Yes!

243
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,298
But what's even more shocking

244
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,431
is that since she is the resident representative,

245
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:34,932
she'll push ahead like a bulldozer.

246
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:39,565
So there's still hope for reconstruction.

247
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:43,766
There's another shocking news.

248
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:44,599
What?

249
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,500
The home owner's appendix burst and went to the ER.

250
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,599
Today's cover is a bust.

251
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,534
We should head back to the office.

252
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:58,733
Since we're already out, let's go get some fresh air.

253
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,380
Sir?

254
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,900
It must be around here.

255
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:22,465
You're here.

256
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,367
Hi!

257
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,090
Come on in.

258
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,830

259
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,164
You decorated the place so well.

260
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:38,331
Thank you.

261
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,966
Cleaning is my hobby.

262
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:42,033
I see.

263
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,465
But don't you get mold even though you clean often?

264
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:45,699
How did you know?

265
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,199
I lived in many semi-basements.

266
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,131
It's a war against dampness when you live in one.

267
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:55,832
If you put charcoal in the wardrobe...

268
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,600
You already did it.

269
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,232
Oh, and...

270
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:05,366
It gets damp between clothes in the drawer.

271
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,798
If you put newspapers...

272
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,832
You already did.

273
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,064
Well...

274
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:13,532
If you don't like people seeing in from outside,

275
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,399
- put a foggy sheet— 
 - So they can't see in from outside.

276
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,033
What?

277
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,498
I pasted a screening sheet on the windows.

278
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:22,533
You can see outside, but you can't see inside.

279
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,933
I didn't know about that.

280
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:29,000
You really know how to live in a semi-basement.

281
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,266
I'll drive the kids this weekend.

282
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:35,832
You do your best as the resident representative.

283
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:38,232
Okay. Bye.

284
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,067
I can't even get some rest this weekend.

285
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:46,799
Why do you live hard, Chief Editor?

286
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,598
Of course, to feed my wife and kids.

287
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:56,367
I don't have anyone to feed. Why am I living hard?

288
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,766
What do you mean?

289
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:05,699
What's my purpose in toiling away and earning money?

290
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't know and I feel empty.

291
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,365
You feel empty?

292
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,232
You're a success.

293
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:15,034
If I were you,

294
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,200
I'd think life was so fun and exciting.

295
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,732
Why?

296
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,065
Just as you said,

297
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:26,632
you don't have a family to take care of.

298
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,599
You have more than enough money.

299
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,998
You can use all that on yourself to enjoy life.

300
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:38,400
If I were you, I'd go crazy.

301
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,633
How much does all this cost?

302
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,266
It's so good.

303
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:07,365
I'm enjoying this luxury thanks to you.

304
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,499
Have as much as you want.

305
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,566
What do you think?

306
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:14,665
Eating good food at a high-end restaurant releases endorphins, right?

307
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:19,390
You think life is good, that life is fun, right?

308
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,167
Why are you already...

309
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,900
Are you already done?

310
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,470
Yes.

311
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,690
I guess...

312
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,160
I'm not the type to feel joy eating expensive food like this.

313
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm sorry, sir.

314
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,899
You wasted money on this because of me.

315
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:47,932
It's okay.

316
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:50,199
At least you enjoy the food.

317
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,460
Please keep eating.

318
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,765
Don't be so disappointed, sir.

319
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:06,365
Fun in life isn't just in food.

320
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:12,267
If I were you, I'd really go crazy.

321
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,632
What's that?

322
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:16,832
Did a partner company send it?

323
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,966
No.

324
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,032
It's mine. I bought it.

325
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,999
I set the shipping address to the office by mistake.

326
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,499
What did you buy?

327
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,265
Okay.

328
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:28,366
Unboxing! It's showtime!

329
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,133
Tada!

330
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,266
Wow, it's so pretty!

331
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,499
Isn't it the same as what you're wearing?

332
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,665
Open your eyes.

333
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,264
How are they the same?

334
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:41,431
This is brown.

335
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:42,865
This is dark brown.

336
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,499
They're totally different.

337
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,431
 What's so different?

338
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:47,632
 They're the same.

339
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,900
But this one's the bomb.

340
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,332
Ta-da!

341
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,766
Isn't that exactly the same?

342
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,898
I don't believe your sense of fashion.

343
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,998
This is one size bigger.

344
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,133
This is slim fit.

345
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,765
This is over fit.

346
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:05,232
They're completely different.

347
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,998
 How are they different?

348
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,366
 She's so wasteful.

349
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,400
What's this?

350
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,898
How is that different?

351
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:15,431
- It's the same. 
 - What?

352
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,164
I guess I forgot and bought the same thing.

353
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:20,366
I was out of it because I was so drunk.

354
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:24,765
 My heart pounded for that hopeless spender?

355
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,999
You need to get a refund.

356
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,164
I can't be bothered.

357
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:27,900
You wear it.

358
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,600
Really?

359
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:32,366
Thank you.

360
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:35,266
 My heart must've malfunctioned for a moment.

361
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:38,565
 What a waste of my heartbeat!

362
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,565
What do you think, Editor Nam?

363
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:43,033
Hey, Editor Nam!

364
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:43,666
What?

365
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,232
Why are you so spaced out?

366
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:46,732
I was?

367
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:48,800
No way.

368
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,866
What's up with him?

369
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,732
Why in the world is he so dazed?

370
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:00,866
Perhaps...

371
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:03,932
Because of this?

372
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,199
What's this?

373
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:21,865
Wow, you look like a Kingsman.

374
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,332
I'm surprised, too.

375
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,865
Like you said, seeing this transformation,

376
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:29,598
I feel life is worth living.

377
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,266
I guess I'm the type of person that feels joy in dressing up and showing off.

378
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,065
See? What did I tell you...

379
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,633
Is what I should say.

380
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:40,632
I should be happy, for your sake.

381
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:47,665
But I guess I'm not the type to feel joy wearing expensive clothes to show off.

382
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,900
Oh, is that so?

383
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:55,500
If I were you, I'd be so excited.

384
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,898
I guess it was my own dream again this time.

385
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:02,999
Well, then, why don't you try one on?

386
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,665
What?

387
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,532
Oh, oh, oh, no, sir.

388
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:14,699
Well, without you, I'd never visit a place like this.

389
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:19,565
Then since I'm here, I'll just calmly try one on.

390
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,234
Just for fun.

391
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:38,865
The premium fabric fits my body like a glove.

392
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,732
Expensive clothes are really different.

393
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:42,600
Is that so?

394
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,266
Excuse me!

395
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:50,599
Please proceed with the bill for the suit he is wearing now and the ones he tried out.

396
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,765
What?

397
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:53,965
Oh, no, sir. It's okay.

398
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,331
I was just trying them on for fun.

399
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:59,133
Just take it. It's a gift.

400
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,566
Why all of a sudden...

401
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,198
You never know.

402
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:05,965
As I become more generous, I might feel joy in such acts.

403
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,467
What?

404
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:28,700
Umm... Sir...

405
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,467
Why Jejudo Island all of a sudden...

406
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,332
And first class at that...

407
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:39,031
You said if you were me, you'd go on a day trip to see Jejudo's emerald sea via first class.

408
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:41,100
Enjoy it.

409
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,866
Why are you doing this for me...?

410
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:49,332
Seeing you so happy, I think it makes me happy, too.

411
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:50,565
Sir?

412
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:55,832
I guess I'm the type that feels joy in being generous.

413
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:58,466
Oh, I see.

414
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,466
Then that's a relief.

415
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,400
Editor Na.

416
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,266
Editor Na!

417
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,698
What?

418
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,733
Oh, Photographer Shin!

419
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,733
I was organizing the interview recording.

420
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,632
Aren't you working too hard?

421
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,165
Not at all.

422
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,232
It's something I want to write so it's not hard.

423
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:40,365
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

424
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:43,599
- Let's go eat. 
 - What?

425
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,866
You said we couldn't be convenience store mates because you're preparing to study fine art.

426
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:51,099
Today, let's go somewhere else instead of there.

427
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,866
Where?

428
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,366
I've never been to a place like this.

429
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:57,965
Thank you.

430
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:01,633
The food is so good and the photos are wonderful.

431
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,832
I'm glad you like it.

432
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,733
Seeing the photos reminds me of something.

433
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:10,165
People only see what they want to,

434
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:14,799
but a photo records every single thing

435
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,198
it saw in the same time and place.

436
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,166
I read it in an article a photographer wrote.

437
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,165
- That's correctly put. 
 - Right? I thought so, too.

438
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,598
Right? I thought so, too.

439
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,599
Especially now that I see the photos here.

440
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:32,699
Want to go out for a walk?

441
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:38,566
Thank you for caring for me.

442
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:42,433
I think you're a really nice person.

443
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,400
Thanks.

444
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,499
But you don't have to worry about me now.

445
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,865
What?

446
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:49,865
I know.

447
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:54,965
That you know about me and CEO Yoo.

448
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:58,400
That you're trying hard to comfort me.

449
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:05,231
But I'm really fine now, so you don't have to...

450
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,966
It's not comforting.

451
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:10,432
- I like you. 
 - What?

452
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,966
I'm not trying to comfort you.

453
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:14,434
I'm doing this because I like you.

454
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:18,967
This isn't how I wanted to confess.

455
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,065
Photographer Shin...

456
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:25,299
I know.

457
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,499
You're taken aback.

458
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:34,332
But I'm not asking you to give me an answer right now.

459
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:38,900
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

460
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,765
Until you're okay, until your wound heals,

461
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:46,132
I'll wait by your side.

462
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:50,532
I can do that, right?

463
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:07,267
I'm home.

464
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:10,264
The kids will be home soon. Wash up and sleep.

465
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:13,333
I don't even get a glance?

466
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,966
What's this Hallabong?

467
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,765
Oh, boy. What's that suit?

468
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:26,700
- Where did you get the money... 
 - The CEO bought this for me as a gift.

469
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,031
I'm respected this much at work.

470
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:33,467
Then ask him to give you a raise.

471
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:38,499
What are you looking at?

472
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,399
Proposals of constructors bidding for the reconstruction.

473
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,733
It's giving me a headache. I shouldn't have become the representative.

474
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,832
You made such a fuss to be it.

475
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:58,040
Oh, well. Let's tidy up and go to bed.

476
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,760

477
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,866
What?

478
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:02,867
Damyung Construction?

479
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:06,365
Hold on. Where did I hear that name?

480
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:08,065
 Damyung Construction?

481
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,365
 It's a company CEO Yoo invested in.

482
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:10,333
Right!

483
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:13,067
Oh! That's right! It's that Damyung!

484
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:17,532
Oh! They placed a bid.

485
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:19,067
What?

486
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:22,031
 My wife ended up taking the job.

487
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,832
 Really?

488
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:27,499
As soon as he heard that, he suddenly...

489
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,765
 Let's go get some fresh air.

490
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:32,531
He said there's no fun in life and he enjoys being generous.

491
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:36,966
Is this a highly advanced strategy to win the bid?

492
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,332
 As long as you enjoy the food.

493
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,799
 Please keep eating.

494
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,999
 Put the suit he's wearing right now and all the suits he tried on on my account.

495
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:48,932
 Seeing you so happy, I think it makes me happy, too.

496
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,266
It was all a bribe?

497
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,932
CEO Yoo is such a clever scum.

498
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,966
Clever scum.

499
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,370

500
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,532
 Do you want to become convenience store mates?

501
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:31,165
 Are you still holding off on getting a boyfriend?

502
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,031
 But you never know what'll happen, right?

503
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:35,566
 I hope you stop hurting.

504
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:39,132
 I hope your wound is healed soon.

505
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,966
 It's not comforting.

506
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:46,266
 I like you.

507
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,733
Welcome, sir.

508
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,765
Good morning, sir.

509
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:32,300
You're here.

510
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,766
- What time is today's meeting? 
 - Three o'clock.

511
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,767
Can we... push the meeting

512
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,299
to tomorrow?

513
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,733
I'm very tired today.

514
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:47,665
As you know, our schedule yesterday was packed.

515
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:51,098
Oh, okay. Let's do it tomorrow.

516
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,966
 I was right.

517
00:30:55,967 --> 00:31:00,631
Chief Editor. Why are you acting like that to the CEO?

518
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:03,032
I'm more shocked that he's letting it slide.

519
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:07,466
I can show you more shocking things if I want to.

520
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:08,698
What do you mean?

521
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:13,099
Never mind.

522
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:18,432
Should I suck him dry?

523
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,566
What time should we have the meeting tomorrow?

524
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:25,399
I don't know.

525
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,433
For me...

526
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,466
The morning is good.

527
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:35,000
Can we do tomorrow's meeting the day after?

528
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,765
You see, I plan

529
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:39,933
- to be tired until tomorrow. 
 - What?

530
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:42,299
You said you enjoy being generous.

531
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,099
You can be that generous.

532
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:46,431
Oh, well. Okay, then.

533
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:50,866
Since you're being generous, take me to a hot spring.

534
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,866
So that I can relieve my fatigue.

535
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:55,132
Okay. Yuseong Hot Springs is nearby.

536
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:57,399
No. Not in Korea.

537
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:58,865
Overseas. What?

538
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:00,633
Broaden the scale.

539
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:03,233
Well. If you want, then okay.

540
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,366
Stop!

541
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,499
Sir. I'm very disappointed in you.

542
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:10,866
Do you feel joy in being generous?

543
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:13,700
- You're not seeking some other kind of joy? 
 - What?

544
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,865
What do you mean...?

545
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:17,031
Damyung Construction that you invested in!

546
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:19,633
They're bidding for my apartment reconstruction.

547
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:22,800
That's why you bribed me.

548
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,133
But I want to tell you.

549
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:27,498
I'm not a man to waver because of bribes.

550
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:30,200
I don't have money! But I at least have integrity!

551
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,566
- Don't live like that... 
 - The investment.

552
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:33,899
I'll pull the plug on it.

553
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,099
I'll break it off with Damyung Construction.

554
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:40,933
- What? 
 - I forgot that apartment was where you lived.

555
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:43,965
It wasn't a bribe...?

556
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:46,265
I can't invest when such misunderstandings exist.

557
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,165
I will withdraw my investment.

558
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:49,331
Sir?

559
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:50,966
You don't have to go that far...

560
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,931
Oh! There's another thing I must withdraw.

561
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,332
The money I spent on the hotel lunch, the suits,

562
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:56,632
and the plane ticket to Jejudo Island.

563
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:59,467
I withdraw my intention of gifting them to you.

564
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,565
Pay me back in full.

565
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:04,300
What? Sir!

566
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,665
I wasn't thinking straight.

567
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:09,098
I thought I might live enjoying being generous,

568
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:11,933
but that joy has gone as well.

569
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:15,432
What joy is there to live for now?

570
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,700
- What's this? 
 - Her job? Content creator.

571
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,866
Her age? Two years younger than you.

572
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,833
- So? 
 - I'm setting you up.

573
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:28,166
- Why all of a sudden? 
 - You need to live a new life now.

574
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,100
What do you think?

575
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,431
She's pretty.

576
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:34,934
- But she's not my type. 
 - What?

577
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,598
I like long hair. Not short hair.

578
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,832
Jeez. She can always grow it out.

579
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:40,867
Then I'll meet her when she does.

580
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:42,367
Darn it.

581
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,432
How long? How long does it have to be?

582
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:49,066
I'm not sure.

583
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:51,533
As long as yours?

584
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,600
Why I ought to...

585
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,167
As long as mine?

586
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,800
Florist. Same age as us.

587
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,832
Cute, right?

588
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,631
Her hair is as long as mine.

589
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:06,732
You're right. She's beautiful.

590
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:08,131
Right? Then I'll call her...

591
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,434
- But she's not my type. 
 - What?

592
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,531
Why?

593
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:15,965
Her hair is long, but she's short. I'll meet her when she's taller.

594
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:17,698
What are you talking about?

595
00:34:17,698 --> 00:34:19,064
How can she grow taller at this age?

596
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:22,566
If she drinks a lot of milk and plays basketball, who knows?

597
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:23,965
Her growth plates might open up again.

598
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:25,632
Why I ought to...

599
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,466
How tall does she have to be?

600
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:32,866
I'm not sure.

601
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:35,500
- As tall as you? 
 - Jeez!

602
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,198
Nam Sang Soon, you're unbelievable.

603
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:39,064
Why are you suddenly being so picky?

604
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:41,499
Why are you so anxious to set me up?

605
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,032
I told you to live a new life.

606
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:46,366
Stop thinking useless thoughts and meet someone!

607
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,733
Hello? Yes.

608
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:51,567
I'll be there.

609
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,200
Seriously!

610
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,899
 Useless thoughts?

611
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,867
 No way.

612
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,999
 Does she know my heart pounded because of her?

613
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:11,400
 She's pushing me away to meet someone else?

614
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,100
Unbelievable.

615
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't have any feelings for you now.

616
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,900
I found this while preparing for this month's article.

617
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,432
I wanted you to know.

618
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:26,065
Sunbaenim!

619
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:29,299
You can apply if you have the qualifications.

620
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,298
I think you do.

621
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,233
Thank you.

622
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,732
But...

623
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,365
I already applied.

624
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:38,766
What?

625
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,232
 Study the qualifications and apply for it.

626
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:52,432
 If there is welfare you can get, you should search aggressively and get it.

627
00:35:52,432 --> 00:35:54,931
 Oh... Thank you.

628
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:56,698
 It's not for you.

629
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,964
 It's for the company.

630
00:35:58,964 --> 00:36:01,332
 Your residence must be stable for you to work hard.

631
00:36:01,332 --> 00:36:04,799
He knew I was staying at the office.

632
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,999
I guess he heard everything we said that time.

633
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:13,065
He speaks coldly, but I think he's a really good person.

634
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,166
Pharmacist. Same hair length and height as me.

635
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,599
There's no one else that matches your terms.

636
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,833
- So... 
 - I'll meet her.

637
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,899
Really? Great!

638
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:33,266
Hey, Yeo Ui Joo! You're not the only one that's happy.

639
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:34,732
I'm happy, too!

640
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,899
I'm meeting a girl that has the same hair length

641
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:40,999
and height as you, but is much better than you!

642
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,733
Great. So good luck.

643
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,899
I'll call her right now!

644
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,632
Okay!

645
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,031
Now she'll know

646
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:54,432
that I don't have feelings for her.

647
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:57,332
How dare she think of me like that!

648
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,390

649
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,468
Oh, Hyungnim! Where are you going?

650
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:06,198
I have some matters to attend to.

651
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,898
Where are you guys coming from...?

652
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:10,366
Hey! Shin Gyeom!

653
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,332
What's up with him?

654
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,133
Keep up the good work.

655
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,566
What's with this vibe?

656
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,865
Hey. What's with you?

657
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:38,767
What?

658
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:41,199
You gave up on your crush for him.

659
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,899
Why are you blowing cold now?

660
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:47,600
Why? Are you regretting doing that now?

661
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,898
Don't try to look cool.

662
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:52,665
You're not the only one who sacrificed for love.

663
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:53,865
Because of you, someone else...

664
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:55,898
They broke up.

665
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,566
- What? 
 - Those two...

666
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:00,165
They broke up.

667
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:02,532
Hyung dumped her. Without any warning.

668
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:05,032
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

669
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,699
I guess I didn't know him that well.

670
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:12,333
I didn't think he would hurt someone like that.

671
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,367
What the...

672
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,531
You heard?

673
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:27,399
Editor Nam is going on a blind date.

674
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,698
Yes.

675
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:31,932
You should go on a date as a fresh start, too.

676
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:33,832
I know a guy from college who's really great.

677
00:38:33,832 --> 00:38:36,331
He's also a romanticist.

678
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:39,066
You should meet a guy like him.

679
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,700
Someone who only sees you.

680
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,766
I should.

681
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,365
That would be right...

682
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,967
What's wrong?

683
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,833
I wish CEO Yoo were a bad person.

684
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:05,500
Then I'd be able to get over him more easily.

685
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,299
Why does he have to be a good person?

686
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:13,267
What are you talking about?

687
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,865
Stop crying!

688
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,832
Young Won...

689
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,365
They're the same clothes, but she says they aren't.

690
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:46,398
So many parcels for Editor Yeo come to the office.

691
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:48,565
She is so thoughtless. Tsk, tsk.

692
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,698
The food's going cold. You should eat.

693
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:52,465
The pasta here is good.

694
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:54,099
Since you mentioned pasta, that reminds me.

695
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:55,832
You know how Editor Yeo goes crazy over pasta?

696
00:39:55,832 --> 00:39:58,666
When she sees pasta, she's like...

697
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,898
She sucks it in like a vacuum cleaner.

698
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,432
She eats so voraciously.

699
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:05,434
I see.

700
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,499
Oh. I heard you won a subscription.

701
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:10,865
Did Editor Yeo tell you even that?

702
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:14,067
Oh, come on. Seriously.

703
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,599
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,432
Since you brought that up, it reminds me.

705
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:21,399
I was in line to apply for a subscription.

706
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:23,532
But I suddenly had to go to the bathroom.

707
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:25,532
So I texted Editor Yeo.

708
00:40:25,532 --> 00:40:28,100
- I promised to set her up if she... 
 - Excuse me.

709
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,966
- Yes? 
 - Do you like Ui Joo?

710
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,132
What... Are you...

711
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,766
Editor Yeo is just a colleague!

712
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:43,531
It seems like she's more than that.

713
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:45,732
It looks like you already like her a lot.

714
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:47,466
That's nonsense!

715
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:49,531
If I did, would I be here?

716
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:53,399
She's the type of woman that's impossible to like.

717
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:57,233
- Don't get me wrong. 
 - I don't think I'm getting you wrong.

718
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:58,766
Well, then.

719
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,132
I'll be going now.

720
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,367
What is she saying?

721
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:10,866
What nonsense.

722
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,599
Are you leaving now?

723
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,698
Oh, yes.

724
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:23,965
It's late. I'll drive you home.

725
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,632
No, it's okay.

726
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:27,531
It's because I want to.

727
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:29,032
Let's go.

728
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:31,999
Photographer Shin.

729
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:37,465
I have something to say.

730
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:43,000
- Photographer Shin, I— 
 - Wait.

731
00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:46,066
Those words...

732
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,665
- Could I not hear what it is? 
 - What?

733
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:52,699
I think I know what you're about to say.

734
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:57,800
But a person's heart

735
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,133
might change as time goes by.

736
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:07,400
When the storm in you ceases,

737
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:12,633
and what you want to say hasn't changed,

738
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:18,033
you can tell me then.

739
00:42:29,532 --> 00:42:31,132
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

740
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:32,533
Hello.

741
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:36,200
Sir! Good morning.

742
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:37,833
Chief Editor...

743
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,465
Why are there so many empty seats?

744
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:41,132
Editor Yeo is out to cover a story.

745
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:43,531
Editor Na has gone to her home in Chuncheon.

746
00:42:43,531 --> 00:42:46,799
- She submitted a leave of absence a few days ago. 
 - Why did she go to Chuncheon?

747
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:50,032
I don't know what's going on in my home, how should I know about hers?

748
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,933
Get to work!

749
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,666
Sir, I did well...

750
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:03,900
Of course, he doesn't want to talk to me.

751
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,799
He won't want to treat me like a human being.

752
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,898
 Why did she go to Chuncheon?

753
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:17,133
 I hope nothing bad has happened.

754
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:21,600
Why do you want to know?

755
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,666
What right do you have?

756
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,466
Come in.

757
00:43:28,533 --> 00:43:30,233
What is it?

758
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:38,732
Well... I calculated how much I have to pay back to you.

759
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:44,598
The hotel restaurant lunch, suits,

760
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:48,532
first class ticket... Add all that and it's...

761
00:43:48,532 --> 00:43:51,099
What about the Hallabong I bought you in Jejudo?

762
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,765
What about the Omegi rice cakes you ate?

763
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:58,932
If I add them, it's about...

764
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,666
5.8 million won ($5,800)...

765
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:05,467
Stop. Let's stop this.

766
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:08,698
Getting that money from you means nothing to me.

767
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:10,265
Just leave and do your work.

768
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:11,766
Really?

769
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,933
Thank you, sir!

770
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:17,565
I'm so sorry for misunderstanding you.

771
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:20,766
Just get out before I change my mind...

772
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:46,067
Nam Sang Soon, are you crazy?

773
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:47,632
Yikes! You scared me.

774
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:51,233
You scared me! I got you the girl that fits your terms perfectly.

775
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:53,798
- But you turned her down? 
 - She said I turned her down?

776
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:56,232
Shut it! I did all I could.

777
00:44:56,232 --> 00:44:58,064
Live alone for the rest of your life.

778
00:44:58,065 --> 00:45:01,700
Live a pitiful single life until the day you die.

779
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:06,000
What?

780
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,131
I don't think I deserve such a curse.

781
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,833
I understand why she's angry.

782
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,599
- She did that because she was worried about you. 
 - What?

783
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,531
 What's up with him?

784
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:18,999
 Why in the world is he so dazed?

785
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,100
 Perhaps...

786
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:26,034
 What's this?

787
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:31,733
 She was worried you'd be troubled by your ex getting married.

788
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,733
 I told you to live a new life.

789
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:40,132
 Stop thinking useless thoughts and meet someone!

790
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:45,399
 So, she did that because she was worried about me?

791
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:51,132
Why are you looking at this?

792
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:54,431
You're not thinking of going to the wedding to throw a tantrum, are you?

793
00:45:54,431 --> 00:45:56,499
Don't you dare!

794
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,066
 That's right.

795
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:04,032
 I should be thinking about ruining her wedding.

796
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:07,766
 But why am I thinking only about Ui Joo?

797
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:11,565
 Do you like Ui Joo?

798
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:13,066
Yes.

799
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,167
I think I do.

800
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:20,733
- Is something up with the CEO? 
 - What?

801
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,132
He's so down these days.

802
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:27,098
He says there's no joy in life, and that he doesn't know why he's making money.

803
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,165
So he spends money recklessly.

804
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,900
- He did? 
 - Yes.

805
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,565
He's so drained like he's about to die tomorrow.

806
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:37,632
You're close with the CEO.

807
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:39,899
Do you know anything?

808
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:42,866
No.

809
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:51,167
Umm, Gyeom.

810
00:46:52,899 --> 00:46:59,665
Maybe Hyungnim... is suffering because he broke up with Editor Na.

811
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:01,265
Why would he suffer?

812
00:47:01,265 --> 00:47:03,199
Editor Na is suffering a lot more.

813
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,332
He dumped her so heartlessly.

814
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,965
He has no right to be sad.

815
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:10,898
He might not have broken up because he wanted to.

816
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:15,632
He might've learned something and felt guilty.

817
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:19,200
He might have sacrificed himself for your love.

818
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,967
What are you talking about?

819
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:31,032
Your cooking is the best.

820
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:33,199
Make sure you chew.

821
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,998
Someone said that food is a switch for happy memories.

822
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:45,064
When I think about the food you made for me,

823
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:48,665
it reminds me of how happy I was when I ate it.

824
00:47:50,032 --> 00:47:55,567
I guess that's why your food comes to mind in hard times.

825
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:57,166
Why?

826
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,333
Are you having a rough time?

827
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,565
No.

828
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:04,966
I was thinking.

829
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,231
Dad might be like that, too.

830
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:12,566
Dad might be somewhere, longing for the food you cooked.

831
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:14,300
Forget it.

832
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:18,665
He abandoned his family to make it on his own.

833
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:21,132
He's no good so why would you bring him up?

834
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:23,965
Don't be like that. Why do you keep saying that?

835
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:25,866
You think I'm wrong?

836
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,265
From now on, don't come visit on this day.

837
00:48:32,265 --> 00:48:35,432
It's not his memorial or his birthday. It's the day he left us.

838
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:37,100
So don't come.

839
00:48:38,232 --> 00:48:41,033
I was worried you might feel lonely.

840
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:47,565
No time for that when I'm trying to make a living.

841
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:55,967
Dad's picture used to be there.

842
00:48:57,866 --> 00:49:00,532
I threw it away. I couldn't stand the sight of him.

843
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:02,132
Mom...

844
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:04,299
I'll get you more soup.

845
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,966
You didn't throw it away...

846
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:45,100
Come in.

847
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:55,231
 Aren't you going home?

848
00:49:55,232 --> 00:49:57,266
I will.

849
00:49:57,266 --> 00:50:03,765
Well... Do you feel like going for a drink?

850
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,633
Thank you. For caring about me.

851
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:19,565
So just forget about that Cutie Pie/Cheating Witch,

852
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:23,232
- and make a fresh start. 
 - Okay.

853
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:27,632
For me, personally, I can forgive everything else.

854
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:30,332
But I can never forgive cheaters.

855
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,798
They must meet their doom!

856
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:35,898
Okay. I got it. Let's stop talking about that.

857
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,064
Oh, okay.

858
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:40,499
Anyway, cheer up, all right?

859
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay.

860
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:44,933
Oh, dear!

861
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:45,767
- Oh, no! 
 - Ouch, hot!

862
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,400
- Here. 
 - Ouch, hot!

863
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:02,465
I think it's fine.

864
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:05,266
Jeez, that gave me a start.

865
00:51:05,266 --> 00:51:07,866
I don't think your cheek got burned.

866
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,000
Editor Yeo. No, no.

867
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,365
- Yeo Ui Joo! 
 - What?

868
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,733
You really are bad for my heart.

869
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:26,964
What?

870
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:30,499
I'm not bad for your heart. I'm bad for your liver!

871
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,866
- Drink up! 
 - No.

872
00:51:31,866 --> 00:51:33,398
You're bad for my heart.

873
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,365
Because of you, my heart...

874
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:37,466
Hold on.  Excuse me.

875
00:51:37,466 --> 00:51:38,833
Okay.

876
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,700
Hello? What?

877
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,232
Oh, okay.

878
00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:46,333
Thank you.

879
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,965
Ui Joo. Because of you, my heart...

880
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:50,800
Can I hear about your heart later?

881
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,998
- I have to go right now. 
 - What? Where?

882
00:51:52,998 --> 00:51:56,532
My parcel was delivered to the office again. I have to go and get it.

883
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:58,532
You can get it tomorrow.

884
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,132
No. Marinated crab can go bad quickly.

885
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:05,231
I have to take it home and put it in the fridge. See you tomorrow.

886
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:09,200
Wait. Hey, hey, Ui Joo, Ui Joo...

887
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:15,899
Did I just lose to marinated crab?

888
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,966
Why order something so expensive?

889
00:52:24,399 --> 00:52:26,267
Seriously.

890
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,666

891
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,431

892
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:35,565

893
00:52:35,565 --> 00:52:38,700
Rich guy?

894
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:43,000
What's this?

895
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:55,566
Oh, sir. Go easy.

896
00:52:55,566 --> 00:52:56,900
You never know.

897
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,930
I might feel joy while drinking.

898
00:53:04,832 --> 00:53:07,766
I don't know why you're doing this,

899
00:53:07,766 --> 00:53:10,098
but you need to have joy in your life.

900
00:53:10,098 --> 00:53:13,698
So I did a lot of hard thinking.

901
00:53:13,698 --> 00:53:18,180
I traced back all the years I lived and thought about

902
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,530
when life was worth living.

903
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:26,199
That was when I loved someone.

904
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:31,065
When I loved and was loved in return...

905
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:34,230
I think it was then.

906
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:40,600
Money isn't everything in life.

907
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,730
Sir.

908
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,933
Date someone.

909
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:55,165
Compared to that, eating good food, buying good clothes,

910
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,999
and traveling alone is nothing.

911
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:59,400
When you love someone...

912
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:03,370
When you can just be with that person...

913
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,730
♫  Always be my side  ♫

914
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,166
 People are staring.

915
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,965
 Who cares?

916
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,799
 We can't show that we're dating at work,

917
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:26,360
 so I want to show off here.

918
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:35,920
♫  Even things you couldn’t ask me  ♫

919
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,780
♫  Are okay with me, if it’s you  ♫

920
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:48,190
 Make a wish and blow out the candle.

921
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:54,960
♫  Even feelings that you can’t figure out  ♫

922
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,400
Sir.

923
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,933
Please, date, okay?

924
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:04,232
If I were you,

925
00:55:04,232 --> 00:55:10,140
I would go crazy.

926
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,670
♫  Tell me  ♫

927
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,066
 Actually, I told him.

928
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,866
 That you like Editor Na.

929
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:23,600
 What?

930
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,899
 When I saw you lying in the hospital,

931
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:30,480
 I got so angry that I couldn't help it.

932
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,390

933
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,532
 Photographer Shin! It's me.

934
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,032
Chief Editor?

935
00:55:46,032 --> 00:55:47,831
Sir!

936
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:50,299
Get up, sir!

937
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:53,600
Come on, sir!

938
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,567
What?

939
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,632
Why did you come? I said I'll take him home.

940
00:55:56,632 --> 00:55:57,799
What happened?

941
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:00,399
He drank too much.

942
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:03,832
He must really be going through something.

943
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,064
I'll take him home.

944
00:56:06,065 --> 00:56:07,198
Oh, no, no, no.

945
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:09,666
I promised to take care of him today.

946
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,933
Don't worry about it.

947
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:13,499
Sir!

948
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:15,699
You need to go home, sir!

949
00:56:15,699 --> 00:56:19,566
Hey? Open your eyes. Okay?

950
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:23,065
 Do you know the word "Semi-Roof-Study"?

951
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:27,466
 Many young one-person households live in semi-basements,

952
00:56:27,466 --> 00:56:30,266
 rooftops, and study rooms.

953
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:40,965
 They endure each day in a poor and tough space.

954
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:43,499
 The reason they can endure

955
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:47,067
 is because they have hope for the future.

956
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:54,200
 But their space is so saddening for them to endure it solely on hope.

957
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,932
Here's mine.

958
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,366
Editor Nam, what about this?

959
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:12,766
 I hope their space isn't a space they must endure,

960
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,332
 but a space that brings them comfort.

961
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:21,067
 I hope that their hope becomes a reality soon.

962
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:30,100

963
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,320
What are you doing?

964
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,700
Why are you here?

965
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,733
Go get her.

966
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:23,633
Editor Na.

967
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,065
What?

968
00:58:25,065 --> 00:58:26,866
You broke up because of me.

969
00:58:26,866 --> 00:58:32,633
Because of me, you hurt her.

970
00:58:33,399 --> 00:58:35,333
Because of me,

971
00:58:38,532 --> 00:58:40,199
you're in agony.

972
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:42,780
What are you talking about?

973
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:52,466
 Sir.

974
00:58:52,466 --> 00:58:54,599
 Are you all right?

975
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,066
 Thank you.

976
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:02,090
 For drinking with me.

977
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:12,333
 Loving someone and being loved...

978
00:59:14,866 --> 00:59:18,000
 I know that it's a huge joy in life.

979
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,167
 I know it's the reason to live.

980
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:25,399
 I know that well.

981
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:30,166
 I guess I'm suffering because I know that.

982
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:35,999
 A jerk like me

983
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:42,833
 shouldn't have known such joy at all.

984
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:02,832
Editor Na still likes you, too.

985
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,766
She hasn't gotten over you.

986
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:08,700
- What? 
 - So...

987
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,032
hurry and go get her.

988
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:15,200
- Gyeom... 
 - Don't make me more pitiful.

989
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,765
Go get her.

990
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:19,200
Go get her back.

991
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,370

992
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,580

993
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:59,733
 People only see what they want to,

994
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:03,065
 but a photo records every single thing

995
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:06,140
 it saw in the same time and place.

996
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,732
Young Won.

997
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,932
Sir...

998
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:32,233
I came because I had something to say.

999
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:33,866
What?

1000
01:01:38,266 --> 01:01:39,431
I'm sorry.

1001
01:01:39,431 --> 01:01:44,499
I know that it's disgraceful and shameless to act this way,

1002
01:01:45,267 --> 01:01:48,300
but I don't think I can live without you.

1003
01:01:56,267 --> 01:01:58,434
I can't say the same.

1004
01:01:58,434 --> 01:01:59,300
What?

1005
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,140
I don't need you anymore, sir.

1006
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,980

1007
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,780
♫  Here I am  ♫

1008
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:45,140
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

1009
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:49,060

1010
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,698
 Stop it already.

1011
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:52,698
 It's over between us.

1012
01:02:52,698 --> 01:02:54,132
 Hyung breaking up with you...

1013
01:02:54,132 --> 01:02:57,266
 He found out I liked you and did that on purpose.

1014
01:02:57,266 --> 01:03:01,932
 I don't need someone who lets go of my hand for whatever reason.

1015
01:03:01,932 --> 01:03:04,198
 Lucky you. You have someone who'll buy you a place.

1016
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:05,766
 - Honey! 
 - Honey?

1017
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:09,566
 I must tell her how I feel before my heart stops.

1018
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:13,265
 This is the freelance editor who will write your promo articles.

1019
01:03:13,265 --> 01:03:14,598
 Hello, sir.

1020
01:03:14,598 --> 01:03:16,266
 No way!

1021
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:19,098
 My stocks hit the ceiling!

1022
01:03:19,098 --> 01:03:20,733
 Rise! Rise! Rise!

1023
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:22,231
 A blind date with her?

1024
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,532
 Even Editor Na said you two look like a good fit.

1025
01:03:24,532 --> 01:03:27,620
 Are you really okay with me meeting someone else?
