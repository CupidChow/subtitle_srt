1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,960

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,560

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,320

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,900

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,170

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,510

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,280

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,260

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,720

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,790

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,231
 Are you diligently gathering seed money to become a homeowner?

12
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:59,099
 Are you using the tips that I gave you?

13
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:01,932
Oh, of course!

14
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:06,032
I'm doing the calendar well and studying hard.

15
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,232
I'm doing so well.

16
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:10,833
 You think you're doing well,

17
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,466
 but do not be prideful.

18
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:15,198
 There may come a time you want to give up.

19
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:18,299
 To persevere, set a clear picture of your desired home

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,431
 and think about it when things get tough.

21
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:24,690
 A clear goal creates great motivation.

22
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:30,665
My desired home...

23
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,566
Right.

24
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:35,750
What kind of place should I buy?

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,750
♫  Here I am  ♫

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,030
♫  A flame is  ♫

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,230
 A place I can rest without any worries.

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,760
♫  I'll be here  ♫

29
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,680
 A place I can enjoy doing things by myself.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,820
♫  Everything is just fine  ♫

31
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:57,490
 A place I can change whichever way I want to match my taste.

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,800
♫  In my heart  ♫

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,930
♫  You can come a little slower  ♫

34
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:06,033
 A place existing only for me.

35
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,500
Wait.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,710
I'm doing all that here.

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,650

38
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,020

39
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,290
♫  And I know that warm feeling  ♫

40
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,032
 You really are a good person.

41
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:29,030
 I wanted to compliment you.

42
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:37,466
As the book said, the power of a compliment is great.

43
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:41,367
I thought it only worked on simple people.

44
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:46,898
But it's turning an advanced person like me into a whale.

45
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:52,766
Yes, Secretary Hwang?

46
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,299
There's a buyer for the place you're living in.

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,398
Okay. Start the contract process tomorrow.

48
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:01,433
Move my stuff to another empty place.

49
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,765
Sunbae!

50
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:09,799
Hi, Young Won.

51
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,633
What are you doing?

52
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,299
I'm looking for my hand cream.

53
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,299
I guess I didn't bring it.

54
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,866
I'll lend you mine.

55
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,367
Thanks.

56
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,032
Not again.

57
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,832
What's wrong?

58
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,290
This bag is acting up these days.

59
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:32,833
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,165
It's okay.

61
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,598
I get that you're saving up, but isn't this going too far?

62
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,166
The zipper is one thing, but look at the state of this bag.

63
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,498
What's this? "Buti"?

64
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:48,765
It used to be "beautiful." The letters fell off.

65
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:52,366
So, now it looks so pitiful.

66
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,499
Don't be like that. Buy a new bag.

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,265
It's still useable.

68
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,800
I need to save to buy a place.

69
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,366
Here.

70
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,965
Wow. Are you telling me to use this?

71
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,666
Not to throw it away?

72
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,599
Give it here.

73
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,567
I can still use it

74
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,000
two or three times more.

75
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,532
There.

76
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,131
Yeah, you'll definitely buy a place.

77
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,499
Very soon, I think!

78
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,399
Right?

79
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,790
♫  Flashing lights surround me  ♫

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,760
♫  I wish time could just stop where I'm at  ♫

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,940
♫  But I'm not gonna cry, yeah  ♫

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,490
♫  Once the lights turn off,  ♫

83
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,533
Stop that!

84
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,740
Hideous.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,499
So it's Subscription Mania all over again.

86
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,099
Is it Rain's "Gang" this time?

87
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,264
How can you come to work dressed like that?

88
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:31,032
We should "gang" up on you and kick you out.

89
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,699
 Just like the dazzling lights covering me,

90
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,067
 I feel like I've become the star of this world.

91
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:39,034
What are you doing? Speak.

92
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,099
 I went to a psychic before tomorrow's random subscription.

93
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,899
 She said I'll get it if I spare my words.

94
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,000
 So I'm not going to talk at all.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,998
You're really something.

96
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,232
At least it's not noisy.

97
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:53,932
 I have a really good feeling this time.

98
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,966
 I think I'll get it.

99
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,898
 Since I'm feeling so good.

100
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:01,798
He's loud even when he's not talking.

101
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:06,632
But the CEO is in this chat room, too.

102
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,966
Why you...!

103
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,910
Stop.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,366
Let's give a round of applause to Editor Nam.

105
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,665
Your tenacity to win a subscription!

106
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,867
I highly compliment that.

107
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,164
I don't know when, but I believe that one day

108
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:38,199
you'll be just as tenacious in your work.

109
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:48,033
Which subway station restroom did you steal that from?

110
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,232
What's up with the CEO?

111
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,201
Why does he keep complimenting us?

112
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,232
I know, right?

113
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:57,767
He would usually get angry in that situation.

114
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,699
Well...

115
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,699
I should tell you...

116
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,166
Then the CEO's compliments were real?

117
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,333
Indeed.

118
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,733
I thought he was laying the groundwork to fire us.

119
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,580
It's a relief that it's not.

120
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,765
You know,

121
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:18,699
if you want the compliments to continue, be careful.

122
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,631
So the CEO doesn't find out.

123
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,250
Okay.

124
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,920
I need this...

125
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,898
He found out.

126
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,131
What? What do you mean?

127
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,132
Stop.

128
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:41,164
S-S-S-S-Sir!

129
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,366
What did you mean just now?

130
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,631
Laying the groundwork to fire you?

131
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,232
Oh, well...

132
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,932
Since we usually don't get compliments, we misjudged your intent.

133
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:57,080
So you worked that hard not to get fired?

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,460
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,631
We won't misunderstand it anymore,

136
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:03,400
so please continue with the compliments...

137
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,599
Or not.

138
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,350
Are you being serious right now?

139
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,366
What do we do?

140
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,999
Compliments are for people who deserve it.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,398
They're not even as good as whales.

142
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,640
I wasted time and money.

143
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,667
Yes, CEO Oh.

144
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,866
We're here.

145
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:51,133
Pardon?

146
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,867
Oh, no.

147
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,067
Okay. I understand.

148
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,099
What is it?

149
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:59,967
CEO Oh's dog is sick.

150
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,366
She had to go to the vet.

151
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:06,698
She asked if we could do the interview when we shoot tomorrow.

152
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,098
What?

153
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,100
But we're already here. What in the...

154
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,165
Seriously.

155
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,030
I must say something.

156
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,300
Why isn't she picking up?

157
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:25,332
 You're a good person.

158
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,332
 Hello?

159
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:32,660
CEO Oh! I called to have a word...

160
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,265
 Her dog is sick.

161
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,933
 You won't yell at her.

162
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:40,534
 Will you?

163
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,099
CEO Yoo?

164
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,430
I called to have a word.

165
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,767
To give a word of comfort.

166
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,432
Is your dog very sick?

167
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,999
Hang in there.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,700
Let's go.

169
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,433
What was that?

170
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:16,033
I thought he would get angry.

171
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,432
Mi Ra. Where's the CEO?

172
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,365
He went to cover a story with Editor Na.

173
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:40,233
Oh, okay.

174
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,232
Since he's not saying anything, he'll let this slide, right?

175
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:48,832
It looks like it.

176
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,333
But you never know when he'll explode.

177
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,598
Whatever. I'll deal with that then.

178
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,165
It's good he let this slide.

179
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:02,367
Ouch, my neck.

180
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,067
I'm dying here.

181
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,965
I don't know why I'm so tired these days.

182
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,265
Stop drinking every day. Take vitamins.

183
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,098
 Since you brought up vitamins...

184
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:14,766
 My cutie pie said she'll pray I win the subscription...

185
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,231
Tell Editor Na to leave the chat room, too.

186
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:19,598
And make a new chat room without Editor Nam.

187
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,833
Don't include him.

188
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,199
Oh! Who's covering the architect Lee Hyun Suk?

189
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,264
Oh. That's...

190
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,200
That's...

191
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,833
 It's me.

192
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,866
Who was that?

193
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,332
Who was that bastard?

194
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,231
 You all don't want to read your texts, so I'm talking like this. 
 (T/N: he is using a text to speech app)

195
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,899
Why I ought to...

196
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,000
I should delete him, not the chat room.

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,133
 I just really want to win the subscription.

198
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:50,533
 - I just really want to win the subscription.  
 - Stop!

199
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,634
Oh. Okay.

200
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,264
Yes, I'm nearby.

201
00:11:57,265 --> 00:12:00,698
 Why do I keep thinking about her compliment?

202
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,399
Okay.

203
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,332
Excuse me, Sir.

204
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:08,332
Sir?

205
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,665
Yes?

206
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,966
Let me off at the bus stop over there, please.

207
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,766
Why?

208
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:19,766
Mi Ra commissioned an item at a workshop near here.

209
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,465
It's done earlier than expected,

210
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,399
so I'm picking it up on my way back.

211
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,800
Okay, then.

212
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,567
See you tomorrow.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Goodbye!

214
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:44,667
 You're a good person.

215
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:48,134
 You won't let me go alone.

216
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,932
 Will you?

217
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,633
Thank you. I could've come alone.

218
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:13,199
It's an item our company needs.

219
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,067
I don't mean anything by this.

220
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,800
Of course.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,598
Here.

222
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,833
Thank you.

223
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,899
So you can make it yourself here.

224
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,231
It's amazing.

225
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,064
Would you like to try it since you're here?

226
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:36,032
For you, it's free.

227
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,067
For free?

228
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,499
It's okay. I'm working right now.

229
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:42,999
I'm going on a survey.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,298
Suddenly?

231
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:48,432
I've wanted to survey this area for a long time.

232
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,231
Oh, okay. Well...

233
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:53,065
Then what should I...

234
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,200
Kill time by making that.

235
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,700
- Really? 
 - I'm off.

236
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,266
 Single apartment buildings with a few households.

237
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,566
 Low profitability because

238
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,899
 it's hard to establish a residence belt line

239
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,400
 like a hospital and huge box stores.

240
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:20,933
 You can't go to the subway station without taking the bus.

241
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:26,699
 On the subway, you have to transfer twice,

242
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,266
 and pass fifteen stops to get to downtown Seoul.

243
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,933
 Accessibility is extremely poor.

244
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:41,400
 In a word, it has no investment value.

245
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,167
 So then... why am I wasting my time surveying this place?

246
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,432
 I know compliments can make a whale dance,

247
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:51,967
 but isn't this too much dancing?

248
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:53,631
 I, Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung?

249
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:55,234
Right! Stop!

250
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:57,100
Yoo Ja Sung...

251
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,199
Get a grip!

252
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,734
Editor Na Zero Won! Let's go right this...

253
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,660
♫  I like the bright mornings  ♫

254
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,430
♫  You like the starry nights  ♫

255
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,530
♫  We’re so different  ♫

256
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,100
♫  We’rе so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

257
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,500
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

258
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,580
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

259
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,690
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

260
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,100
♫  You know this too  ♫

261
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,932
You're back.

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,365
Sir. This is for you.

263
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:55,733
What?

264
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,865
Why are you giving me this?

265
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:04,933
I decided to be a homeowner thanks to you.

266
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:10,033
The tips from your videos give me hope.

267
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:14,064
It's not much, but it's a token of my gratitude to my mentor.

268
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,399
Oh, well.

269
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,600
I'll go take off this apron.

270
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,290

271
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,800

272
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,134
 - Why are you sighing?  
 - Yikes.

273
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:49,499
That's so weird.

274
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,399
 So, why are you sighing?

275
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,332
Because I'm lonely.

276
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,532
 What about your boyfriend?

277
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:55,533
He dumped me.

278
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,199
 Oh, I'm sorry.

279
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,232
Tell me the truth.

280
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:00,999
Am I not attractive as a woman?

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,699
Am I truly unappealing?

282
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,099
 Don't be so hard on yourself.

283
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,765
 You're a really great woman.

284
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,366
- Really? 
  - Yes.

285
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:11,298
 If you stop swiping your credit card like there's no tomorrow.

286
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:15,834
- What? 
  - Oh, and if you stop talking so meanly.

287
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:21,032
 Also, if you don't become scary when you're drunk. Oh, and...

288
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,565
Tell me to get reborn, why don't you?

289
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:24,866
 Change that twisted personality.

290
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:27,233
Why you...

291
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:30,000
Make a sound! Speak!

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,867
Make a sound, huh?

293
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:37,566
It melts in my mouth.

294
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:42,499
By the way, why are you buying me dinner?

295
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,833
It's a give and take. I'm precise when it comes to repaying.

296
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,765
It wasn't something as great as sushi.

297
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,265
I wanted to eat sushi.

298
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:53,999
If you don't like it, you can leave.

299
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,033
Oh, no, Sir.

300
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:06,733
A bottle of sake, please.

301
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,433
Okay.

302
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,398
I ordered it because I wanted to drink it.

303
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,399
If you don't like it, you don't have to drink.

304
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,100
No.

305
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,333
I am so going to drink it.

306
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:36,732
Bastard. Not one text.

307
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,900
Just forget about him.

308
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,433
 Editor Yeo. I have to poop real bad.

309
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,765
 Can you come out and hold my spot in line?

310
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:58,900
What crap is this?

311
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,866
Jeez.

312
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,466
So annoying!

313
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,266
Jeez.

314
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,031
 Editor Yeo, please...

315
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:11,198
 Please save me...

316
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:13,765
 I'm begging you... Please...

317
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:16,299
He's so annoying.

318
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:17,499
 Why ask me?

319
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,466
 Go ask your cutie pie!

320
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,699
 She'll be tired from teaching.

321
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:23,698
 I can't ask her to do this.

322
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,966
What the?!

323
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,965
 I worked, too. I'm tired, too!

324
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,531
 Do I look like a pushover? Well?

325
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:33,266
 A plastic surgeon with his own practice in Cheongdam-dong.

326
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:34,698
 If you come here, I'll set you up with him.

327
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,499
Unbelievable!

328
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:40,399
Do you think that'll make me go there at this hour?

329
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,733
So annoying.

330
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,999
What's this?

331
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:59,865
What use is this?

332
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,066
Housing prices will fall eventually.

333
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,766
 Your one o'clock.

334
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,667
How embarrassing!

335
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,332
I want to pretend I don't know him!

336
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,966
 Thanks for coming.

337
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,432
Wh-What are you doing?

338
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,432
Hey, hey!

339
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:42,732
I know it's cold, but how many pants did you put on?

340
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,965
 Stay in line, no matter what, until I return.

341
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:46,398
Okay, okay.

342
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:50,399
Hey. You have to keep your promise.

343
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:55,566
Set me up on a date tomorrow, okay?

344
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,332
Are you okay?

345
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,966
He really is something. Really...

346
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,932
You said on your channel that I should think about

347
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:41,298
the place I want to buy when things get tough.

348
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,631
Yes, I did.

349
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,666
So I thought about it

350
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:49,699
and your studio I'm living in is perfect.

351
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,566
- It's great to live in, in many ways, and— 
 - It's not about what you want to live in.

352
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:55,401
- Think of a place you want to buy. 
 - What?

353
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:58,832
If you're not going for income from rent,

354
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:01,566
it's better you get a proper apartment than a studio.

355
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:04,833
If you consider price increases and liquidity,

356
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,232
- you should save up more money... 
 - But to save up more,

357
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:10,634
I need more time.

358
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:14,966
I just want to stop worrying about rent already.

359
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,167
For me, even your studio is out of my league.

360
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,233
Then I'll wait.

361
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:30,033
Pardon?

362
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,932
I won't sell the place.

363
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:34,667
I'll try to wait until you can buy it.

364
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,532
Really?

365
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:39,365
Wow. Do you promise?

366
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:40,665
Yes.

367
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,366
Then you can't sell it to someone else, okay?

368
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:47,632
I... I'm going to save up like crazy.

369
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,966
I'm going to buy that place soon.

370
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,410
♫  You’re my love  ♫

371
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,510
♫  Please, look at me. I'll stand here  ♫

372
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:15,500
♫  Hey, because of you I felt that I had changed.  ♫

373
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,230
♫  I don't know why.  ♫

374
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,830
♫  When I find myself staring at you.  ♫

375
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,550
♫  Sometimes I feel like I'm day dreaming  ♫

387
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,567
 You really are a good person.

388
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,133
 I wanted to compliment you.

389
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:34,133
 Oh, Sir.

390
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,865
What's going on?

391
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:41,866
Wh-wh-where am I?

392
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:45,700
I don't know. I don't remember.

393
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:50,599
There's a wooden bed...

394
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,630
Mother-of-pearl wardrobe?

395
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,233
What is it?

396
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:59,500
- This is my place. 
 - What?

397
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,465
 Get in. I'll have the fee charged to my card.

398
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:06,966
 Wow. You're the best!

399
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,399
 Thank you.

400
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,932
 See you tomorrow.

401
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:15,965
 Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

402
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:18,733
 - Sir! 
 - Chief Editor?

403
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:23,233
 Let's go!

404
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,333
I was going to take you to your place.

405
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,499
Are you both awake?

406
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,198
Wash up and have breakfast.

407
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:41,232
Yes, ma'am. I mean, okay.

408
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:50,732
Sir, sir! Wait, wait!

409
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:53,631
Don't leave! Please have some breakfast.

410
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:55,631
My wife grilled expensive fish.

411
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:59,032
It's okay. I caused you much inconvenience.

412
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:03,933
I hope this stays between us.

413
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,599
- Understand? 
 - Sir?

414
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,499
Oh, okay. I understand.

415
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,999
I'll see you at work.

416
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,500
Oh, but sir...

417
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,999
That's strange.

418
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:17,800
He's not the type to get so drunk.

419
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,399
Whoa, it's cold.

420
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:27,766
Honey.

421
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:29,233
What's all this?

422
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:31,899
Get out. Get out, you turd!

423
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:34,464
I told you it's the kids' exam period, didn't I?

424
00:26:34,464 --> 00:26:36,232
I told you to come in quietly.

425
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:37,999
But you bring your CEO?

426
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,600
Honey, I'm so sorry.

427
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,700
- I was so drunk last night... 
 - I don't want to see you. Get out.

428
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,633
Honey!

429
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,832
Honey! Open the door.

430
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:51,800
Please forgive me. Honey! Honey!

431
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,065
Did I sleep at someone else's place?

432
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:02,367
And I was plastered on top of that?

433
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,965
And what was that ridiculous dream?

434
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:09,198
This is all because of that woman's compliment.

435
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:11,999
I shouldn't have heard it.

436
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:17,999
 I hope you're feeling okay.

437
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:20,667
 Thank you so much for yesterday.

438
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:25,100
 You're a really good person.

439
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:30,699
 The power of a compliment is great.

440
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:32,499
 Even the great Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung

441
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:36,667
 can't help but feel good about a sincere compliment.

442
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,132
All right, I give up. I surrender.

443
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:42,366
I completely surrender.

444
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:05,333
 - Are you all right? 
 - Are you okay?

445
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Not again.

446
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,167
Go ahead.

447
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:35,464
 Please place the transit card on the card reader.

448
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,265
I'm sorry. I'll be quick.

449
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,867
 Please place the transit card on the card reader.

450
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:43,600
Oh, it worked. Thank you!

451
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,166
Good morning.

452
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,666
Wow, you look so cool.

453
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,932
You look beautiful!

454
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:54,099
You're dazzling.

455
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,934
What's up? Are you going to a job interview?

456
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,766
Yes, I'm going on an interview.

457
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,434
- To be someone's girlfriend. 
 - What?

458
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,965
Editor Nam is setting me up with his friend.

459
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:07,066
He likes the smart type.

460
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,298
What will happen if you get even smarter?

461
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:10,866
- Hello. 
 - Good morning.

462
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,898
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

463
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:15,367
What? Good morning!

464
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,298
Yes.

465
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,366
Hey, wait. Did you really get it this time?

466
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:22,464
I got it!

467
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:25,500
- Awesome! 
 - I got it!

468
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:31,300
I got rejected again.

469
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,899
It's all my fault.

470
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,060
 Twelve.

471
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,340
 - We got it! 
 - We got it!

472
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,660
 We got it!!

473
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,732
 Awesome!

474
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,600
 I got it!

475
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:17,399
 One ninety-one.

476
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,167
 I got it! It's me!

477
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,400
 One ninety-one!

478
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,900
If... I hadn't shouted then...

479
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,566
Do you think I could've won?

480
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,531
No. The psychic was wrong.

481
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,932
If you got it because you didn't speak, everyone in Korea would own an apartment by now.

482
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,865
Get over it and get to work.

483
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:40,734
Yes, sir.

484
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:42,466
This isn't new for you.

485
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,434
It'd be weirder if you did win.

486
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,033
Hang in there, Editor Nam.

487
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:03,833
Hang in there. You'll get it next time.

488
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,567
So what time is my date?

489
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,533
- What? 
 - You didn't forget, did you?

490
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,366
Your promise.

491
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,131
You're so harsh.

492
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:16,299
I'm not in the mood to set you up.

493
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:18,266
Seriously.

494
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,133
Why you...

495
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,232
Let's wrap it up like this.

496
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,566
Your storyboard is a lot better than mine.

497
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:29,666
You're so talented.

498
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,600
Thank you.

499
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:35,632
I need to take this.

500
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,332
Okay.

501
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:43,467
Then let's take a break.

502
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,264
What type of guy do you like?

503
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:47,364
What? That's random.

504
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,265
Please. I'm dying to know.

505
00:31:50,265 --> 00:31:54,165
Oh, well.

506
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:57,433
A nice guy I can talk to?

507
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:00,198
You're not an idol on TV. Why be so vague?

508
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,899
Come on. Be more specific.

509
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,700
For example...

510
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,865
A tall guy like our Gyeom?

511
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:11,300
It'll be nice if he's tall.

512
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,632
How about a guy like our Gyeom,

513
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:17,064
whose left shoulder is the Pacific and right shoulder is the Atlantic?

514
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:19,232
Do you like a man with broad shoulders?

515
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:21,200
That's good too.

516
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,733
That's great!

517
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,733
I know a guy who has all of that.

518
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,700
I'll set you up.

519
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:29,131
- Give it here. 
 - What?

520
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:31,566
- ₩300,000 ($300). 
 - What do you mean?

521
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,598
I was in the worst condition possible,

522
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,466
but I got my hair and makeup done this morning.

523
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:37,932
At a beauty parlor in Cheongdam-dong.

524
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:39,865
The total is ₩300,000.

525
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:40,800
Give it here.

526
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,065
What?

527
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,198
That hair and makeup cost ₩300,000?

528
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,833
Are you the Korea Mint Corporation?

529
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,098
You can't just print out money.

530
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,698
Why do you live like that?

531
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:51,833
Does your mother know you live like that?

532
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,732
I don't have a mom.

533
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:57,300
I told you she died a long time ago.

534
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,966
D-D-Did you?

535
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,132
Of course.

536
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:05,232
Since your father raised you,

537
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,499
you're so magnanimous like a general.

538
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,733
I don't have a dad either.

539
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:13,666
I told you they both died.

540
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,800
D-Did you?

541
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,698
Of course. That's why you're so independent.

542
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm sorry I touched on a sore spot.

543
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,799
Are you all right?

544
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,865
No.

545
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:36,232
So set me up on a date.

546
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:47,865
This is a multi-unit complex for pet owners only.

547
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,960

548
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,910

549
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,590

550
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,200
 We minimized stairs for the pets.

551
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,265
 Before they go inside after a walk,

552
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:08,999
 they can quickly wash their paws here.

553
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,800
 This is a pet room, an independent space for pets.

554
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,099
 We removed the threshold so pets can travel comfortably.

555
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,800
 We used skid-free material on the floors.

556
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:46,365
The drainage facility ensures optimal cleanliness.

557
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:48,499
You're really amazing, Sir.

558
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,333
Pardon?

559
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:54,932
Well, actually, I didn't know there was a place for pets.

560
00:34:54,932 --> 00:34:58,766
But you invested in it already a few years back.

561
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:02,766
You're truly Korea's top real estate expert.

562
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:05,066
Oh, well.

563
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:14,198
You must like dogs.

564
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,665
Yes. I had a dog since I was little.

565
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:21,231
Then is that dog with your parents?

566
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:25,132
No. He died when I was in New York.

567
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:27,832
I see.

568
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,632
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

569
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:31,132
It's okay.

570
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:36,100
I'm sure he was happy when he was alive.

571
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,767
Since he lived with such a good owner.

572
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,466
Right?

573
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:48,766
What do you think?

574
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:50,399
 That Na Zero Won.

575
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,665
 She's complimenting someone else, too.

576
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:56,432
 Well, Gyeom deserves the compliments.

577
00:35:56,432 --> 00:35:59,833
 So it's possible. I'll accept that.

578
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,566
What are you doing?

579
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:07,440
When Gyeom starts shooting, he's so focused that he doesn't watch where he's going.

580
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,698
Photographer Shin is so lucky to have such a great friend as his assistant.

581
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:14,299
You're a good friend.

582
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,732
- Aw, shucks. 
  - That Na Zero Won.

583
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:19,400
 She overuses compliments.

584
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,898
Thank you for being so cooperative, CEO Oh.

585
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:28,867
My pleasure.

586
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,299
 She's a compliment machine.

587
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,398
 She even compliments someone she just met.

588
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,531
 At this rate, she'll compliment a dog.

589
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:40,467
Paw? Wow! Good job!

590
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:44,500
You're such a smart puppy.

591
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,265
 What a valueless compliment!

592
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:51,033
 Shooting out insincere compliments easily!

593
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:52,966
 I became a dancing whale because of that?

594
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:55,533
 I, Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung?

595
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:08,365
He's a good judge of character.

596
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:09,966
Wow.

597
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:13,099
I just learned that he's very shy,

598
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,532
but he's so playful. I guess he knows

599
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:18,599
- that you're a good person... 
 - No.

600
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,231
I'm not a good person.

601
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:22,834
- What? 
 - I said I'm not a good person!

602
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:25,832
You are very much mistaken.

603
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:30,765
What's wrong with him?

604
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,199
Chan.

605
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:18,132
If someone says I must have been a good owner to my dog,

606
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:20,031
it means I have a good personality, right?

607
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,099
What are you talking about?

608
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,966
I told Editor Na about my dog.

609
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,932
She said I must've been a good owner.

610
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:29,866
She thinks I'm a good guy, right?

611
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:33,298
I see the light after this one-way tunnel...

612
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:35,600
- No. 
 - What?

613
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:38,866
Actually...

614
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:40,066
 How about a guy like our Gyeom,

615
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:43,499
 whose left shoulder is the Pacific and right shoulder is the Atlantic?

616
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:44,932
 Do you like a man with broad shoulders?

617
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:47,632
 That's good, too.

618
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:49,198
 Great!

619
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,466
 I know a guy who has all of that.

620
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,431
 I'll set you up. He's the same age as me...

621
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:58,132
 Oh. Thanks but no thanks.

622
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:01,100
 I'm putting off dating for a while.

623
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,131
 And I don't like younger guys.

624
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:06,699
 What? Why?

625
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:12,800
 Oh. I had a really bad experience with one.

626
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,099
 I think I'm traumatized. So I don't like younger guys.

627
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:21,033
So take that crush and crush it.

628
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,198
You can't change your age.

629
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,566
What can you do when she doesn't like younger guys?

630
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:27,199
- Not all men are the same. 
 - What?

631
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,740
I'm going to approach slowly and show her I'm different.

632
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,000
Editor Nam. That Busan lodging...

633
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:43,932
- Editor Nam! 
 - Yes?

634
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:47,633
The Busan lodging special. How's it going?

635
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:52,931
Oh, well... I heard from the coordinator there.

636
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:58,364
Oh, right... She gave me some not well-known vacation cabins...

637
00:39:58,364 --> 00:39:59,631
What?

638
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,499
I mean...

639
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,166
What is he saying?

640
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,733
Give it here.

641
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:07,966
So frustrating!

642
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,200
You have all the photos.

643
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,598
So where's the reference material you drew up?

644
00:40:12,598 --> 00:40:14,332
Did you finish it?

645
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:16,333
No, not yet.

646
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,132
What?

647
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,031
You're leaving in two days.

648
00:40:20,032 --> 00:40:21,099
You haven't done it?

649
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,232
You can stand in line for the subscription but can't find time to work?

650
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:28,465
Do you want to be jobless as well as not having a house?

651
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:30,866
I'm sorry.

652
00:40:30,866 --> 00:40:34,199
If you have time to be sorry, find the reference material.

653
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,000
Now!

654
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,220
Yes, sir.

655
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:45,600
He's giving me a headache.

656
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,865
You know what he's like.

657
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:47,933
Why get angry now?

658
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:51,231
I felt sorry for him and held back, but this is going too far.

659
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:52,833
He's not the only one with problems.

660
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,064
Everybody has problems and hardships,

661
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:57,399
but we all hide it and work hard.

662
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:00,499
If he acts unprofessional like this again,

663
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,599
I'll really make him jobless.

664
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,632
I'm sorry. I'll find it quickly.

665
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:32,967
It's not that. Here.

666
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,766
You got a text.

667
00:41:34,766 --> 00:41:36,533
Thank you.

668
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:42,490
I unintentionally saw it.

669
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,967
Editor Nam.

670
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,333
Why do something I didn't ask?

671
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,531
 Sang Soon.

672
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:29,665
 We put our place on the market today.

673
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:34,932
 When it sells, buy a place with the money and get married.

674
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:38,060
 Don't worry about us.

675
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:40,632
Did you call for me?

676
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:43,132
I want the first draft of today's coverage by today.

677
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:44,866
Today?

678
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,898
Why? You can't?

679
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:51,699
No, but as you know, we just covered it.

680
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,499
I have to go through the interview recordings.

681
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,366
I won't have enough time.

682
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:57,099
If you could give me more—

683
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,432
Why should I accommodate your needs?

684
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:00,266
Sir?

685
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:04,066
I told you. I'm not a good person.

686
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,365
I won't tell you twice.

687
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:08,680
Write the first draft before you leave today.

688
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:17,266
What's up with him?

689
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:20,633
Yesterday, he was such a good person.

690
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:22,265
Did I do something wrong?

691
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,000
What did I do wrong?

692
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,140
I don't think I did anything wrong.

693
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,380

694
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,967
Editor Na.

695
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:39,332
What?

696
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,299
Why are you here at this hour?

697
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,198
To deliver this in case you're hungry.

698
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,966
Wow!

699
00:43:44,967 --> 00:43:48,165
Mi Ra said you were working overtime.

700
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,434
I see.

701
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:53,900
You're the best convenience store mate.

702
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,400
I'll repay you with a 1+1 next time.

703
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Okay.

704
00:44:00,366 --> 00:44:02,999
The deadline isn't soon.

705
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:06,132
Why work overtime to write?

706
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:11,233
The CEO said I had to write the first draft today.

707
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,833
He did? Why?

708
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:18,233
Beats me. I have no idea.

709
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:22,599
He really is tiresome.

710
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:26,199
But if you really get to know him...

711
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,198
He's warm-hearted on the inside?

712
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,365
Yes.

713
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:33,500
But I guess this isn't a good time to cover for him.

714
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:38,665
I think you are very thoughtful.

715
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:39,433
What?

716
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:45,364
You make excuses for Ja Sung, whom you care about, and take care of me like this.

717
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:48,967
Sometimes, you seem more mature than me.

718
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:51,165
What? What did you just say?

719
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:55,566
You seem more mature than me.

720
00:44:55,566 --> 00:44:59,880
Right? I'm kind of like that, right?

721
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,799
What?

722
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:10,132
Are you smiling?

723
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:11,234
Are you fine?

724
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:12,599
Of course.

725
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,332
I told you.

726
00:45:14,332 --> 00:45:16,233
Not all men are the same.

727
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:20,932
I can show her that I'm different.

728
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:25,299
Do you know what Editor Na just said?

729
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:26,999
Whoa.

730
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:28,498
Did you tell her how you feel?

731
00:45:28,498 --> 00:45:30,534
Did she accept?

732
00:45:30,534 --> 00:45:32,633
That's not it.

733
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:38,634
She said I'm so thoughtful and that I'm mature.

734
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:40,999
- Mature? 
 - Yes.

735
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,732
She doesn't see me as a younger guy.

736
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:45,599
She sees me as an older guy.

737
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,500
So you're not giving up on her, Elder?

738
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,766
You unnecessarily have a great imagination.

739
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:53,532
Whatever.

740
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:56,367
She said I'm mature.

741
00:45:58,033 --> 00:46:00,832
Yes, I finished writing the first draft.

742
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,832
 I don't have time to look at it today.

743
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,933
 Leave it on my desk and go home.

744
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:06,634
What?

745
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,710
Yes, Sir.

746
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,033
He wasn't even going to read it.

747
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:19,799
Then why make me write it today?

748
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,700
I don't get him at all.

749
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,130
Seriously.

750
00:46:36,467 --> 00:46:39,267
Editor Na was working overtime alone.

751
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:42,532
Why did you make her write the first draft today?

752
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:45,331
She had to do it anyway.

753
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:47,765
Can't you be nicer to her?

754
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:50,398
Forget it. I don't want to be concerned.

755
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:51,399
So just drop it.

756
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:52,733
How can you say that?

757
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:53,666
Stop.

758
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:57,366
I didn't call you to talk about that.

759
00:46:57,366 --> 00:46:59,599
I got a recommendation for a new photographer.

760
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,565
So you can go do fine art in New York as planned...

761
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:02,966
No.

762
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:05,099
Take your time finding a new photographer.

763
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,532
What? Why all of a sudden?

764
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:10,331
I have a reason to be in Seoul a little longer.

765
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:12,032
A reason?

766
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:15,033
There's someone that I like.

767
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:19,132
You're putting off what you want to do for a girl?

768
00:47:19,132 --> 00:47:20,765
Do you like her that much?

769
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:23,533
Yes. A lot.

770
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:25,934
What does she do?

771
00:47:25,934 --> 00:47:27,698
I can't tell you now.

772
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:30,433
I'll introduce her to you later.

773
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:34,766
You didn't bat an eye when I asked you to stay.

774
00:47:34,766 --> 00:47:38,032
But if you stay longer, you'll need to look for a proper place.

775
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:40,699
It's okay. I can stay at yours when I need to—

776
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:42,000
No.

777
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,365
Why not?

778
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:44,366
You know why.

779
00:47:44,366 --> 00:47:48,100
I've no intention of letting anyone in my boundary.

780
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:53,267
So tired...

781
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:58,532
At least I have a place I can rest.

782
00:47:58,532 --> 00:48:00,367
What?

783
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:02,366
Sunbae!

784
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:06,433
Young Won...

785
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,665
I got dumped by my boyfriend.

786
00:48:08,665 --> 00:48:11,999
I got rejected by my blind date.

787
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:14,399
I'm hitting rock bottom these days.

788
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:16,798
Don't say that.

789
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:18,900
It's true.

790
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,399
I felt so angry getting dumped.

791
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:26,750
I wanted to meet someone good to show him.

792
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,600
But I'm destined to be alone my whole life.

793
00:48:35,232 --> 00:48:37,600
Don't cry, Sunbae.

794
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,732
I'll be by your side so you're not alone.

795
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:44,140
Thanks, Young Won. You're the best.

796
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:47,133
What?

797
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:50,532
Are you crying for me, too?

798
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,233
What?

799
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,766
What's that?

800
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:03,666
Wait.

801
00:49:06,032 --> 00:49:08,133
What's going on?

802
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,067
We held it off temporarily.

803
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:20,366
Okay.

804
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,198
There's a water leak from upstairs.

805
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:27,099
It'll take three to four days to repair.

806
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,665
Stay somewhere else for now.

807
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:29,633
Oh... Okay.

808
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,065
Where will she go then?

809
00:49:32,565 --> 00:49:34,298
Do your parents live far from here?

810
00:49:34,298 --> 00:49:36,398
Very far. She's from Gangwon-do.

811
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:38,332
She can't commute from there.

812
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,332
Then a friend's house?

813
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:41,632
She has no friends.

814
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:44,533
Her work schedule left her with no friends.

815
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:45,367
Sunbae.

816
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:47,832
Be quiet.

817
00:49:47,832 --> 00:49:51,033
Don't be like that. Give her lodging expenses.

818
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:51,901
What?

819
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:53,567
Sunbae, I'll take care of this.

820
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:56,666
I told you to be quiet.

821
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:59,632
If there's a water leak from upstairs, they should provide for lodging expenses.

822
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,398
You should know that better than anyone.

823
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,366
You own the upstairs unit as well

824
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:05,566
so give her lodging expenses. No,

825
00:50:05,566 --> 00:50:07,365
make that a hotel.

826
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:08,832
What? A hotel?

827
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:11,232
Do you know what the monthly rent is here?

828
00:50:11,232 --> 00:50:13,033
What's the monthly rent, Young Won?

829
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:14,399
₩400,000($400).

830
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,990
What? That's it?

831
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:21,933
Maybe not a fancy deluxe hotel,

832
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:26,000
but a clean and safe mid-to low-end hotel.

833
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,364
You're not giving her money for a motel when she'll be alone?

834
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,732
What's wrong?

835
00:50:43,732 --> 00:50:47,298
I'm fainting from acting all tough in front of the CEO.

836
00:50:47,298 --> 00:50:50,300
Did it show? Did I shake?

837
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,099
You weren't shaking at all.

838
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:53,766
I almost fell in love with you.

839
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:56,390
That's a relief.

840
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,099
Whoa.

841
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,099
He sent me ₩500,000($500).

842
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,600
No way.

843
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,400
He spent a lot for a scrooge.

844
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,766
I think I'm getting too much.

845
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:13,231
No, you're not.

846
00:51:13,232 --> 00:51:16,832
You need that much to go for leather.

847
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,633
What?

848
00:51:18,633 --> 00:51:20,665
The name of the hotel is "Leather"?

849
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,031
What are you saying?

850
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:24,933
No, I mean a bag. You can buy a leather bag.

851
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:26,099
A bag?

852
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,599
Yes.

853
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,565
Stay at my place while yours is getting repaired and buy a bag with that money.

854
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:35,198
That's why I acted like that with CEO.

855
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,599
This was the big picture I was drawing.

856
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,566
What?

857
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:43,766
Let's let this bag retire.

858
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:46,364
If this bag were a person, you would be violating Labor Laws.

859
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:49,220
You would be arrested.

860
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:53,133
Okay.

861
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:54,999
Thank you so much, Sunbae.

862
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,832
You're the best.

863
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,600
You're the best, too.

864
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,800
- I don't need a man. 
 - Right.

865
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,466
- All I need is you. 
 - Me, too.

866
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:04,560
Ui Joo.

867
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:08,166
Young Won!

868
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,566
It's okay.

869
00:52:10,566 --> 00:52:13,465
I can send my boyfriend away. Why are you leaving?

870
00:52:13,465 --> 00:52:14,332
It's okay.

871
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:15,866
You two spend quality time together.

872
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,133
Come on. You don't have to do this.

873
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:20,365
Don't worry about me and go back inside.

874
00:52:20,365 --> 00:52:22,965
Your boyfriend will be waiting.

875
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:24,499
About your bag...

876
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,064
- Take this. 
 - What?

877
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:28,231
It's a designer bag. I only used it twice.

878
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:30,332
Oh, no. It's okay.

879
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:35,132
No. Take this bag and use that money to go to a hotel.

880
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:36,698
I said it's okay.

881
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:39,299
- Don't worry about me and go back inside. 
 - All right, all right.

882
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:40,332
The elevator's here.

883
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:41,531
I'll be going now.

884
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:44,600
Be careful. Bye.

885
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:54,660
Should I really go to a motel?

886
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,833
Not again...

887
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:14,732
I was going to retire it.

888
00:53:14,732 --> 00:53:18,099
But it quit on its own.

889
00:53:34,065 --> 00:53:36,333
That's pretty.

890
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,366
Why is it so expensive?

891
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:46,533
Think about the place you want to buy.

892
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:50,340
Hold back.

893
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,170

894
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:19,767
 Young Won... I'm sorry... Do you have some money?

895
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:23,000
 I'm behind on credit with the wholesaler.

896
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
How does she know everytime I get extra cash?

897
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,334
 How much?

898
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,566
 ₩500,000 ($500).

899
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:37,399
Unbelievable.

900
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,910
Did she put a tracker on me?

901
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:01,230
♫  It’s especially quiet in my room today  ♫

902
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:08,220
♫  Feels like it’s embracing me  ♫

903
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:15,240
♫  Things didn’t go my way today  ♫

904
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:23,020
♫  It was a day filled with easy sighs  ♫

905
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,010
♫  When I try to act like I’m OK and smile  ♫

906
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:29,599
 When I'm tired and exhausted,

907
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,660
 I think about the place I want to buy.

908
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:39,620
♫  Feels like tomorrow will be better  ♫

909
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,660
♫  Just like the many dreams  ♫

910
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:48,120
 It can be a haven where I find comfort.

911
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:54,060
♫  In a small corner of my heart  ♫

912
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,230
♫  Everyone goes through this kind of day  ♫

913
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,850
 It can be a space to be with the person I love.

914
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:10,980
♫  For a tomorrow that’ll be different from today  ♫

915
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:19,370
♫  Thank you for getting through this lonely day  ♫

916
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,790
♫  Everyone  ♫

917
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:30,060
 But it's an unattainable dream.

918
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:38,520
 Hi, kids. I'm home

919
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:46,860

920
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,433
 But the place I'm living in

921
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:52,499
 can be an extension of my rough day

922
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:54,820
 and another kind of battlefield.

923
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:59,260
♫  The countless days that pass  ♫

924
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:07,140
♫  There are these kinds of days and those kinds of days  ♫

925
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,790

926
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,365
 It can be a place with a secret

927
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:18,580
 I don't want others to know.

928
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,550
♫  Even if it’s nothing special  ♫

929
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:28,360
♫  Everyone goes through this kind of day  ♫

930
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,431
 It can be a place you have no choice but to return to.

931
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:41,560
♫  For a tomorrow that’ll be different from today  ♫

932
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:49,930
♫  Thank you for getting through this lonely day  ♫

933
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:56,860
♫  Tomorrow, we’ll be happier  ♫

934
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:02,366
 Will I be able to live in my own dream house one day?

935
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:09,334
 Will the time really come when I can live in my own place?

936
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:33,933
I'm so forgetful these days.

937
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,499
Why are you... Why did you...

938
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,666
What are you doing here right now?

939
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:05,034
Oh, I...

940
00:59:05,966 --> 00:59:09,365
I came back for something and fell asleep.

941
00:59:09,365 --> 00:59:11,131
Then grab it and leave.

942
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,280
Okay, then.

943
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:18,567
Stop.

944
00:59:21,065 --> 00:59:22,933
Are you telling me you need that right now?

945
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,534
Pardon?

946
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,299
Did you take the hotel money from me to do this?

947
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,898
You're incredible.

948
00:59:30,899 --> 00:59:34,467
This is how you were planning to buy this place?

949
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:38,499
No. That wasn't my intention.

950
00:59:38,499 --> 00:59:41,533
I had to use that money on something urgent suddenly.

951
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:43,500
No need for excuses.

952
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,933
I gave you money, so I did my duty as a landlord.

953
00:59:46,933 --> 00:59:51,480
I'm not responsible for where you sleep.

954
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,299
Seriously. Unbelievable.

955
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,350
I don't care. I don't.

956
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:11,865
 Thanks, Young Won.

957
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:13,850
What?

958
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:17,799
What's wrong with me these days?

959
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,999
 Thanks for the money you sent.

960
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:25,767
 I'm sorry for asking for money all the time.

961
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:30,540
 I had to use that money on something urgent suddenly.

962
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,565
Where...

963
01:00:59,566 --> 01:01:01,167
This is my place.

964
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:03,199
Pardon?

965
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,565
Stay here until the repair is done.

966
01:01:06,565 --> 01:01:11,832
Thanks for the offer, but I can't stay here.

967
01:01:11,832 --> 01:01:13,231
I'll be going now.

968
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:15,031
Where are you going?

969
01:01:15,032 --> 01:01:18,865
If you have nowhere else to go, will you go back to the water-leaking studio?

970
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:22,599
If there's an accident, who will be responsible?

971
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:25,531
Don't worry. I'll go somewhere else.

972
01:01:25,532 --> 01:01:28,367
How can I believe that?

973
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,200
I promise.

974
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,590
So don't concern yourself with me.

975
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:40,899
How can I not? You make it hard not to.

976
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,533
You make me...

977
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,632
get concerned...

 I smell the same shampoo from Editor Na and you.

 I want to repay the kindness somehow.

999
01:03:25,065 --> 01:03:26,332
 It's a gift.

01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,898
 I need to move out of here when it sells.

1001
01:03:28,899 --> 01:03:30,198
 Get rid of that.

1002
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:31,650
 It's a nuisance for when I move out.

01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,810
♫  Write the story of us ♫
