1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,580

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,190

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,800

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,830

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,360

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,030

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,750

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,380

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,880

10
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:59,980

11
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,166
Look here, Editor Na.

12
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:15,833
Editor Na Zero Won!

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,032
Yikes.

14
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,633
We're here.

15
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:43,866
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:48,466
You were kind enough to drive, and I fell asleep on you.

17
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,834
It's hard to fight sleep when you're tired.

18
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,198
I'm tired, too, so you can get out now.

19
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,899
Right.

20
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,032
Thank you.

21
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,632
See you tomorrow.

22
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:03,332
Bye.

23
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,565
 I think I went too far earlier.

24
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:38,266
 I apologize.

25
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,631
 You don't have to move out either.

26
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:43,090
What's up with him?

27
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,233
He apologized first.

28
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,900
Oh, well.

29
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,220
Whatever.

30
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:06,566
She's probably crying tears of gratitude.

31
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:11,165
I guess I can write a comment.

32
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,790

33
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,220

34
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,480

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,099
She doesn't waste any time.

36
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,200

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,899

38
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,999

39
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,300
 Why all of a sudden?

40
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,600
Why?

41
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:40,299
 What you must do while gathering seed money

42
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,265
 is gaining knowledge by reading real estate books.

43
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,366
 What's the use of gathering seed money

44
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:49,832
 when you can lose it all if you don't know about real estate?

45
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:51,466
 You can have a gun and bullets,

46
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:54,067
 but if you don't know how to use it,

47
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,367
 you will die a horrible...

48
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:00,200
Do I have to hear this at home too? Hearing it at the office is enough!

49
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:05,199
No wonder he has few followers!

50
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,531
 It's just something personal.

51
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:13,600
 Anyway, please recommend some competent real estate channels.

52
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:23,400
 To my knowledge, Yoo Ja Sung is Korea's top real estate expert.

53
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:33,166
What's this?

54
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,866
Is she disagreeing?

55
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,970

56
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,520

57
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,865
 Then why didn't you say something?

58
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,933
 I was desperate. Was it amusing to you?

59
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:09,066
 I thought we were partners,

60
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:13,070
 but did you think of me as entertainment?

61
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,133
Hey, Shin Gyeom!

62
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,730

63
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,364
Excuse me.

64
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:52,400
Isn't there another 1+1 event?

65
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Another?

66
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,532
We don't do 1+1 with new items.

67
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,865
There was one last time, though.

68
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:01,333
No, there wasn't. Not yet.

69
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:04,334
 Oh! Take a look at this.

70
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,066
 First Lady Lunch Box is 1+1.

71
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,464
 What? Really?

72
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:10,364
 I've never seen a lunch box go for 1+1.

73
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:13,299
 I guess it's a promotion because it's a new item.

74
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,366
 Save our seats outside. I'll pay the cashier.

75
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:21,300
So she knows you've been acting like you're poor?

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,933
I wondered why you looked so blue.

77
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:25,332
You're broken-hearted.

78
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:29,631
You know, getting caught was a matter of time.

79
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,400
I think there's only one way to turn this over.

80
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:37,966
Tell her how you feel.

81
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,166
- That you like her. 
 - What?

82
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,098
"I like you so much that I wanted to support you."

83
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,534
Go for a direct attack.

84
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:48,534
Then she won't be mad anymore.

85
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,132
She might even reciprocate.

86
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:51,633
Forget it.

87
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:54,300
This is not the time to confess.

88
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,632
It's the perfect time to confess!

89
00:06:56,632 --> 00:07:00,133
A crisis is an opportunity. Got it?

90
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:05,365
Okay then. Keep on being a downer.

91
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,765
 How was the shoot?

92
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:12,832
 Call me when you get to Seoul. Let's talk.

93
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,331
A crisis is an opportunity!

94
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:17,067
Don't contemplate. Confess!

95
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,566
You know...

96
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,800
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

97
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:37,466
I'll tell you the truth.

98
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:42,467
I know why you did it.

99
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,632
What?

100
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:48,367
You were helping a coworker trying to save money.

101
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:54,967
I'm sorry I misread your good intentions.

102
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:59,098
Looking back,

103
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,832
I was the one who misunderstood you and went overboard.

104
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,566
It was hard for me,

105
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,534
so I guess I wanted someone to rely on.

106
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:13,666
I was sincere in wanting to be your partner.

107
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,766
Yes, I know.

108
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:19,333
And I'm really grateful.

109
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,199
Can we still be convenience store mates?

110
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,900
What?

111
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,120

112
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,432
Shaping underwear after an athlete's foot ad...

113
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:39,066
The dignity of our magazine...

114
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,033
I told you maintaining money is our first priority.

115
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,633
But still... The former CEO...

116
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,032
He didn't put in ads like this.

117
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,465
Especially something so vulgar...

118
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:49,599
What are you doing?

119
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,732
You seem to prefer the former CEO.

120
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,732
He's now in the convenience store business.

121
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:57,866
You can at least get a job as a part-time clerk.

122
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,365
Wait.

123
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:03,099
I'll calmly put in the ad.

124
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,366
That'll be all.

125
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:11,167
 Congratulations! Congratulations!

126
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,010
Congratulations on your winning an award!

127
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,200
Congratulations!

128
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,433
What's all this?

129
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,899
Didn't you know?

130
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,532
Our CEO is receiving a Manager Award at this year's Magazine Day.

131
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,699
I'm sorry. We didn't know...

132
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,098
Why didn't you tell us?

133
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:33,165
Stop.

134
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,367
It's nothing special.

135
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:41,399
 - Wow! Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations!

136
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:48,500
This is why you're on his blacklist.

137
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,132
What the?

138
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,365
Such a brown-noser.

139
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,798
He should be the leader of the flattery team, not the ad team.

140
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:54,700
I'll say.

141
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,865
He's frantic to score high with the CEO.

142
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:58,766
Never mind.

143
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,900
Everyone, follow me calmly.

144
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:04,767
Sir!

145
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,333
I have a suggestion.

146
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,598
Since you're receiving an award,

147
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:16,100
how about a feature story on you in the next issue?

148
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,199
No.

149
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,232
I'd rather you put in more ads.

150
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:23,164
As I said, it's nothing special.

151
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,400
Of course, it's special!

152
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,366
You're a rising star in the magazine industry,

153
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,532
getting an award three months after you took over.

154
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:33,631
People should know you're the CEO of our magazine.

155
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,833
Do you think so?

156
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,466
I guess there may be a promotional effect.

157
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:41,933
If people know the master of real estate is the CEO,

158
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,431
the houses we're promoting will sell better.

159
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:47,066
It's a money-making idea.

160
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:48,499
Right? I did well, right?

161
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:49,400
No.

162
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,165
You should've thought of this sooner.

163
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:55,833
The deadline is near. You'll have to get busy.

164
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,165
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:57,165 --> 00:11:01,866
Oh, well, then... Your feature story...

166
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:03,599
Editor Na could write it.

167
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,467
Me?

168
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:10,798
- Editor Na? 
 - Yes.

169
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,998
She's your exclusive editor,

170
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:15,199
and she did many interviews at her former job.

171
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:15,967
Stop.

172
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,032
Aren't there more competent editors?

173
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:19,633
Sir?

174
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:21,365
Oh, well...

175
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:26,234
The others have a lot to do right now.

176
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:28,333
Then it can't be helped.

177
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,466
You'll have to write well.

178
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:33,767
If not, I'll get a new editor.

179
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,899
How can he say that to her face?

180
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,280
So humiliating.

181
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,100
Get a new editor?

182
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:52,730
He must think I want to write this.

183
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,432
Young Won, you poor thing.

184
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:03,033
Looks like CEO Yoo is mad at you.

185
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,499
Will you be okay writing the story?

186
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:08,599
Oh! Are you looking for a new place?

187
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:11,966
The CEO said I don't have to move out.

188
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,099
What?

189
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,365
He was angry about the request for a discount.

190
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:16,599
Is he good now?

191
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,798
Then what's up with him?

192
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:22,299
Indeed, well, I thought things were good...

193
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,265
But I guess they're not.

194
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:26,498
He's so difficult to figure out.

195
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:29,400
I can't believe you're writing a feature story on him.

196
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,331
I feel sorry for you.

197
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:34,266
If you need any help, let me know.

198
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll help you plenty.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,232
In that case, can you write the feature story?

200
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:41,331
What?

201
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,131
- You're unbelievable. 
 - What?

202
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:45,498
Since when do you give up that easily?

203
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,498
You have such a tenacious spirit.

204
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:51,633
If you get through this, you'll grow even more.

205
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,333
Fighting!

206
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,970
Help me, my foot.

207
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:09,350

208
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,810

209
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,130
♫  Leaving everything behind  ♫

210
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,470
Hello! Nice to meet you!

211
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,640

212
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,665
You're a complete Jeju person now.

213
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:41,666
Indeed. I was initially worried when you said you were moving to Jejudo to live like Lee Hyo Ri.

214
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,464
Are you on a diet? You look thinner.

215
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,732
I eat only vegetables like the singer Lee Hyo Ri.

216
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:47,700
Vegetarian!

217
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,032
I'm doing yoga, like Lee Hyo Ri.

218
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:55,865
At this rate, I might pick up men in "just ten minutes."

219
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,599
Just ten minutes, my foot.

220
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:02,200
You're just half a century old but still unmarried.

221
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,266
What, you punk?

222
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,331
That's what I would've said.

223
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:10,099
But after living in Jejudo, I don't get angry.

224
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,264
I guess it's because the place is wonderful.

225
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:15,967
Jejudo is so healing.

226
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,798
Do you like Jejudo that much?

227
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:19,032
Of course!

228
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:22,931
Don't worry about reconstruction and come to Jejudo.

229
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,899
If you sell your apartment, you could buy several houses there.

230
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,365
Really?

231
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,332
Of course!

232
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:31,233
You can rent your houses out,

233
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:35,699
take walks on the oreums and surf in the ocean.

234
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,831
Jejudo is paradise on earth!

235
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:42,866
Should I ask my wife to leave everything and go?

236
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:44,098
Come on.

237
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:46,599
What use is that?

238
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,464
Your wife is crazy about your kids' education.

239
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:52,498
She drives your kids all the way to Daechi-dong.

240
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:55,465
Would she live in Jejudo?

241
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:56,566
Hey.

242
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:58,665
There are private academies there too.

243
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:03,198
And if you have a computer, you can take classes from Daechi-dong tutors.

244
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:05,666
But it's different from actually being there.

245
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,699
And the academic atmosphere is different.

246
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,899
Right?

247
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,264
Of course.

248
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:12,065
Are you living in Jejudo?

249
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:15,430
No can do.

250
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:29,099
Ui Joo, Ui Joo, Yeo Ui Joo.

251
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:30,599
Come here for a sec.

252
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:33,066
Sure. What's up?

253
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:37,200
What's this typo here?

254
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,365
It's not "unhesetatingly."

255
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:41,434
It's "unhesitatingly."

256
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:42,966
Oh, I made a mistake.

257
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:44,698
Some mistake.

258
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:46,032
How can you make this mistake?

259
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:49,032
- Maybe it's because you unhesitatingly misjudge things. 
 - What?

260
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,532
And here.

261
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,164
It's not "litely."

262
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,365
It's "lightly."

263
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:54,532
Oh, another mistake.

264
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:57,598
How can an editor of over ten years make this kind of mistake?

265
00:15:57,598 --> 00:16:00,867
- Maybe it's because you think lightly. 
 - What?

266
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:04,667
Mistakes reflect one's competence! Okay?

267
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:05,731
What?

268
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,665
You said you don't get angry anymore after living in Jejudo.

269
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,433
Why are you getting so angry?

270
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:10,665
What? Angry?

271
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,099
When did I get angry?

272
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:16,067
I was just giving advice.

273
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,498
What? You're dismissed.

274
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,420
What? Okay.

275
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,132
Does he always wear sneakers to a survey?

276
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:36,165
Yes, but...

277
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:38,399
A pair doesn't last three months.

278
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,298
He walks a lot.

279
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,432
Really?

280
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:44,665
That's incredible.

281
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:47,265
 This is for the better.

282
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:52,699
 When she covers me, she'll know how great a real estate expert I am.

283
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:59,898
 She'll know what a fool she was to unsubscribe to Jasung TV.

284
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,120

285
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,231
Awesome.

286
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,832
Are you buying this house?

287
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:12,166
Big houses aren't popular nowadays,

288
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,699
since families are getting smaller.

289
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,399
Stop.

290
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,298
All you can see is a big house.

291
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:19,899
Sir?

292
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:23,332
 A mansion of 330㎡.

293
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:26,390
 A total of thirteen rooms.

294
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:31,932
 Ranging from 2-person rooms to 8-person rooms.

295
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:37,132
 It can be remodeled to a sharehouse that can receive a total of sixty residents.

296
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,331
 It's at the heart of the three Gangnam districts,

297
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:59,299
 home to many start-ups and young people.

298
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,298
 Despite the appealing surrounding infrastructure,

299
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:09,270
 rent in the area is high, so young people can't enter.

300
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:16,832
 Targeting them, if we lower rent to ₩500,000-₩700,000, ($500-$700)

301
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:20,398
we'll get a profit of over thirty million won a month.

302
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:21,965
Thirty million won...

303
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:25,398
We'll recover the renovation costs in a few months.

304
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:28,398
I'll buy it immediately and start the renovation.

305
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,599
Oh, Secretary Hwang.

306
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,232
Yes, sir?

307
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:32,798
You must be tired of being in awe all the time,

308
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,932
but you think I'm the best in real estate, right?

309
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:37,933
Sir?

310
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,600
Oh, sure.

311
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,380
You'll continue to be in awe.

312
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:50,365
Then before we go to the next site, let's get something to eat.

313
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:53,300
Great! I was getting hungry.

314
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,065
Why are you following me?

315
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:02,465
What? Aren't we getting something to eat?

316
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,565
Looks like you misunderstood me again.

317
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,898
I meant, go get something to eat.

318
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,510
We'll meet up one hour later after lunch.

319
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,699
Take out "at a glance."

320
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,898
Change it to "furnished with a bathtub." Simple.

321
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,566
Oh, right.

322
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:31,367
You're the best.

323
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:32,699
Aw, shucks.

324
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,900
I guess I'm thinking clearer because Jejudo's air is cleaner.

325
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,733
Jejudo is an air purifier!

326
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,098
I envy you.

327
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:42,499
- Don't be envious and go for it. 
 - What?

328
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:47,565
With the money for a subscription here, you can buy two apartments in Jejudo.

329
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,665
There are many magazines and private academies there.

330
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:57,699
You can move to Jejudo with your cutie pie and live a sweet, sweet life.

331
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:59,800
Jejudo is love!

332
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,832
Right.

333
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,400
Shall I talk to my cutie pie once?

334
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,599
What use is that?

335
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,365
Your cutie pie was born and bred in Gangnam.

336
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:10,165
Do you think she can live in Jejudo?

337
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,199
She'll like malls better than the beach

338
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:19,066
and running on treadmills rather than walking on a coastal pathway.

339
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,999
Seriously. You're making a lot of mistakes today.

340
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:23,965
Jejudo has everything, you know.

341
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:27,166
Come on. It still won't be like Gangnam.

342
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,065
- You think so? 
 - Of course.

343
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:32,865
Are you living in Jejudo? No can do.

344
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,732
- Ui Joo, Ui Joo, Yeo Ui Joo. 
 - Yes?

345
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,831
I read your article.

346
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:39,398
Why aren't your writing skills improving?

347
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:41,132
Look. Look here!

348
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,432
Maybe it's because you live in Seoul with its bad air.

349
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:46,398
- Your sentences are so murky. 
 - What?

350
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:49,165
Your sentences are making me choke.

351
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,080
See? Look. Look at this!

352
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,030
Oh, this...

353
00:20:58,034 --> 00:20:59,565
What? Is it a mistake again?

354
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:01,331
I said mistakes reflect one's competence.

355
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,332
No, I mean, this isn't my article.

356
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:05,832
It's Editor Nam's.

357
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,820
- What? 
 - What?

358
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,598
It's mine.

359
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:16,232
Oh... Everyone makes mistakes.

360
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:19,332
Just being in Seoul for a moment

361
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:22,898
is polluting my head with exhaust fumes.

362
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:27,600
Exhaust fumes are dangerous.

363
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,432
Oh, my head.

364
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:32,470
Oh, my head. My head.

365
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,460
What's up with her today?

366
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,032
Yes? Has someone come to look at my house?

367
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,533
 No, not even one person.

368
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,565
I'm going insane.

369
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:48,965
I'll up the commission. Please find a buyer.

370
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:51,331
 You said you're going to Seoul to find a buyer.

371
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:52,265
Are things not going well?

372
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:54,331
I'm laying the groundwork,

373
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:56,965
but someone keeps ruining it. Drat!

374
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,831
 How about just living in Jejudo?

375
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:01,731
No! I'm going to come back to Seoul!

376
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,731
I can't live in Jejudo any longer!

377
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:07,665
I'm losing weight because of the stress!

378
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:10,365
Sell my house no matter what.

379
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,360
What?

380
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,700
Are you selling your house in Jejudo?

381
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,390
Did you hear that?

382
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,260
Does the CEO usually not buy lunch?

383
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,898
Lunch money is included in our paycheck.

384
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:33,265
Still.

385
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:37,132
He buys mansions so easily but is so miserly with lunch.

386
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:43,032
He saves up on the small things and boldly invests in big things.

387
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,190
I can't write that in the feature story.

388
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,732
Yes!

389
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:50,300
Right!

390
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,490
What do you think about the CEO?

391
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,000
What?

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,450
Is there something you feel grateful about?

393
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,630
Or...

394
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,100
Was there a time you were moved by him?

395
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,800
You worked with him for three years.

396
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,650
There must be something...

397
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,150
Anything...

398
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,500
 He never spoke till the end.

399
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,380
I can't write that.

400
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:41,365
 CEO Yoo. I have a lot to say about him.

401
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:42,932
 He has so much money,

402
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:46,132
 but he calculates every single penny.

403
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:49,232
 He's the most tight-fisted person I know.

404
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:50,699
 Thank you for the interview.

405
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:53,099
 And he's so unpleasant.

406
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,933
 Once I told him I had a suggestion about the building.

407
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:59,832
 He said it wasn't my concern. But why?

408
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,133
 I'm the one guarding and managing this place.

409
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,865
 Why wouldn't it be my concern?

410
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:08,640
 He never stopped speaking till the end.

411
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,130
I can't write that.

412
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:14,631
There has to be material to write a feature story.

413
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:18,720
This is harder than when I wrote my cover letter.

414
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,190
I don't know.

415
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,370
It'll work out somehow.

416
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,520
400,000 subscribers?

417
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,467
CEO Yoo only has forty.

418
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:44,933
 Homeownership, do you think it's unattainable?

419
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,198
 I know very well how you feel.

420
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:53,250
 From now on, I'll support you.

421
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,340
He speaks so nicely.

422
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,260
What?

423
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,934
I'm switching channels.

424
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:10,333
Don't show up again.

425
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,398
 Real estate is hard, even if you know it.

426
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,998
 So it's natural that you don't know.

427
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:17,032
 Don't be so impatient.

428
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:19,350
 I'll help you.

429
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,000
He's so considerate, too.

430
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,260
Oh, no!

431
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,631
 You must read real estate books.

432
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:44,733
 All of life's answers are in books.

433
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:47,831
 But if you knew that, you'd be reading.

434
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:49,766
 Not watching this video.

435
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:53,532
There he goes again.

436
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:57,160
I'm watching out of loyalty.

437
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,830
 I've decided to continue watching

438
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:07,565
 Jasung TV and prepare for home ownership.

439
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:11,699
 I'm going to read real estate books

440
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,633
 per CEO Yoo's advice.

441
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,199
Of course.

442
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,500
There probably wasn't anyone better than me.

443
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:25,260
She must've realized what a huge expert I was today.

444
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,320
What's up?

445
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,000
Well...

446
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,060
As a convenience store mate, I wanted to share this.

447
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,265
I felt guilty eating this alone.

448
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:47,934
You scared me for a second.

449
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:51,060
Good. I was craving something sweet.

450
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,090
Oh?

451
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,370
Are you really giving me this half?

452
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,820
Yay!

453
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,260
Why don't you date?

454
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,966
What?

455
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:19,520
You don't seem to have a boyfriend.

456
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,400
Yes.

457
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,730
I don't have time to date.

458
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,990
I'm overwhelmed trying to be a homeowner.

459
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,166
I don't have the time to find a boyfriend.

460
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:35,400
Oh, I see...

461
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,299
Yes!

462
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,566
I actually wanted to ask you.

463
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:41,199
What kind of person is CEO Yoo?

464
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:43,232
What? Hyung?

465
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:48,199
I'm interviewing his acquaintances because of a feature story.

466
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:51,465
You know him better than anyone.

467
00:27:51,465 --> 00:27:55,133
Yes. I know him quite well.

468
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,660
In a word, he is...

469
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,550
terribly tiresome.

470
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,060
You praised Jejudo so much to us, but it was so you could leave Jejudo?

471
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,232
To sell us your house?

472
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,631
Is that why you got frustrated with me?

473
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:21,965
Yes, you jerk.

474
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:25,699
If you hadn't spoiled everything, these fools would've bought my house.

475
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:26,965
It's so frustrating!

476
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:28,298
But why?

477
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:30,666
You're living on vegetables and doing yoga.

478
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,099
You're living like the singer Lee Hyo Ri.

479
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:36,298
You can't live like her just by being a vegetarian and doing yoga.

480
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,898
She has her husband Lee Sang Soon.

481
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,532
I forgot about that.

482
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:44,798
I don't know anyone there.

483
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:46,665
I'm so lonely.

484
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:49,065
Jejudo is lonely.

485
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,699
It's solitude.

486
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:54,320
It's dreariness.

487
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,631
Get a husband in Jejudo.

488
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:59,599
Don't you know there are more women there?

489
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,366
There are only dolhareubang stone figures.

490
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,532
Then what will you do?

491
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:08,967
Take Nam Sang Soon instead of Lee Sang Soon.

492
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:12,830
Let's leave! Just the two of us!

493
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,731
Sang Soon, want to go with me?

494
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,665
To Jejudo? I'll do everything for you.

495
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:20,799
Why would I?

496
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,399
I want to live in Seoul.

497
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,100
I'm going to live in Seoul.

498
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,366
Oh, dear.

499
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:30,532
I can't buy your house,

500
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:32,967
but I can set you up with someone.

501
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,700
Really? Who?

502
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,532
What kind of guy do you like?

503
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:38,998
I don't care how he looks.

504
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:41,433
For example...

505
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:43,366
A trustworthy guy like the movie star So Ji Sub?

506
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:44,799
- What? 
 - No, no.

507
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,998
For example...

508
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:49,333
A gentleman like the movie star Jung Woo Sung?

509
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,332
No. For example...

510
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,832
Grab her. Let's go. Unbelievable!

511
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:56,900
- How much is it? 
 - Hey! Let go!

512
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,765
It's been a month since I drank with people.

513
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,732
I will drink all night until I die!

514
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:06,270
I want to enjoy the full night out in Seoul!

515
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,420

516
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,880
Here, here, here.

517
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,510

518
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,470

519
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,060

520
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,032
Hello!

521
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:19,700
Yes, we must go global.

522
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,667
Chief Editor Choi! Long time no see.

523
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,533
You're looking haggard every time I see you.

524
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:28,165
- Stop picking a fight and go your way. 
 - Okay.

525
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:28,865
Who is he?

526
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:31,533
The chief editor of our rival magazine Green House.

527
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:34,699
I almost mistook you as a tabloid.

528
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,999
You have all sorts of weird ads now.

529
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,465
What happened to the dignified magazine?

530
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,099
Why you...

531
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,631
- Don't you touch him. 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

532
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:47,633
You've gotten bold, you b*stard.

533
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:49,334
Relax.

534
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,699
There's an ad we rejected.

535
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:53,266
It's called Rumble Ka-boom.

536
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:55,699
What? Rumble Ka-boom?

537
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:57,166
It's a laxative ad.

538
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,832
It's not dignified enough for our magazine,

539
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:01,699
but it'll be a good fit for Monthly Magazine Tabloid.

540
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,034
I'm going to kill you.

541
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,332
Ignore him.

542
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:05,265
Let me know if you're interested.

543
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:06,365
I'll hook you up.

544
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,633
Rumble Ka-boom!

545
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,933
Rumble...

546
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:15,267
Better watch it. I'll knock you out.

547
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:18,233
You did well not to engage.

548
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:26,331
The press award of the 2020 Korean Magazine goes to Han Won Shik, CEO of Green House!

549
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:29,199
You are awarded this prize for your contribution

550
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,980
to the development of Korea's magazine culture.

551
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,565
I would like to thank my chief editor and staff

552
00:31:46,565 --> 00:31:49,766
for all the hard work they have done.

553
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,699
This honor goes to them.

554
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:55,400
Thank you.

555
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,767
 Awesome!

556
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:59,233
 Awesome! Awesome!

557
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:03,265
The manager award of the 2020 Korean Magazine goes to

558
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:07,320
Yoo Ja Sung, CEO of Monthly Magazine Home.

559
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,800
Congratulations, sir!

560
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:40,166
Congratulations, sir!

561
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,066
The reason I won this award is thanks to the hard work of

562
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,567
myself.

563
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:30,599
I, Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung, will take all the honor.

564
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,367
Thank you.

565
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:51,933
The CEO's acceptance speech was unbelievable.

566
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,999
I know. What a show off!

567
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:57,532
We're the ones working hard while being treated as a tabloid.

568
00:33:57,532 --> 00:34:00,365
How can he not mention us at all?

569
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:03,798
But he gave us a thumbs up.

570
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:05,832
Wasn't that a "thank you"?

571
00:34:05,832 --> 00:34:08,666
Oh, that?

572
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:12,232
 Did you buy these flowers with company money?

573
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,300
 Sir? What do you mean?

574
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,733
 Did you waste company money on flowers?

575
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:24,066
 The staff chipped in and bought them.

576
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:26,232
 That's a relief.

577
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,199
 Congratulations, Sir!

578
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:36,433
 Wow, unbelievable.

579
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:37,566
Unbelievable.

580
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:41,365
Did he ask that in that situation?

581
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:42,732
He makes me shudder.

582
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:47,433
Compared to him, my scary wife is an angel.

583
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,733
Hyung!

584
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,465
Let's get some solo shots.

585
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:56,134
Why?

586
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:59,299
For your feature story. Give me a smile.

587
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,566
Your expressions are all blank.

588
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,767
Forget it.

589
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,566
Does he not smile?

590
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:11,431
Come to think of it, I've never seen him smile.

591
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:15,199
Come on. Are you leaving?

592
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,831
How about drinks on this special day?

593
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:20,666
Everyone's here to congratulate you.

594
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:24,299
Yeah, I was thinking of buying anyway.

595
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,399
Oh, hello.

596
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:32,298
Since I won an award, I'll buy drinks.

597
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,299
- Sir? 
 - Sir?

598
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,166
You said no get-togethers...

599
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,498
Since I'm here today, it's okay.

600
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:40,133
- Let's go. 
 - Oh, I'm so sorry.

601
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:41,498
I have to go to a funeral.

602
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:43,599
- You know him, right, Editor Nam? 
 - What?

603
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,533
You know him.

604
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,231
Oh, right.

605
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,132
- You know him, too, right, Editor Yeo? 
 - What?

606
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:49,732
You know him.

607
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:51,531
Oh, of course.

608
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:52,832
You know him, too, Young Won.

609
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:54,566
- What? 
 - You'll know when you get there.

610
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:56,866
You two know him as well.

611
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:57,965
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

612
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:01,199
We all know him so we must go.

613
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,200
Tomorrow's the burial.

614
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,431
I understand.

615
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:06,500
I'll be going then.

616
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:08,934
Goodbye.

617
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:18,698
Should... we really do this?

618
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:22,632
The CEO was being considerate in saying he'll buy.

619
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,533
Being considerate?

620
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:25,967
Did you forget his thumbs up?

621
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:26,866
Right.

622
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:28,098
And even if we had a get-together?

623
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,231
"Stop!"

624
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,199
"Eat within the ₩30,000 limit."

625
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,600
"Don't drink too much." He'd be like that.

626
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,980
It's better to drink by ourselves in peace.

627
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,599
Get in.

628
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,565
Better to drink by ourselves.

629
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:44,465
- We're going to that place, right? 
 - Yes.

630
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:45,900
- Did you make reservations? 
 - Yes, I did.

631
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,600
Good.

632
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,800
Got it.

633
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:57,199
Close it. Close it.

634
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,600
Get in. Get in.

635
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:04,966
- Let's get in. 
 - Let's get in.

636
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:07,533
- Close it. 
 - Let's get in.

637
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,065
Did you come all the way here for a manager award?

638
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:23,165
Since you all dressed up, I thought you'd get more awards.

639
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:24,699
I feel so bad.

640
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:27,865
We got the press award, editing award, and editor award.

641
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:29,133
That's it. Come here.

642
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,766
Are you going to punch me?

643
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:34,600
Try it then!

644
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,200
- It's best not to engage. 
 - Every year, you looked down on us

645
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,599
because we won nothing.

646
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,898
Shut up. Let's go quietly.

647
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:43,265
Just say you're envious.

648
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:45,232
By the way, you should work harder.

649
00:37:45,232 --> 00:37:49,631
No wonder your CEO didn't even mention any of you in his acceptance speech.

650
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:52,300
What?

651
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,665
Are you not on good terms with him?

652
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:58,500
You're worse than a tabloid. You're Messed Up.

653
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,264
Oh, I can't breathe.

654
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:04,500
Jeez. Messed Up...

655
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:12,566
 When I finish counting, run out of the elevator.

656
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:15,632
Five.

657
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:18,567
Four. Three.

658
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,200
- What are you doing? 
 - Two.

659
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,499
Messed Up...

660
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,199
One.

661
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,799
Run!

662
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:32,750
- What are you doing? 
 - What's this?

663
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,940
Close it!

664
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:46,400
♫  Though I may be sad I've got to live  ♫

665
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,070
♫  Because I feel so sad I must go on...  ♫

666
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:03,600
♫  I know that I will understand when I'm gone  ♫

667
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,100
♫  Why I just had to live  ♫

668
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,920
♫  My life here in this world~  ♫

669
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,140
♫  You were the only one for me  ♫

670
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,990
♫  Though sorrow of my heart  ♫

671
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,650
♫  You loved me so~  ♫

672
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,570
♫  Please tell me so...  ♫

673
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:42,399
Get back here.

674
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,166
Get back here. Get back here...

675
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,732
- That hurts, that hurts! 
 - Ouch, ouch.

676
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:50,300
That hurts, that hurts! Ouch!

677
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,200
Oh, I'm dying here.

678
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,233
You should've held back!

679
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:58,999
How could I?

680
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:02,265
I should've ripped his mouth out.

681
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,531
 I'm so angry! Let's order drinks first.

682
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:05,765
 Excuse me!

683
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:07,065
 What should we get for snacks?

684
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:08,266
- What? 
  - Get whatever you want

685
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,600
That sounds like the editorial team.

686
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,564
I thought they were going to a funeral.

687
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:15,980
 Get something expensive.

688
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:25,967
How did our magazine fall to this level?

689
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,365
It's all because of CEO Yoo.

690
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:32,632
Before he came on, we never thought those bastards would look down on us.

691
00:40:32,632 --> 00:40:33,898
You're right.

692
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,365
It's not Monthly Magazine Home.

693
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:36,832
It's Monthly Magazine Hell.

694
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:39,150
Monthly Magazine Hell.

695
00:40:39,832 --> 00:40:41,800
I'm so angry.

696
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:49,264
- Oh, Editor Na. 
 - Yes?

697
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:51,866
How's the feature story going?

698
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,232
It's going.

699
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:56,166
You're interviewing his acquaintances, right?

700
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,534
Write this under anonymous.

701
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:00,998
What kind of a person is Yoo Ja Sung?

702
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:02,566
He only knows money.

703
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:03,800
He's a snobby show off.

704
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,900
He has no regard for his employees.

705
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,365
In short, he makes his employees miserable!

706
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:14,599
Hyung!

707
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,231
This will be epic.

708
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:20,832
A blood bath of the editorial team.

709
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:22,733
He makes me miserable.

710
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,032
 Oh, you scared us!

711
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:26,598
What's wrong with you?

712
00:41:26,598 --> 00:41:27,866
You scared us!

713
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:30,200
There's something scarier.

714
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,765
The CEO was in the next room.

715
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:33,566
Wha... What?

716
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:35,365
I saw him come out of it.

717
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:37,034
Are... Are... you sure it was him?

718
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:38,099
Did you run into each other?

719
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,631
No, but I definitely saw him.

720
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,798
What do we do?

721
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:45,332
He might know we lied to him and came here.

722
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:49,732
There's something worse.

723
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:54,500
He didn't... hear what we said, did he?

724
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:02,532
Hyung.

725
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:05,166
Are you alright?

726
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,865
There's no reason not to be.

727
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:10,265
It's natural to talk behind the boss's back.

728
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:12,599
Then why leave in the middle of dinner?

729
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,566
They might be embarrassed if they run into me.

730
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,333
So don't tell them about tonight.

731
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,366
Is he really okay?

732
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:29,731
What kind of a person is Yoo Ja Sung?

733
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:31,599
He only knows money.

734
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,598
He's a snobby show off.

735
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,799
He has no regard for his employees.

736
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:40,140
In short, he makes his employees...

737
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,899
 - Miserable! 
 - Miserable!

738
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:43,934
Okay. That's it.

739
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:47,565
And? Can you hear us?

740
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,800
No.

741
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,565
It's loud outside.

742
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:52,566
It's quiet outside.

743
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:54,499
Is she sure?

744
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:57,764
She must be hard of hearing, having earphones on all the time.

745
00:42:57,764 --> 00:42:59,665
Don't worry. He probably didn't hear us.

746
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:01,399
If he did, he wouldn't have left.

747
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:04,399
With his temper, he would've come in and gone berserk.

748
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:06,199
- Yes? He didn't hear, right? 
 - He didn't hear, right?

749
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,499
- He probably didn't. 
 - He probably didn't.

750
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:10,300
- Let him not have heard. 
 - Let him not have heard.

751
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,832
 It's not Monthly Magazine Home.

752
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:13,398
 It's Monthly Magazine Hell.

753
00:43:13,398 --> 00:43:15,600
 Monthly Magazine Hell.

754
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,731
 In short, he makes his employees miserable!

755
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:22,566
 It's nothing.

756
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:26,366
 It's common to exclude and badmouth the boss.

757
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,832
 It's completely...   not okay!

758
00:43:30,832 --> 00:43:34,899
What? I make them miserable?

759
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:36,650
Seriously.

760
00:43:48,466 --> 00:43:51,700
I shouldn't be leisurely buying books.

761
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,465
 No, like Sunbae said,

762
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,732
 he wouldn't have just left if he heard us.

763
00:43:56,732 --> 00:43:57,998
 With his temper.

764
00:43:57,998 --> 00:43:59,833
Right?

765
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,140

766
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,680

767
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:24,633
 There's a saying that you must live in your home to know it.

768
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,767
It's a good sentence.

769
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:31,199
Right.

770
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,780
You have to live in your home to know it.

771
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,899
The neighborhood is quiet, so it's good for reading.

772
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:45,067
There's ample sunlight, so they grow well.

773
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:51,865
This apartment gets better the more I live in it.

774
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,399
Move!

775
00:44:56,399 --> 00:44:58,400
- Move! 
 - Stop.

776
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,400
Are you arriving to work now?

777
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,832
I'm sorry.

778
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:07,499
But as you know,

779
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,933
I live in an apartment scheduled for reconstruction.

780
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:12,898
The elevator broke down on my way today.

781
00:45:12,898 --> 00:45:14,231
I was trapped in there for thirty minutes...

782
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:16,765
You should change your name.

783
00:45:16,765 --> 00:45:19,431
Sir? To what?

784
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:20,699
To Choi Worst?

785
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,200
No.

786
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,333
To Choi Patience.

787
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,300
What?

788
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,920
Give him a round of applause.

789
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:38,631
Your patience as you invest with your life!

790
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:40,499
I compliment you.

791
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,432
No doubt you've been the chief editor for this long, thanks to your patience.

792
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:49,865
Others would've quit, but you held on for ten years!

793
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:54,166
We all should learn this kind of patience.

794
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,065
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

795
00:45:56,065 --> 00:45:57,900
- Bye. 
 - Oh, yes.

796
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,400
Goodbye.

797
00:46:12,232 --> 00:46:15,500
He heard what I said yesterday.

798
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,832
He heard.

799
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:17,866
I don't think so.

800
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:20,032
Why would he compliment you if he did?

801
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:21,598
Do you think that was a compliment?

802
00:46:21,598 --> 00:46:23,565
He's not the type to compliment someone.

803
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:24,831
That's true but...

804
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:28,933
He's saying I should leave since I've been a chief editor for ten years.

805
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:30,299
No way.

806
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:32,032
Then he would've told you to leave.

807
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:33,631
Why would he talk around like that?

808
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:36,733
If he tells me up front, there might be trouble.

809
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:41,367
I need to hold onto this job until the reconstruction happens.

810
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:49,990
I'll show him how essential I am no matter what.

811
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,260

812
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,080

813
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,940

814
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,632
Compliment instantly.

815
00:47:30,632 --> 00:47:35,380
Encourage people, so they'll do well.

816
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:49,666
I did what the book said, but will it really work?

817
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:53,766
Do you call this an item?

818
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,932
Are you joking?

819
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:59,133
How dare you work like this?

820
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:02,465
Aren't you ashamed of collecting your paycheck?

821
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:04,333
Of course.

822
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,399
All of life's answers are in books.

823
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,931
I will check thoroughly with eagle eyes.

824
00:48:09,931 --> 00:48:11,765
But still...

825
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:14,933
With just one compliment?

826
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,066
How simple he is!

827
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:18,732
There's no time to drink tea!

828
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,200

829
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,365

830
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:34,132

831
00:48:34,132 --> 00:48:35,264
Stop.

832
00:48:35,264 --> 00:48:36,666
What are you doing?

833
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:39,550
Oh, I...

834
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,733
Let's give him a round of applause.

835
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:58,399
You have multi-tasking skills of messaging and checking subscriptions while working.

836
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:00,332
- I compliment you. 
 - Thank you.

837
00:49:00,332 --> 00:49:06,899
Multi-tasking is crucial to editors who write several articles simultaneously.

838
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:09,067
I compliment you.

839
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,833
He heard what I said, too.

840
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:15,833
He heard.

841
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,200
Editor Yeo.

842
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,000
Sir?

843
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,399
I compliment you.

844
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,832
For... For what?

845
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:31,066
Your focus on work is so great that you have no time to clean.

846
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:33,590
I compliment you.

847
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:40,799
He heard what I said, too.

848
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:42,600
He heard.

849
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,898
I can't get fired.

850
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,799
To get married, I have to pay for the subscription.

851
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:50,199
I have several shoes I'm making monthly payments on.

852
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,100
I can't get fired.

853
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,199
Remember you three were there as well.

854
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,000
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

855
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,500
 Bring me creative items!

856
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,133
 I'm Nam Sang Soon at Monthly Magazine Home.

857
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,733
 I want to interview architect Kim Seok Go.

858
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:11,766
 Do what you can!

859
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:12,999
Move!

860
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:14,300
I sent it there, so...

861
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,620
They're so simple.

862
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,900
What a masterpiece!

863
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:28,765
Look at those dancing whales.

864
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:31,598
Bring me a good item! Now!

865
00:50:31,598 --> 00:50:34,431
This is why our competitor got the best of us!

866
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,932
Bring me something good!

867
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:39,666
Make it good!

868
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,932
What a splendid view!

869
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:43,580
Splendid.

870
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,820

871
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,566
That looks like Editor Na's feature, not CEO Yoo's.

872
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,633
You should've become her boyfriend, not a friend.

873
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:15,766
It was the perfect moment to tell her how you feel.

874
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,731
Hey.

875
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:22,366
What's with the sad silence?

876
00:51:24,033 --> 00:51:27,632
Did she reject you?

877
00:51:27,632 --> 00:51:29,866
Never mind.

878
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:31,898
 I'm overwhelmed trying to become a homeowner.

879
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:34,867
 I don't have the time to find a boyfriend.

880
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:37,033
There's no need to rush.

881
00:51:37,033 --> 00:51:39,131
Then you'll miss the opportunity.

882
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:41,699
While you're eating 1+1 with her at a store,

883
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,966
she could find her plus one elsewhere.

884
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:45,634
Are you done talking?

885
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:46,799
You've never dated.

886
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:47,932
How dare you give advice?

887
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:49,066
Get lost!

888
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:50,780
All right.

889
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,165
 Who is it?

890
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:19,132
Hello.

891
00:52:19,132 --> 00:52:22,432
I'm Editor Na Young Won from Monthly Magazine House.

892
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:25,666
I have something to give you.

893
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,265
What?

894
00:52:27,265 --> 00:52:28,433
Here.

895
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,333
What a surprise!

896
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,032
CEO Yoo sent it, right?

897
00:52:32,032 --> 00:52:33,333
What?

898
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:36,865
Thank you.

899
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:37,866
Sure.

900
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,998
He came here a while ago.

901
00:52:39,998 --> 00:52:44,098
 I'm CEO Yoo Ja Sung of Monthly Magazine House.

902
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:45,866
 You requested a renovation

903
00:52:45,866 --> 00:52:48,131
 for the interior special article "Change," right?

904
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,799
 Yes. What brings you here?

905
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,032
 First of all,

906
00:52:54,032 --> 00:52:58,832
 I'm sorry for cancelling on renovating your place.

907
00:52:58,832 --> 00:53:00,900
 It's okay.

908
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,865
 Changing the interior of a monthly rental is only good for the landlord.

909
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:07,231
 It'd be the end if he told you to move out.

910
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:09,331
 Oh, I see.

911
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:11,466
 So I wanted to give you this.

912
00:53:11,466 --> 00:53:15,620
 It would be better if you looked into this.

913
00:53:18,067 --> 00:53:19,765
 If you do more research and study,

914
00:53:19,765 --> 00:53:23,465
 you can get job training and daycare service.

915
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:26,267
 I brought all the material you need.

916
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:29,900
 It's too complicated. I won't understand it.

917
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,431
 So you won't study?

918
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:36,366
 If you make an effort, your child can grow up in a better environment.

919
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:37,966
 Not knowing is your loss.

920
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:41,130
 The world only helps those who are prepared.

921
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,366
 Just a second.

922
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,767
 The world will be tougher on you.

923
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:18,464
 If you do something well, they'll be suspicious or envious.

924
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:24,066
 If you do something bad, they'll criticize your environment.

925
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:27,499
 But you still have to live the best you can.

926
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:31,167
 I'm the last dragon from the ditch,

927
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,332
 but I hope you become the next dragon.

928
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,632
 This is obviously too hard for you to understand.

929
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:44,465
 First, grow up healthy and strong.

930
00:54:44,465 --> 00:54:47,199
 He spoke a bit coldly,

931
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,465
but he came all the way here to tell me that,

932
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:52,967
and I felt so grateful.

933
00:54:52,967 --> 00:54:56,000
He wasn't wrong.

934
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,567
So I wanted to ask you...

935
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:04,632
Can you give him this?

936
00:55:04,632 --> 00:55:09,390
I knitted it, but I don't know if he'll like it.

937
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,099
Okay.

938
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:23,232
It's the first time in a long time I worked this hard.

939
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:26,432
I gave it my all.

940
00:55:26,432 --> 00:55:29,099
This will be the death of me.

941
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:32,365
So why work so hard all of a sudden?

942
00:55:32,365 --> 00:55:36,999
There is someone I'd like to send to Jejudo.

943
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:39,733
Really? Who?

944
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:41,599
CEO Yoo.

945
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,440
What? CEO Yoo?

946
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,500

947
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,000
Hi, Sunbae.

948
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,198
 We're out for drinks. Come on over.

949
00:55:53,198 --> 00:55:56,565
I have to send the first draft to the CEO.

950
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:57,831
I see.

951
00:55:57,831 --> 00:55:59,632
Another time, then.

952
00:55:59,632 --> 00:56:02,832
Oh, and you don't have to worry.

953
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:04,798
We won't ever get fired.

954
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:05,499
What?

955
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:06,898
Ms. Lee said...

956
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:11,099
 CEO Yoo isn't as bad as you think.

957
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:14,632
 If he were to fire you for that, he would've fired you ages ago.

958
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:18,999
 He's not someone to fire you for badmouthing him.

959
00:56:18,999 --> 00:56:20,299
 He endured worse.

960
00:56:20,299 --> 00:56:21,431
 Worse?

961
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:25,431
 I heard from the former CEO recently.

962
00:56:25,431 --> 00:56:27,899
 Real Estate Agent Yoo Ja Sung

963
00:56:27,899 --> 00:56:31,399
 as the CEO of Monthly Magazine Home is ridiculous!

964
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:33,999
 - Ridiculous! Ridiculous! 
 - When this magazine was being sold to CEO Yoo,

965
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:35,598
 all of you were livid.

966
00:56:35,598 --> 00:56:36,700
 You were like,

967
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,264
 "A magazine can't go to an ignorant real estate operator."

968
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:43,131
 "If he becomes the CEO, we'll quit!"

969
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:45,598
 You put up posters and held protests.

970
00:56:45,598 --> 00:56:47,565
 CEO Yoo knows all about that.

971
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:49,732
 What? How can he know?

972
00:56:49,732 --> 00:56:52,865
 Because the former CEO told him.

973
00:56:52,865 --> 00:56:57,466
 He said to fire you all because you'll present challenges.

974
00:56:57,466 --> 00:57:00,899
 But he bought the magazine, insisting on keeping all of us on.

975
00:57:00,899 --> 00:57:02,633
 He's that kind of person.

976
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:03,666
Really?

977
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:07,331
Yes, but even if he wouldn't have fired us,

978
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:11,832
if he heard how we badmouthed him,

979
00:57:11,832 --> 00:57:13,598
he would've gotten angry.

980
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,598
 Maybe he really didn't hear us.

981
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,530
I don't know.

982
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,090

983
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,670

984
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:48,332
 In a word, he is...

985
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,866
 Terribly tiresome.

986
00:57:52,532 --> 00:57:57,332
 He seems cold-hearted and cruel,

987
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:59,932
 but that's just the outside.

988
00:57:59,932 --> 00:58:01,666
 On the inside, he's warm and tender-hearted.

989
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,567
 What?

990
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:04,966
 No.

991
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:07,966
 You're just saying that because you're close.

992
00:58:07,966 --> 00:58:13,332
 This interview isn't objective, so I can't put it in the article.

993
00:58:13,332 --> 00:58:15,666
 It's true.

994
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,567
 I know.

995
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:20,967
 I know how good a person Hyung is.

996
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:27,920
 He seems cold, but he's warm and tender-hearted.

997
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:48,566
 I emailed you the first draft of the feature story.

998
00:58:55,966 --> 00:59:00,898
 The house I followed him to, looked like a great mansion.

999
00:59:00,898 --> 00:59:03,965
 But his eye for real estate was sharp.

1000
00:59:03,965 --> 00:59:06,632
 As the saying "A railroad is a road of money,"

1001
00:59:06,632 --> 00:59:09,699
 he focused on the station district.

1002
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:13,999
I can tell she read real estate books.

1003
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:18,450
 Seeing him made me think.

1004
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,033
What's this?

1005
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:25,965
 There's a saying that you must live in your home to know it.

1006
00:59:25,965 --> 00:59:30,232
 Likewise, you must experience a person to know them.

1007
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:32,265
 Stop. Change the client.

1008
00:59:32,265 --> 00:59:35,933
 Who would be interested in a single room interior?

1009
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:41,099
 A person might seem cold on the outside,

1010
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:46,867
 but you don't know what's on the inside.

1011
00:59:46,867 --> 00:59:51,666
 Just as a mansion whose opulence leaves you in awe

1012
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:57,100
 can turn out to be a sharehouse for many people,

1013
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:03,299
 CEO Yoo might seem cold and unapproachable,

1014
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,399
 but on the inside,

1015
01:00:04,399 --> 01:00:09,366
 he has a warmth that embraces others.

1016
01:00:09,366 --> 01:00:12,566
What's this sudden turn?

1017
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,210

1018
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,631
I read your article.

1019
01:00:22,631 --> 01:00:25,765
 It seems you studied up on real estate.

1020
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:29,032
I compliment your diligence.

1021
01:00:29,032 --> 01:00:30,166
Thank you.

1022
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:33,731
But what you wrote below was cringe-worthy.

1023
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:35,865
 You don't have to make me look nice.

1024
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,699
- Just write as it is... 
  - I wrote as it is.

1025
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:39,432
What?

1026
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:41,966
You really are a good person.

1027
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:44,566
I wanted to compliment you.

1028
01:00:46,099 --> 01:00:48,799
 I'll see you tomorrow.

1029
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,499
 You really are a good person.

1030
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:58,566
 I wanted to compliment you.

1031
01:00:58,566 --> 01:01:01,264
 You really are a good person.

1032
01:01:01,264 --> 01:01:03,990
 I wanted to compliment you.

1033
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,390
♫  Give it to you, my eyes, eyes, eyes  ♫

1034
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:13,220
♫  A series of my touch, touch, touch, touch  ♫

1035
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:16,830
♫  One and only my love, love, my lover  ♫

♫  From my head, bboom boom  ♫

♫  To my toes, bboom bboom, bboom bboom, ow!  ♫

1038

1039

♫  I'll give you bboom bboom, bboom bboom  ♫

♫  What you see now will not be a dream, wake up, wake up  ♫

1042

1043
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,100
♫  Hey! Show off your charms,  ♫

1044
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,832
Wait. What was I doing?

1045
01:01:48,832 --> 01:01:53,366
Have I become a whale just because

1046
01:01:53,366 --> 01:01:55,940
Na Zero Won complimented me?

1047
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:04,970

1048
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:12,140
♫  We’re so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

1049
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:17,720
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

1050
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,000
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

1051
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,310
♫  But I’m imagining  ♫

1052
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:24,860

~ Preview ~

1053
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,065
 I thought he was laying the groundwork to fire us.

1054
01:02:27,065 --> 01:02:30,032
 If you want to keep hearing compliments, be careful.

1055
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:30,900
 I guess he knows.

1056
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,098
 - That you're a good person. 
 - No.

1057
01:02:33,098 --> 01:02:35,500
 I'm not a good person.

1058
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,400
 Yesterday, he was such a good person.

1059
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,166
 How about a blind date tomorrow?

1060
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:43,933
 I'm destined to be lonely my whole life.

1061
01:02:43,933 --> 01:02:45,140
 What?

1062
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,330
♫  I want to see you from closer  ♫

1063
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:49,765
 Stay here until the repair is done.

1064
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:50,765
 Don't worry.

1065
01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:53,720
 How can I not? You make it hard not to.

1066
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,660
♫  Did you ever think this would happen? I bet you know  ♫

1067
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,700
♫  You’re so cute  ♫
