1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,510

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,280

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,000

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,350

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,490

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,310

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,340

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,400

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,120

10
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,299
 There's a buyer for the place you're staying in.

11
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,699
 They said that, if they can move in immediately,

12
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,733
 they'll pay more than the market price.

13
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,767
You'll have to move soon.

14
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,333
Where will you go this time?

15
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,164
No, I'm not moving.

16
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:09,466
Why not?

17
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,431
I'm not going to sell this place.

18
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,565
I'm going to stay here.

19
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:15,632
You said it was a temporary stay for profit...

20
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,466
Yes, I said that.

21
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:20,234
That a place is a means to increase your assets.

22
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,333
But now, it's not.

23
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:28,533
To me, this isn't just a place,

24
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,120
but it's also a home.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,400

26
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,498
I've been meaning to ask you.

27
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,932
Can you accompany me somewhere?

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,460

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,699
You know what?

30
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:50,832
It's been ten years since I last wrote a moving-in notification.

31
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:52,331
Then how did you live all this time?

32
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:55,465
I lived in empty places owned by the investment company,

33
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:58,766
so I never stayed in one place longer than a week.

34
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:01,299
I didn't know you moved so often.

35
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:06,032
After I met you, I realized for the first time that I was homeless.

36
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:11,332
You said that a home is a container that holds life.

37
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,332
I had a lot of residences,

38
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:16,900
but I had no home.

39
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm going to keep living in this house which holds a lot of our memories.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,167
While making even better memories.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,032
- Are you done? 
 - Yes.

42
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,560

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,580

44
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,833
Editor Na.

45
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,331
How's your article linking up with Editor Nam's?

46
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,566
Oh, I have some stuff I need to organize.

47
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,031
I'll hand it over to Editor Na soon.

48
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:52,799
How about we change the theme and go with what a good house to live in is?

49
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,331
Yes, sounds good.

50
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,331
Okay, then. Carry on with that.

51
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:58,366
What is this issue's travel theme?

52
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,399
How about a special on a school trip?

53
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:03,531
So people can be reminded of their school trip.

54
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,298
Wow, that's good.

55
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,466
- In my day, we went to Gyeongju. 
 - Me, too.

56
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,567
You, too? Me, too.

57
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:13,367
Yes, Gyeongju is the best for school trips.

58
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,766
Did you go to another place for your school trip?

59
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,732
Yes.

60
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,999
- Where? 
 - The convenience store.

61
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,231
What?

62
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:25,732
I always worked part-time at night.

63
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:28,533
So I haven't been on a school trip.

64
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,131
But now that you're financially capable,

65
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:35,933
you must've been to every travel destination.

66
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,131
No.

67
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:40,932
I've been all over the country for a survey,

68
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,966
but I've never been on a trip.

69
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,499
Excuse me. I have to take this.

70
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:46,899
Yes, Secretary Hwang?

71
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:49,832
How did the investment in Sangeon Construction go?

72
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:51,165
Really?

73
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,499
From when?

74
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,700
In a way, I feel bad for CEO Yoo.

75
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,534
He doesn't know what fun there is in life.

76
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,366
What?

77
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,732
A trip?

78
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:06,964
You said you've never been on a school trip.

79
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:09,266
Let's go on a school trip this weekend.

80
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,166
To Gyeongju.

81
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,599
What's wrong?

82
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,999
Are you sick?

83
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,399
No.

84
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,265
Thinking about going on a trip with you is making my heart flutter already.

85
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,932
- Great. Let's go on a trip. 
 - Good.

86
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,164
Have you gone on a lot of trips?

87
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:32,499
When was your last trip?

88
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,164
A school trip.

89
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:35,100
What?

90
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,865
You must know since you saw my post on the café,

91
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:40,898
but my family suddenly became poor,

92
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,790
so I never dreamed of going on a trip after that.

93
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,290

94
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,666
 Is this really it?

95
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,265
 Yes. This is now our home.

96
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,633
 Awesome.

97
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:56,865
 Through my father's friend, we bought an unsold unit at a cheap price,

98
00:04:56,865 --> 00:05:01,633
 and my parents finally became homeowners.

99
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,766
 Who are you?

100
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,699
 Who are you?

101
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,164
 I'm the owner of this house.

102
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,798
 We're supposed to move in here today.

103
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:10,264
 What are you talking about? I live here.

104
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,232
 What a weird person!

105
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,632
 It turned out to be a Double Contract fraud.

106
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:21,999
 My parents lost all their money and the money they borrowed.

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,466
 Let's go.

108
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:48,833
 Mom.

109
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,199
 Honey.

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,499
 Young Won.

111
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:58,299
 I'll make money and return.

112
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,931
 I'm so sorry.

113
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:05,833
 My father disappeared like that, and my mom and I lived a hard life.

114
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,965
So that's why you said you moved often.

115
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,766
Yes.

116
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:22,300
Since I was busy making ends meet, I couldn't think of going on a trip.

117
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:25,734
Let's go on that trip.

118
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,031
Yes.

119
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:30,466
Let's forget the past pain and have a great time.

120
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,700
Okay.

121
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,599
Oh, wait.

122
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,633
My heart is fluttering...

123
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,866
A class reunion?

124
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,232
Oh, no. I don't think I can go.

125
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:45,931
I'm going on a trip this weekend.

126
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,366
What?

127
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,899
Yes, with my boyfriend.

128
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,999
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,366
Bye.

130
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:55,566
Are you going on a trip? With Hyung?

131
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:58,400
Oh, yes.

132
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,366
Thanks.

133
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:05,731
It's incredible that Hyung is going on a trip.

134
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:09,665
He used to say that if he had time for a trip, he'd rather earn money.

135
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:13,366
Indeed, the power of love is strong.

136
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:20,499
Hyung has changed a lot after meeting you.

137
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,965
Seeing how he's getting along well with people.

138
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:27,299
He usually never opened up to anyone.

139
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:31,500
It's because of that person, right?

140
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,599
When he was betrayed by someone he trusted.

141
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,967
I guess you knew.

142
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,732
After that, he built a wall around himself

143
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:41,200
and lived a lonely life,

144
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,733
only focused on making money.

145
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,465
Hyung being able to smile like that now,

146
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:49,933
it's all thanks to you.

147
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:54,234
Please make lots of good memories on your trip, too.

148
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,967
Okay.

149
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,199
- Ui Joo Ui Joo. 
 - Yeah?

150
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,499
- I can sleep over tonight again, right? 
 - Again?

151
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,765
Won't your parents worry?

152
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,199
I told them I'm working overtime.

153
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,733
I love hanging out with you all day.

154
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:27,331
Which brings me to my question. What if we get married?

155
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:28,531
No.

156
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:31,632
I told you I don't ever plan on getting married.

157
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:34,899
Don't reject the idea right away...

158
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,865
Seriously!

159
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:37,965
I told you.

160
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,999
If you want to get married, date someone else!

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,267
I'll let you go!

162
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:43,332
Okay.

163
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,200
I take back what I said.

164
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,933
Starting today, I'm against marriage!

165
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,600
Marriage? I loathe it!

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,231
Let's date each other our whole lives.

167
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,765
Ui Joo Ui Joo.

168
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,332
Hold my hands now.

169
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,732
Instead of yoga, let's do another workout.

170
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,566
Another workout?

171
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,800
Come on.

172
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:14,332
Yes!

173
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,932
Ui Joo Ui Joo!

174
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,266
♪ Let's go to a place where you can ♪

175
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:23,164
♪ Hear echoes in the flowing stream ♪

176
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,331
♪ To that place ♪

177
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,667
♪ Let's go on a trip ♪

178
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,965
And do what?

179
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:30,598
What do you do on a trip?

180
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,065
I've never been on one.

181
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:43,400
I'm going on a trip with Ja Sung.

182
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,866
I can't believe this.

183
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,633

184
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,999

185
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:26,332
Hello? Editor Nam.

186
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:29,000
Where is this person right now?

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,999
Could it really be your father?

188
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,665
You saw the photo yourself.

189
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,131
It's definitely him.

190
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,699
Yes.

191
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,932
I hope it is.

192
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,733
I think it's over there.

193
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,167
Yes, I think we're almost there.

194
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,032
Dad?

195
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,399
Dad!

196
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,800
Young Won!

197
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,832
Honey!

198
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:35,598
- You! 
 - Ouch, ouch!

199
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,633
- You should've died! 
 - I'm sorry, Honey.

200
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,199
- You should've died! 
 - Please forgive me!

201
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,532
- Stop it. 
 - Because of you, Young Won and I

202
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,933
went through so much hardship!

203
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:52,799
Dad!

204
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,399
Stop!

205
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,131
Let go of me!

206
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,832
Honey!

207
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:05,233
Honey!

208
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,067
I'm sorry!

209
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,332
 Something came up at home, so I put in a leave.

210
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,399
 It's nothing bad so don't worry.

211
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,799
 I'll call you later.

212
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:25,165
 What do you want to eat at Gyeongju...?

213
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,431
No.

214
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:30,566
She's away due to a family matter. I shouldn't bother her.

215
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:38,434
What in the world should we do on the trip?

216
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:58,800
Editor Nam. How's the Gyeongju travel article going?

217
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,832
- Sir? 
 - As the editor in charge, please tell me.

218
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,531
What's a must-see place in Gyeongju?

219
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:09,231
This is random. Oh, are you going on a trip to Gyeongju?

220
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,267
Oh, no.

221
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:12,699
I'm the CEO of this magazine,

222
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,531
but I feel like I've only been focused on my promo articles.

223
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,733
So I'm thinking of pouring interest into other segments.

224
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:21,298
Wow, you're amazing. Even when you're so busy—

225
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,264
So please tell me, Editor Nam.

226
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:26,434
What's a must-see place in Gyeongju?

227
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:29,065
Museums and historic sites are a given.

228
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:32,566
If I were to recommend something else... Hwangridan Road.

229
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,598
Wow, Hwangridan Road is amazing.

230
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,899
I went there with my wife, too.

231
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,767
You did? What did you do there?

232
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:41,264
We got into a fight because we wanted to go to different restaurants.

233
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:43,499
Oh, The Bomun Lake Resort is good too. The scenery is pretty.

234
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:46,431
Wow! That's a really nice place.

235
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:47,965
I also went there with my wife.

236
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:50,198
- What did you do there? 
 - We got into a fight

237
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:51,800
because we wanted to see different things.

238
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,565
Chief Editor. Please get along well with your wife.

239
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:58,899
Studies show that domestic trouble can affect a child's grades in school.

240
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,032
- Is it your kid? 
 - What?

241
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,366
Leave my family out of it.

242
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,232
- I was just worried... 
 - I said, leave them out of it!

243
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,699
Stop!

244
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,965
- Let's go somewhere else and talk. 
 - Okay.

245
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:09,332
- Not you. I meant Editor Nam. 
 - What?

246
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,465
You're only hindering the conversation.

247
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,699
- Let's go, Editor Nam. 
 - Okay.

248
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,099
- I'll buy you a cup of coffee. 
 - Okay. Thank you.

249
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,666
I'm lonely.

250
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:25,366
So lonely.

251
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,899
Leaving home, I got on a deep-sea fishing vessel

252
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,598
and got injured.

253
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:34,100
So I was kicked out.

254
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,733
Were you hurt badly?

255
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:38,266
Are you okay now?

256
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:40,000
Since I left like that,

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,333
I was so ashamed that I couldn't return home.

258
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,165
- I'm so sorry. 
 - Bull crap.

259
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:49,631
You were hiding from the creditors.

260
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,032
To live comfortably by yourself.

261
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,399
No, I really

262
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,298
tried to earn money

263
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:57,600
to pay off the debt somehow and come find you.

264
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,499
I also did everything here that would make money

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,998
and saved up.

266
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:03,799
You must've suffered so much alone.

267
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,366
What load of crap.

268
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,631
Suffer so much alone?

269
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,165
You suffered a million times more.

270
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,064
- Mom... 
 - What?

271
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:12,999
She never stopped working while she was in college.

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,264
She got a job right after graduation

273
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:16,264
and paid our debt off with every paycheck.

274
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,399
She worked night and day.

275
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,932
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:24,166
What I did was very wrong.

277
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,267
At least you know that.

278
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:28,467
Forget it.

279
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,264
Get up. We're leaving.

280
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:33,733
Let's take Dad, all right?

281
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,300
No. How can I?

282
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,834
I'm not without conscience.

283
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,798
- Mom. 
 - Don't worry about me.

284
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,167
- Go. 
 - Pack your bags.

285
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,933
What if Young Won gets married?

286
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,332
- Will you greet your son-in-law like that? 
 - Honey...

287
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:51,465
I can't let that happen.

288
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:52,933
Pack your bags and follow us.

289
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,534
Now.

290
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:57,899
Let's go.

291
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,366
Okay.

292
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:02,098
Come in.

293
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:05,367
This is the office that your son works in.

294
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,800
- Who are they? 
 - Oh?

295
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:13,199
I don't know. They look familiar...

296
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,366
- Mom? 
 - Dad!

297
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,499
- What? 
 - You can stand here.

298
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,032
Hello.

299
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:21,933
- Oh, hello. 
 - Hello.

300
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:23,333
What brings you here?

301
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,566
They were worried you were skipping meals,

302
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,631
so they came here themselves to see you.

303
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:29,899
Because you've been working overtime every day

304
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,765
instead of going home.

305
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,431
Your cooking is superb.

306
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,267
This is so delicious, Ma'am.

307
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,432
Oh, thank you.

308
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:47,733
Chief Editor.

309
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,899
Please excuse me for saying this...

310
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,298
Oh, please go ahead.

311
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,298
I know there's much work to do,

312
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:59,399
but can you at least let my son sleep at home?

313
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,034
- Excuse me? 
 - Dad, please!

314
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:05,098
What? When you don't come home, your mother doesn't sleep well.

315
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,065
Do you know how worried she gets?

316
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,299
Honey.

317
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,132
Don't say that.

318
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,866
Oh, yes, of course.

319
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,899
You heard your father, right?

320
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,498
Starting from today, go home. Every day.

321
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:18,867
Yes, sir.

322
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,232
By the way, our Sang Soon must get married soon.

323
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,799
Editor Yeo, you're the same age as him.

324
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,032
If you know a good woman, can you introduce her to him?

325
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:30,033
Pardon?

326
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,067
Oh, sure.

327
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,100
Stop talking about things like that here.

328
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,365
Finish eating and leave. I have to go cover a story.

329
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,999
You know why we're saying this!

330
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,499
You have to get married soon

331
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,065
and give us grandchildren...

332
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,099
I'm not getting married!

333
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:44,332
- What? 
 - What?

334
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,264
I'm against marriage.

335
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,533
I loathe marriage!

336
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,299
You bastard!

337
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,967
How can you say that to your parents?

338
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:56,266
Do you want to see your mother collapse?

339
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:11,599
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

340
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,167
They want it so badly.

341
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:21,299
Why don't you reconsider marriage?

342
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,932
Yes, I think I should.

343
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,633
Right?

344
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,099
I'm glad you think so.

345
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:29,198
Marriage isn't such a bad thing...

346
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,098
My relationship with him...

347
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:33,565
- I need to reconsider it. 
 - What?

348
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:34,932
I have no intention of marrying.

349
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,899
So holding Sang Soon back

350
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,065
is an awful thing to do.

351
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,299
Wait, Editor Yeo...

352
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,098
My parents are leaving.

353
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,932
Okay, we'll be there.

354
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,932
You're not going to break up right away, right?

355
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,599
- Right? 
 - Let's go say goodbye.

356
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:06,298
Why did you bring all your worn out clothes?

357
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:09,800
Throw this away. This, too.

358
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,566
- Mom. 
 - What?

359
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,365
Man of nature?

360
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:15,499
What a laugh!

361
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,033
You're a jobless guy living in the mountain.

362
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,765
- Stop it. 
 - It's okay.

363
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:22,933
She's right.

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,799
But this photo helped me

365
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,431
get through everything.

366
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:29,765
My daughter...

367
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:32,365
You were still like a kid in this photo.

368
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,832
I see you're an adult now.

369
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,032
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,566
For not being there for you.

371
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,733
Stop saying you're sorry.

372
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,132
You can be there for me from now on.

373
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,065
See me get married, have kids,

374
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,531
and watch them go to school.

375
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,067
Okay?

376
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,199
Okay.

377
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,299
Are you seeing anyone?

378
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,799
What?

379
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
There is someone, isn't there?

380
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,400
Right?

381
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,399
You've met him once.

382
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,666
When?

383
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,332
It's the CEO.

384
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,933
What?

385
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,832
The CEO of your magazine?

386
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,431
Oh, my goodness!

387
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:17,566
He seemed like such a nice person.

388
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,165
He's handsome and competent.

389
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,999
Oh, my goodness! I'm so happy for you!

390
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,133
I guess your mother knows him well.

391
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,065
I'm curious to know who he is.

392
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,867
Want to see a picture?

393
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,166
Handsome, right?

394
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,366
Is this man's name Yoo Ja Sung?

395
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,000
What?

396
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,165
How do you know Ja Sung?

397
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,900
Indeed.

398
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,565
Do you know him?

399
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,065
What else is there to do on a trip?

400
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,633
It's all about taking memorable pictures.

401
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,698
So?

402
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:11,300
Have you got the hang of it?

403
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,899
With skills like this, you'll never get to take memorable photos with Editor Na.

404
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,232
This selfie stick...

405
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,865
isn't easy to handle.

406
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,232
Look.

407
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,098
Hold your arm up firmly.

408
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:25,567
Don't move.

409
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,765
Make it level with the person.

410
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:29,999
That way, the composition is stable.

411
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,632
It's important to make it level...

412
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:36,199
with the person...

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,366
What's with the smirk?

414
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,899
It's good to see you like this.

415
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,098
Like what?

416
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,800
It's nice to see you happy.

417
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,265
It's all thanks to you.

418
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:54,334
If it weren't for you,

419
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,599
the me of today wouldn't exist.

420
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:09,466
 Come on, let's eat.

421
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,199
 Eat up and get energy.

422
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,264
 I'm okay.

423
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:14,031
 Don't say that.

424
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:17,565
 I asked my wife to pack a lot, so I can share with you.

425
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:20,933
 If there are leftovers, my wife will scold me.

426
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:24,200
 Did you get the money you needed?

427
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
 No.

428
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,598
 I borrowed money from people and got a bank loan.

429
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,733
 But it's still not enough.

430
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:35,733
 I've been meaning to ask. Do you...

431
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,899
 Never mind.

432
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,132
 I shouldn't ask.

433
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:42,500
 I'll lend you the money.

434
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:48,433
 You always told me that your wish is to become a homeowner

435
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,233
 and live with your family with no worries about having to move.

436
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:53,866
 You always treat me like a son,

437
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,565
 so I'm repaying you.

438
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:59,831
 I will never forget your kindness.

439
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,931
 I'll pay you back first thing.

440
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,432
 - Thank you, Ja Sung. 
 - Sure.

441
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:08,233
 - Let's eat. 
 - Thank you!

442
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,598
 Oh, Ja Sung.

443
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,765
 Did you hear?

444
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,932
 - Mr. Na has gone off the grid. 
 - What?

445
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:16,899
 He borrowed money from people and fled.

446
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:47,067
If you hadn't been by my side, comforting me,

447
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,532
it would've been really hard for me.

448
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:53,434
You're so grateful, right?

449
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:56,732
Then forget that gloomy past,

450
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:59,533
and think only about a bright, happy future.

451
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:02,833
Okay. Thanks.

452
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,032
- What are you doing? Set the composition again. 
 - Okay.

453
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:10,000
- Grip it tight. 
 - Real tight.

454
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,799
Ui Joo!

455
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,399
- There you are. 
 - Yeah.

456
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,865
What are you doing?

457
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:33,132
What do you think?

458
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:34,999
I'm working.

459
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:40,431
Don't worry about what my parents said.

460
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:43,233
I really have no intention of getting married.

461
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:49,032
Joo! Let's go straight home after work.

462
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,698
I'll make you dinner.

463
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,865
I'll cook truffle pasta that you like and...

464
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,399
Go to your home today.

465
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,666
Your parents will worry.

466
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,666
- No, it's okay. 
 - It's because I'm tired.

467
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,399
I want to rest alone.

468
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:05,166
Oh, okay.

469
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:08,399
- I'll be going now. 
 - Bye.

470
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:22,166
What am I going to do?

471
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,860

472
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,864
You take a trip to learn.

473
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,266
Is that so?

474
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,366
Oh, look at the time!

475
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:58,032
Has Young Won come back to Seoul?

476
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,198
 Did you get home safe?

477
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:06,032
 Are you sure it wasn't anything bad?

478
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,966
 Yes, it was no big deal.

479
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,999
 Won't you be tired for tomorrow's trip?

480
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,365
 Get some sleep.

481
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:15,666
 You, too.

482
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:23,498
 So this is how it feels not to be able to sleep before a trip.

483
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,765
 My heart is fluttering. I'm looking forward to it,

484
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:28,466
 so much I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

485
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:47,165
 I also lost all the money I saved up once.

486
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,566
 I was betrayed by someone I trusted.

487
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,200
 It was the biggest ordeal and scar of my life.

488
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,899
 I thought it was no use trying to make it.

489
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,799
 The pain was unimaginable.

490
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,598
 I wanted to die.

491
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,865
 After that, he built a wall around himself and lived a lonely life,

492
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:05,332
 only focused on making money.

493
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,733
 I always worked part-time at night,

494
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,633
 so I haven't been on a school trip.

495
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,733
 My heart is fluttering, too.

496
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,399
 Let's have fun on our trip.

497
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,232
 Make it a trip we'll never forget.

498
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,967
Ja Sung.

499
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,800
- Get in. 
 - Okay.

500
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,465
Oh, no. It's locked.

501
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:10,599
I'll open it for you.

502
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,499
Huh? That's...

503
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,665
What do you think? My amazing girlfriend gave it to me.

504
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:20,031
Okay, then. Let's go!

505
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,699
Here.

506
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,098
Daereungwon Ancient Tombs is Historical Site No. 512.

507
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:34,265
It consists of 23 tombs of the kings, queens and

508
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:36,666
nobles of the Silla Dynasty including Cheonmachong,

509
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,399
Royal Tomb of King Michu and Hwangnamdaechong.

510
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,698
You studied a lot.

511
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:45,533
Well. You see as much as you know,

512
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:48,366
so I studied up before our trip.

513
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:51,065
There's a famous photo zone.

514
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,500
Let's take a picture.

515
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,120
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

516
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,598
We should move a little to the right.

517
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,432
The subject and scenery mustn't be in a straight line.

518
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,860
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

519
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:14,900
Wow, you're very photogenic.

520
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,799
This time, I'll take a photo of you.

521
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,065
Stand over there.

522
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:21,565
I want to, but we have to go to Cheonmachong now.

523
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:24,498
- What? 
 - I drew up a schedule.

524
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:26,531
- A schedule? 
 - Yes.

525
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,365
We can't waste even a second, so I set a tight schedule.

526
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:31,365
Wait.

527
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:34,233
Can we see all of this in one day?

528
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,431
It's possible. If we follow this schedule.

529
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,799
In that respect, let's move.

530
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,400
This way.

531
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,198
This is the oldest observatory in Asia.

532
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,498
It consists of 365 rocks that represent each day of the year.

533
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:50,332
It's the Cheomseongdae.

534
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:54,333
Wow, it's even more marvelous in person.

535
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,066
You're right.

536
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,867
- Do you want to take a walk around once? 
 - Okay.

537
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:00,833
Just a sec.

538
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,030

539
00:30:02,032 --> 00:30:05,099
Oh, Young Won. We have to go to our next plan.

540
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:06,232
What?

541
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:07,365
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:11,699
But if you do as I say, we'll be able to crack Gyeongju in one day.

543
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:13,533
Let's go.

544
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:25,633
Oh? The lights are on.

545
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:27,399
Oh? Chief Editor.

546
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,298
Hey. Why'd you come to work on the weekend?

547
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:33,267
Oh. I have some work left.

548
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:38,398
Jeez. It's because you leave on the dot to go to Editor Yeo's house.

549
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,899
I'll be reprimanded by your parents again.

550
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,665
Since I'm calling you out on the weekend to work.

551
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:45,833
Well, then.

552
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,932
Let's go out and get some drinks...

553
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:51,432
No. I'm going to finish up and go on a date.

554
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,665
Jeez. Okay, then.

555
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,832
Do you think I don't have anyone else to drink with?

556
00:30:56,832 --> 00:30:59,233
What a lousy friend.

557
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,733
Hello, sir.

558
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:05,632
It's the weekend. What are you doing?

559
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,065
How about a drink...?

560
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,132
He... Hello?

561
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,967
He hung up on me.

562
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:15,632
Hi, Joo.

563
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,132
I'm almost done.

564
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:19,600
What should we do? Watch a movie?

565
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,065
No. I'm tired.

566
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:25,065
I want to stay home.

567
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:27,032
Really?

568
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:29,898
Then I'll come and cook for you. The pasta I promised yesterday.

569
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:32,199
No. I want to be alone.

570
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,399
I'm tired.

571
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:34,732
Are you really tired?

572
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:36,164
Or are you avoiding me?

573
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:38,265
- What? 
 - Why...

574
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:40,699
- Are you avoiding me? 
 - I'm not avoiding you.

575
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,765
You've been avoiding me since yesterday

576
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:46,000
after you met my parents.

577
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,566
I'll come to your place.

578
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,332
Let's talk face to face.

579
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:58,100
Okay.

580
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,466
I should tell him.

581
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:02,334
I'll tell him.

582
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,300
♫  You’re my love  ♫

583
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,560
Let's go, Student Na Young Won.

584
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,267
♫  Look at me, I’ll be standing right here  ♫

585
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:20,830
♫  Hey, I feel that I’ve changed because of you  ♫

586
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,190
♫  Sometimes I feel like I’m day dreaming  ♫

587
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,533
Here we go.

588
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:28,060
♫  Whatever it is, I’ll do it for you  ♫

589
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,730
♫  Whenever you need someone on your side  ♫

590
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:34,732
Student Na Young Won.

591
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:35,730
♫  Don’t mind  ♫

592
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,200
♫  So you won’t think that you’re alone  ♫

593
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,450
♫  I’ll hold your hands and open your ears  ♫

594
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,300
♫  I’m there,  ♫

595
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,465
I didn't know there was a place that lent school uniforms.

596
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:51,565
Wearing this, it truly feels like a school trip.

597
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:55,100
Now I don't feel sad about never having gone on a school trip.

598
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,760
♫  You’re my love  ♫

599
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,566
Since I've met you,

600
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:05,020
I feel like the holes in my life are filled completely.

601
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,233
Let's wrap up Hwangridan Road.

602
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,600
- The next plan... 
 - Wait...

603
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,598
Can we go back to our lodging?

604
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,665
What? Already?

605
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,665
There's so much left to see.

606
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,599
We need to see Woljeonggyo Bridge and Bulguksa Temple.

607
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,933
There's something I want to do, too.

608
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,266
Ui Joo. I really have no intention of getting married...

609
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,331
Can you hear me out first?

610
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:45,366
I have something to say, too.

611
00:33:45,366 --> 00:33:48,366
That's why I didn't stop you from coming.

612
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,499
- Sang Soon, let's... 
 - No.

613
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,098
I know what you're going to say, but my answer is no.

614
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:58,665
I'm not breaking up with you ever.

615
00:33:58,665 --> 00:33:59,699
No, I can't.

616
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,899
What?

617
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:05,766
I don't have to get married.

618
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:08,999
I can live alone my whole life.

619
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,699
Just let me be by your side like this. Is that so hard?

620
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,967
Yes, it's hard.

621
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,632
Let's stop dating.

622
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:19,798
How can you...

623
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:21,931
Let's stop dating and get married.

624
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:25,299
- What? 
 - Let's get married.

625
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:26,933
No.

626
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,665
Please marry me, Sang Soon.

627
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,566
It might seem sudden,

628
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:43,399
but I have thought about it a lot since yesterday.

629
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:45,698
But...

630
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,699
 Thank you for the food.

631
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,432
 You're most welcome.

632
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:52,367
 Then we'll be going now.

633
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:54,799
 - Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

634
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,133
 - I'll go cover my story. 
 - Okay.

635
00:34:58,133 --> 00:34:59,666
 Let's go.

636
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,866
 Let's go inside.

637
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:05,265
 I need to go.

638
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:07,899
 Your shoelace came undone.

639
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,133
 All done.

640
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:18,233
 Be careful, be careful.

641
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:21,599
 Watch your head. Watch your head.

642
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:30,031
A son learns from his father.

643
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:34,800
Seeing him be so sweet to his wife even at his age,

644
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,964
I felt that I could trust you.

645
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:41,031
You're not breaking up because of my parents,

646
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:44,332
but because of them, you want to get married?

647
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:51,165
I would feel moved thinking there couldn't be anyone sweeter

648
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:54,166
or warmer than you,

649
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,198
but then I'd think men are all the same.

650
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:01,366
That you could betray me like my father did.

651
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,400
But now I feel like you might be different from the rest.

652
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,166
Ui Joo.

653
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:19,933
Will you marry me?

654
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
Of course!

655
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:35,398
I promise. I'll treat you better than my dad treats my mom.

656
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:46,099
I'll be good to you.

657
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:57,367
Welcome.

658
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,732
Excuse me.

659
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:04,300
- One pork belly and a bottle of soju, please. 
 - Okay.

660
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,933
What?

661
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:10,066
Secretary Hwang!

662
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:15,866
Jeez. It must be so hard assisting CEO Yoo.

663
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,832
No wonder you're here for a drink on a weekend.

664
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,265
I'm not here to drink.

665
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:24,299
- I'm here to eat... 
 - I know how you feel.

666
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,231
You don't need to hide it from me.

667
00:37:27,232 --> 00:37:29,531
CEO Yoo is so picky.

668
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:31,698
He's also fickle.

669
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,499
He's not fickle. He's cautious.

670
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:38,698
Come on. You don't have to hide your true feelings from me.

671
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,099
They say a widower knows how a widow feels.

672
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,732
I'm in the same position as you.

673
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:47,200
Oh, sure.

674
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,565
Excuse me.

675
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,599
- I have to go. I have something to do. 
 - Okay.

676
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,965
- I got this. 
 - No way.

677
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:55,299
Knowing CEO Yoo, I bet you're paid very little.

678
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,565
It's fine. I'll pay.

679
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,632
Excuse me. Check, please.

680
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,165
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

681
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:13,366
Make a lot of money and get away from CEO Yoo.

682
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:15,832
Okay. Bye.

683
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:18,232
Oh, my. Are you already leaving?

684
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:20,733
I was going to give you more meat, on the house.

685
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,466
Are you a regular here?

686
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,398
Oh, you didn't know?

687
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:27,533
- He owns this building. 
 - What?

688
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:31,398
He lowered the rent because times are tough.

689
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:34,898
He was even awarded "Good Landlord" from the borough office.

690
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:38,332
He's still young, but he's amazing.

691
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,099
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

692
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,332
See you next time.

693
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,100
What can I do for you?

694
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,165
What the...?

695
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:50,065
- Are you from a rich family? 
 - Oh, no.

696
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:52,432
Then how can you own a building at your age?

697
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:53,665
What's your secret?

698
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,398
They say a dog recites a poem if it spends three years at a village school.

699
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:59,400
I learned about real estate by watching CEO Yoo.

700
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,899
I guess my secret is finding things to learn about instead of complaining.

701
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm busy, so I'll be going now.

702
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,532
Oh, okay.

703
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:15,100

704
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,566
₩123,000 ($123).

705
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,132
Wait, Secretary Hwang.

706
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,732
Hey, Building Owner!

707
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,765
You pay for this!

708
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:29,032
Oh, is this what you wanted to do?

709
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,265
Yes.

710
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:34,799
I wanted to be with you alone.

711
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,534
I read in a book that you take a trip to learn.

713
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:46,533
I wanted to show you as many sites as I could

714
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,632
and pushed my plans onto you.

715
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:52,532
It's okay. That was good, too.

716
00:39:52,532 --> 00:39:55,000
But you take a trip

717
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:59,933
also to make good memories.

718
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:07,432
From now on, let's go on a lot of trips.

719
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:10,060
Let's make a lot of good memories.

720
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:40,732
You must be tired.

721
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,798
Go inside and rest.

722
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:43,964
No.

723
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:46,265
Come up with me.

724
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:47,899
Can I do that?

725
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:52,633
I really wanted to, but I held back.

726
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:56,799
There's something I didn't tell you.

727
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,431
I actually found my dad.

728
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:00,465
What? Really?

729
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:02,165
Why didn't you tell me?

730
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,833
I wanted our trip to be a happy memory for you.

731
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,000
What do you mean...?

732
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,067
My dad is going to come by to see you.

733
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,199
So suddenly?

734
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,198
Let me go home and change—

735
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,032
Ja Sung.

736
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,899
Mr. Na...

737
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:34,733
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:40,520
I'm so sorry, Ja Sung.

739
00:42:01,232 --> 00:42:03,365
- Where are you? 
  - Home.

740
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:06,766
- Let's go camping. 
 - No, no.

741
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:08,765
Why not? You have nothing else to do.

742
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,265
 No, no, no, no.

743
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:12,899
I'm tired. Bye.

744
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,200
You really don't have to go?

745
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:20,598
No.

746
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:24,166
But what brings you to my house?

747
00:42:26,232 --> 00:42:29,933
I packed you lunch. Help yourself.

748
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,333
- What? 
 - I'm very grateful.

749
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,366
You carried me on your back and took me home.

750
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:38,131
I hesitated how to express my thanks.

751
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,565
I'm only now expressing it like this.

752
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:41,098
Oh, well.

753
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:44,067
I did what should've been done.

754
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,733
Wow, awesome!

755
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:55,132
You made this for me?

756
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:56,000
Yes.

757
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,964
Not for someone else? For me?

758
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:01,133
Of course.

759
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:02,233
I hope you enjoy it!

760
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:04,367
I'll be going now.

761
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,267
Wait, Mi Ra.

762
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:08,766
Yes?

763
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:12,767
If you haven't had lunch, would you like to join me?

764
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:20,265
I'm so glad you reunited with your father.

765
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,366
Let's meet him often and...

766
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,698
This is the money my dad saved up until now.

767
00:43:27,698 --> 00:43:31,500
I'll send you the rest once my mom's store is sold.

768
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,065
You don't have to do this.

769
00:43:33,065 --> 00:43:37,331
If it weren't for that time, I wouldn't have succeeded like this.

770
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:38,799
No.

771
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:44,967
If it weren't for that time, you wouldn't have suffered in pain.

772
00:43:44,967 --> 00:43:48,299
It's okay. It's all water under the bridge.

773
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:50,567
Let's end this.

774
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:53,266
What?

775
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:57,166
I know how much you suffered because of my dad.

776
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:02,699
I'm not so shameless that I can stay with you after knowing all that.

777
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:04,931
But it was my misunderstanding.

778
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:07,931
All this time, I thought he purposely deceived me.

779
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:09,531
But that wasn't the case.

780
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:11,867
He was conned by his friend, so he had no choice—

781
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:14,499
Even if he didn't have a choice,

782
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:19,960
he shouldn't have disappeared on you like that.

783
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,490
♫  The fights and the scars  ♫

784
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,233
I am so scared

785
00:44:24,233 --> 00:44:28,466
about the fact that the suffering you went through,

786
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,798
which made you want to die,

787
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:32,866
was because of my dad.

788
00:44:32,866 --> 00:44:35,332
Don't worry. I can forget all of that.

789
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:38,866
You'll only be making an effort to forget,

790
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:42,966
but you'll be reminded of it when you look at me.

791
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,930
Can you deny that?

792
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,490
♫  I’m so lonely and you were my only light  ♫

793
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,732
And I...

794
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:54,300
I'll feel terrible and grieved when I look at you.

795
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,199
Young Won.

796
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,467
Don't do this. Please.

797
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,667
I'm sorry.

798
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:07,133
And thank you for everything.

799
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:09,666
Don't do this.

800
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,000
I need to, for myself.

801
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,160
♫  And go next to you  ♫

802
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,760
Let me go. For me.

803
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,800
♫  Because I think I can forget all the painful times  ♫

804
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:29,630
♫  I’m looking for you like this  ♫

805
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,960
♫  But where are you?  ♫

806
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,900
♫  Leaving me behind  ♫

807
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:46,560
♫  Here? Here?  ♫

808
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,200
♫  Leaving me behind  ♫

809
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,650
♫  Here?  ♫

810
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,860
♫  Here?  ♫

811
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,560

812
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,870

813
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:23,580

814
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,990
That's good.

815
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,099
Great. Wonderful.

816
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,431
Smile for the last shot.

817
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:39,999
I can't recognize you, Ui Joo.

818
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,332
I can see what's happening.

819
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,698
A goddess has descended.

820
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,933
You're so beautiful, Editor Yeo.

821
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:45,799
Thank you.

822
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:49,266
Will you two come and check the result?

823
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:50,899
What's the use of checking the result?

824
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:52,332
You took it.

825
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:54,732
It's such an honor.

826
00:46:54,732 --> 00:46:55,732
Thanks.

827
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:56,932
It's my wedding present.

828
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:58,499
Congratulations to both of you.

829
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,998
- Thanks. 
 - Oh?

830
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:01,831
Then what should I give you as a wedding gift?

831
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,198
Anything within ₩1 million.

832
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,231
I'll cancel my savings.

833
00:47:05,231 --> 00:47:07,766
Can you give us something worth more than ₩1 million?

834
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:09,199
Okay, what is it?

835
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,867
Sit in my father's seat.

836
00:47:11,867 --> 00:47:12,565
What?

837
00:47:12,566 --> 00:47:15,865
You know that I have no one to sit in my father's seat.

838
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:18,700
So please sit in it.

839
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,665
Well, you know...

840
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:24,466
You can't?

841
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:27,466
I understand. You're not my father.

842
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:30,999
- It's awkward, right? 
 - I don't care about that.

843
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:32,999
To sit in your father's seat...

844
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,066
I'm worried I'll look too young.

845
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:38,632
What?

846
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:43,833
Wow, I'm sitting in the wedding host's seat before my son gets married.

847
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,350
Thank you, Chief Editor.

848
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:02,164
It must be someone special since you insist on giving the invitation in person.

849
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:04,033
Yes.

850
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:05,565
What?

851
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,233
What's this?

852
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:14,898
Well...

853
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:16,799
I'm leaving.

854
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:18,933
Go tell him.

855
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:20,032
What?

856
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:23,965
- Why did you do this? 
 - I saw it.

857
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:27,430

858
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:40,400

859
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:57,466
The wedding host's seat you asked Chief Editor to sit in...

860
00:48:57,466 --> 00:49:01,367
You actually want your father to sit in it.

861
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:10,334
Ui Joo.

862
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:14,832
Your mother, who's in heaven, will want that, too.

863
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:18,732
I might be out of line,

864
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:24,466
but I don't think she'd want you to get married with nobody there.

865
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,120

866
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,000

867
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:37,133
Are you really quitting and focusing on fine art?

868
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,733
You're more capable to be the main photographer.

869
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:43,765
And I can no longer put off what I want to do.

870
00:50:43,765 --> 00:50:48,632
Then why did you cancel your plane to New York?

871
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,433
It's Hyung.

872
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:52,766
I can't leave him alone.

873
00:50:54,232 --> 00:50:55,567
You're right.

874
00:50:55,567 --> 00:51:00,732
It's been three months since Editor Na quit and disappeared.

875
00:51:00,732 --> 00:51:05,033
I heard even Editor Yeo can't reach her.

876
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,750
♫  You’ve fall asleep  ♫

877
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:46,120
♫  And I want to see you from a little closer  ♫

878
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:53,180
♫  It would be so nice  ♫

879
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,440
♫  If we could be a little more comfortable with each other  ♫

880
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,800
 You're here.

881
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:11,480
♫  Always be my side  ♫

882
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,320
♫  On days you start to sigh  ♫

883
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,750
♫  Come to me  ♫

884
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:28,270
♫  Even things you couldn’t ask me  ♫

885
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:33,240
♫  Are okay with me, if it’s you  ♫

886
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:40,600
♫  Always be your side  ♫

887
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:47,730
♫  Even feelings that you can’t figure out  ♫

888
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:55,010
♫  Tell me  ♫

889
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,370
♫  When you wanna go somewhere  ♫

890
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:06,850
♫  Tell me  ♫

891
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,940

892
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,110

893
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,530

894
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,032
I'm planning a collab with "Beautiful House TV,"

895
00:53:20,032 --> 00:53:23,765
which is the hottest channel that introduces houses.

896
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,465
Wow, Editor Gye. Good job.

897
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:28,866
Then carry it out immediately.

898
00:53:28,866 --> 00:53:31,398
- Can you give me more time? 
 - Why?

899
00:53:31,398 --> 00:53:32,933
It's not easy casting her.

900
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:35,966
I contacted her by phone first, but she declined.

901
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:39,132
Really? How hot is her channel to be so snobbish?

902
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,299
- Do you know that channel, Editor Yook? 
 - Yes.

903
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:45,064
Her Gyeongju vacation home video is going viral.

904
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:47,099
- Let's take a look. 
 - Okay.

905
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,140
Wow, 1.2 million views?

906
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,660

907
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,200

908
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:03,800

909
00:54:06,132 --> 00:54:08,599
 But you also take a trip

910
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,890
 to make good memories.

911
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:20,070

912
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,900
Stop.

913
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,099
This content creator...

914
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:27,900
I'll contact her myself.

915
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,950

916
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Who is it?

917
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:10,970
I came to meet the creator of "Beautiful House TV."

918
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,800
How may I help you?

919
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:38,531
I'm sorry I can't give you the answer you want.

920
00:55:38,532 --> 00:55:41,298
I got a lot of collab offers from other magazines, too,

921
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:42,931
but I refused all of them.

922
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:45,999
I want to focus on my content for now.

923
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:47,499
I understand.

924
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:49,699
If you change your mind, please call me.

925
00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:51,198
Okay, I will.

926
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:53,166
Goodbye.

927
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,100
Have a safe trip back.

928
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:02,750

929
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:50,865
So please do your first collab with us.

930
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:54,390
I even wrote up a proposal...

931
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,890

932
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,033
 What do you think?

933
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:11,166
 My amazing girlfriend gave it to me.

934
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:14,299
The CEO of Monthly Magazine House came by.

935
00:57:14,299 --> 00:57:17,130
He must've dropped that.

936
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,798
You came back for this, right?

937
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:55,765
Oh, yes.

938
00:57:55,765 --> 00:58:00,466
It must be very important to you for you to come back for it.

939
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:02,633
Thank you.

940
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,030

941
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:24,700
♫  I know that warm feeling  ♫

942
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:30,960
♫  Of someone quietly holding me  ♫

943
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,540
♫  You quietly waited for me  ♫

944
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,380
♫  Always in the same spot  ♫

945
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,320
♫  I feel like I’m home  ♫

946
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,890
♫  Whenever I think of you  ♫

947
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:58,030
♫  Here I am  ♫

948
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:02,500
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

949
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,140
♫  I’ll be right here  ♫

950
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,180
♫  Everything is just fine  ♫

951
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,870

952
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,850
♫  Here I am  ♫

953
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:20,250
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

954
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,950
♫  You can take your time  ♫

955
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:30,000
♫  Everything is just fine  ♫

956
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:37,420
♫  I could tell we feel the same  ♫

957
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:42,650
♫  Always, cozily  ♫

958
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:49,200
♫  Hold me like that time  ♫

00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,480
♫  Here I am  ♫

960

♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

961
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:02,670
♫  I’ll be right here  ♫

962
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:07,140
♫  Everything is just fine  ♫

963
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,410
♫  Here I am  ♫

964
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:15,750
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

965
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:20,380
♫  You can take your time  ♫

966
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:25,560
♫  Everything is just fine  ♫

967
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:41,640

968
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,990

969
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,999
You built a house that is so you.

970
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:49,732
I can see it's comfortable and cozy.

971
01:00:49,732 --> 01:00:51,765
That's not all.

972
01:00:51,765 --> 01:00:54,132
This neighborhood will be developed soon.

973
01:00:54,132 --> 01:00:57,699
Right upfront, the GTX subway line will open.

974
01:00:57,699 --> 01:00:59,865
- Then the house price will go up. 
 - What?

975
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,466
Now, a residence is not only a house,

976
01:01:02,466 --> 01:01:05,400
but a home as well.

977
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,750
 What is a good home?

978
01:01:18,432 --> 01:01:21,800
 A place that's clean and cozy.

979
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,332
Congratulations!

980
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:27,466
 A place you want to invite close friends to.

981
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:29,700
Your smile is so beautiful.

982
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,860

983
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,620
 A place built on a spot that brings good fortune.

984
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,500
 This is what I think.

985
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,300
 A good home is a place where a good person lives.

986
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:07,431
"You age ten years while building a house."

987
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:10,233
I guess that saying is wrong.

988
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:13,400
I think I aged five years.

989
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:28,199
 Small, big, high, low...

990
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:30,399
 It might all look different,

991
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:35,532
 but it's where your day starts and ends.

992
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:42,280
 Is the place you are living in a good home?

993
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,100
♫  Just listen here we are again  ♫

994
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,760
♫  Through the fire through the rain  ♫

995
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,060

996
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:55,980
