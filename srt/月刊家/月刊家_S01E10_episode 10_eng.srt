1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,320

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,020

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,860

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,230

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,450

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,070

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,820

8
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,460

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,860

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,631
 You must be hungry.

11
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:58,098
 You couldn't eat because of me.

12
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,199
 Please wait.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,966
 I'll bring you some late-night snacks.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,100
 - No, it's okay... 
 - I refuse your refusal.

15
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:13,970

16
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:20,866
What?

17
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:24,333
Are they already back from repairing the equipment?

18
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,299
Those klutzes.

19
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:42,399
Ja...Ja...Ja...Ja...Ja Sung!

20
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,065
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:47,299
The trunk was open.

22
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,865
We... We... were taking out the equipment...

23
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:51,566
Right.

24
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,899
What brings you here at this hour?

25
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,264
What?

26
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:00,766
Oh, me. I remembered I had to do something.

27
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,433
Okay.

28
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,466
What's that?

29
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,599
This?

30
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,067
Oh, this... I thought you'd be here and wanted to share a snack.

31
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,299
Great.

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,732
Editor Na is inside, too.

33
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,765
Let's all eat together.

34
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,299
Really? Editor Na is here, too?

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,566
I had no idea.

36
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:20,432
Let's go in.

37
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,065
Okay. Go on ahead.

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,600
That was close. You almost got caught.

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,932
If it weren't for me, he would've seen the bag.

40
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:38,966
I wanted to ask you. Keep the bag at your place.

41
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:39,934
What?

42
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:41,732
It'll be safer there.

43
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,266
Please?

44
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,530
What would he have done without me?

45
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,740

46
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:04,531
Yes, Dong Beom?

47
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,631
I know. It's been so long.

48
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:09,699
Oh, the storyboard?

49
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,799
- I think I have it. 
  - Dong Beom?

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,465
I'll email it to you.

51
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,067
Okay.

52
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:21,231
Thanks for the ride, sir.

53
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,367
No problem.

54
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,599
But...

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,232
who were you talking to just now?

56
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,465
Dong Beom?

57
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:34,165
Oh. He's a stylist I worked with at another magazine.

58
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,032
Is that so?

59
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,332
I guess you're quite close since you call him by name.

60
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,532
Yes.

61
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,632
We're friends.

62
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,699
Will you stop addressing me so professionally?

63
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,466
- What? 
 - We're not just boss and staff anymore.

64
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,933
Shouldn't we figure out what to call each other?

65
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,733
Right...

66
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,666
I'm so used to calling you "sir."

67
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,467
Right.

68
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:07,599
I was only thinking of myself again.

69
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,199
Do what you feel is comfortable. Take your time...

70
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,133
Ja Sung?

71
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:27,133
I had fun today.

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
Yes. Good.

73
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,933
You must be tired. Go on in.

74
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,732
Young Won.

75
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,299
Okay.

76
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,790
- Then I'll see you tomorrow. 
 - Bye.

77
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,730
♫  We’re so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

78
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,132
Ja Sung.

79
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:55,420
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

80
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,600
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,640
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,120
♫  You know this too  ♫

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,000
Ja Sung?

84
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,470
Ja Sung.

85
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,720
♫  But what? Why am I thinking about you?  ♫

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,090
♫  You’ve come into my head  ♫

87
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,950
♫  Even the way you look at me  ♫

88
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,500
♫  Can’t takе my eyes off you  ♫

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 Goodnight, Young Won.

90
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:38,833
 You, too, Ja Sung.

91
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,367
Oh, my.

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
♫  You seemed so uptight  ♫

93
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,700
 Stop!

94
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,432
Ja Sung.

95
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,165
 What? Ja Sung?

96
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:57,166
 Ja Sung?

97
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,166
Long time no see. I haven't seen you in a while.

98
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,164
 Of course, you haven't.

99
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:06,598
 You're so caught up in dating that you forgot about becoming a homeowner.

100
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:09,031
No, I didn't.

101
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:12,499
- I'm thinking about it... 
  - Do you want to be poor?

102
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:13,631
No.

103
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,298
 Thinking won't get you anywhere.

104
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:18,165
 I hope you don't think you don't need a home

105
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:21,132
 because you now have a boyfriend. That's outdated.

106
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,132
Of course not!

107
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,260

108
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,366
Is Editor Nam sick?

109
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,599
Why is he so late?

110
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,898
He just called.

111
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,264
He's taking the day off today.

112
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,165
Oh, dear.

113
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,499
He was meeting his girlfriend yesterday.

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,531
I guess it didn't go well.

115
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,264
Poor guy.

116
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:45,632
The whole office knows. It's all the more reason not to come.

117
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:47,165
I totally understand.

118
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,232
I would've handed in my resignation.

119
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,332
I accept.

120
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,899
What? Oh, s-s-s-s-ir!

121
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,531
I didn't mean I was going to quit...

122
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:55,532
You didn't?

123
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,199
Then tell me whenever you want.

124
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,866
I'm always ready to accept.

125
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,300
Editor Na! Let's coordinate our coverage schedule.

126
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,700
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:12,065
I really do want to hand in my resignation.

128
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:16,199
I'll schedule it so we can do the coverage and interview together.

129
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,432
Let me know when the date is set.

130
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:19,798
Yes, sir.

131
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:23,199
I really want to call you "Young Won".

132
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,866
I had to hold back hard earlier.

133
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:27,999
You did well.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,531
Don't make a mistake.

135
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,232
Of course not.

136
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:34,266
Have lunch with me today. Just the two of us.

137
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,398
I don't think I can.

138
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,599
Why not?

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,333
Did Editor Yeo beat me to it again?

140
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:43,898
No...

141
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:48,531
Starting today, I'm grabbing a quick bite and going on a survey.

142
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,431
- A survey? 
 - Yes.

143
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:52,898
You said on Jasung TV...

144
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,733
 You must have an eye to choose a good home.

145
00:07:55,734 --> 00:08:00,198
 The best way to develop that eye is surveying.

146
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:02,998
 The neighborhood you live in. The company you work at.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,966
 Start from there.

148
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,298
The more your heels wear out...

149
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:11,898
The more you'll develop an eye for assessment.

150
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:12,966
Then let's go together.

151
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:15,566
No, it's okay. I can go by myself, watching Jasung TV...

152
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:19,666
Why watch Jasung TV when Ja Sung is right here?

153
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,034
Let's do it together.

154
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,599
What you must do before going on a survey is...

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,266
Research.

156
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,566
Find out the average price of the target homes

157
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:34,566
through various real estate market price apps

158
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,766
and double check that on the MOLIT website.

159
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,064
Then you will never be ripped off.

160
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:42,298
Yes. That's right.

161
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,400
You really studied a lot.

162
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,065
I'm not the old me who thought a survey was a questionnaire.

163
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,098
Sang Soon.

164
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:58,165
Try this on after breakfast, all right?

165
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,600
What is that?

166
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,133
You'll officially meet your girlfriend's family. You need a suit.

167
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,666
This was on sale at the department store.

168
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,099
Get a refund.

169
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:07,798
Why?

170
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,598
Don't you like it?

171
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,766
I broke up with her.

172
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,067
What?

173
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,200
Why?

174
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,300
No reason.

175
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,000
We dated for so long. There's no chemistry.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,199
And I won a subscription. I'll own an apartment.

177
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,967
I lack nothing, so why would I marry her?

178
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,564
- Are you out of your mind? 
 - Why did you hit me?

179
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:28,399
Think about how she waited for you!

180
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,631
Are you seeing another woman?

181
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,866
Well? Is that it?

182
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,199
Whatever. Let me eat in peace.

183
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,599
Did you cheat on her?

184
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,765
Seriously! Yes, I cheated on her!

185
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,332
Yes, I cheated on her!

186
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,798
That's why I broke up with her!

187
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,634
Happy?

188
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,933
So annoying!

189
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,866
Seriously!

190
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,199
 Go to her this instant and grovel.

191
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,499
I did.

192
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,798
 Beg if you have to.

193
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,666
I did.

194
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,032
 Get her back!

195
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:10,033
I tried.

196
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:30,633
Here is the material you asked for, Ja Sung.

197
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,598
Ja Sung?

198
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,199
Are you out of your mind?

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,766
- Are you crazy, Editor Na? 
 - No, I...

200
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,599
Stop!

201
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:50,699
- I asked her to call me that. 
 - Sir?

202
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:55,066
Calling me "sir" made me seem too authoritative.

203
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,732
But why only Young Won...

204
00:10:56,732 --> 00:11:00,565
I was just about to ask all of you.

205
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,399
Editor. Chief Editor. CEO.

206
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:06,231
Let's take away all these titles and call each other by name.

207
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,700
To build a strong rapport.

208
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,865
Let's start the meeting.

209
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,299
What was that?

210
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:22,266
Why is he suddenly going American style?

211
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:32,166
Report to me the proposals by tomorrow.

212
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,635
But tomorrow...

213
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:36,633
Oh. The editorial team is going somewhere, right?

214
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,231
Yes. For two days, we'll go to an old manor

215
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,766
in partnership with us.

216
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,064
We'll do volunteer work

217
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:43,665
and put that in the magazine.

218
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,799
Oh, two days...

219
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,565
Why are there so many events?

220
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:50,898
Oh, come on, Ja Sung.

221
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:54,865
A magazine must write new articles every month.

222
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:58,399
If you want, you can come, Ja Sung.

223
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,965
I'm not that idle...

224
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:02,366
But!

225
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:04,832
I'll go.

226
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,631
It'll be good to do volunteer work.

227
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:08,999
Good thinking, Ja Sung.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,431
Thank you, Ui Joo.

229
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:15,266
Then we'll all go except for Young Won.

230
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,165
What? Why not Young Won?

231
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,933
I have a meeting with an advertiser tomorrow.

232
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:22,434
That's right.

233
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,899
I'll put up tomorrow's schedule in the group text.

234
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,899
W-W-Wait!

235
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Oh, darn it.

236
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,733
I don't think I can make it tomorrow, either.

237
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,998
I remembered I have an important meeting.

238
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,498
I don't know what that is, but it'll be good to come, Ja Sung.

239
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:39,898
It's good to make an acquaintance with the owner, Ja Sung.

240
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:42,664
Choi Go. What are you doing?

241
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,431
He said he had a meeting.

242
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,766
That's right, Choi Go.

243
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,032
Yes, Choi Go.

244
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,298
Totally, Choi Go.

245
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:52,332
Stop. Stop!

246
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,431
Oh. Sir, I'm sorry.

247
00:12:57,432 --> 00:13:00,231
I want to be called Chief Editor again.

248
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:03,498
Being called by my name makes me feel as if we're on the same level.

249
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:04,933
I feel looked down on.

250
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,199
Is that so?

251
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,765
If that's what you want, then we won't do it.

252
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:09,933
Thank you.

253
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:12,666
So it's settled that you will go without me.

254
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,866
Dismissed.

255
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,533
I almost didn't get to see Young Won.

256
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,390

257
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:41,499
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,332
I told you not to make a mistake,

259
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,566
and then I did.

260
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,264
It's okay.

261
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:48,431
Where shall we survey tonight?

262
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:53,231
Since we surveyed well during the day, let's go on a date tonight.

263
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,300
What? Can we do that?

264
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,465
Yes.

265
00:13:56,466 --> 00:14:02,131
It's a date but an update on Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung's best movie ever.

266
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:03,866
- What? 
 - Let's watch a movie.

267
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:08,532
- You said the last movie you saw was "Taegukgi (2004)." 
 - Right.

268
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:11,766
Won Bin, who plays the little brother, is a dad now.

269
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,267
What?

270
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,732
Does Won Bin have a kid?

271
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:20,532
Let's do it.

272
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,266
Up - date.

273
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,767
Yes.

274
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,431
I didn't know there was a couple's set menu.

275
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:36,098
Oh. People come to the movies often on a date.

276
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:39,266
- Now I finally feel like we're in a relationship. 
 - What?

277
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:43,067
If you think about it, this is our first real date.

278
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,200
You're right.

279
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,732
Want to get some drinks after the movie?

280
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:51,900
I'll look up good places near here.

281
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,134
Can we go to my place?

282
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,032
What?

283
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:59,533
It's not because I have other intentions.

284
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,199
I decorated my place so you would be comfortable,

285
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,131
but you didn't get to enjoy it before you left.

286
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:07,252
It's a shame it's going to waste.

287
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,367
Let's make snacks then.

288
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,064
Okay.

289
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:14,366
 The movie for Hall 6 will begin. Please enter.

290
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:15,733
I'm going to run to the bathroom. You go on ahead.

291
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,098
You go on ahead.

292
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,132
Okay.

293
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,632
- Sir! 
 - Editor Yeo! What are you doing here?

294
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:45,800
I came to watch a movie, of course.

295
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,498
I came alone, but it looks like you came with someone.

296
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:54,265
No. I came alone, too.

297
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,067
I see.

298
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,632
 Wait outside. I'll go out now...

299
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:21,366
Hi, Young Won.

300
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:25,465
Okay. I'll be there right away.

301
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:27,366
Young Won has just asked me to come.

302
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:31,532
She's at the hairdresser's, but she lost her purse.

303
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,199
Is Editor Na at the hairdresser's?

304
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,765
Yes. I'll be going now.

305
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:37,231
Enjoy the movie.

306
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:38,733
Okay.

307
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,264
She must really hate watching the movie with me.

308
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,533
I hate it more.

309
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:50,499
 Editor Yeo says she's leaving.

310
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,799
 Hide for a bit, then come in.

311
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,766
Why did he have to sit next to me?

312
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,131
What a waste of money!

313
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:03,566
The movie is starting.

314
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:10,999
Young Won.

315
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,666
Sunbae.

316
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,667
What are you doing here?

317
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,633
Did you come to see a movie with that friend?

318
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,267
Yes.

319
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,566
You said you were going to meet Editor Nam...

320
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,031
He kept avoiding my calls.

321
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:30,700
I didn't have anything else to do, so I came to watch a movie alone.

322
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,799
I see.

323
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,399
Then I'll be going in.

324
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,865
- Don't. 
 - What?

325
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:39,165
CEO Yoo is inside. I bumped into him.

326
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,566
Don't ruin your evening by running into him.

327
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,832
Have drinks with me.

328
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,932
Oh, well...

329
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,264
My friend...

330
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,065
Tell her to come, too. We can have drinks together.

331
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:54,999
Oh, well, my friend was supposed to come,

332
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,466
but she suddenly said she couldn't make it.

333
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,899
Really? Great.

334
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,667
Let's go. Let's go.

335
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,733
 She should be here by now.

336
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,665
 Why isn't she coming?

337
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:27,065
 I ran into Sunbae at the entrance.

338
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,198
 I think you have to watch the movie by yourself.

339
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,198
 I'll tell you the details later.

340
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,166
 I'm really sorry.

341
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:38,433
Jeez! Ui Joo, Ui Joo, Yeo Ui Joo!

342
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,499
Why did you go to the cinema alone?

343
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,165
What about your boyfriend?

344
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:51,766
- Oh. We broke up. 
 - What?

345
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:54,665
You know I don't want to get married.

346
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,966
But he kept asking for marriage,

347
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,466
so I ended it with no regrets.

348
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,832
I see.

349
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:03,800
Are you okay?

350
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,067
Yes.

351
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:09,799
I'm more worried about Editor Nam.

352
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,999
Sunbae, didn't you quit smoking?

353
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:22,199
Oh... I did.

354
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:25,098
But I should at least enjoy this since I'm single now.

355
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,299
You quit because you had bronchial issues.

356
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,666
I'm lonely. What use is it to have strong bronchial tubes?

357
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,166
Sunbae.

358
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,031
Jeez. All right.

359
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,866
I won't smoke.

360
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,232
Happy?

361
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,633
- I'm going to the bathroom. 
 - Okay.

362
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:51,265
What do you want to drink, Young Won?

363
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:55,299
Beer? Wine? Champagne?

364
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,232
It should've gone like this!

365
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,998
What use is decorating the house like this when Young Won isn't here?

366
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,310
Seriously! Ui Joo, Ui Joo, Yeo Ui Joo!

367
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:16,366
Where are you? Should I go to pick you up now?

368
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,598
No, I just got home.

369
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,299
I told you to call me once she was gone.

370
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,366
It's dangerous at night.

371
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,566
It's okay.

372
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,167
I'm sorry about today.

373
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:30,933
Why are you sorry? You didn't do anything wrong.

374
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,765
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

375
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:37,466
Everyone's going to volunteer tomorrow, so we can spend quality time together.

376
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:42,132
I just got a call from the advertiser asking to reschedule,

377
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:46,399
so I have to go to the manor tomorrow.

378
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:47,265
What?

379
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:51,466
I feel bad about that, but I can't help it.

380
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,867
I'll call you when I get there.

381
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:55,833
You must be tired. Get some rest.

382
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,899
Okay.

383
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:00,966
Darn it!

384
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:04,266
If I'd known earlier, I would've said I'm going.

385
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:06,299
Should I say I'll go now?

386
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,031
No, no.

387
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,866
I'm the CEO. I can't seem fickle.

388
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:14,732
Oh, well.

389
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,067
I can go one day without seeing her.

390
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,350
It's just one day.

391
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,666
What a great ride!

392
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,366
I got it.

393
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:40,865
Joo Hee, you're a good driver.

394
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,098
You should drive on the way back.

395
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,099
I don't want to.

396
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,280
Okay then. I'll drive.

397
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,399
You seem to be in a really good mood.

398
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,434
Of course.

399
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,999
I don't have to see CEO Yoo today.

400
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,132
I can't help but feel great.

401
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:00,232
Whoa, my eyes. Jeez.

402
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,932
Stop that.

403
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,165
Young Won should be singing.

404
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,867
Aren't you glad you're free from his nagging?

405
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,360
What? Oh, sure.

406
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,332
What?

407
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,198
That must be a guest.

408
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,266
They have a manor experience program.

409
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:20,400
That car looks exactly like CEO Yoo's.

410
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,431
He looks exactly like CEO Yoo, too.

411
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:26,090
It is CEO Yoo.

412
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,433
What?

413
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:40,833
What brings you here, sir?

414
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,365
My meeting got canceled.

415
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:45,066
I came to participate in the volunteer work.

416
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,232
Good.

417
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:51,099
I felt so sad at the thought of not seeing you today.

418
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:52,198
Let's go inside.

419
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:54,031
The owners will be waiting.

420
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:54,833
Let's go.

421
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,333
Okay.

422
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,365
Why are you really here?

423
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:02,698
Why do you think?

424
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:05,033
I was worried you might miss me.

425
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,933
What?

426
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:11,100
All right. I came because I missed you.

427
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,599
Young Won!

428
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,166
Why aren't you coming?

429
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,533
This is what's wrong with you, Editor Na Zero Won!

430
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,266
You lack focus!

431
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,366
If you're here to volunteer, focus on volunteering!

432
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,432
Why mention the promo article?

433
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:26,299
Focus on one thing! Focus!

434
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,840
Okay. Everyone, this way.

435
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,367
Why is he so angry with you these days?

436
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:35,665
I know, right?

437
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,232
This is what's wrong with you!

438
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,333
- You just take it! 
 - What?

439
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,099
Fight back!

440
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:42,666
You're such a pushover.

441
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,067
That's why he's walking all over you.

442
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:47,832
It's okay.

443
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:48,866
Oh, well.

444
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,200
Forget it. You'll be wasting your time.

445
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,334
- Let's go. 
 - Sure.

446
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,165
Welcome!

447
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:58,034
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

448
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:01,099
This is the owner of the manor.

449
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,632
You must be tired from the long trip.

450
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,632
This is our CEO, Yoo Ja Sung.

451
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:06,300
Hello.

452
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,632
Hello.

453
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:10,466
Chief Editor, you came here many times.

454
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:11,932
Can you give them a tour?

455
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,166
Oh, okay.

456
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,900
Come this way.

457
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,031
Yes. Let's go inside.

458
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,432
Okay.

459
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,430

460
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,898
 Myungjae Manor was built in 1709.

461
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:30,165
 It has been preserved very well.

462
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:36,366
 It shows the style of a Joseon aristocratic residence.

463
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:41,233
 Here, we see how traditional ponds are designed.

464
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:45,680
It's the best place in Myungjae Manor.

465
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,599
Over there.

466
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,398
This place stores soybean paste and soy sauce

467
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,232
over 300 years old. It's as old as the manor.

468
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,867
They are still made the traditional way.

469
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:09,132
- Wow. 
 - Wow.

470
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,198
This is amazing.

471
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,833
Indeed.

472
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:31,265
- The composition... 
 - Oh, there's that.

473
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:34,533
Let's keep the light here and take a photo.

474
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,867
What do you think? How's the composition?

475
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:38,367
Good.

476
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:41,533
By the way, are you okay?

477
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:42,966
What? About what?

478
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,299
Well...

479
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,531
Your girlfriend...

480
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,766
Right.

481
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:49,165
Work is work.

482
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:52,000
I won't let my personal issues affect the workplace.

483
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,065
Just turn a blind eye.

484
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,832
That will be helpful.

485
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,264
Why did you ask?

486
00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:03,531
He's trying so hard not to show.

487
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:05,932
Because I'm worried.

488
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,865
He's amazing.

489
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:11,699
He's surely a professional.

490
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:14,100
Okay, good.

491
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Should I get more shots, Editor Nam?

492
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,931
Excuse me... Editor Nam?

493
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,400
Should I get...

494
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,399
Since you mention getting something,

495
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:30,466
I want to say that my cutie pie

496
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:33,765
wanted to get that stereo for our future home.

497
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:36,232
She said when we got married,

498
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:39,600
she was going to buy that model...

499
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,398
Are you two dating anyone?

500
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:50,233
 - No. 
 - No.

501
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,533
Good.

502
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,665
Don't date.

503
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,399
It only causes pain.

504
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:57,800
- Oh. 
 - Oh.

505
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,467
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

506
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,366
No.

507
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,566
Just date.

508
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:01,265
What?

509
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,765
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

510
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:05,932
No.

511
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:10,532
They also say it's not love if it hurts too much.

512
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,999
- Editor Nam! 
 - Are you okay?

513
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,098
Oh? What?

514
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:18,799
You seem like you're having a tough time.

515
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,365
I told you.

516
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:23,299
Turn a blind eye.

517
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,390
Please do me this favor.

518
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,600
Just turn a blind eye.

519
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:38,165
Why did CEO Yoo have to come?

520
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:41,499
Who would want to work with him?

521
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,899
Well...

522
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,433
Should I team up with him?

523
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,200
Really?

524
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,831
Since you can endure his temper, you'll be perfect.

525
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:52,800
Thank you.

526
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
Sure.

527
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,266
Okay, then.

528
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,865
We'll work in pairs.

529
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:05,399
First, removing the weeds in the backyard will be Mi Ra and Joo Hee's job.

530
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:06,333
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

531
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,099
Good.

532
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,232
And tidying up inside will be done by...

533
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,232
CEO Yoo...

534
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,466
And Editor Na.

535
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:17,799
Come on. Why do I have to work with her?

536
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,932
Oh, well. It's volunteer work, so I can't be picky.

537
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,733
I'll accept it with grace.

538
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,434
Good.

539
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,067
Stop!

540
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:27,765
I'll team up with Young Won.

541
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:29,631
- What? 
 - What?

542
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,365
You said it, sir.

543
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:33,198
That you're incompatible with Young Won.

544
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:35,650
Don't get stressed while doing volunteer work.

545
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,860
I'll team up with Young Won.

546
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,365
Oh, I can put up with her...

547
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,567
Young Won! Let's go!

548
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,166
What...

549
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,799
In your life, I'm like this traditional paper.

550
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,367
What? What do you mean?

551
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:09,066
Just like how this paper stops the wind, I stopped CEO Yoo.

552
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:13,599
If you had worked with him, you would've suffered his abuse all day.

553
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,900
Oh, so that's why you volunteered...

554
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,000
I did well, right?

555
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You're very grateful, right?

556
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,098
I'm all you have, right?

557
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:22,299
Right.

558
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,232
You're all I have.

559
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:26,932
You were there for me at my lowest.

560
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,065
Just count on me today.

561
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:33,066
I'll stop CEO Yoo from saying a word to you.

562
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,580
Thank you, Sunbae.

563
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:56,032
 How can she be pretty even when she's scrubbing?

564
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:07,899
 Yeo Ui Joo!

565
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,366
 If it weren't for her, I could've been with Young Won.

566
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:14,399
Sir!

567
00:30:15,067 --> 00:30:16,567
Yes?

568
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,132
You have to put that down.

569
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:23,599
Okay.

570
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,665
How should I...

571
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:28,266
Oh, no! Sir!

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,965
- If you lift it like that, you'll break your back. 
 - What?

573
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:36,865
I come here every year, so I know how to work.

574
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:40,232
Look. Don't try to lift it with sheer strength.

575
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,667
Grab here, like this.

576
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,867
Calmly lift it up.

577
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,132
Okay, one, two.

578
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:47,800
Then put it on your shoulders...

579
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,366
What was that? Are you okay?

580
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,332
Oh, no...

581
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:56,733
Are you okay?

582
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,766
Oh, dear...

583
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:08,100
Sir!

584
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,698
I'm sorry!

585
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:15,833
I guess I can't help being middle-aged.

586
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:20,132
I thought my back would be different.

587
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:21,865
Stop!

588
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:25,667
It's okay. Just keep the hot pack on.

589
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,266
Sir!

590
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:31,980
You shouldn't lift it by sheer strength...

591
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,434
Thank you.

592
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:43,334
- Bon appetit. 
 - Bon appetit.

593
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,132
Editor Nam. Eat.

594
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:47,533
What?

595
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,399
Okay...

596
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,865
Isn't it hot?

597
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,032
It's hot.

598
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,599
Of course, it is.

599
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,666
Is your hand okay?

600
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,066
Oh... My hand?

601
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:13,164
It's okay even if it's not.

602
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:17,532
What use is my hand to me

603
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,500
when I can't hold my cutie pie's hand?

604
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:31,065
Listen, Editor Nam...

605
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:38,499
Editor Nam!

606
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,434
Isn't it hot?

607
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:43,867
It's very hot.

608
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,099
Are you okay there?

609
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,832
Oh. Here?

610
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,566
It's okay even if I'm not.

611
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:52,499
What use is this to me?

612
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:54,431
Why don't you put some cold water...

613
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,432
No.

614
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:58,232
I want to stay like this for a bit.

615
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:01,200
Thanks to this burning pain,

616
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,333
I can forget about the pain of losing my cutie pie for a bit.

617
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,031
But still...

618
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:11,566
I asked you many times to turn a blind eye.

619
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:15,133
Just leave me alone! Please!

620
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:19,566
Oh, hot. Hot. Hot. Hot.

621
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,934
Try some of this.

622
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,266
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

623
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:25,998
No, thank you for all your work.

624
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:28,132
Let me know if you need anything.

625
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,390
- Okay. 
 - Bye.

626
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:37,766
Where are Mi Ra and Joo Hee?

627
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,233
They went to throw out the trash.

628
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:40,999
Really?

629
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,167
Then I guess I'll have to go.

630
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,765
Where do you think you're going?

631
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:47,966
When I was grocery shopping, I forgot to get the meat.

632
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:50,132
Stop!

633
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:52,833
Will you be able to go to the store by today?

634
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,399
Stay here. I'll go.

635
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,133
What?

636
00:33:56,134 --> 00:34:00,933
You're hurt so just stay. I'll go.

637
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:01,899
Sir...

638
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,368
- Na Zero Won, you seem idle. Come with me. 
 - Sir?

639
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:07,698
This is what's wrong with you, Editor Na Zero Won!

640
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,466
You have no consideration for the CEO.

641
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:11,499
Do I have to drive and carry the groceries?

642
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,766
Come with me now!

643
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:13,733
Yes, sir.

644
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:15,710
Stop!

645
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,867
I'll come with you.

646
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:19,566
What?

647
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:22,332
I'll demonstrate consideration for you.

648
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,299
She's tired because she cleaned a lot earlier.

649
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,865
No, it's okay. I'll go.

650
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,165
You're tired.

651
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,666
Right?

652
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:33,366
Let's go.

653
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,865
 How much more is she going to interfere?

654
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:48,898
 Yeo Ui Joo! Yeo Ui Joo!

655
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,700
 Why doesn't a monster come and get her?

656
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,266
If you bought everything, let's go.

657
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,033
Wait, sir.

658
00:34:57,033 --> 00:35:00,265
I tagged along because I have something to say.

659
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:04,665
I'm cautious about saying this, but I don't think anyone else will.

660
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:05,766
Then speak.

661
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,232
- Can you stop hating Young Won? 
 - What?

662
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,732
You're too harsh!

663
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,099
How can you say

664
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,299
that this is wrong and that is wrong to her face?

665
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,199
What?

666
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,966
 What's really wrong is you, you fool!

667
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:21,265
She was never hated like this at her previous workplaces.

668
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:23,999
She was always doted on and loved.

669
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,265
 I'm giving her that love, you fool!

670
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:30,265
I'm saying this after much thought.

671
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:33,133
I'm sorry if I offended you.

672
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,531
No.

673
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,965
Come to think of it, you have a point.

674
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:38,832
I'll be more careful from now on.

675
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,132
Happy?

676
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:42,033
Thank you.

677
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,799
 You have deviated from your route.

678
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,398
 - The route will be reset.  
 - What?

679
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,732
I guess you took the wrong road.

680
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:54,566
Did I?

681
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,365
I followed the GPS.

682
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:58,398
Where did we go wrong?

683
00:35:58,399 --> 00:35:59,698
Yeah.

684
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,064
Where did it all go wrong?

685
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:07,332
Should I not have seen them cheating on me?

686
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,799
No. If I won a subscription sooner...

687
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,599
- Um, Editor Nam? 
 - No.

688
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,665
If I hadn't lost my money on cryptocurrency...

689
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,966
- Don't be so hard on yourself... 
 - No.

690
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,865
I shouldn't have been born.

691
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:26,500
If I hadn't been born, such sorrow wouldn't exist.

692
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,299
Wow, look at that lake! It's so pretty.

693
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,599
Oh, yes. Wow!

694
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,132
Pull over.

695
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:36,367
What? Why?

696
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:38,730
I said pull over!

697
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:47,632
What's he going to do?

698
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,898
I hope he isn't thinking of doing something bad.

699
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:51,933
What do you mean?

700
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:53,865
 - What? 
 - What?

701
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,233
Let me go. Let me go.

702
00:36:58,233 --> 00:36:59,165
Don't do this.

703
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,767
She's not the only woman in the world!

704
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,865
Live first! You have to live!

705
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:08,699
I have to go! I have to go now!

706
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:09,732
What?

707
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:11,432
I got off because I need to poop.

708
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,566
I told you.

709
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:16,270
Turn a blind eye no matter what I do!

710
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:24,531
Well.

711
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:26,132
What a show!

712
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,434
Toilet paper, please.

713
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:31,300
Don't turn a blind eye!

714
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,531
I really want to turn a blind eye.

715
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,600
Oh, and one of you has to stay.

716
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,532
I'm going.

717
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,550
Hey, hey!

718
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,132
We're here.

719
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:48,900
Welcome.

720
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,565
You must be tired from all the driving.

721
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:51,232
I'm okay.

722
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:53,865
Rest before the shoot. I talked to the owner.

723
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:56,467
Okay. Thanks.

724
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:59,910
I'll help to move the equipment.

725
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:05,799
Oh, jeez.

726
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:08,299
She's trying too hard.

727
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,999
What?

728
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,365
What?

729
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:13,567
Nothing.

730
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:14,832
Oh, you're here.

731
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,767
Ouch, my back.

732
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:19,799
Where is Editor Nam?

733
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,032
There he is.

734
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:25,898
Editor Nam!

735
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:27,632
Are you okay?

736
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:33,532
Chief Editor!

737
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,933
What is it?

738
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:50,066
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:52,866
I was keeping it in,

740
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:57,667
but seeing you, I just couldn't...

741
00:39:01,366 --> 00:39:03,733
Cry all you want.

742
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:08,632
You had to mask your pain in front of them.

743
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:10,165
You had to act as if nothing happened.

744
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,533
It must've been hard, holding it all in.

745
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,966
Oh, dear.

746
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,399
You poor thing.

747
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,365
He was holding it in?

748
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:22,410
I had no idea.

749
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,433
Have some.

750
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:43,000
What's this?

751
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:44,265
It's a sweet rice drink.

752
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:45,966
The owner gave it to us earlier.

753
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,265
You didn't have any.

754
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,400
Thank you.

755
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:55,166
They say splendor comes from time.

756
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:58,266
I think this manor is proof of that.

757
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,934
I want to live in a place like this.

758
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,433
You can.

759
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:09,999
You're working hard on becoming a homeowner.

760
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,067
Not really.

761
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:13,665
It's...

762
00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:16,899
It's not as easy as it was when I first committed to it.

763
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:20,131
So I'm going back to the beginning,

764
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:22,100
and I'm going to work hard again.

765
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,800
I see.

766
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,332
Then are you still holding off on dating?

767
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,400
- What? 
 - Remember what you said?

768
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,232
You're overwhelmed with becoming a homeowner

769
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:35,599
so you don't have the time to get a boyfriend.

770
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,565
Oh, that...

771
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:41,333
But you never know what'll happen, right?

772
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,767
Sure...

773
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,365
If someone really great comes along,

774
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,033
I might change my mind.

775
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,500
Really?

776
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,166
Sure...

777
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,265
You bought a lot. Thank you.

778
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:10,333
Editor Nam is here. He's changing in the room.

779
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,999
Okay. Should I put this in the fridge?

780
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,431
I'll do it since you did the shopping.

781
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,531
I'll put it in the fridge. Ouch, ouch!

782
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:19,999
Will you get to the fridge today?

783
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,698
Sit down and rest.

784
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:24,465
- Okay. 
 - Get some rest.

785
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,499
You're here!

786
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:29,100
- Here. I'll do it... 
 - No!

787
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,332
I'll put them away myself.

788
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:32,565
You get some rest.

789
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:33,866
What?

790
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,100
I said I'll do it.

791
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,366
What's gotten into him?

792
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,465
At least he can be reasoned with.

793
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:45,765
What do you mean?

794
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:48,298
I gave CEO Yoo a piece of my mind.

795
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:49,768
- I told him to stop tormenting you. 
 - What?

796
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,765
He won't bother you now.

797
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:55,331
If he berates you again, saying what's wrong with you,

798
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:57,231
tell me immediately, okay?

799
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,733
How dare he harass our Young Won!

800
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:02,999
You're a champion of justice, Editor Yeo.

801
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:06,332
You should be grateful to her.

802
00:42:06,332 --> 00:42:09,099
Oh, yes.

803
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,699
 I heard that Ui Joo spoke harshly to you.

804
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:27,198
 Yes. So I wanted to ask.

805
00:42:27,198 --> 00:42:30,832
 How about we tell Editor Yeo about us?

806
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,032
 Yes. I think that'll be good.

807
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:43,732
 She's so considerate towards me...

808
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:46,698
 She'll feel more betrayed the later she finds out.

809
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:47,999
 Never mind that.

810
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:51,365
 If she knows, she'll stop intruding on us.

811
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:53,699
 She'll root for us completely.

812
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:56,534
 I'll tell her as soon as I can.

813
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,565
Then send an email, Secretary Hwang.

814
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:09,232
- What happened to the place in Cheongdam-dong? 
 - I told you to start a fire the moment you arrived.

815
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:11,732
Are you two going to wash the vegetables all day?

816
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:13,498
The water is cold. Our hands are freezing.

817
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:15,866
Ow, my back. Jeez.

818
00:43:15,866 --> 00:43:18,300
If I hadn't lifted the crock...

819
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,266
Bastard!

820
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:25,898
Why? What is it?

821
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:29,198
My ex-boyfriend has a new girlfriend!

822
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:30,798
I can't believe this.

823
00:43:30,798 --> 00:43:33,398
What use is not believing it?

824
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:35,365
You're the one that broke up with him.

825
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:36,766
I told you.

826
00:43:36,766 --> 00:43:38,665
I broke up because he wanted to get married,

827
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:41,298
but he goes and gets a new girlfriend in two days?

828
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:44,065
Wait. Was he cheating on me?

829
00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:47,468
- Did he mention marriage to shake me off? 
 - No way.

830
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:49,866
Should I just kill him?

831
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:52,100
- Kill him. 
 - Calm down.

832
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,499
How can I calm down?

833
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:55,632
I'm furious!

834
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:58,132
If I see a couple today,

835
00:43:58,132 --> 00:44:00,767
I'm going to end them!

836
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:03,566
I need to drink soju! Soju!

837
00:44:03,566 --> 00:44:06,765
Looks like there won't be any soju left.

838
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:09,766
Hey, hey, hey! Editor Yeo!

839
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,265
Ja Sung.

840
00:44:17,265 --> 00:44:19,665
Since you're around people, just listen.

841
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:23,765
I don't think we should tell Ui Joo we're dating.

842
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:28,600
She broke up with her boyfriend and is upset.

843
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,399
- I can't tell her I'm happy... 
 - Hyung!

844
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,665
The air is so fresh.

845
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:42,767
 Yes.

846
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,667
Who is this?

847
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,632
The phone has been turned off.

848
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:08,367
Please leave a message after the beep.

849
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,999
 Where is Ja Sung?

850
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,900
 No, more importantly, I must find who that was,

851
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,199
 and keep them from talking.

852
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,900
 Not Photographer Shin since he was with Ja Sung.

853
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,232
 Ja Sung.

854
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,499
 Since there are people around you, just listen.

855
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:42,699
 I don't think we should tell Ui Joo we're dating.

856
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:45,133
 - She broke up with her boyfriend... 
 - Where's Editor Nam?

857
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:48,600
 - ...is upset. 
 - He's lying in a room.

858
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,798
 Right.

859
00:45:49,798 --> 00:45:52,532
 I heard the voices of Chief Editor and Assistant Jang.

860
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,999
 Editor Nam was lying in the room.

861
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,133
 So it's not those three.

862
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,000
 - Good. 
 - Please be one of them!

863
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,899
 As long as it's not Sunbae.

864
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:09,031
- What are you doing there? 
 - Oh.

865
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:19,199
Good timing.

866
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:20,865
I was going to call you.

867
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:23,266
- I need to talk to you. 
 - What?

868
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,732
 Was it Sunbae?

869
00:46:27,732 --> 00:46:29,533
 Sunbae?

870
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,167
Hurry!

871
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,532
- You're unbelievable. 
 - What?

872
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:47,299
I didn't know you'd hurt me like that.

873
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:49,599
How long were you going to keep it from me?

874
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,832
- Sunbae. 
 - Do I mean nothing to you?

875
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:53,499
Well...

876
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:55,498
I was going to tell you...

877
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:57,199
I really was going to tell you later.

878
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,500
Later? When?

879
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,066
When you felt better.

880
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:04,900
What? I won't feel better until I die.

881
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,399
- So you would've kept it from me forever! 
 - No, that's not...

882
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:10,460
No? Then tell me.

883
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,530
Why did you change rooms with Joo Hee?

884
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,667
- What? 
 - Why did you change rooms without telling me?

885
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:20,500
Do you hate sharing a room with me?

886
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,432
- What? 
 - I was excited about it.

887
00:47:22,432 --> 00:47:26,899
I brought facial packs for you and a massager for your stiff shoulders.

888
00:47:26,899 --> 00:47:30,033
How could you change rooms without telling me?

889
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,066
Oh, that...

890
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,232
Mi Ra begged me

891
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:37,499
to share a room with her...

892
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:39,198
Why are you saying this now?

893
00:47:39,198 --> 00:47:43,400
If you had told me sooner, I wouldn't have made a fool of myself!

894
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,531
I'm sorry.

895
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:48,266
Oh, she must've told her about us.

896
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,466
I won't interfere.

897
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:54,232
Young Won will take care of it.

898
00:47:54,232 --> 00:47:57,198
I feel so betrayed!

899
00:47:57,198 --> 00:47:58,866
I'm so sorry.

900
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:01,666
Of course, you are, but I don't like it.

901
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:05,966
- Think again. 
 - I didn't think you'd dislike it this much.

902
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,965
I don't like it at all.

903
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:10,164
I'm against it. Absolutely against it!

904
00:48:10,164 --> 00:48:12,499
I will not allow it!

905
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:14,199
Stop.

906
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,032
Who do you think you are to not allow us to date?

907
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,131
What?

908
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,432
- Sir. 
 - Did she commit a fatal sin, dating me?

909
00:48:24,432 --> 00:48:28,032
- Why is Editor Na groveling... 
 - Sir! Sir!

910
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,064
What? I didn't say anything wrong.

911
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:33,867
- What are you talking about...? 
 - You're unbelievable.

912
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:36,266
What? Absolutely against it?

913
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:37,600
Are you jealous?

914
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,132
You should be happy for her, not get twisted.

915
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:42,732
You're a terrible person!

916
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,832
So... You...

917
00:48:46,832 --> 00:48:49,066
You two are dating?

918
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:52,231
- Yes! 
 - Sunbae, I'll apologize instead.

919
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:56,066
- I'm so sorry. 
 - Let go. I said let go!

920
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,200
Sunbae! Sunbae!

921
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,067
Jeez.

922
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:03,231
Sir!

923
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,567
CEO Yoo. This is yours.

924
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:08,966
- Thank you. 
 - It was in the yard.

925
00:49:08,966 --> 00:49:11,099
Editor Na called, so I picked it up.

926
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:12,732
Then the batteries went out.

927
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:14,599
Be careful, Editor Na.

928
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:16,365
It's good that I picked it up.

929
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:19,732
If not, you could've gotten caught.

930
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,265
Are you okay?

931
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:28,467
No, I'm not.

932
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:30,000
It's okay.

933
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,032
No, it's not.

934
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,099
Sunbae.

935
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:45,100
Don't be mad.

936
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,500
Please.

937
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,299
I told him to be nice to you

938
00:49:56,299 --> 00:49:58,799
when he was already nice to you.

939
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:05,466
I separated you two all day when you wanted to be together.

940
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:12,098
I dragged you out of the movie theater when you had come together.

941
00:50:12,098 --> 00:50:14,033
It's so funny!

942
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:19,299
Sunbae.

943
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:21,698
Why the gloomy faces?

944
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:23,832
Laugh. It's funny.

945
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:27,080
Why, you made me into a laughing stock!

946
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:34,365
Are you out of laughs because you've been laughing at my expense?

947
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,633
Wasn't the show too good to watch alone?

948
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,433
I was putting on such a performance!

949
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:43,066
I'm sorry.

950
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:45,432
Editor Na was going to tell you,

951
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:46,599
but things got twisted...

952
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,600
Things didn't get twisted. I did.

953
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,865
I'm sorry for saying that.

954
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:56,665
What use is an apology now?

955
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:57,666
Sunbae.

956
00:50:57,666 --> 00:50:59,366
Forget it.

957
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,398
Editor Yeo.

958
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:04,965
Can you keep what you heard today a secret?

959
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:06,099
I don't know.

960
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,865
I'm such a terrible blabbermouth.

961
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,333
I apologize for saying that, too.

962
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,766
Stop apologizing.

963
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:15,932
I'm terribly twisted,

964
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:18,065
so you can keep your distance.

965
00:51:18,065 --> 00:51:19,932
No.

966
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:24,332
I should keep my distance from you.

967
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,233
Sunbae!

968
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:31,531
Since this happened because of me, I'll fix it.

969
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:33,733
I think she's really angry.

970
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:36,899
I'll do whatever it takes to get her to forgive.

971
00:51:36,899 --> 00:51:40,199
You know I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

972
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,480
Just leave it to me.

973
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,065
Have some meat.

974
00:52:03,065 --> 00:52:04,766
Bon appetit.

975
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:06,365
Thanks.

976
00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:08,699
Have some, sir.

977
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:13,133
Editor Yeo, eat up.

978
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,099
I don't know.

979
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:18,065
I don't know if I can eat meat.

980
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:19,666
I don't think I'll be able to digest it.

981
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:21,765
I'm a twisted person.

982
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:24,600
Naturally, my stomach is twisted too.

983
00:52:25,532 --> 00:52:26,999
What are you talking about?

984
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:28,001
Well...

985
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:31,666
I was told today that I'm twisted.

986
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,431
What? Who said that?

987
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:37,400
Oh, someone I know.

988
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,598
Change seats with me, Sunbae!

989
00:52:49,598 --> 00:52:50,566
Forget it.

990
00:52:50,566 --> 00:52:52,367
Don't bother.

991
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:53,532
What's the matter?

992
00:52:53,532 --> 00:52:55,599
She was just being considerate.

993
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,064
Was I out of line?

994
00:52:57,065 --> 00:52:57,934
I'm sorry.

995
00:52:57,935 --> 00:53:01,565
This is why I was told I'm a terrible person.

996
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:03,466
What? Who said that?

997
00:53:03,466 --> 00:53:06,933
Oh, someone I know.

998
00:53:09,532 --> 00:53:10,433
Editor Nam.

999
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:12,533
Eat up and switch places with them.

1000
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:14,898
They can't eat because they're grilling the meat.

1001
00:53:14,898 --> 00:53:16,534
Editor Nam.

1002
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:19,898
Phew, forget it.

1003
00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:22,333
You can't eat at all.

1004
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:40,199
I told Editor Nam to lie down since he is unwell.

1005
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:41,266
Okay.

1006
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:44,167
I should be lying down, too. My back.

1007
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:45,531
What's up with him?

1008
00:53:45,532 --> 00:53:48,266
Staying for more drinks?

1009
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,199
Beats me.

1010
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,666
I don't know why the CEO has joined us.

1011
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,567
Maybe he's monitoring us to see who says what.

1012
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,700
What are you talking about?

1013
00:54:00,899 --> 00:54:02,365
Oh, sir.

1014
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:05,698
This reminds me of a college field trip.

1015
00:54:05,698 --> 00:54:08,564
Which reminds me, let's write anonymous comments to each other.

1016
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:10,699
- We're here to work not play... 
 - Let's do it!

1017
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:12,400
Yes, let's do it!

1018
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,832
- Really? 
 - Yes.

1019
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,733
Okay. Mi Ra.

1020
00:54:14,734 --> 00:54:16,898
Can you get us some pens and paper?

1021
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:19,031
That's not how it's done these days.

1022
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:19,934
Then how is it done?

1023
00:54:19,935 --> 00:54:21,265
In an anonymous chat room.

1024
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:22,866
What?

1025
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,699
 You're the best leader of this era.

1026
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,399
 Can you give me 1 billion won?

1027
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:33,165
 Stop saying "stop."

1028
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:34,732
 Give us a raise.

1029
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:38,020
 Congratulations! Have fun!

1030
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,299
Come on, Editor Yeo!

1031
00:54:41,299 --> 00:54:42,632
This is supposed to be anonymous.

1032
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:44,565
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

1033
00:54:44,565 --> 00:54:46,431
I forgot.

1034
00:54:46,431 --> 00:54:48,598
But what is there to congratulate?

1035
00:54:48,598 --> 00:54:50,265
I don't know.

1036
00:54:50,265 --> 00:54:52,032
He said to keep it a secret.

1037
00:54:52,032 --> 00:54:56,765
But I'm so twisted, I just want to say it.

1038
00:54:56,765 --> 00:54:57,800
Can I, sir?

1039
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,099
A residence I invested in rose in price.

1040
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,732
Editor Yeo found out about it.

1041
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:03,165
You don't have to keep it a secret.

1042
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,900
You can congratulate me all you want.

1043
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:11,898
 My role model.

1044
00:55:11,899 --> 00:55:13,398
 Implicitly the best-looking one here.

1045
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:15,766
 A good person.

1046
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:18,565
 Your smile is very pretty.

1047
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,565
 Isn't it great to be loved?

1048
00:55:21,566 --> 00:55:25,100
 Your unni envies you.

1049
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,500
Come on.

1050
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,898
Not again, Editor Yeo!

1051
00:55:27,899 --> 00:55:28,733
What?

1052
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:30,632
I wrote it anonymously this time.

1053
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:32,999
You're the only one older than her.

1054
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,033
Don't make it so obvious it's you.

1055
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:38,064
Oh, my. You're right.

1056
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:39,032
Young Won.

1057
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:41,466
I'm so thoughtless.

1058
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,265
I'm a terrible person.

1059
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:44,032
Right?

1060
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:46,733
Oh, no, no.

1061
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:48,099
Hey.

1062
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:51,398
What do you mean by "great to be loved?"

1063
00:55:51,398 --> 00:55:53,198
I shouldn't have said that.

1064
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,965
I'm so twisted inside that I said that out of jealousy.

1065
00:55:57,965 --> 00:56:00,099
I'm truly a terrible person.

1066
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,200
Right, everyone?

1067
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,132
No!

1068
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:05,967
I don't think that.

1069
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:08,499
This is no fun. Let's stop.

1070
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
No!

1071
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:11,810
It's your turn.

1072
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,732
 Spend money wisely.

1073
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:17,365
 Can I get some designer clothes?

1074
00:56:17,366 --> 00:56:18,799
 You look so young.

1075
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,433
 What use is asking what use it is?

1076
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:28,100
 Thank you and sorry.

1077
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,432
 A true editor that knows how to keep an embargo.

1078
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:37,499
 She can really hold her tongue.

1079
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,698
 An editor who can hold her tongue.

1080
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,499
 A person that holds no grudge.

1081
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:43,098
 A secret safe personified would be Yeo Ui Joo!

1082
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:44,698
 The only editor I want to be associated with.

1083
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:46,766
 Yeo Ui Joo!

1084
00:56:46,766 --> 00:56:47,766
Come on.

1085
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:51,310
What's with this flood of insincere comments?

1086
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:28,133
Sunbae.

1087
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:31,932
I'm really sorry.

1088
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:39,467
If I were you, I would feel very betrayed.

1089
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:46,133
The CEO truly regrets what he said to you.

1090
00:57:47,433 --> 00:57:49,300
So...

1091
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,732
Please stop being angry...

1092
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,933
Do you like him that much?

1093
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:54,199
What?

1094
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:56,666
Do you?

1095
00:57:57,699 --> 00:57:59,299
Yes.

1096
00:57:59,299 --> 00:58:01,132
All right then.

1097
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:03,132
Since you're dating, have fun.

1098
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:05,133
Okay.

1099
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:06,766
What?

1100
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:11,999
Honestly, I want to be mad forever because of CEO Yoo.

1101
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:16,765
But you like him, so I'm letting you two off the hook.

1102
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,033
Thank you, Sunbae.

1103
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:24,033
In return, tell CEO Yoo

1104
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:27,940
if he hurts you, I'll kill him.

1105
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,531
Okay.

1106
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:32,599
I'm all you have, right?

1107
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:36,032
Who'll take care of you if not me, right?

1108
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:39,633
We've been friends for a long time.

1109
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:41,933
We won't have a falling out because of this.

1110
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:44,260
Of course not.

1111
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:49,066
Thank you so much, Sunbae.

1112
00:58:49,066 --> 00:58:51,600
And I'm sorry.

1113
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,400
It's okay.

1114
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,966
Let's drink.

1115
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:56,099
You'll drink more, right?

1116
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,799
I'll go bring more.

1117
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,767
Wait here.

1118
00:59:01,899 --> 00:59:05,466
Na Young Won, you have one great unni.

1119
00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:14,331

1120
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:16,000
That girl...

1121
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,199
She really knows how to be sweet.

1122
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:24,980
I guess I'm the one who has a great little sister.

1123
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,140
♫  I’m OK and smile  ♫

1124
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:36,190
♫  Feels like tomorrow will be better  ♫

1125
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:42,780
♫  Just like the many dreams  ♫

1126
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,665
 The more time passes by,

1127
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:48,240
 the more radiant an old manor becomes.

1128
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,733
♫  Of my heart  ♫

1129
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:52,060
 Relationships are like that, too.

1130
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,630
♫  Everyone goes  ♫

1131
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:59,380
 It's okay.

1132
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,200
♫  For a tomorrow  ♫

1133
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,620
 The longer the relationship, the stronger it becomes.

1134
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,630
♫  That’ll be different from today  ♫

1135
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,730
♫  Thank you for getting  ♫

1136
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:16,090
 You can even tend to each other's wounds.

1137
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:21,030
♫  Tomorrow, we’ll be happier  ♫

1138
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:27,420
 I hope our friendship will last for a long time.

1139
01:00:28,399 --> 01:00:34,499
 Just like this old manor that becomes more splendid as time goes by.

1140
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:35,698
Is that true?

1141
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,032
- Is Editor Yeo no longer angry? 
 - Yes.

1142
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:42,265
She said she'll root for us completely.

1143
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:44,432
She even told me about this place.

1144
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,966
She said people hardly come here,

1145
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:49,466
so it's a good place for us to be alone.

1146
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:53,131
I knew my hard work would pay off.

1147
01:00:53,131 --> 01:00:55,298
Editor Yeo recognized my sincerity.

1148
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:56,100
What?

1149
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:58,399
What did I tell you?

1150
01:00:58,399 --> 01:01:00,431
I told you you could count on me.

1151
01:01:00,431 --> 01:01:04,066
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

1152
01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:05,365
Right.

1153
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:07,267
You did well.

1154
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:12,932
So don't worry and get a good night's sleep.

1155
01:01:12,932 --> 01:01:17,233
It's late. Shall we head back?

1156
01:01:17,233 --> 01:01:19,799
Are you just leaving like that?

1157
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,300
What?

1158
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:24,165
You told me Editor Yeo said

1159
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:28,799
people hardly come here.

1160
01:01:38,566 --> 01:01:40,370
Let's go.

1161
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,770
♫  Just listen here we are again  ♫

1162
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,350
♫  Through the fire through the rain  ♫

1163
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,780
♫  The roads we crossed they built  ♫

1164
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,150
♫  Story of us  ♫

1165
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,430
♫  Here we are again  ♫

1166
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:59,960
♫  And I still feel the same  ♫

1167
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,260
♫  You and I we write the  ♫

1168
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,610
♫  Story of us  ♫

1169
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:07,070
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

1170
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:10,120

 Tomorrow is CEO Yoo's birthday.

1188
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:02,366
 Let's pretend we don't know.

1189
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:06,198
 Don't let Young Won hear people badmouth you.

1190
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,199
 Cheer up.

1191
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,531
 You're a great guy.

1192
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:10,665
 Do you like me?

1193
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:14,666
 There's no way, get real!

1194
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,999
 Did you get a gift from CEO Yoo, too?

1195
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:19,432
 CEO Yoo must like you a lot.

1196
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:21,732
 I can see he makes such an effort for you.

1197
01:03:21,733 --> 01:03:24,064
 What? Editor Na?
