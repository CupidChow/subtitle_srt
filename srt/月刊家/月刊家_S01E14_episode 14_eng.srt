1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,550

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,180

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,870

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,290

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,280

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,410

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,360

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,440

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,990

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,930

11
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,932
I don't think I can live without you.

12
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:06,133
I can't say the same.

13
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,899
What?

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,760
I don't need you anymore, sir.

15
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,499
 Right...

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,132
 There's no way she'd take me back.

17
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,300
But...

18
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:35,120
I can't give up like this.

19
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,900

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,160

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,799
 I'm sorry, Young Won.

22
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,266
 Please give me a chance to explain.

23
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:50,533
 Can you meet me during lunch?

24
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:53,950
 Please. I beg you.

25
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,299
Young Won, can I talk to you...

26
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,865
"Young Won"?

27
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:25,666
Don't call me so personally.

28
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,165
I'm sorry, Editor Na. Can I talk...

29
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,131
Is it work-related?

30
00:02:30,132 --> 00:02:32,767
Not exactly...

31
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,220
Then I'll be going now.

32
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,767
What's this?

33
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:49,866
Have a drink as you work.

34
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,766
You're unbelievable.

35
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,698
Why are you being so nice to me these days?

36
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,020
No way...

37
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,532
Are you going to ask me for something ridiculous like a discount on the interest?

38
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,165
Of course not! Jeez.

39
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,799
That's a relief.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,665
Don't piss Queen Yeo off.

41
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:12,399
Wow, what's all this?

42
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,965
They're references for this month's article.

43
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:18,164
Take a look. The structure is cool.

44
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,499
- If you like it, ask him to buy it for you. 
 - What?

45
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,799
He said he'll pay for it.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Your rich guy.

47
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,232
 Have you seen my phone?

48
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:31,533
 Why are you looking at my phone?

49
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,399
 I didn't mean to.

50
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,066
 - You got a text. 
 - Oh?

51
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:38,964
 Rich guy... Who is he?

52
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:41,768
 Why is he buying you a place?

53
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:44,732
 He's... a distant relative.

54
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:51,564
 When both my parents passed away, he took pity on me.

55
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,360
 I see.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,431
Lucky you. You have someone who'll buy you a place.

57
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:58,401
Forget it. I like paying my monthly rent.

58
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:02,864
- What? 
 - I told you. Real estate prices will drop!

59
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:04,965
Isn't it a waste to pay rent money?

60
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,732
If you put that money into savings instead—

61
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,733
Honey!

62
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:09,600
So suddenly?

63
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,366
People would think you're my husband.

64
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,266
Stop nagging!

65
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,430
What's wrong with you today?

66
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
 Honey!

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,199
 Honey! Honey!

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,432
Honey?

69
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,200
Husband?

70
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:35,233
That woman's so bad for my heart.

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,500
I must tell her how I feel before my heart stops.

72
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:43,666
How's it going these days?

73
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,398
Can you breathe now that you've escaped CEO Yoo's claws and are writing the articles you wanted?

74
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:48,832
Oh. Yes.

75
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:51,466
Who should you thank for that? Me.

76
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,265
What?

77
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,866
You writing special articles.

78
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:57,532
I suggested that to the CEO.

79
00:04:57,532 --> 00:05:02,434
If I just hadn't said that, I wouldn't be covering stories at this age.

80
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,766
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,631
I hope you get a freelance editor soon.

82
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:11,400
Hold on a sec. Sorry.

83
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,666
Hi, Honey.

84
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,200
What?

85
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,665
Okay. I'll be right there. Bye.

86
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:19,632
What's wrong?

87
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,099
My son is sick and went to the ER.

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,999
I have to go. When the CEO comes, can you cover the story instead of me?

89
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:28,790
- Oh, okay. 
 - Thanks.

90
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:46,733
I hope the chief editor's son is okay.

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,620
Yes.

92
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,899
Since you're here, can you hear me out while we're in—

93
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,398
I don't want to hear it if it isn't work-related.

94
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,999
You said not to mix personal and private matters.

95
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,420
Oh, yes. I'm sorry...

96
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,830

97
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,366
Hello, Chief Editor.

98
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,531
How is your son?

99
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:14,531
 Yes. It's acute pancreatitis.

100
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:16,898
 They said he'll be all right after treatment today.

101
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:17,966
I'm glad to hear that.

102
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,366
 I'm sorry, sir.

103
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,966
  I know you said that making money almost feels worthless

104
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,031
 since there's no joy in living.

105
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:26,432
 And I've added to your troubles.

106
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:31,730
It's okay. Just take care of your son. Bye.

107
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,434
That's how I was.

108
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:40,999
After breaking up with you, life felt so worthless—

109
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,266
Do I have to tell you again?

110
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:46,332
Keep personal matters out of the workplace.

111
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,300
Okay.

112
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:51,834
It was good, right? Good, right?

113
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:52,967
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

114
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:55,065
But my mouth feels so numb.

115
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,367
It was that hot?

116
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,932
But wasn't it delicious?

117
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,233
I came here because you love stir-fried octopus.

118
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,367
Yes. It was great.

119
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,333
The spicy food has relieved my stress.

120
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,566
Right?

121
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:08,631
Oh, right.

122
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,966
You two have to buy props for the shoot, don't you?

123
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:11,734
What?

124
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:12,500
You can hurry off then.

125
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,199
We have time.

126
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,298
Don't take your time. Hurry up and go.

127
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,031
Shoo. Shoo.

128
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:19,998
- Okay, then. See you later. 
 - See you later.

129
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:22,800
Okay. Bye.

130
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,031
Hey.

131
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:29,366
Want to get some coffee?

132
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,966
Just the two of us? Why?

133
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,432
Actually, I have something to tell you,

134
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,099
but I couldn't get the timing right.

135
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,866
I don't think this is the right time either.

136
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,131
I'm tired. I'm going to go doze off.

137
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:42,399
You are? Okay.

138
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,932
Hey, Sang Soon!

139
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,733
Hey, Dong Shik!

140
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:56,399
Wow, Kim Dong Shik! Long time no see!

141
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,531
You haven't changed.

142
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:58,565
Who...?

143
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,232
Oh, he's a friend from high school.

144
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,199
Oh. Nice to meet you.

145
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm Yeo Ui Joo. I work with Editor Nam.

146
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,500
Oh, thank you.

147
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:11,232
I'm Kim Dong Shik, Sang Soon's friend.

148
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,898
Oh, my. You're a lawyer.

149
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,032
Yeah, he was an honor student.

150
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:17,467
I'm on my way to the courthouse.

151
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,966
- I'll call you later. 
 - Okay.

152
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,766
I'll see you next time.

153
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,799
See you.

154
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,065
Wow, you've made it big.

155
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,710
Stop it. I'll call you.

156
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,899
Let's go. You said you're sleepy.

157
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,699
No. I'm suddenly wide awake.

158
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,598
Let's go get coffee!

159
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,965
Great.

160
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,533
Let's go.

161
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:47,598
Actually, what I wanted to say was—

162
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,832
I have something to say, too.

163
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,366
Can I go first?

164
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,300
Oh, okay.

165
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,999
Do you remember you said whoever is going to date me is blessed?

166
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,031
Let's give that blessing to your friend Dong Shik!

167
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:03,231
What?

168
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:04,999
Set me up with him.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,933
I have his business card so I could call him,

170
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,733
but that'll make me look desperate.

171
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:13,000
So you act as the middle man.

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,133
He's totally my type.

173
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:15,899
Forget it!

174
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,965
You're not his type.

175
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,899
Why? Does he not like pretty women?

176
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,465
What the...

177
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,366
He has high standards.

178
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,633
He's only dated super model goddesses!

179
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,965
You're unbelievable.

180
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,566
You said I'm Queen Yeo!

181
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,631
You acted like you'd do anything if I asked.

182
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,866
I said Queen Yeo, not Goddess Yeo!

183
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,368
What?

184
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:37,165
All right! Forget it then!

185
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,199
What did you want to say to me?

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,899
Forget it! Sheesh!

187
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,566
Seriously.

188
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,232
You're so annoying!

189
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,065
I must be insane to confess my feelings to her.

190
00:09:56,933 --> 00:10:00,370
The place we're covering today is this one.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,966
 This house was designed as if connecting

192
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,699
 several fusion hanok buildings like a cube.

193
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,264
 When you open the door and walk in,

194
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:15,066
 you see the high-ceilinged kitchen, not the living room.

195
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,199
 It reflects the recent trend of using the kitchen

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,932
 as a gathering space rather than the living room.

197
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,066
 There's a tearoom where you can gaze at the pond.

198
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,532
 And the bathroom made with cypress

199
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,933
 becomes an open-air bath with open windows.

200
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,231
 The moment I saw this house,

201
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:37,699
I knew it was a house destined for my girlfriend.

202
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,064
Did you buy this house for her?

203
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:44,264
We almost broke up because of a big mistake I made,

204
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:47,032
so I bought this house as a gift and asked for forgiveness.

205
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,933
I envy you so much.

206
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,431
I was so arrogant.

207
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,266
I thought I could live without her when we broke up.

208
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,832
But what do you know?

209
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,566
I couldn't live a second without her.

210
00:10:56,567 --> 00:11:00,266
Yes, I know what that feels like.

211
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,032
At first, she coldly ignored me.

212
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,768
But I couldn't give up.

213
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:07,232
Because I was sure she was my destiny. I couldn't lose her again.

214
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:11,332
Yes, I know completely what that feels like.

215
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:13,133
Um, excuse me.

216
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,799
Can I have a glass of cold water?

217
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,399
Sure.

218
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,232
What are you doing right now?

219
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:25,032
- What? 
 - Don't waste time on useless talk.

220
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,733
Ask questions that make money.

221
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,766
How much has the price risen since he bought it?

222
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,298
How much more is it expected to rise?

223
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:35,132
Focus on making money like you always do.

224
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:41,732
This won't do. I'll do the interview when he comes back.

225
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:43,932
Okay.

226
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,965
Are you feeling okay?

227
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:56,298
I think the stir-fried octopus was too spicy.

228
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,399
My stomach is acting up again.

229
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,631
What?

230
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:02,098
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have taken you there.

231
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,733
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

232
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:06,665
It's okay. It's not that serious.

233
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,766
Are you really okay?

234
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,665
You have an advertorial shoot this evening.

235
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,766
Oh? I'll figure something out.

236
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,598
I'm a professionaaaaaaal!

237
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,832
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

238
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,832
What would you do in that state?

239
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,499
I'll do the advertorial for you.

240
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,631
What? No, it's okay.

241
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,866
It's my job so I should do it.

242
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,032
I'm a professionaaaaaaal!

243
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:28,166
Forget it. I'll do it.

244
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,899
Really?

245
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,600
She lives alone. She can't be sick.

246
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,430
 Medicine

247
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,733
 What kind of food does Ui Joo like?

248
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:45,633
 Actually, we're meeting up tonight.

249
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,967
 That Yeo Ui Joo! Why I ought to...

250
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,965
Thanks, Editor Nam.

251
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,432
- Here's the storyboard for the shoot. 
 - Okay.

252
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,231
Take the medicine first.

253
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:09,566
Okay, thanks.

254
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:11,531
- And some water. 
 - Okay.

255
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:13,500
I should just...!

256
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,999
What's wrong with you?

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,733
I'm sick. How can you play a joke on me?

258
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,431
Right back at you.

259
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,733
I'm putting up with you because I'm a good person.

260
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,465
Others would've thrown water and more.

261
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:29,365
What are you talking about?

262
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,100
Quit acting.

263
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,665
Oh, sorry.

264
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,965
I didn't think you'd cover for me if I asked.

265
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,899
It seemed like you didn't like us meeting.

266
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,399
You knew that, but you still set up a date?

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,865
Don't be like that.

268
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:50,598
Help me out, all right?

269
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,499
I'm your Queen Yeo!

270
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,965
Queen Yeo, my foot.

271
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,598
You're disqualified from that title.

272
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,600
You're so petty.

273
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,298
Hello?

274
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,900
What?

275
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,632
The product release has been delayed?

276
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,164
That can't be helped.

277
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,899
Bye.

278
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,631
- The advertiser wants to postpone the shoot. 
 - What?

279
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:19,566
See? Even the heavens are helping me.

280
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,430
I guess I really am Queen Yeo.

281
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,400
Take that.

282
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,932
Do you want to meet him?

283
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,965
We'll see about that.

284
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:47,431
 Dong Shik, don't meet Editor Yeo.

285
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:49,599
 I like her.

286
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,100
No.

287
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,699
I should stop liking someone who's not even interested in me.

288
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,833
I should give up already.

289
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,598
That's the right move, right, Sang Soon?

290
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,199
Of course, Sang Soon!

291
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:17,499
Editor Na, please hear me out.

292
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,133
There's nothing to hear.

293
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:23,798
What I did was totally wrong.

294
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,566
Please forgive me. Give me another chance.

295
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,932
If you take me back...

296
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:31,365
I'll be good to you. I won't disappoint you again.

297
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,799
You know I do what I say.

298
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,933
Please forgive me just once...

299
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,432
Stop it.

300
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,700
It's already over between us.

301
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:02,932
Editor Na is still being really cold to Ja Sung.

302
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:04,231
But then again,

303
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:07,231
how can she open up again to a man who hurt her that way?

304
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:10,667
You must be in agony, too.

305
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,299
What kind of ironic fate is this?

306
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:14,999
I know.

307
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,098
Whose fault do you think this quirk of fate is?

308
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:19,999
Who?

309
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,632
- Me? 
 - You have to ask?

310
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:22,966
I told you not to tell.

311
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,731
I told you not to let it show.

312
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:27,298
Why did you tell Hyung about me and cause this mess?

313
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,965
I told you I lost it when I saw you suffer, as your friend.

314
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,431
That's my friendship to you.

315
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:35,966
That's how much I care about you.

316
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:53,366
Sorry for asking you to meet me so suddenly.

317
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:55,366
It's okay.

318
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:59,532
What is it you want to say?

319
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,901
I was so selfish.

320
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,566
- What? 
 - I knew you were hurting because of Ja Sung.

321
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,132
But I told you how I felt anyway.

322
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm really sorry.

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,732
It's okay.

324
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,099
Photographer Shin.

325
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,399
I can't—

326
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,733
I know.

327
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,266
That you'll turn me down.

328
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,167
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:27,933
It's nothing compared to the hurt you felt,

330
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:32,900
but Hyung was hurting a lot, too.

331
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:38,198
Sorry, but can you not talk about CEO Yoo?

332
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,698
It was all because of me.

333
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:41,599
What?

334
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,633
What are you talking about?

335
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:44,632
Hyung breaking up with you...

336
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,332
Hurting you...

337
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,067
He found out I liked you and did that on purpose.

338
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,032
All because of me.

339
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,167
I see now.

340
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:08,933
Why he heartlessly turned away.

341
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,600
Yes.

342
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,434
It's understandable.

343
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,434
You two are...

344
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,531
practically brothers.

345
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:30,732
Hyung didn't want to break up with you.

346
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:32,499
So...

347
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:34,232
If you give him another chance...

348
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,000
No.

349
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,767
I don't need someone

350
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,466
who lets go of my hand for whatever reason.

351
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:47,267
- Editor Na... 
 - If you're done, I'll be going now.

352
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,431
 You're going to put it away again?

353
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,967
 Don't do that, Mom.

354
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,000
 You should meet someone who'll always be with you.

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,666
 Meet a man

356
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:35,799
 who won't let go of your hand in any situation.

357
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,466
 Don't live like me.

358
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,120

359
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,932
Sir! The editor I told you about is here.

360
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,198
Come in.

361
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,799
Yes, sir.

362
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:07,765
This is the freelance editor who will write

363
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:09,266
your promo articles.

364
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:11,566
Hello, sir. I'm Kwon Min Gook.

365
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,799
I'm Yoo Ja Sung.

366
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,132
He's a talented editor who's freelancing for several magazines.

367
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,200
We'll see whether he's talented or not after working together.

368
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,300
Oh, right sir.

369
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,967
I'm sure he is.

370
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,300
I've heard so much about you, sir.

371
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,632
You're Gaeryong, the dragon that rose from a ditch.

372
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:33,800
Stop wasting time with useless talk. Let's focus on work.

373
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,632
Get the material on the house we covered yesterday from Editor Na,

374
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:39,734
and send me the first draft by today.

375
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:43,467
What? Write an article based on only the material?

376
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,833
Why? Is that impossible?

377
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,566
I guess you aren't as talented as he just introduced you to be.

378
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:50,600
No. I can do it.

379
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,666
If you're done, we'll calmly leave now.

380
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,900
Stop.

381
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:59,534
I almost forgot something crucial.

382
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,933
Crucial! I should write this down...

383
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:04,401
- He's this talented. 
 - Please continue.

384
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:05,599
The first draft...

385
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,300
The first draft...

386
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,400
- ...must be written on scrap paper. 
 - Scrap paper is good. Scrap...

387
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,033
Scrap... Scrap paper?

388
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:14,498
Be sure to remember that.

389
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:19,199
Yes, sir. Let's go now.

390
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,032
Scrap...

391
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:24,199
Just accept it for what it is.

392
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,900
A glass of soda filled to the brim, please!

393
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,732
Never mind!

394
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:53,865
You said you had a previous engagement.

395
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:55,632
You didn't want to eat with us?

396
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:57,367
It's not that.

397
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,801
- Actually, it was a previous engagement with myself.   - What?

398
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:04,567
Lunch time is when I focus on my stock no matter what.

399
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,800
- Stock? 
 - You invest in stocks.

400
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,667
Yes. When the stock market crashed in the economic crisis,

401
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:15,432
- I invested all my savings, and that tripled overnight. 
 - Tripled?

402
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:16,967
From what amount to what amount?

403
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,033
Oh, well...

404
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:22,232
From 1 billion won ($1 million) to 3 billion won ($3 million)...

405
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:25,899
That's what I dreamed of.

406
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,365
But I had only saved up 10 million won ($10,000).

407
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,332
It was such a shame.

408
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,065
I realized it then. The stock market is the lottery!

409
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,967
It's the only chance to turn my life around!

410
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:39,233
The independent trader I heard about was right here.

411
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,699
You only heard about it?

412
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:43,966
You didn't invest during the economic crisis?

413
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:49,766
If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep,

414
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:53,133
you will work until you die.

415
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,066
Don't you know Brother Buffett's quote?

416
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:58,900
No. 1 in the stock investment world, Warren Buffet!

417
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,400
He's my role model, so I call him my brother.

418
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,699
You all should prepare for retirement.

419
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,866
I'm watching the stock market, so bye.

420
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:12,366
Thanks for the food.

421
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:15,267
They'll pay for my bill.

422
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,534
Maybe I should invest in stocks.

423
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:19,367
Pay back Editor Yeo first.

424
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:22,066
Has CEO Kim already arrived?

425
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:25,365
I'll be right there. Bye.

426
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,666
Is there something you need?

427
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,098
Oh, I...

428
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,432
If you're here to sell milk, a newspaper, or insurance, just leave.

429
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,500
Our office is off limits to outsiders.

430
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,400
I'm Editor Na's mother.

431
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,633
- Pardon? 
 - Na Young Won is an editor at this magazine. She's my daughter.

432
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:45,699
Oh, my! It's nice to meet you.

433
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,766
I'm Yoo Ja Sung, the CEO.

434
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:50,734
I didn't know who you were and was so rude. I apologize.

435
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:53,100
Nice to meet you.

436
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:58,565
Have you... had lunch? Mother?

437
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:04,066
You didn't have to delay your plans for me.

438
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:07,865
Please. My plans weren't that important. Please help yourself.

439
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:10,600
I don't deserve such lavish treatment.

440
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,099
Of course, I should treat you well. You're the mother of Editor Na whom I trust and cherish.

441
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,567
 I love your daughter, Mother.

442
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:21,332
You're so competent and you have great character.

443
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:23,133
I heard you were single.

444
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,933
I wonder who you'll meet. She's very lucky.

445
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,099
Oh, you're too kind.

446
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:33,167
 Please tell your daughter what you just said, Mother.

447
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,467
Whoever will have you as their son-in-law,

448
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,667
I'm very envious of them.

449
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,265
Thank you.

450
00:24:39,265 --> 00:24:43,799
 Please tell her that, too. I beg you, Mother.

451
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,900
 No. Mother-in-law.

452
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,699
Why aren't you eating?

453
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:48,966
You should eat, too.

454
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:51,166
Yes, Mother-in-law.

455
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,666
Pardon?

456
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,933
Oh, uh... I meant I'll eat this braised beef.

457
00:24:57,933 --> 00:24:59,733
Braised beef.

458
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,299

459
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,633
It's Young Won.

460
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,799
Go ahead and answer it comfortably.

461
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,733
Okay then.

462
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:15,734
Hi, Young Won. What do you mean? I wanted to know how you were doing.

463
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,500
Right now?

464
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,033
I'm having lunch.

465
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,299
 Now's the time, Mother-in-law.

466
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,867
 Tell her you're receiving a grand treatment.

467
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,532
 That you want me as your son-in-law.

468
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,799
Who am I eating with?

469
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,033
Yoo...

470
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,466
Yoo Sung's mom.

471
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:39,900
I have to finish up and go to work.

472
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's talk later.

473
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:44,800
Why...

474
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,866
I came here on business and thought I'd visit her quickly.

475
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:49,500
But I have to go home soon.

476
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,199
I don't want her to feel bad I didn't stop by.

477
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:59,567
That's why I'm asking, but please don't tell her that you met me.

478
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,599
- Pardon? 
 - She hates being indebted to anyone.

479
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,066
If she knows you bought me lunch, she'd make such a fuss.

480
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,800
She might not though, no?

481
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,566
She might be so moved that

482
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:15,567
if she was angry at or disappointed in me, she could forgive me.

483
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:19,799
Why would she feel that way about such a good person like you?

484
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,967
 But she does, Mother. So please...

485
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,567
Please keep it a secret.

486
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,900
Okay, I will.

487
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,731
 One day, I hope I can call you "Mother-in-law."

488
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:39,598
Due to the nature of the promo article,

489
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,500
it's better to write based on facts than feelings.

490
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,900
I'm sorry. My alarm goes off when the market opens.

491
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,166
No way!

492
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,765
My stocks hit the ceiling!

493
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:57,633
I just earned more than this promo manuscript fee.

494
00:26:57,633 --> 00:27:00,032
Really? You're so lucky.

495
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:01,300
You must feel great.

496
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,199
Of course! Hit the ceiling!

497
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,833
If you're like this, you'll go broke.

498
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,365
- What? 
 - Brother Buffett said this.

499
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:12,400
If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.

500
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,166
Stock is a long-term investment.

501
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,799
You should never be swayed by the fluctuating stock price.

502
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,399
I see.

503
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,333
What's this? Why is it going down?

504
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,567
How much evaporated in an instant?

505
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,365
The price is declining.

506
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:37,733
I should've sold it when it hit the ceiling!

507
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:39,667
Editor Kwon.

508
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,934
Editor Na. What do you think the water temperature of the Han River is?

509
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:48,333
- It'll be really cold, right? 
 - What?

510
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,700
I need to go to the restroom.

511
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:56,666
What the...?

512
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:59,200
He said not to be swayed.

513
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,334
- I'm back. 
 - Hey.

514
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:03,766
- Hah! 
 - Did you get the source?

515
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,934
Yes, I did.

516
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,866
How was your lunch date?

517
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,733
No, he's history.

518
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh? Why?

519
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,532
You said he was your destiny.

520
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,734
Forget it!

521
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,167
So annoying!

522
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,766
 This place is great!

523
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,766
 Let's take a picture and send it to Sang Soon.

524
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:24,434
 Good idea.

525
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,767
 Okay.

526
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,233
 What?

527
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:36,166
 Your great aunt is calling. Are you not taking her call?

528
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:40,033
 I can call her back later.

529
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,332
 Let's take a picture. Okay. 
 - Good.

530
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,500
 Here we go.

531
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,367
 Oppa, are you busy? My parents are away so I can spend the night.

532
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,066
 What was that?

533
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,532
 My great aunt is very old

534
00:28:57,532 --> 00:29:01,166
 so her mind wanders.

535
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,532
 She used to be so healthy.

536
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:06,266
 Let's go ahead and take a picture.

537
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,900
 What? Okay.

538
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,700
 Here we go. One, two.

539
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,230

540
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:20,766
 - I'm your second great aunt? 
 - Oh...

541
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:23,098
 Th-That's a misunderstanding.

542
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:25,000
 I don't have a grand nephew like you!

543
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,666
 How dare you cheat on your girlfriend! You're a bastard! You bastard!

544
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:34,166
If he weren't your friend, I would've killed him right then and there.

545
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,867
I can't believe he did that.

546
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:39,400
Remember? I said I can never forgive cheaters!

547
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,499
Tell him to be careful at night.

548
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:45,566
The moment I see him, I'll kill him!

549
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:51,699
That bastard!

550
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:54,965
Why did he do that?

551
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:03,365
He's no good. He's such a bastard.

552
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:13,234
As you can see, I want to introduce a man of nature who lives in the woods in a hut.

553
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,166
It's fresh.

554
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,799
But will he agree to an interview?

555
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,966
I made an acquaintance with him when I went hiking.

556
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,200
I'm working on him.

557
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,665
What? What's wrong?

558
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,665
The chair is uncomfortable.

559
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,900
Is it okay for all of you?

560
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,832
The chairs in other magazines are great.

561
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,332
But here, they're uncomfortable.

562
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,333
Stop.

563
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,765
What do you want to say?

564
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:40,299
Buy new chairs?

565
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,798
Comfortable chairs boost work efficiency...

566
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:44,966
The craftsman doesn't blame the tools.

567
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,899
Did Brother Buffett not say anything like that?

568
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,399
If it's bad, bring a comfortable chair from home.

569
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,466
That's a wrap.

570
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,299
Yes, Secretary Hwang.

571
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,098
Just let it go.

572
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,365
He hates wasting money.

573
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:05,099
Don't quit because of this. You have to hold on.

574
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,499
The chairs are uncomfortable.

575
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,966
It was like that for me, too.

576
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:11,599
- But once you get used to it— 
 -   Let's get new ones.

577
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:16,132
I'll swap out all the chairs right away.

578
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,632
But you just said no.

579
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,765
An employee working long hours said they're bad.

580
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:24,199
We must change them now. Get comfortable chairs, please.

581
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,767
Yes, sir.

582
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,199
Thank you.

583
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:46,466
It'll be good to reference these, too.

584
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:48,199
Thank you.

585
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,566
What's this?

586
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,332
Why? Did the stocks go down again?

587
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,365
Do you know Welcome Game Magazine?

588
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,999
I'm freelancing for them, too,

589
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,232
but they said they can't pay me.

590
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,199
What?

591
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,631
I wrote it the way they wanted, but they're nitpicking.

592
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,200
But I need to get paid.

593
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:09,466
That money is for my parents' living expenses.

594
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,431
Then you should get it no matter what!

595
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,698
Revise the manuscript until they're satisfied.

596
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,098
Work furiously.

597
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,865
I should, right?

598
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:19,467
Since you said that,

599
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:24,132
- can you write this instead of me? 
 - What?

600
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:27,831
If I don't send the revision now, they said they'll get a new freelancer.

601
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:30,031
What use is it to give up sleep and invest in stocks?

602
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:34,132
I can't even get paid for the manuscript I worked hard on.

603
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,266
My poor parents...

604
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:39,531
All right, then.

605
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:40,899
Go do the revision.

606
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,733
But do it where no one can see you.

607
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:45,966
If you get caught working for another magazine,

608
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:47,031
you'll be in trouble.

609
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,598
Thank you so much.

610
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,264
I will never forget your kindness.

611
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,165
Thank you.

612
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:54,765
These will be good as reference materials.

613
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,466
What?

614
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,899
Photographer Shin.

615
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,799
I'm going up with material.

616
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,499
Would you like some coffee?

617
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,300
Oh, you already had some?

618
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,967
Okay.

619
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,431
Chief Editor, would you like some coffee?

620
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,198
- It's freshly brewed. 
 - Wow!

621
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,632
You brewed this for me?

622
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:17,299
How did you know I was craving coffee?

623
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,598
I can see what's happening.

624
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,399
A misunderstanding.

625
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,499
You brewed that for Gyeom, but he declined.

626
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,865
So you've given it to Chief Editor.

627
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,466
Why are you making people misunderstand you?

628
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:29,731
Oh, well, it doesn't matter if it was for someone else.

629
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:31,832
It's not such a matter to treat lightly.

630
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:36,465
If you hadn't come here, that coffee would've gone down the drain.

631
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:39,332
You're drinking that kind of coffee, sir.

632
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:42,800
Yeah, well.

633
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:47,333
Thanks for the details I didn't need to know.

634
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,799
So stop leading people on.

635
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,865
What does that stare mean?

636
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:04,366
I can draw up two interpretations.

637
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:06,466
Petty fool.

638
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:07,932
What a loser.

639
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,266
Both are wrong.

640
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:12,499
A fool who obviously likes Mi Ra,

641
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,266
but a fool who'll always lose to Photographer Shin.

642
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,666
How dare you!

643
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,265
Where's the proposal for the small appliances advertorial?

644
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,099
Oh, yes. Editor Na is reviewing it.

645
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,365
- I'll go get it. 
 - It's okay. I'll get it.

646
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,690

647
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,299
Why is Editor Na writing this?

648
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:49,167
Where is Editor Kwon?

649
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:57,165
No way! It hit the ceiling!

650
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:00,265
It hit the ceiling!

651
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,667
Rise! Rise! Rise!

652
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,533
What?

653
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,434
Sir.

654
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:28,665
Pack up and leave right now!

655
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:31,766
I can't work with someone who doesn't know the basics!

656
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,533
I'm sorry.

657
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,500
Sir, wait.

658
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,865
Editor Kwon didn't pass off his work to me.

659
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:46,133
I offered to do it.

660
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:46,933
What?

661
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:49,466
I thought he shouldn't overdo it on his first day,

662
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:52,398
so I told him to rest while I wrote the article.

663
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,499
I'm sorry.

664
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,799
Who are you to tell him to rest?

665
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,231
Are you paying him?

666
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:58,633
- Are you the CEO? 
 - Stop.

667
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:00,165
That's enough.

668
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,667
No, sir.

669
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,898
This isn't a matter to go over lightly.

670
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:06,299
Get it together!

671
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,498
If this happens again, Editor Na will have to—

672
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:11,265
Editor Kwon will have to take full responsibility.

673
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:12,898
I'll make sure this never happens again.

674
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:14,566
If it does, I'll tell you off—

675
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,898
- I'll tell you off, Editor Kwon. 
 - So you should—

676
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,899
Stop! That's enough.

677
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:20,633
- Sir? 
 - Why are you...

678
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:21,832
Sir.

679
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,666
Get back to work.

680
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:31,366
I'm sorry.

681
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,599
What I did was wrong.

682
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,367
"I need to increase my money somehow."

683
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,099
"I want to become rich soon."

684
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,000
I must have gone crazy for a second with those thoughts.

685
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:48,766
I'm sorry.

686
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,732
And thank you.

687
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:54,731
I had no idea you would cover for me like that.

688
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,099
"I want to make seed money somehow."

689
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,265
"'I want to live comfortably."

690
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,833
I have a lot of those thoughts myself.

691
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:07,532
I know too well how you feel,

692
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,799
but don't do that ever again.

693
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,365
You need to earn money to invest.

694
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,567
You shouldn't do that at a paying job.

695
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:19,165
I understand.

696
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,433
I'll bear that in mind.

697
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,332
You're a good person.

698
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:28,265
- I guess that's why the CEO cares about you so much.
 - What?

699
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:31,633
The chairs in the conference room and just now, too.

700
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:34,300
He cares for you so obviously.

701
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,933
I'll get back to work then.

702
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:06,033
Editor Yeo. Are you okay?

703
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,064
About what?

704
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:11,367
Your lunch was ruined by my friend.

705
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,800
I'll apologize instead.

706
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,398
Forget it.

707
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:17,799
What use is your apology?

708
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,466
I shouldn't have met him when you stopped me.

709
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,766
I brought it upon myself.

710
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:25,064
No, it's my fault.

711
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:28,766
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have met him.

712
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,099
Unbelievable. Why are you going overboard?

713
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:35,066
I just feel responsible.

714
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:36,732
I want to make it up to you.

715
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,566
- Want to go watch a movie? 
 - What?

716
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:42,698
Let's watch a movie and forget this happened.

717
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:45,565
It's because I feel responsible.

718
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:47,466
No. I have other plans.

719
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:48,865
What other plans?

720
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:51,167
None of your business.

721
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,999
 I'm sorry, but I have to cancel our dinner tonight.

722
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,599
Oh, you said you had plans.

723
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,599
It was to meet your relative?

724
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,566
Yeah.

725
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:09,067
But as you can see, it got canceled.

726
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,865
Let's go see a movie.

727
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:12,767
Okay.

728
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,833
I need to go to the restroom.

729
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:21,299
What the...?

730
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,832
Is she that disappointed about not seeing a distant relative?

731
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:28,367
If others saw, they would think she couldn't meet up with her lover.

732
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,531
There's not much to revise since Editor Na finished it all.

733
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:32,966
Run the article as is.

734
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:35,432
Let's talk about the next home we'll cover.

735
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,199
The material...

736
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,899
Oh, here.

737
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,200
- Stop! 
 - Yes?

738
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:47,799
- You're hopeless, aren't you? 
 - Sir?

739
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:49,965
I warned you not even a minute ago!

740
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,865
How can you be looking at your stocks while speaking to the CEO?

741
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:54,631
No, sir. That's not it, this is—

742
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:58,330
Don't lie to me! The evidence is so clearly...

743
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,798
not here.

744
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:03,766
As you can see, I wasn't looking at my stocks. I was recording.

745
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,267
- Recording? 
 - I was nervous and forgot my pen.

746
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:09,466
If I told you the truth, I thought you'd reprimand me.

747
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:12,531
But if I missed what you said, I thought you'd reprimand me even more.

748
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:15,332
So I was recording you.

749
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:18,032
Oh. You should've told me the truth.

750
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:21,967
I wouldn't reprimand someone over something like this.

751
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:26,766
Editor Kwon.

752
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:27,766
I was looking for the material.

753
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:29,833
I didn't look at my stocks.

754
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,133
I know, I know.

755
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,233
I'm sorry I misunderstood you earlier.

756
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,166
It's okay.

757
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,798
There was probable cause.

758
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:43,567
I lost your trust.

759
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:47,900
They say it takes many years to build trust,

760
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,866
but just five minutes to ruin it.

761
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,698
The saying fits my situation. I'm ashamed.

762
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:55,466
You don't have to be ashamed.

763
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,232
Not to you. To Brother Buffett.

764
00:40:58,232 --> 00:40:59,100
What?

765
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,033
Brother Buffett said that.

766
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:03,665
I see.

767
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:05,467
I apologize.

768
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:08,099
I made a mess on my first day.

769
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,700
Actually, my family is dirt poor.

770
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,332
My sister and I went through so much hardship.

771
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm fed up with poverty and want to get out of it so much that I just...

772
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,834
You need seed money to invest in real estate.

773
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:26,600
So the stock market is my only hope.

774
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,080
I really want to become rich, sir.

775
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:36,033
I was that desperate, too.

776
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:39,967
So I worked very hard, like you.

777
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:45,800
But don't set money as your only goal in life.

778
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,634
Sir?

779
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:52,832
Take the time to look around you and care for your loved ones.

780
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:54,999
If you lose money, you can earn it back.

781
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,667
But if you lose a person's heart, it's hard to win it back.

782
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,890
Don't forget what's precious.

783
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,466
Editor Kwon.

784
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:24,932
I'll buy you a drink. Teach me about stocks.

785
00:42:24,932 --> 00:42:27,398
I want to get rich quickly, too.

786
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,565
Someone once said this.

787
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:30,667
"Don't set money as your only goal in life.

788
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:35,432
Take the time to look around you and care for your loved ones."

789
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:36,467
Who said that?

790
00:42:36,468 --> 00:42:37,832
Oh, right. Brother Buffett?

791
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,533
No, Hyung Ja Sung.

792
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,099
- What? Brother Ja Sung? 
 - Yes.

793
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:45,332
Starting today, my role model isn't Warren Buffett but CEO Yoo Ja Sung.

794
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:47,232
I thought he was a cold-hearted money-grubber.

795
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,499
But it turns out he's a warm person.

796
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,365
- No way. CEO Yoo? 
 - Yes.

797
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:54,765
And I want to make Hyung Ja Sung into my brother-in-law.

798
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:56,099
What? Brother-in-law?

799
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,700
Actually, my sister is

800
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,564
- Announcer Kwon Min Kyung. 
 - What?

801
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:03,332
The main anchor at News House?

802
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,565
The woman who appeared on Knowing Sisters and was #1 on the search rank recently? 
  (T/N: Knowing Sisters is a reference to "Knowing Brothers" a famous variety show )

803
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:06,333
That Kwon Min Kyung?

804
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,833
Yes.

805
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,198
In our family, she's the dragon risen from a ditch.

806
00:43:13,198 --> 00:43:14,100
Oh, right.

807
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:17,198
Didn't you interview her once, Young Won?

808
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,899
What?

809
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:20,898
Yes. When I was with a fashion magazine.

810
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,064
You did?

811
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:23,231
What did you think about her?

812
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:25,000
My sister's awesome, right?

813
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,665
Yes. She seemed nice.

814
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:28,734
Really?

815
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:31,132
Do you think she'll be a good match with CEO Yoo?

816
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:32,365
What?

817
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:33,432
Oh, sure.

818
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:34,732
Great!

819
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:36,865
I'll calmly back you up.

820
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:40,665
I want the CEO to date more than anyone.

821
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:44,660
What are you doing? Move, move! Move!

822
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:51,232
What?

823
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:52,799
A blind date with her?

824
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,165
Yes.

825
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:58,866
This famous announcer is Editor Kwon's sister.

826
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:01,531
Guys bother me when they learn she's my sister,

827
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:03,265
so I'm normally tight-lipped about it.

828
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:06,599
But I want to introduce her to you.

829
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,566
It's fine.

830
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:09,198
I don't have the time.

831
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:11,699
Oh, sir. I told you.

832
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,332
You need to date.

833
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,565
It's finally your chance to find joy in life.

834
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:18,565
Don't be like that. Meet her.

835
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:20,064
I said I don't want to.

836
00:44:20,065 --> 00:44:24,066
Even Editor Na said you two would be a great fit.

837
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:25,000
Did she say that?

838
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:27,432
She interviewed his sister once.

839
00:44:27,433 --> 00:44:32,500
She complimented on how nice she was.

840
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,532
Sir.

841
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:34,966
Are you free tonight?

842
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,650
My sister says she's free.

843
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,132
Is it true?

844
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,799
What is?

845
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:49,799
You said I'd be a good fit with that announcer.

846
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:52,766
Are you really okay with me meeting someone else?

847
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:57,565
What do you want me to say?

848
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:00,733
Do you still think you can change my mind?

849
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,765
Is that why you've been trying so hard today?

850
00:45:02,765 --> 00:45:05,466
I wanted you to know how sincere I was.

851
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:07,666
I told you there was no need.

852
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,665
I told you it's over between us.

853
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:10,966
Do you think I'm joking?

854
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,001
- No, that's not— 
 - The world is so easy for you, isn't it?

855
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,733
- What? 
 - Since you made it this far on your own,

856
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:19,766
since you succeed in everything you set out to do,

857
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:22,399
you think everything is easy, right?

858
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:27,667
But you should know there are things you can't get through pure effort.

859
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,531
Not everything works out your way.

860
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:30,500
That wasn't what I—

861
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:32,431
Just stop already!

862
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:36,833
Pushing your feelings on someone is the same as assault.

863
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:55,250

864
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,398
 I wanted you to know how sincere I was.

865
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,798
 Are you really okay with me meeting someone else?

866
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:02,700
So what if he does?

867
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,933
What do I care?

868
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,965
Hi, Mom.

869
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:14,332
What?

870
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,031
What are you saying?

871
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:18,865
Raising the store deposit that much is insane.

872
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:21,933
The new landlord was so obstinate.

873
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:23,366
He said if I don't pay, I must move out.

874
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:25,198
No. Don't be scared.

875
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,799
There's still time left on the contract period.

876
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,298
- It's almost up. That's why he said that. 
 - What?

877
00:46:30,298 --> 00:46:32,299
I didn't know either.

878
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:38,264
The previous owner and I didn't speak about the contract period.

879
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:40,966
I didn't want to ask you for money again.

880
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:44,866
So I came to Seoul this morning, meeting people I know.

881
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:47,033
No one has any money.

882
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:49,500
So I was thinking...

883
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,265
What about asking your CEO for money?

884
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:54,265
- Who? 
 - Actually...

885
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:58,366
I went to your office to see you and ran into him.

886
00:46:58,366 --> 00:47:00,898
He said he trusts and cherishes you.

887
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:02,565
He praised you a lot.

888
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:03,799
So...

889
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,832
If you tell him the situation and ask him—

890
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,933
Don't speak such nonsense.

891
00:47:07,934 --> 00:47:10,870
Do you want to see me quit my job?

892
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,060

893
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,550

894
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:25,233
I can't understand anything.

895
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:30,333
Right.

896
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,360

897
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,766
 Does anyone know about commercial buildings?

898
00:47:38,766 --> 00:47:41,198
 My mom runs a small store.

899
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:46,766
 The new landlord is suddenly asking for a 30% raise in the security deposit.

900
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,370

901
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,300
Where is she?

902
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:13,099
I told you I'm not buying.

903
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,900
I told you already I don't want to buy a house.

904
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,632
Don't worry about me.

905
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:20,064
Take care of your precious wife.

906
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:23,399
What'll she do if she finds out you called in secret?

907
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:26,966
What is she talking about?

908
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:28,933
Never mind. Just meet me this weekend.

909
00:48:28,934 --> 00:48:31,970
Carlton Hotel at six. Okay?

910
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,232
I have to go. Talk to you later.

911
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:44,833
Are you okay?

912
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:48,633
- What's going on? 
 - What?

913
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:50,099
You said he was a distant relative.

914
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,531
- Are you having an affair with a married man? 
 - What?

915
00:48:52,531 --> 00:48:56,766
All the while, you said you can't forgive cheaters.

916
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:57,832
You need to look in the mirror.

917
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,099
Nam Sang Soon.

918
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,800
That's not it.

919
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:02,366
Don't deny it.

920
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:04,231
Why do you live like this?

921
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,732
You lack nothing.

922
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:10,832
Whatever. I'm leaving.

923
00:49:10,832 --> 00:49:12,732
Why do you live like this?

924
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:14,332
Mind your own business!

925
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,898
- Why do you care? 
 - Why?

926
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:17,666
Because I...

927
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:19,400
He's my dad!

928
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,300
What?

929
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:22,200
He's my dad.

930
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,765
Happy?

931
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,666
What?

932
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,064
What's going on?

933
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:44,799
You said your parents passed away.

934
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,799
They did.

935
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:52,766
I lived as if both of them didn't exist in this world.

936
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:54,666
What?

937
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,366
When I was a senior in high school,

938
00:49:57,366 --> 00:50:01,066
my mom got sick and was hospitalized for a long time.

939
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:05,533
But amidst all that, do you know what my dad did?

940
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:10,799
He shacked up with another woman.

941
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:16,600
And less than one month after my mom's funeral, he remarried.

942
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:20,833
Seeing that, I told myself

943
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:25,530
that my dad was dead to me.

944
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,532
You get it, right?

945
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:37,132
Why I don't want to get married.

946
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:41,200
What if I meet someone like him?

947
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:44,933
It made me not want to.

948
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:48,766
But do you know what's funny?

949
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:54,367
I thought about it, and felt it was unfair.

950
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,100
The daughter of his former wife

951
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:04,066
voluntarily cut ties, so he must feel so free.

952
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:08,898
So I told him to pay for my rent.

953
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,767
What?

954
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:15,233
Then at least he'll think about me once every few years

955
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:18,133
when the contract renews.

956
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:22,166
I wanted him to feel guilty.

957
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:27,166
So why a monthly rent?

958
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:30,333
So he'd think about me more often.

959
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:35,166
When he pays my rent every month,

960
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,966
I want him to feel guilty.

961
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,765
I'm so childish, right?

962
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:50,000
Ui Joo...

963
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,480

964
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,200

965
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,166
 You don't have to worry.

966
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:59,098
 Your post said she didn't discuss the terms after the contract expired with the landlord.

967
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:02,600
 That is an implicit contract renewal.

968
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,730
Implicit contract renewal.

969
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,660

970
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,498
 Up to a month prior to contract termination,

971
00:53:13,498 --> 00:53:15,898
 if there is no mention of an extension or revocation,

972
00:53:15,899 --> 00:53:18,866
 the contract is implicitly renewed on the same terms.

973
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:21,865
 Even if the landlord changes, the previous contract stands.

974
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,360
Oh, it's the same as a house.

975
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,300

976
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,532
 If you need more help, I can introduce you to a lawyer I know.

977
00:53:30,532 --> 00:53:34,732
 First, put your mother at ease.

978
00:53:34,732 --> 00:53:37,732
 Dragon, thank you so much.

979
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:41,390
 I'm grateful for your support every time.

980
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:47,000
Hi, Mom!

981
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:52,400
What should I do?

982
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,899
I can't borrow any money.

983
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:56,265
Mom, you don't have to move out.

984
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,165
You don't have to raise the deposit.

985
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,231
- What? 
 - Come see.

986
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:01,032
Come here.

987
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:04,730
We can take legal action.

988
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:07,580

989
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:16,100
Mom.

990
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:18,333
What a relief.

991
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:21,365
I'm so glad.

992
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:24,150
Don't cry.

993
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,432
 She must've suffered so much alone.

994
00:54:34,432 --> 00:54:36,934
 Mom's right.

995
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:42,099
 It has to be someone who will never let go of my hand no matter what.

996
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,220

997
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,160
Home Ownership Café?

998
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:10,066
 What are you reading?

999
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:14,332
 Oh, I joined an online club after deciding to buy a place.

1000
00:55:14,332 --> 00:55:16,531
 It's called Home Ownership Café.

1001
00:55:16,532 --> 00:55:18,632
 Your nickname is YoungForever?

1002
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:20,299
 Yes.

1003
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:23,190
Was Hyung a member of that club, too?

1004
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,280

1005
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,033
 I heard there's a place that makes you feel it's your destiny the moment you see it.

1006
00:55:46,866 --> 00:55:49,365
 I believe it's the same with people.

1007
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:53,360
 A person who you feel is your destiny at first glance.

1008
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:09,266
 Of course, sometimes you realize that after you've known them for a long time.

1009
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,830
 I'm on my way. I'm looking forward to meeting you.

1010
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:24,865
 And sometimes, you thought it was fate,

1011
00:56:24,866 --> 00:56:27,900
 but it could fall apart in the end.

1012
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,380

1013
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:39,367
 Just like my home I knew was my destiny,

1014
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:45,166
 I hope to meet the person of my destiny

1015
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:50,500
 that will never let go of my hand.

1016
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,380

1017
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,180

1018
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,300

1019
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,932
 LAN cable companion?

1020
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:09,499
 It's someone who's there for me, rooting me on.

1021
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,320
 The username is Dragon.

1022
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,960

1023
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,190

1024
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:26,267
 Dragon, who was there for you…

1025
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:28,066
 It was Hyung.

1026
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,299
 Hyung has never once let go of your hand.

1027
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:40,120
♫  I know that warm feeling  ♫

1028
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,640

1029
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,866
 First comment!

1030
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:49,232
 Hardships are the driving force that pushes you forward.

1031
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,201
 Hang in there!

1032

 I'm always rooting for you.

1033
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:53,265
 Thank you.

1034
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:56,065
 Actually, that's a lie.

1035
00:57:56,065 --> 00:58:01,066
 No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't forget him.

1036
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:04,100
 Forget about that bastard,

1051

Get up right now!

I won't let you meet another woman.

What are you…?

1054
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,832
You asked me to forgive you.

1055
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:58,999
You said you were wrong.

1056
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,033
After saying that, you're already going on dates?

1057

How does that make sense?

Excuse me, CEO Yoo.

Perhaps I should give you some space.

1060
00:59:10,065 --> 00:59:12,365
Should we talk about investment next time?

1061
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:13,833
Who are you?

1062
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:17,620
She's a client I'm meeting for an investment consultation.
