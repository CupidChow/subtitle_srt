1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,940

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,640

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,210

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,780

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,220

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,330

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,500

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,220

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,440

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,030

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,390
Sir,

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,660
do you like me?

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,470
What?

14
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:05,789
Telling me that I'll meet someone that's a million times better...

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,310
Do you mean yourself?

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,490
♫  When I’m in your atmosphere  ♫

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,040
You like me, don't you?

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,629
I'm right.

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,319
Aren't I?

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,279
Can I... give you an answer this way?

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,910
Sir?

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Just listen here we are again  ♫

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,670
♫  Through the fire through the rain  ♫

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,020
♫  The roads we crossed they built  ♫

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,230
♫  Story of us  ♫

26
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,220
Why did I ask?

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,440
 Editor Na Zero Won.

28
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,919
 Look here, Editor Na Zero Won.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,620
 Pardon?

30
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:46,120
 What did you just say?

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,490
 I said...

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,750
 I mean...

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,340
 Do you like me?

34
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,139
 Can I give you an answer this way?

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,700
 Sir?

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,919
 Get a grip.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,700
 I told you to drink freely, not get drunk freely.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,410
 Come on. I'm right, right?

39
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,579
 I already know!

40
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,150
 You paid for the armchair and coffee.

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,219
 You stopped me from buying drinks.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,880
 You're buying me drinks now.

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,209
 You say it's about legal matters or efficiency,

44
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,969
 but it's all an excuse.

45
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,839
 Since you like me,

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,290
 you want to treat me well, so you made excuses!

47
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,599
 Since it's all out in the open, just be honest and tell me.

48
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,680
 Like a man! Be brave!

49
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,390
 Can I really be honest?

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,129
 I did it because I took pity on you.

51
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,720
 Because you're pitiful.

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,139
 Pardon?

53
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,320
 Trembling at spending ₩10,000 ($10) while trying to save up for a house at your age,

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,089
 I felt pity for you, that's why.

55
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,289
 I was helping like I would the needy.

56
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,330
 Happy now?

57
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,000
 The needy?

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,699
 Wow, I can't believe you'd misunderstand something like that!

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,429
 I'm Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung.

60
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,809
 The last dragon of our age to rise from a ditch.

61
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,289
 Do you think I became a dragon to be with someone like you?

62
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,149
 Do you think I became self-made just to be with someone like you?

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,420
 Get a grip! Please!

64
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,320
 What do I do now?

65
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,609
I should die.

66
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,470
Die.

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,410
I can't go to work tomorrow.

68
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,119
  I shouldn't have been nice to her, no matter how pitiful she is.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,769
 Me, like Na Zero Won?

70
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,159
 Me, Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung?

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,069
 Na Zero Won who has nothing?

72
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,279
I'll turn up the volume.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,840
What a load of rubbish!

74
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,909
Oh, no.

76
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,710
I wasn't talking to you.

77
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,069
Why does my car have a taximeter?

78
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,060
What?

79
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,679
It's my car. A taxi.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,139
Taxi?

81
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,319
Aren't you the chauffeur?

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,270
I'm a taxi driver.

83
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,629
- Then what about my car? 
 - Pardon?

84
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,360
Pardon?

85
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,950
Oh, no.

86
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,419
I think I called a taxi instead of the chauffeur service.

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,279
I'm sorry, but please turn back to Itaewon.

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,090
Sure.

89
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,109
 I can't believe I made a mistake like this. I'm always perfect.

90
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,810
  But then again, she did cause huge mental damage.

91
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,889
 I'm wasting money, time, and emotions.

92
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,750
 This is all because of Na Zero Won.

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,289
 Na Zero Won. Na Zero Won.

94
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,830
Na Zero Won!

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,300
Hello, sir!

96
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,610
What a lovely morning!

97
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,219
Lovely morning? Yesterday, don't you—

98
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,990
Oh. Did you get home safe?

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,790
I blacked out. I don't remember a thing.

100
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,829
Oh, I see.

101
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,809
You did look very drunk.

102
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,290
Tell me about it!

103
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,789
I should end my drinking or my life.

104
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,319
Right. I told you I was buying you a drink,

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,409
but the bill was more than I expected.

106
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,440
I was thinking we should split it.

107
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,490
How much was it?

108
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,680
- ₩380,000 ($380). 
 - Pardon?

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,429
But we had two glasses of draft beer and six bottled beers.

110
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,909
As a snack, we had shrimp gambas.

111
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,690
The total is probably less than ₩100,000 ($100).

112
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,039
That chicken salad was on the house.

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,360
You seem to remember perfectly well.

114
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,189
It's not that you don't remember.

115
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:10,280
It's that you don't want to remember what you did yesterday.

116
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,540
I felt so embarrassed.

117
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,830
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,059
I'm sorry about yesterday too.

119
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,160
You're sorry...

120
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,009
You were out of line, and then you lied again. Do you think sorry will suffice?

121
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,759
That doesn't make what you did go away.

122
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,530
Sir?

123
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,049
The feeling of insult you left me with...

124
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,879
That won't go away with the word "sorry."

125
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,980
Got it?

126
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,150
What am I going to do?

127
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,240
Great.

128
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,859
Hello.

129
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,069
- Hi. 
 - Hello.

130
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,159
What? Did your interview end late?

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,230
You look so tired.

132
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,299
You know how it's like.

133
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,510
Yes, I know.

134
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,459
I'm also very tired.

135
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,299
So... How about a cup of sweet coffee to recharge our energy?

136
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,549
Are you buying?

137
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,750
Are you crazy?

138
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,449
The person who was supposed to buy us drinks at the popular pork ribs place,

139
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,639
but who luckily got away without buying.

140
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,919
Who is that damn lucky woman?

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,340
Her name is Na. Young. Won.

142
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,549
Editor Na should buy.

143
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,649
But!

144
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,190
No.

145
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,820
We have another financier.

146
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,320
Pardon?

147
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:49,280
Well, actually, I was going to ask Editor Na to buy coffee since she got out of it thanks to you.

148
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,370
That was my plan, but right then,

149
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,010
your wise remarks suddenly brushed past my thoughts.

150
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,929
- Wise remarks? 
 - Yes.

151
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,939
The wise remark where you said

152
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,899
it's only right that you buy the coffee to boost work efficiency.

153
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:07,749
So I've come to ask politely.

154
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,650
I did well, right?

155
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,379
What about my work efficiency?

156
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,370
Sir?

157
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,779
If I buy coffee, your team will perform well.

158
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,740
However, what about me?

159
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,439
I have the most important position in this publishing company.

160
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,800
My work efficiency will decrease.

161
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,639
What happened? What happened?

162
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,110
He said Editor Na should just buy coffee.

163
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,259
Wait, but last time...

164
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,909
Right. Last time, I bought coffee.

165
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,139
I'm deeply regretting that moment.

166
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,340
I shouldn't have wasted my money like that.

167
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,249
What's the most expensive coffee on the menu?

168
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,830
Green tea cream latte blended.

169
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,069
Anything more expensive?

170
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,090
You can upgrade the size to a large one.

171
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,320
And add Java chip sprinkles on top.

172
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,519
And add hazelnut syrup.

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,470
And get a drizzle topping.

174
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,309
And two or three shots of espresso—

175
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,699
Stop!

176
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,850
Add in everything that's available!

177
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,699
What's up with him?

178
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,419
He must really regret buying coffee last time.

179
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,829
Anyway, I'll have what he's having.

180
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,809
- Me, too. 
 - Come on.

181
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,299
Young Won doesn't have any money.

182
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,799
I'll buy.

183
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,009
It's okay, Sunbae.

184
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,809
- I'll buy. 
 - Forget it.

185
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,430
I told you I would help you save up.

186
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,890

187
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,370
 Thanks, Sunbae.

188
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,989
I'm getting a hunch.

189
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,749
What? About what?

190
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,119
I thought I lost my touch last time.

191
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,400
But now I'm sure that CEO Yoo likes you.

192
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,089
Not this again, please.

193
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,259
What do you mean?

194
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,099
Last time, he bought coffee in your place stead.

195
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,929
Today, he tells you to buy coffee.

196
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,300
What do you think he's doing?

197
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,859
He's playing tug-of-war.

198
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,360
No, he's not.

199
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,229
What do you think of him?

200
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,650
He's surly,

201
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,769
but he's not so terrible to flirt with.

202
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,039
Stop it! I told you he doesn't like me.

203
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,649
I'm telling you he does!

204
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,779
If you don't believe me, ask him yourself.

205
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,969
Ask him directly if he likes you.

206
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,129
- Ask him right— 
 - I did.

207
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,819
I asked him!

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,330
What?

209
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,720
I'm going crazy.

210
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,050

211
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,949
The client of last quarter's interior special "Change"

212
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,040
was a newly-wed couple in their thirties, living in a monthly rented house.

213
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,280
The client chosen for this quarter

214
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,519
is a single mom renting a single-room apartment.

215
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,510
Stop.

216
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,799
Change the client.

217
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,640
Sir?

218
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,539
Who would be interested in a single-room interior?

219
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,399
Changing a single room won't draw attention.

220
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,950
Change it to the vacation home I invested in.

221
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,269
Sir, but that's...

222
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,049
This special is to help out the marginalized...

223
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,740
I need to change someone else along with the client.

224
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,259
Do you mean me again?

225
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,210
Yes.

226
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:05,069
I can't work with someone who disagrees with me.

227
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,329
I'll calmly change the client.

228
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,709
I didn't buy this magazine to do charity work.

229
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,269
But if you help, you'll feel rewarded—

230
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,559
Rewarded?

231
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,129
I don't know about that.

232
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,809
There was an instance where I helped out a disadvantaged person

233
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,110
and instead of feeling rewarded, I was ridiculously misunderstood.

234
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,900
He was ridiculously misunderstood after helping out a disadvantaged person...

235
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,100
He was saying that to you, right?

236
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Now that I think about it, saying that he deeply regrets buying coffee

237
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,200
was for you to hear as well.

238
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,390
He's raking you over methodically.

239
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,049
What do I do now?

240
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,809
So why did you ask him?

241
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,540
Why get raked over by asking him if he likes you so rashly?

242
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,149
You said your hunch was right.

243
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,120
You said you were sure he liked me.

244
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,089
- You seem so foreign to me. 
 - Pardon?

245
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,160
When have you ever listened to me so well?

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,889
What are you going to do now?

247
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,360
I'm so worried about you!

248
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,760
I heard someone moved into #707.

249
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,099
Do they know what happened there?

250
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,789
If she did, she wouldn't have moved in.

251
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,150
She lives alone, on top of that.

252
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,099
What... are you talking about?

253
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,580
We'll be going now.

254
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,740
What happened in #707?

255
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,440
Nothing. It's nothing.

256
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,570
What do you mean, "nothing"? What happened?

257
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,969
 I think it was about a year ago.

258
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,369
 A woman about your age lived in #707.

259
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,810
 She committed suicide.

260
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,819
 Word got around, and no one wanted to live there.

261
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,579
 Some moved in without knowing,

262
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,819
 but they didn't last a month.

263
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,600
 They said there was a ghost.

264
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,380
Come on. There's no ghost.

265
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,690
It's the Forth Industrial Revolution era.

266
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,100
AIs park cars nowadays.

267
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,360
Ghosts aren't real.

268
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,269
 No need to thank me.

269
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,309
  I'm getting monthly rent from a spare apartment.

270
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,090
 A spare apartment?

271
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,509
He should have told me that it's spare because somebody died here and no one wants to move in!

272
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,510
No, wait.

273
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:59,080
Even if he told me,

274
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,120
I had nowhere else to go.

275
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,569
 I did it because I took pity on you.

276
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,329
 I took pity on you.

277
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,569
 I helped you like I help the needy.

278
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,480
 Got it?

279
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,279
 Help the needy?

280
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,709
What a laugh!

281
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,239
He acted like he was being generous, but he dumped this place on me

282
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,549
so he can at least get some rent.

283
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,980
Isn't that what it was?

284
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,739
No, wait.

285
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,309
At least he didn't ask for a security deposit.

286
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,230
Let's pretend I didn't hear it.

287
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,760
It's the Forth Industrial Revolution era.

288
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,010
It's the Forth Industrial Revolution era.

289
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,960
It's the Forth Industrial Revolution era...

290
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,600
It's the Forth Industrial Revolution era...

291
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,449
Was it you?

292
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,520
Was it you?

293
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,310
 Do you want to grab a late-night snack with me, Editor Na?

294
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,210
Am I going overboard when it's so late?

295
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,310
I shouldn't.

296
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,190
What? Editor Na!

297
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,599
Did someone die there?

298
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,080
Yes.

299
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,819
I couldn't stay because it feels creepy.

300
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,119
So I came out to kill time.

301
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,929
Did you confirm it with Hyung?

302
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,539
Some even saw a body being gurneyed out...

303
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,189
You knew?

304
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,389
That CEO Yoo was my landlord?

305
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,830
What?

306
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,179
Yes. By coincidence.

307
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,089
By the way, are you really going to stay here all night?

308
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,129
I'll be fine.

309
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,790
I've often spent the night outside doing photo shoots.

310
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,039
Then how about going to my second house instead?

311
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,140
Your second house?

312
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,360
What do you think about my second house?

313
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,040
It's totally amazing.

314
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,420
You've got a huge yard and an awesome river view.

315
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,239
Right?

316
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,209
It's the perfect spot to kill time.

317
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,140
You're right.

318
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,720
Looks delicious.

319
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,209
Do you want to order something?

320
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,900
Ordering take-out here is a must.

321
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,970
Not again.

322
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,360
Say poor backward.

323
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,059
But since you feel down today...

324
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,369
It might sound like nagging,

325
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,809
but you have to control impulse buying too.

326
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,339
Okay then. How about pretending?

327
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,319
- What? 
 - Here's the pizza you ordered.

328
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,600
Here's fried chicken.

329
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,320
Grilled pork belly and tteokbokki.

330
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:04,350
This luxury set menu is only ₩5,900 ($5.90).

331
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,459
Wow, Photographer Shin. You're so witty.

332
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,400
You can acknowledge that I'm controlling impulse buying now, right?

333
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,540
Totally.

334
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,079
It's a relief.

335
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,199
What is?

336
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,670
To have a partner like you.

337
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,280
If I were alone, I'd have been lonely.

338
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,080
You're such a great source of help.

339
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,160
I'm lying.

340
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,970
Pardon?

341
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,570
No, no I was telling the truth.

342
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,180
- I was shocked. 
 - I'll buy next time.

343
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,609
Okay.

344
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,010
Next time, we'll...

345
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,729
Did you hear that this place is going to be redeveloped?

346
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,319
If not, it doesn't look like you'd do a survey here.

347
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,269
I'm not here for a survey.

348
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:15,181
Sir?

349
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,869
There's someone I have to meet.

350
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,870
Did you find that woman?

351
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,370
Wait here.

352
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,180

353
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,130

354
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,320

355
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,320
What? Half-deposit?

356
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,609
How much?

357
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:08,629
I see. I'll think about it.

358
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,640
Okay.

359
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,209
What's that about a half-deposit?

360
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,389
It was my landlord.

361
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,179
He wants a half-deposit and monthly rent now.

362
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,500
Wasn't your house a luxury villa in Itaewon that was deposit-based?

363
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,340
The monthly rent will be expensive.

364
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,059
It's one million won.

365
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,179
One million won. Every month?

366
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,270
That's insane.

367
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,899
How can you live like that?

368
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,559
Why don't you just buy a place instead?

369
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:39,209
You could get a small apartment on the outskirts of Seoul with your deposit.

370
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,869
What use is that?

371
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:42,699
House prices will fall.

372
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,029
Never mind that. How about a unit in my apartment complex?

373
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,819
It's waiting to be redeveloped, so the deposit is really cheap.

374
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,089
Forget it.

375
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,469
I'd rather die than live in a rotting apartment.

376
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,859
How can a person live in a place that could collapse at any moment?

377
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,620
Stop. Shut up.

378
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,170
How can a person...

379
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,500
Fine. I'm not even a person.

380
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,269
- Happy? 
 - No.

381
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:09,560
That's not what I meant...

382
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,780
That redevelopment better happen soon

383
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,159
because I'm not considered a person now.

384
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,570
It's so sad that I can't live!

385
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,710
- Chief Editor... 
 - Let go!

386
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,570
I said that's not what I meant!

387
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,110
Hey. What do you want to eat?

388
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,119
How can you think about eating right now?

389
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,769
The apartment you leased to Editor Na...

390
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,250
Is it true a former female tenant committed suicide there?

391
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,119
Did Editor Na say that?

392
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,609
Where did she hear that?

393
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:52,109
Is it true?

394
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,569
Let's not talk about that place. I don't even want to think about it.

395
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,829
Why?

396
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:59,210
What happened?

397
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,870
That woman died because of me.

398
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,529
What? Did someone die there?

399
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,130
Yes.

400
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,349
He passed that on to you and said he helped you out of pity?

401
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:18,830
Pretending to be kind when he's just calculating?

402
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,469
That pisses me off.

403
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:22,579
Go confront him.

404
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,679
How can I?

405
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,919
I don't have anywhere else to go.

406
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,779
I'm not telling you to move out.

407
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,989
Ask for a discount on the monthly rent.

408
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:32,559
Go confront him!

409
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,309
Even a homeless person can get angry if covered with a poop-stained newspaper!

410
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,860
And a beggar can bite if you give them dog food!

411
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,999
Show him what you can do!

412
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,580
Pardon?

413
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,689
It's just a figure of speech.

414
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,710
Anyway, go confront him.

415
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,089
Forget it.

416
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,410
This is frustrating.

417
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,399
By the way...

418
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,329
Aren't you scared?

419
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,779
I know a good psychic.

420
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,239
Want a talisman?

421
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,640
No, it's okay.

422
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,979
Everything was fine until now.

423
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:08,120
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

424
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,129
Okay...

425
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,550
Housing really is the problem.

426
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,310
For either one of us.

427
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,690
What do you mean?

428
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,969
Editor Yeo.

429
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,089
Did you call the interior client?

430
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,019
- The single mom. 
 - Yes.

431
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,099
I called her as soon as yesterday's meeting was over.

432
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,079
She said it was okay, but I could tell she was disappointed.

433
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,809
I felt really bad.

434
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,840
Yes... It was a harsh thing to do.

435
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,940
Did you call for me?

436
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,069
The vacation home interview is set for tomorrow.

437
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,570
Yes, sir.

438
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,180
But sir...

439
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,869
About the original client...

440
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:53,811
Yes?

441
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:57,479
She's a single mom with a 4-year-old kid.

442
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,179
The single room they live in seems to be in very poor condition.

443
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,689
So... Can we do two interior examples this quarter...?

444
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:09,090
I've made my decision.

445
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,809
Was that decision made because of me?

446
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:16,419
Do you think I can't draw a line between work and private matters?

447
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,150
No, sir.

448
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,889
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:22,409
But I am a bit scared.

450
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:24,060
Sir?

451
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,069
I'm scared to help someone now.

452
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,439
I worry that people might mistake my pure intention for something else.

453
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:33,850
I've been traumatized, you could say.

454
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,899
 Go confront him!

455
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:39,669
  Even a homeless person can get angry if covered with a poop-stained newspaper!

456
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,259
 And a beggar can bite if you give them dog food!

457
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,980
  Show him what you can do!

458
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,150
Never mind. Get out there and—

459
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,239
Your intention wasn't totally pure when you helped me!

460
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,200
What?

461
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:52,000
#707.

462
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,369
I heard all about it.

463
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:54,969
Why didn't you tell me?

464
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:58,239
Did you worry I might not live there when you had to get rent out of it?

465
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,840
Is that why you didn't tell me?

466
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,379
If I had told you, would you not have lived there?

467
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:11,170
Well, I still might have, but I would've asked for a discount on rent!

468
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,859
So I want to ask you.

469
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,619
Give me a discount on the rent.

470
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,469
No. I won't receive rent at all.

471
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:22,160
What?

472
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,429
If you go that far, it'll make me feel a little...

473
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:28,249
Just move out.

474
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:28,971
Sir?

475
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:30,899
I have no intention of giving a discount on rent.

476
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,810
So just move out of that apartment.

477
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,140
Sure.

478
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,509
That's a relief!

479
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:44,189
I had no intention of living in that creepy place.

480
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:45,409
Fine!

481
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:50,010
But give me some time to get a new place.

482
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,980
Satisfied?

483
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,790
What?

484
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,769
Pure intention?

485
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,570
What a laugh!

486
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,410
Do you think I won't move out if you tell me to?

487
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,560
How annoying!

488
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,850
Hello?

489
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,580

490
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,409
What did you want to talk about?

491
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,119
Oh, well...

492
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,079
It's about #707...

493
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,049
 That woman died because of me.

494
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,001
 What?

495
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:34,019
 A ridiculous rumor spread.

496
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,020
 But it's far from the truth.

497
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,539
  The woman in #707 was addicted to online gambling.

498
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:44,610
 She was a nightmare of a tenant who was behind in rent for months.

499
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,380
 Hyung was finally going to evict her.

500
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,760

501
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,759
  She bore a grudge and staged a suicide

502
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,490
  so the value of the apartment would drop.

503
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,440
  That's why a rumor spread that someone died there.

504
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,629
  She disappeared, and the police are still looking for her.

505
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:17,100
 Hyung also seems to be privately looking for her.

506
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,759
He said he's not worried because it's a false rumor.

507
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,069
But how can he not be worried?

508
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,409
- Oh, no. What should I do? 
 - Pardon?

509
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,830
Oh, no. This is a disaster.

510
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,760

511
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,459
- Good job. 
 - Good job.

512
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,339
When are you keeping your promise to buy drinks?

513
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:42,441
How about today?

514
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:44,449
I have to meet up with my cutie pie today.

515
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:46,679
Yes, I've thought about it.

516
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,589
I'll do the half-deposit and pay a monthly rent.

517
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,950
Okay.

518
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,259
Are you really going to pay that expensive rent?

519
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:54,969
Yes. I can't be bothered looking for a new place.

520
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,719
And I spent my own money renovating that place

521
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,509
two years ago when I first moved in.

522
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,321
It would be such a waste to move out now.

523
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,329
So why waste your own money on someone else's place?

524
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:04,390
Why do you think?

525
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,699
It's my work ethic.

526
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:09,439
- No way. 
 - I'm an interior design article editor.

527
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,499
- I can't live in a dump. 
 - Sheesh.

528
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,439
But most of all, I like my place so much.

529
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:17,919
There are many good restaurants, pubs, and clubs.

530
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,049
Hot places are my style. You know that.

531
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,580
All the more reason you should move.

532
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,079
You go to restaurants, pubs, and clubs,

533
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,369
and pay an expensive rent.

534
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,180
How can you manage that?

535
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,459
I don't know. It'll work out somehow!

536
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,949
Anyway, I've made my decision.

537
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,400
It's done, so don't nag at me.

538
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,689
Does she work two jobs?

539
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,420
She earns the same as me.

540
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,530
How can she have no worries about money?

541
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,930
Maybe she just didn't tell us that she's actually from a very rich family.

542
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,769
I don't think so.

543
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:52,680
Right?

544
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,599
She has no wealthy vibe in her bones.

545
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,840
She could be dating a really rich guy.

546
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,769
Let's say you're a rich guy.

547
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,909
- Would you date her? 
 - Heck no.

548
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,110
My point exactly.

549
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,369
Then how can she spend so much money all the time?

550
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,640
She's living as if there's no tomorrow.

551
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,769
Getting loans and using several credit cards.

552
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,280
Since we're talking about money,

553
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,649
I want to say how frugal my cutie pie is.

554
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,830
She's a hotshot teacher at a private academy,

555
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,940
but she doesn't even own a car...

556
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,640
He's gone.

557
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,610

558
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,380
Sir! Sir!

559
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,719
What is it now?

560
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,789
I heard about #707 from Photographer Shin.

561
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:51,009
I didn't check the facts again and rashly judged you.

562
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,049
I'm sorry.

563
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,710
You insulted me twice. Sorry doesn't cut it.

564
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,179
It wasn't enough that you arrogantly thought I liked you,

565
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:03,189
you even accused me of being a shameless man who only cares about rent?

566
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:05,700
Do you think "sorry" fixes everything?

567
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,079
How low will you drag me down to be satisfied?

568
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,460
I'm really sorry.

569
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,420
Move.

570
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,230
What are you looking at?

571
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,919
Are you researching for your shoot tonight?

572
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,019
No, I already finished that.

573
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,570
I'm researching something else.

574
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,440
Something else?

575
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:48,389
F/W fashion that will give my style an edge.

576
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,549
There are so many new items in this month's fashion magazines.

577
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,300
Wake up and smell the coffee.

578
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,909
You pay expensive rent and also go shopping?

579
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,269
Were you born to just spend money?

580
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,499
It's not your money, so back off.

581
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,779
I'm so worried about who'll marry you.

582
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,540
It won't be you, so back off.

583
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,590
Editor Yeo. You have to think about your future.

584
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,799
- Dad! 
 - What the?

585
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,359
Are you my dad?

586
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,350
Worry about your housing subscription, Dad.

587
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,870
Why, I ought to...

588
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,499
Whatever.

589
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,340
The housing problem will work out.

590
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,370
But the CEO problem won't.

591
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,560
Will he ever forgive me?

592
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,990
Just die.

593
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,030
- Should I quit my job? 
  - Stop!

594
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,989
 Are you giving up on owning a home?

595
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,599
 How can you quit your job?

596
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,190
I'm not in a position to think of owning a home.

597
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,189
I feel so bad that I can't face him.

598
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,189
 This all happened because you don't own a home.

599
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,070
What?

600
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:05,689
 If you had a home,

601
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,779
 you wouldn't have received pity

602
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,679
 and you wouldn't have come to live here.

603
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,909
 Then you wouldn't have been swept up in that rumor.

604
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,599
That's true, but...

605
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,539
 Don't think about anything else.

606
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,120
 Strive to buy your own house.

607
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,870

608
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:27,289
 An effective way to gather seed money is by splitting bank accounts.

609
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:30,060
 Split your bank account according to use.

610
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,939
 When you get your paycheck,

611
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,349
 send 50% of it to your "Seed money" account.

612
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,359
 Don't ever touch it until you reach your goal.

613
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,509
 Second! "Living expenses" account!

614
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,999
 Wire 30% of your paycheck there.

615
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,229
 Third! An account for me!

616
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,159
 Wire the remaining 20% to it.

617
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,479
An account for me?

618
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,540
 It's a gift to yourself as you'd be worn out from saving up.

619
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,639
 Come up with a name for it yourself.

620
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,739
 For example,

621
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,819
 something you wanted to learn or a travel destination...

622
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,390
 The more specific, the better.

623
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,840
What am I doing? I don't have time for this.

624
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,920
 Sir, I'm so sorry.

625
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,310
 I'm really sorry.

626
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,719
 I'm sincerely sorry.

627
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,610
 I'm so so sorry. Please forgive me...

628
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,650
 I'm truly sorry.

629
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,650
 It was wrong of me to do so. Please forgive me.

630
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,680
 I'm sorry. Please stop being angry.

631
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,680
I guess she's truly sorry.

632
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,340
I should forgive her now—

633
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,949
  I'm splitting my bank account to gather seed money starting today.

634
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,969
  Hello. (in Thai)

635
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,770
Pu Phat? 
 (T/N: Account Pu Phat Pong Curry (crab curry) that you'd eat in Bangkok)

636
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,030
Does a truly sorry person think about pu phat?

637
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,919
If she was truly sorry, she'd be refusing food.

638
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,089
Not think about eating pu phat pong curry.

639
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,330
Wow, she almost fooled me!

640
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,380
I was almost fooled!

641
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,679
She's a scary woman.

642
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,750
She makes me shudder in horror. Seriously.

643
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,850

644
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,810

645
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,240

646
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,539
Sir.

647
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,740
Hello.

648
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,500
 Yeah, I wouldn't want to see me either.

649
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,490
Where's Jang Chan?

650
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,210
You ask about him now?

651
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,629
He has intestinal inflammation.

652
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,949
I told him to rest.

653
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,540
Will you be okay without an assistant?

654
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,059
Of course. If you help me.

655
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,839
Why would I? Get the person in the back to help.

656
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,730
Right?

657
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,600
Why aren't you answering...

658
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,329
She's asleep.

659
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,440
She must be tired. Let's be quiet.

660
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,470
Unbelievable.

661
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,460

662
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,789
Let's stop here for a while.

663
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,820
Get out quietly.

664
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,150
Hyung!

665
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,810
Have we already arrived?

666
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,559
Does this look like the destination?

667
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,690
Are we covering a service area today?

668
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,160
I'm sorry. I'm not quite clear-headed.

669
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,249
How can you sleep?

670
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,870
Are you sure you're repentant?

671
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,040
Stop it.

672
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,859
If you were truly sorry, you'd have a kink in the neck from apologizing, not sleeping.

673
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:12,889
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,919
I don't know.

675
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,399
I don't feel an ounce of sincerity from that apology.

676
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,109
Are you sure you're not just saying that while thinking about something else?

677
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,339
Come on! Let's go get coffee.

678
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,380
Come on!

679
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,159
I deserved that.

680
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,970
How can I sleep in this situation?

681
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,130
#707.

682
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,530
It's because Editor Na believed the rumor and misunderstood you, right?

683
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,660
Don't be petty like that.

684
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,619
You don't know how she makes me shudder in horror.

685
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,599
You make me shudder in horror.

686
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,360
Stop it.

687
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,769
Hi, Chan. How do you feel?

688
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,360
Are you okay?

689
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,239
You really have no idea how scary she is.

690
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,140
How terrifying she is!

691
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,479
Wait. Stop.

692
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,839
Why am I so worked up?

693
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,290
No matter how angry I get, she doesn't feel sorry.

694
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,469
 That's right. She's not worth my anger.

695
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:30,989
 It's a waste of emotions.

696
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,760
 Now I'll stop caring.

697
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,380
An article that flatters the vacation home's interior design.

698
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,020
An article that makes you want to come here.

699
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,759
Focus on writing an article that makes money.

700
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,820
Yes, sir.

701
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:09,140
  ]

702
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,750
Looks ordinary.

703
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,330
What?

704
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,729
- Oh, my gosh! Awesome. 
 - This is incredible!

705
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,620
- I've never seen anything like this! 
 - Me neither.

706
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,600
Awesome.

707
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,459
You look really tired.

708
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:13,039
Were you unable to sleep because of Hyung?

709
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,470
Well... I just felt so bad.

710
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,069
And I feel uneasy about having to move too.

711
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:20,169
What? Move?

712
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,019
Did he tell you to move out?

713
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,999
That's a new low.

714
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,129
Oh, no. It was my fault.

715
00:40:27,129 --> 00:40:29,630
Don't worry about it.

716
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,769
Chestnuts!

717
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,889
There's a chestnut tree here.

718
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:40,010
- They're ripe. 
 - Indeed.

719
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,389
My vacation house is eastward, so the view is amazing at sunrise.

720
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:48,309
How about spending the night and capturing the sunrise as well?

721
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,519
Oh, well...

722
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,719
I'll ask my photographer.

723
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,130
Oh, thank you!

724
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,469
Cracking chestnuts?

725
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:07,119
She stabs me in the back, then wastes time cracking chestnuts instead of working?

726
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,210
 No. Stop.

727
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,059
 I've decided to stop minding her.

728
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:14,219
 I'm Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung.

729
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:18,850
  I haven't become a dragon to waste emotions on the likes of her.

730
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,569
- Are you really repentant? 
 - Sir?

731
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:38,049
If you were sorry, you'd be focusing on working hard with the same determination you have

732
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:40,101
for cracking chestnuts.

733
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:42,749
- Oh, it's not that, it's— 
 - What do you mean?

734
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:44,299
Are you here to play around?

735
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,009
Why aren't you working?

736
00:41:46,009 --> 00:41:48,360
She is working.

737
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,309
What?

738
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:54,769
She said it'd look great with cracked chestnuts outside,

739
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:59,419
and I agreed with her, so she's cracking chestnuts.

740
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,029
Why didn't you say something instead of making me feel awkward!

741
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:08,739
I was going to, but you cut me off...

742
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:12,200
You should've talked more quickly then.

743
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,369
He's being really unreasonable.

744
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:22,710
Just ignore him.

745
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,770
Okay.

746
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:34,240
He probably wants to be unreasonable so that he can tell me off some more.

747
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,970
Since I was in the wrong.

748
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,819
Jeez! How humiliating!

749
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,129
Now I've really got to stop!

750
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:53,259
I don't care whether she cracks chestnuts,

751
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:56,230
cracks jokes or cracks her back. I'm going to stop.

752
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,809
Oh, okay.

753
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:05,770
I'll give the advertorial material to Editor Yeo.

754
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,379
What? Wait. Has Editor Yeo gone out to cover a story? Why's she not in all day?

755
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,539
Oh. she did a shoot all night and took today off.

756
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,669
Oh, right. She told me.

757
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,559
If it's urgent, should I contact her?

758
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:18,859
Oh, no, it's okay.

759
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,389
If you need to give her something,

760
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,419
I can run by her house.

761
00:43:22,419 --> 00:43:24,970
No, it's okay.

762
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,199
Wow, now I see

763
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,079
Mi Ra really is very passionate.

764
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,099
You'll become an excellent editor soon.

765
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:34,899
Thank you. I'll work harder.

766
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:37,169
Good, good.

767
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:39,029
Oh, and Joo Hee. Work harder.

768
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:41,759
If you want to be an excellent editor.

769
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:44,519
I don't want to be an excellent editor.

770
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:46,169
I'm going to be an ordinary editor.

771
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:47,569
Really?

772
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,539
Okay, then.

773
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,860
Keeping it real.

774
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,330
Oh, I slept well.

775
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,879
How can I leave this great place?

776
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:15,819
I can't leave no matter how expensive it gets.

777
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,039
Hello?

778
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,269
Hotel Mitchell at seven?

779
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:30,030
Okay. See you then.

780
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,860
You should've left. You have work tomorrow.

781
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,730
Isn't it uncomfortable being with Hyung?

782
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,999
I want to make it up to him so he won't be angry anymore.

783
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:03,580
He's so petty.

784
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,059
What kind of food does he like?

785
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:07,199
What?

786
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,759
Won't he be less angry if I make him his favorite food?

787
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,019
You don't have to do that.

788
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,190
He'll get over it.

789
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,420
I just feel so bad, that's all.

790
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,000
So? What does he like?

791
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,109
What? She's laughing?

792
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:37,520
If she was sorry, she'd be crying, not laughing.

793
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:38,809
Not again!

794
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:40,459
Yoo Ja Sung! Stop!

795
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:42,630
Stop!

796
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,799
I made it with great care but I can't guarantee the taste.

797
00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:55,169
Looks delicious. Try it.

798
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,619
No. You eat it all.

799
00:45:57,619 --> 00:45:59,789
Come on. Consider her effort.

800
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:01,389
Try some.

801
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:04,030
- Come on! 
 - Are you okay?

802
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,939
I said I'm not eating. Why make kimchi stew and cause this mess?

803
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,599
I spilled it. Why take it out on her?

804
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,779
If she hadn't made it, you wouldn't have spilled it.

805
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:19,619
I told you to go, but you insisted on staying.

806
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,639
Did you stay to eat kimchi stew?

807
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:24,169
Is food all that you think about even now?

808
00:46:24,169 --> 00:46:26,249
Seriously! How can you say that?

809
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:28,230
Stop it.

810
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,390
I'll go wash my hands.

811
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,379
Come on, Hyung!

812
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,250
What?

813
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,890
I don't want to waste emotions either.

814
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:51,390
Yes... I deserved...

815
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,719
What a load of crap!

816
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,779
I've had it!

817
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,949
He maxed out! I'm going to...

818
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,329
 Hold back.

819
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:01,809
 Look at this bank book that will get you a house and hold back.

820
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:04,669
No, I can't.

821
00:47:04,669 --> 00:47:07,029
This isn't the only magazine publisher in Korea that will hire me!

822
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:09,219
 You're not guaranteed employment.

823
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:11,269
 How will you live until then?

824
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:14,019
 Look at this bank book that will help you survive and hold back.

825
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:15,779
No.

826
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:18,759
If I work part-time, I won't starve.

827
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:22,450
 Then what about pu phat pong curry in Bangkok?

828
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,779
I don't have to eat pu phat pong curry.

829
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:27,939
Forget it!

830
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:31,159
 Is your will that weak?

831
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,269
 To save up, you skipped coffee.

832
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:37,049
 You ate at convenience stores and made a ₩10,000 calendar.

833
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:39,500
 Won't that go to waste?

834
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,520
 Hold back.

835
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,330

836
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,419
Tone it down already.

837
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:53,929
You tone it down.

838
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:57,380
You seem to be getting overly concerned about Editor Na these days.

839
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,679
Whatever.

840
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:02,940
Fine. I see why you're concerned.

841
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,169
What?

842
00:48:05,169 --> 00:48:08,859
You must take pity on her, too.

843
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:11,179
At her age, not having anything of her own,

844
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,759
you must feel sorry.

845
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:14,249
It's not like that.

846
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,990
What do you mean it's not like that? I know what a softy you are.

847
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:21,289
Anyway, don't keep being nice to her out of pity.

848
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:24,530
She'll stab you in the back.

849
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,629
You really hold on to a grudge.

850
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,240
Stop.

851
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,470
Yes, Secretary Hwang?

852
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,740
Okay. I got it.

853
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,839
You really won't buy the place we saw last time?

854
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,869
If you don't, he's giving it to someone else.

855
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:44,019
- I'll buy it. Draw up the contract now. 
 - Really?

856
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:47,201
I'm going to buy it and let Editor Na live there for free.

857
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:49,999
- What? 
 - I heard you told her to move out.

858
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,569
Even if you're angry,

859
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:54,900
how can you be so harsh to someone who has nowhere to go?

860
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,139
Hey, Shin Gyeom. When will you grow up?

861
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,649
Your parents aren't trying to buy you that house to run a charity!

862
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:02,789
With that kind of weak mindset,

863
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:05,669
how will you take over your dad's multi-billion business?!

864
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:08,589
I told you I'm not going to take over my dad's business!

865
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:11,980
- Are you seriously... 
 - What did you just say?

866
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,849
Photographer Shin's family is...

867
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,080
Editor Na, I can explain.

868
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,639
What the?

869
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,070
What's up with her all of a sudden?

870
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,419
  Since I've lived longer than you, I'll say one thing.

871
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:50,611
 Say the word "poor" backward.

872
00:49:50,611 --> 00:49:55,320
-  Family in turmoil. 
 - Right. You can become poor in an instant.

873
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,179
  Do you want to become convenience store mates?

874
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,650
 Per your advice, I'm saving up, too.

875
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,939
 I'm grateful. To have a partner like you.

876
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,449
 If I were alone, I'd have been lonely.

877
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:13,240
 You're such great help.

878
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,009
Editor Na, I can explain.

879
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:34,890
I'll leave ahead of you.

880
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:36,990
I'm sorry.

881
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,789
Please don't be mad.

882
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,920
I'm not leaving because I'm angry.

883
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,239
It's because I'm humiliated.

884
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,330
What do you mean?

885
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,789
You're from a rich family who was born with a gold spoon in his mouth.

886
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,709
Yet, I lectured you and gave you advice on saving money.

887
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:57,280
So I'm mortified.

888
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,240
I'm sorry.

889
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,159
But I wasn't trying to deceive you.

890
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,910
Then why didn't you say something?

891
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:08,229
I was desperate. Was it amusing to you?

892
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:11,299
I thought we were partners,

893
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,990
but did you think of me as entertainment?

894
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,889
- No, that's not it... 
 - If that's not it,

895
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:19,819
why did you go along with my "save money" crap?

896
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:21,359
"Let's target 1+1 items."

897
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,940
"Let's be convenience store mates."

898
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,379
Why did you act pathetic with me?

899
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,260
 Probably because he took pity on you.

900
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,379
How could he tell someone who was struggling to save up at your age

901
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,070
that he doesn't have to worry about that kind of stuff?

902
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,859
That he's from a rich family?

903
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:37,229
He probably didn't want you to feel deprived by being honest.

904
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,799
He's nice like that.

905
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,310
Hyung!

906
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,600
I'm sorry.

907
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,909
What I did was wrong.

908
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,779
Why apologize? You didn't do anything.

909
00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:49,229
The person who misunderstood is at fault.

910
00:51:49,229 --> 00:51:51,759
Is misunderstanding a hobby of yours?

911
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:52,940
Pardon?

912
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,280
And after doing that, you don't even sincerely feel sorry.

913
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,520
That's enough.

914
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,110
Go. Go inside.

915
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,539
I told you not to be nice to her.

916
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:08,139
Even if you are nice to her, she'll misunderstand your intent completely.

917
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:10,600
Then she'll stab you in the back without remorse.

918
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,689
She's a scary woman!

919
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,060
I said that's enough!

920
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,930
Are you alright?

921
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,340
- Ouch! 
 - Editor Na!

922
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,259
The landlord wants a half-deposit.

923
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:32,899
Really? Do you need anything else?

924
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,160
- Well... 
 - Hang on.

925
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,140
Hi, Honey.

926
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,990
What do you mean? I'm at work.

927
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,900
 Are you insane?

928
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,529
 Taking a cab to Seoul at this hour when they charge extra?

929
00:52:57,529 --> 00:52:59,190
Back off.

930
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,719
You want to show up at a time like this?

931
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:05,080
I don't want to see that face right now.

932
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,449
 Do you want to be poor?

933
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:11,139
I know. I know!

934
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,990
Beg or starve, it'll be my life!

935
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,829
So go away!

936
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:18,920
Don't ever show up in front of me again!

937
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,500

938
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,409
Sir! Can you drop me off over there?

939
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,320
Okay.

940
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,450
Na Zero Won is insane.

941
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,720
If not, how could she...

942
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,360
Ouch, that stings.

943
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,600
Seriously! Who is she that I keep...

944
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,289
How could I not waste my emotions?!

945
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,809
How dare she push her CEO?

946
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,200
On chestnuts?!

947
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,930
Where's Editor Na Zero Won?

948
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,830
She left.

949
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,330
I can't believe how shameless she is.

950
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,599
When she's the one at fault.

951
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,139
She was so worried about you that she couldn't sleep a wink.

952
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:11,709
Did she tell you that?

953
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:13,409
You're really clueless.

954
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:14,429
You know nothing.

955
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:17,199
The reason she didn't go home earlier was because of you.

956
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,569
She wanted to make it up to you, so she stayed behind.

957
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:21,539
Why are you saying something so ridiculous now?

958
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,799
She asked what kind of food you liked.

959
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,749
She cooked kimchi stew because of you.

960
00:54:26,749 --> 00:54:28,249
What?

961
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,130
Seriously.

962
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:31,689
She made me promise not to tell you since it would seem like she was showing off,

963
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,559
but I think you should know.

964
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,180
You should know how truly sorry she is. You need to know.

965
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:50,640
Hello?

966
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:52,039
Hello, sir.

967
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,389
It's me.

968
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,709
I was wondering if you knew.

969
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,030
Knew what?

970
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,340
Oh, the woman living in #707...

971
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,239
 I heard she killed herself because of CEO Yoo.

972
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:05,649
 What did he do that she killed herself?

973
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,629
 He's a nasty man who only thinks about money.

974
00:55:08,629 --> 00:55:10,709
 She did a lot to resolve the misunderstanding

975
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,719
 about you and the former tenant.

976
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,280
 Hello. I'm the tenant living in #707.

977
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,859
 I am writing this to clear up the rumor regarding #707.

978
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:26,170
  The rumor that a former tenant killed herself here is indisputably false.

979
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:30,050
  She put that up all night on every door.

980
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:34,069
  She felt bad and didn't sleep a wink.

981
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:35,199
 How can you sleep?

982
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,809
 Are you sure you're repentant?

983
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,209
 She stayed behind because of you.

984
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:41,189
 She wanted to make it up to you.

985
00:55:41,189 --> 00:55:42,869
 I told you to go, but you insisted on staying.

986
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:45,840
 Did you stay to eat kimchi stew?

987
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,110

988
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:06,180

989
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,819
 How was today's cover?

990
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:16,519
 How amazing is the interior design that CEO Yoo is so confident about it?

991
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:17,950
 Send me photos.

992
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:24,070
♫  Feels like it’s embracing me  ♫

993
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,300
♫  Things didn’t go my way today  ♫

994
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,830
 A thought suddenly occurred to me.

995
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:34,349
 If I could renovate my life

996
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,620
 as you'd renovates your place...

997
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,950
♫  With easy sighs  ♫

998
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,610
♫  When I try to act like I’m OK and smile  ♫

999
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:52,180
 If I could get rid of the things that went wrong...

1000
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,480
♫  Feels like tomorrow will be better  ♫

1001
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:02,910

1002
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,960
 If I could fix my life

1003
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,250
 like fixing broken parts...

1004
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:18,880
 If I could do it over like painting over walls...

1005
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,210
 Just like interior designs that have a before and after,

1006
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,969
 if my life that seems stuck at "before"

1007
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:29,760
 could turn into the glamorous "after," that'd be great.

1008
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,320
♫  Thank you for getting through this lonely day  ♫

1009
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:41,760
♫  Let’s let go of this day that has passed  ♫

1010
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,120
Editor Na Zero Won.

1011
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,009
I'm on my way to Seoul on business.

1012
00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:53,840
It's a coincidence we met.

1013
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,460
Yes. You can be on your way now.

1014
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:02,380
I think buses stopped running. Just get in.

1015
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,339
It's okay. I'll go on my own.

1016
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,229
If you get in now,

1017
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:09,560
I'll forget you pushed me into a chestnut burr.

1018
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,520
If not, I'll press charges.

1019
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,570
I went too far earlier.

1020
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:38,709
I'm sorry.

1021
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,370
What?

1022
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,750
Oh, well, I'm sorry, too.

1023
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,230
How is your bottom?

1024
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,910
Since we were both in the wrong, let's call it even and wipe the slate clean.

1025
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,069
You don't have to move out either.

1026
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:56,279
What?

1027
00:58:56,279 --> 00:59:00,789
You don't have to move out of #707.

1028
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:02,329
Thank you.

1029
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:04,569
No need to thank me.

1030
00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:08,989
I'm getting rent from a spare apartment.

1031
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,220
In any case,

1032
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,679
how could you run off like that? It's late.

1033
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,780
What if I hadn't driven by?

1034
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:29,440
Look here, Editor Na Zero...

1035
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:34,819
 She was so worried about you that she couldn't sleep a wink.

1036
00:59:34,819 --> 00:59:39,760
  She put that up all night on every door.

1037
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:55,500
♫  I like the bright mornings  ♫

1038
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,540
♫  You like the starry nights  ♫

1039
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,180
♫  We’re so different  ♫

1040
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:09,350
♫  Like putting one ice cube in an americano  ♫

1041
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:14,530
♫  Our first encounter was lukewarm  ♫

1042
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:19,950
♫  We’re so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

1043
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,190
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

1044
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:27,120
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

1045
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,590
♫  You know this too  ♫

1046
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:36,570
♫  This isn’t a dream  ♫

1047
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:41,900
♫  But I started thinking about you   ♫

1048
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,040
♫  You’ve come into my head  ♫

1049
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,180
♫  Even the way you look at me  ♫

1050
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:52,730
♫  Can’t takе my eyes off you  ♫

1051
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:58,250
♫  We’rе so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

1052
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:03,690
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

1053
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,690
♫  You seemed so uptight  ♫

1054
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:10,750
♫  But I’m imagining  ♫

1055
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,400
♫  You becoming mine  ♫

1056
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,350
Who are you?

1057
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,330
I'm CEO Yoo Ja Sung of Monthly Magazine Home.

1058
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:36,069
You requested a renovation for the interior special article "Change," right?

1059
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:39,650
Yes. What brings you here?

1060
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,450

1061
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,770

~ Preview ~

1062
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:53,539
 How about a feature story of you in the next issue?

1063
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:55,420
 You'll have to write well.

1064
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,340
 There's no material to write a feature story.

1065
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,159
 Since I won an award, I'll buy drinks.

1066
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,000
 I have to go to a funeral.

1067
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,430
 It's not Monthly Magazine Home. It's Monthly Magazine Hell.

1068
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,569
 CEO Yoo isn't as bad as you think.

1069
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:11,949
 Give him a round of applause.

1070
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,340
 I compliment you.

1071
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,819
 With just one compliment... They're so simple.

1072
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,719
 You really are a good person.

1073
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,330
 I wanted to compliment you.

1074
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,370
