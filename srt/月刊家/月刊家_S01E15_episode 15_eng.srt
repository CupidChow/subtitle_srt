1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,470

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,160

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,870

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,390

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,380

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,260

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,130

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,560

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,220

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,960

11
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,933
Listen, Ja Sung.

12
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:16,099
Is there something wrong with your car?

13
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:18,632
You seem to be going very slowly.

14
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:22,199
I wish I could go even slower.

15
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:25,233
Because I want to be with you longer.

16
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,264
What?

17
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:28,233
That's why I'm asking, but...

18
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:30,700
Can...

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,132
...I have ramen at your place before I go?

20
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:35,199
Ramen?

21
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,531
Oh, you see.

22
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,465
I'm sorry if that came as a surprise.

23
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,365
I'm such a relationship newbie.

24
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:46,599
I searched on the internet and learned other couples do that.

25
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,932
How about a drink instead?

26
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:55,932
What?

27
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:59,266
My mom cooked a lot of food before she left.

28
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,600
We can eat that as snacks.

29
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,780

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,530

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,690
♫  I know that warm feeling  ♫

32
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,960
♫  Of someone quietly holding me  ♫

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,400
♫  You quietly waited for me  ♫

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,230
♫  Always in the same spot  ♫

35
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,230
♫  I feel like I’m home  ♫

36
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,820
 I like that my life revolves around you.

37
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,970
♫  Here I am  ♫

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,460
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,020
♫  You can take your time  ♫

40
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,560
♫  Everything  ♫

41
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,480
 I like wasting my life on you.

42
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,470
♫  I could tell we feel the same  ♫

43
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,850
♫  Always, cozily  ♫

44
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,460
♫  Hold me like that time  ♫

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,730
♫  Here I am  ♫

46
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,230
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

47
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,566
 I hope everyone in the world will give up on you.

48
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:10,210
 Then, I'll be the only one holding you.

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,460
♫  Here I am  ♫

50
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,880
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,560
♫  You can take your time  ♫

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,960
♫  Everything is just fine  ♫

53
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,610

54
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,930

55
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,899
With the concept of "A House Built For Me,"

56
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,964
I will interview people who built their own houses.

57
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,733
Oh, sounds great.

58
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,466
- Did you recruit the source? 
 - Yes.

59
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,300
Okay.

60
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,298
Oh, it's the digital team.

61
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:49,765
- It's an important call. 
 - Go ahead.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,098
Hello, Team Leader. Yes.

63
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:55,864
Let's review the material until the chief editor returns.

64
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,400
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:26,865
Yes. Bye.

66
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:46,098
Then carry out with the advertorial as planned.

67
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,131
That will be all.

68
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,933
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

69
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,899
Here's this month's operating expenses statement.

70
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,499
Okay. Leave it there.

71
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,866
May I have a word with you?

72
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:17,132
Okay.

73
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,966
Sir,

74
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,299
what do you think about in-house dating?

75
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,366
What?

76
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,765
What are you talking about?

77
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:37,266
Actually, I witnessed a couple dating at work.

78
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,132
What?

79
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:42,599
I just saw two people be touchy-feely with each other

80
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:45,399
in the conference room.

81
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,631
How did you...?

82
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:48,064
I'm Choi Go!

83
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:53,199
I don't have much, but I have the sharpest eyes.

84
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,565
I guess you do.

85
00:06:56,565 --> 00:07:00,232
I had no idea you would notice it.

86
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,164
It's not appropriate during meetings,

87
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:04,533
but strong feelings are hard to control...

88
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,666
Those two...

89
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,665
We shouldn't let this slide.

90
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,266
What?

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,099
Did you notice it; too, sir?

92
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:18,933
About Editor Nam and Editor Yeo.

93
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:56,633
I actually knew a few days ago.

94
00:07:56,633 --> 00:08:01,266
But I couldn't take it anymore seeing them like that in the conference room.

95
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,132
They probably lost all reason because of strong feelings for each other.

96
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:06,866
You said dating made life fun.

97
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,266
You strongly encouraged me to date.

98
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:12,799
I meant dating outside the office.

99
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,833
There's a sea of men and women out there.

100
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:17,964
Why date someone in this small office?

101
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,666
You demanded we keep personal issues

102
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,999
out of our professional lives many times!

103
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,467
Aren't I right?

104
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,264
I don't mind dating in the workplace.

105
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:27,366
As long as they do their jobs.

106
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,965
But it does interfere with their ability to do their jobs!

107
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:32,432
You saw it, too, sir.

108
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:33,832
Let's mind our own business.

109
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,131
They'll handle it on their own.

110
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,832
What?

111
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:41,999
It's unlike you to be so lenient.

112
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:47,164
Have you given up on everything because you feel no joy in life?

113
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:48,532
What?

114
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,532
The old you would've lost your temper

115
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:54,334
because they weren't focusing on their work.

116
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,799
You are so spiritless with no desire for life,

117
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,800
but those two are all lovey-dovey...

118
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,766
Come on, I'm not that spiritless...

119
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:04,998
Anyway!

120
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:06,867
Those two...

121
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:11,199
I'll make sure they don't get on your nerves.

122
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,299
Okay... Sure...

123
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,400
Go ahead and do that then.

124
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,733
 Hold on. Hold on.

125
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:00,422
 We're almost here. Almost here.

126
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:02,432
 - There you go. 
 - Oh, I drank too much.

127
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:04,350
 There.

128
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:31,799
 Can you stay?

129
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,467
 What?

130
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,800
 Just for today.

131
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,699
 Can you stay by my side?

132
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,567
 No.

133
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,832
 Not just today.

134
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,565
 I want to stay by your side every day.

135
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:03,233
 You really are bad for my heart.

136
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,533
Yeo Ui Joo is my girlfriend?

137
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,399
Is this for real?

138
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,334
It's for real.

139
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:18,299
It's hard to believe, but I am your girlfriend.

140
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,799
Ui Joo.

141
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,065
Whoa! Stop. We're at work.

142
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,232
What if someone sees us?

143
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,998
Who will see us?

144
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:27,967
It's just us.

145
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,931
Where have you two been during work hours?

146
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:45,965
What?

147
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:48,266
Oh, well, we...

148
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,598
What?

149
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:52,300
I helped Editor Nam find references for a story.

150
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,398
Yes, that's right.

151
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,966
Everyone, attention!

152
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,633
I'm saying this out of concern.

153
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:07,431
If you're dating your coworker, don't let it show.

154
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,932
You know Kim and Choi couple from Digital Team, don't you?

155
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:13,131
At first, they were so happy and made this place a monthly party home.

156
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,632
In the end, they split up and made this place a funeral home.

157
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:16,598
They both eventually quit.

158
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:17,865
That!

159
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:20,933
Is the end and reality of an open office romance.

160
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:22,032
Well...

161
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:27,666
Maybe dating a coworker won't always end badly.

162
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,099
Maybe not.

163
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:30,866
What?

164
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:34,099
As long as you keep things professional.

165
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,366
So!

166
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:38,666
Don't be obvious about dating in the workplace.

167
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,765
Focus on work during office hours.

168
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:41,465
Okay?

169
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:43,065
Yeo Ui Joo! Nam Sang Soon!

170
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,198
What? What about me?

171
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,365
I would never do that.

172
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,099
Neither will I!

173
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,800
Really?

174
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:55,433
I'll be watching.

175
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,966
Like a hawk.

176
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,732
This is the item for next month's special article.

177
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,499
Thank you.

178
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,065
You know...

179
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,864
I think the chief editor knows about us.

180
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,566
What?

181
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,465
He told us to be discrete about office romance.

182
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,998
He threatened us.

183
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,199
I think it was for me to hear.

184
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,998
It was meant for Editor Nam and Editor Yeo.

185
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:31,798
Who?

186
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,998
Those two are dating.

187
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:38,167
The chief editor got wind of it.

188
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,933
No way!

189
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:43,733
At first, I also thought he suspected us.

190
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:47,231
Anyway, he's sharpening his sword right now.

191
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:51,100
This is why I said we shouldn't go public.

192
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,666
Let's be more careful.

193
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,265
Okay. I'll be more careful.

194
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,332
Those two dating is a complete surprise.

195
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:01,198
Goodness! I had no idea.

196
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,533
I was shocked, too.

197
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:09,164
 I think the Chief Editor knows about us.

198
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:12,165
 I have a bad feeling.

199
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,466
 No way. That can't be.

200
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:16,199
 Don't let it show.

201
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,198
 I don't want to be exposed for dating a coworker.

202
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,199
 Don't worry.

203
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:24,399
 I will be extra careful.

204
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,933
Okay.

205
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:35,232
Bon appetit!

206
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:39,833
CEO Yoo, who I respect.

207
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,998
Chief Editor, who I love.

208
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,466
Oh, thank you.

209
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,231
Editor Na, who always works hard.

210
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,398
Oh, me? Thank you.

211
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:53,432
And me, Editor Nam.

212
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:54,799
Everyone has a piece, right?

213
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,832
Enjoy!

214
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,099
You didn't give Ui Joo a piece.

215
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,965
What?

216
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,932
I forgot about Editor Yeo.

217
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:05,432
This is what's wrong with you!

218
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:07,099
You have no presence.

219
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:07,832
What?

220
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,398
If you didn't get one, you should've spoken up!

221
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:12,132
Seriously!

222
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:14,198
Oh, well. There's one left.

223
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:16,066
Here.

224
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:18,632
Eat it or not. Whatever.

225
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:24,699
 Sir.

226
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:25,865
 You didn't give Young Won a piece.

227
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:27,833
 This is what's wrong with you!

228
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,531
 - You have no presence. 
 - Sir?

229
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,666
 There's one left here.

230
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,367
 Eat.

231
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,366
Editor Yeo's piece is huge, isn't it?

232
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:41,598
Some might say you were putting on an act to give Editor Yeo the biggest piece.

233
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,733
What? Why would I?

234
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,733
What's so great about her that I would dote over her?

235
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,233
What the...?

236
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,899
Do you think there's a reason to dote over you?

237
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,231
See?

238
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:53,766
Editor Yeo and I are so incompatible.

239
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,566
Incompatible!

240
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,365
Move!

241
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:15,766
This is what's wrong with you!

242
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,399
Being an obstacle!

243
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:22,633
What gives...?

244
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,964
That jerk and I are so incompatible!

245
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,164
Right?

246
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,499
Yes, of course.

247
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,864
Look at how they're making a fool of themselves.

248
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:37,799
Making a fool?

249
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,166
Yes!

250
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:43,164
They should think about how to do their jobs better.

251
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:45,565
But they're thinking about how not to get caught.

252
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,665
They're making such a fool of themselves.

253
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,732
Isn't that a bit harsh?

254
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:53,734
It's not harsh.

255
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,864
But you're being odd, sir.

256
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:56,964
What do you mean?

257
00:16:56,964 --> 00:16:59,466
You're so lenient about office romance.

258
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,832
It's not like you.

259
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,567
No way.

260
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,665
Is there someone in the office you secretly like?

261
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:08,634
What?

262
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,799
If not...

263
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:15,065
Are you already dating someone in the office?

264
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:18,032
How can you say such an absurd thing?

265
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:20,798
Oh, I'm sorry.

266
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,065
Of course, you wouldn't do that,

267
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,800
considering your past remarks.

268
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,532
Anyway, leave it to me to supervise that cheeky couple.

269
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:34,032
I won't let you down.

270
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:36,600
They're going down.

271
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,732
Are you really all right?

272
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,533
About what?

273
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,766
About Hyungnim and Editor Na getting back together.

274
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,265
Does it really not affect you?

275
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,366
How can it not?

276
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,000
Right?

277
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,865
You're human. Not Buddha.

278
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:00,331
I like it. For real.

279
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,199
What?

280
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:04,765
Seeing them both so happy.

281
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,933
I like it.

282
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,198
You must be Buddha.

283
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:12,267
Amitabha and the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion...

284
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,998
 Remember I said I'd treat you to dinner?

285
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:16,531
 When are you free?

286
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:18,633
It's really not necessary.

287
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,666
What?

288
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,267
Mi Ra says she'll buy dinner. Do you want to come?

289
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,265
Are you crazy? Why would I go there?

290
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:28,732
I hate Mi Ra. I totally loathe her.

291
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,098
- I can read one's character from a person's face. 
 - You can?

292
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,466
She's a person you shouldn't get close to.

293
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:35,866
Tell me. You hate Mi Ra, too, right?

294
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,531
It's a relief you hate her, too.

295
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,800
I didn't say a word.

296
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,832
Anyway!

297
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:43,199
If you date women like Mi Ra because you feel lonely,

298
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,132
I won't see you.

299
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:45,232
Forever.

300
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:47,833
We'll no longer be friends, okay?

301
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,366
What the...?

302
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,199
How was my acting?

303
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,733
Freaking awesome, right?

304
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,531
Yeah. I almost hit you.

305
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,799
Because I got so mad.

306
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,700
So don't worry so much.

307
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,399
There's no way we'll get caught.

308
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,032
With my Oscar-worthy acting, how will people know...

309
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:15,366
I know, you fools.

310
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,199
I've known for some time now.

311
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,466
And the CEO!

312
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,965
Yes, yes.

313
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,065
Okay.

314
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:36,132
Promise in front of everyone that you will be completely professional.

315
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,165
- I promise. 
 - I promise.

316
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,865
Okay, good. That's enough...

317
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:39,733
No.

318
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,931
They still haven't come to their senses.

319
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,232
You, stand back.

320
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:47,166
You two, repeat after me.

321
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,566
From today, we will...

322
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:50,067
- What? 
 - What?

323
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,398
Repeat after me!

324
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,200
From today! We will!

325
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,199
Chief Editor.

326
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,899
We didn't commit a huge crime. Do we have to do this?

327
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,065
In front of the assistants?

328
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,565
From today!

329
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,733
We will!

330
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,699
- From today, we will... 
 - From today, we will...

331
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:08,565
Never show we're dating!

332
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,765
- Never show we're dating. 
 - Never show we're dating.

333
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:12,699
Too low. Louder!

334
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:16,400
We'll focus on work!

335
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,399
- We'll focus on work! 
 - We'll focus on work!

336
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,698
This isn't the army. This isn't...

337
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:24,632
Sir!

338
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:28,098
You said you'll let me take care of this.

339
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:30,099
Please stand back.

340
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,199
You two!

341
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,532
You promised, okay?

342
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,599
I'll be watching.

343
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,567
As well as the CEO. Okay?

344
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:53,000
Sunbae, congratulations.

345
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,965
Oh, thanks.

346
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,500
Sorry I didn't tell you.

347
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,132
You were sad after your break-up.

348
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:03,566
It didn't feel right to be happy

349
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:04,966
so I couldn't tell you.

350
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,431
Oh. I see.

351
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,399
But I'm so—

352
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,332
- So glad you broke up? 
 -  What?

353
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:16,098
You saw how the chief editor flipped out.

354
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:21,165
So if CEO Yoo, who stressed keeping things professional, was caught dating you,

355
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:24,900
he wouldn't just flip out, he'd eat you alive.

356
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,298
Right?

357
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,498
Of course.

358
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:29,965
CEO Yoo would've totally become a target.

359
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:32,133
Don't you think?

360
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,466
I guess...

361
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:40,264
Then I'll, uh, go, uh, cover my story.

362
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,666
Okay.

363
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:47,532
Wow, what a pretty house!

364
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,299
- Did the owner design it herself? 
 - Yes.

365
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:53,032
Wow! So this is what a narrow house looks like.

366
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:55,798
- A house built on a narrow plot. 
 - That's right.

367
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,831
Instead of a widely-stretched living space, it's stacked up tall.

368
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:02,799
Let's go inside and sketch the place.

369
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,099
Okay.

370
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,990

371
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:17,466
 The basement is a study set up to the owner's taste.

372
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:20,598
 The first floor is a bar where you can have a drink.

373
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,665
 The second floor is the kitchen and living room.

374
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,732
 The third floor is the bedroom.

375
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:30,499
 The fourth floor is a balcony looking out to Mt. Bukhansan.

376
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:33,932
 She gave each floor a distinct character.

377
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,665
How did you come to build your own house?

378
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:45,098
I have to live in Seoul because of work,

379
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,931
but I didn't have enough money to buy an apartment.

380
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:50,232
Doesn't building a house cost a lot?

381
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:53,299
That's why I built a narrow house.

382
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:56,999
With a deposit and a little loan, I could do it.

383
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:03,165
Wow. But it wouldn't have been easy to actually do it. You're amazing.

384
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:04,899
Thank you.

385
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,832
But anyone could do it.

386
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:11,531
There's such happiness in building your own home and living in it.

387
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:15,498
I highly recommend others to do it.

388
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:16,966
I see.

389
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:26,364
Editor Na, should I take more photos of the exterior?

390
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,799
- Editor Na? 
 - Yes. Yes?

391
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,832
What are you thinking about?

392
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,199
I was envious of the owner who built this.

393
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,264
You can do it, too.

394
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:43,366
She said it's possible to build it with little capital.

395
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:48,464
I could've done it if I hadn't lost my deposit then.

396
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:49,633
What?

397
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:53,199
The multiplex unit I lived in was put up for auction.

398
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,399
I was kicked out without getting my deposit back.

399
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,498
The landlady went off the grid.

400
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,632
Couple's dinner voucher?

401
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:08,099
Great.

402
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:13,633
Okay, done.

403
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:17,066
Send as a text message.

404
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,299
 I made a contract with the urgent sale in Hwayang-dong.

405
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,098
Why is this...

406
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,200
Why is this printing...?

407
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,766
Wait...

408
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,020

409
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,998
Editor Nam, how can you do this?

410
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:52,466
Do what?

411
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,065
- What's this? 
 - Feigning ignorance, I see.

412
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:57,299
You did this!

413
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,833
What? Me?

414
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,465
- No, I didn't. 
 - What do you mean?

415
00:25:02,465 --> 00:25:06,698
You made a solid promise, then you go and do this during work hours?

416
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:08,367
Stop.

417
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,666
What's all this ruckus?

418
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,198
You don't have to know.

419
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,733
I'll take care of it.

420
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,699
It'll only make you mad.

421
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:18,365
I said it wasn't me!

422
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,965
I made a promise in front of the CEO.

423
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:23,033
I'd be crazy to make a reservation during work hours.

424
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:26,265
Wow, you're shameless!

425
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:30,732
Who else would book an expensive couple's dinner?

426
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:32,999
The assistants with their puny salary?

427
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,998
The CEO who thinks dating is a waste of money and time?

428
00:25:36,998 --> 00:25:38,732
I'm sorry, sir.

429
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:41,132
I was going to take care of this myself somehow, but—

430
00:25:41,132 --> 00:25:43,266
I'm telling you, it's not me!

431
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:45,932
Darn it.

432
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:48,399
Oh! Here's the credit card number.

433
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,832
We can compare it to my credit card.

434
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:53,166
- So that's how it's going to be? 
 - Let's do this!

435
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,198
Okay, then. Let's do this.

436
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:57,532
- Take out your credit card! 
 - Take it out.

437
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:59,065
Stop!

438
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:03,133
There's no time to compare credit cards during work hours!

439
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,766
I'll let this one pass. Be careful from now on.

440
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,399
Sir, I'm being falsely accused...

441
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,933
Enough! I said let's end it at this.

442
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:17,031
Sir, give that to me. I'll throw it away...

443
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:20,067
Oh, no. It's too good to throw out.

444
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:22,800
I'll use it as scrap paper.

445
00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:29,532
Be thankful the CEO left it at that.

446
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:32,232
It's because he's listless nowadays.

447
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,832
If he were his usual self, you'd be dead.

448
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:36,699
You punk.

449
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,332
Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung! How could you make such a mistake?

450
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,233
I don't believe this.

451
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,499
 I'm sorry, Editor Nam.

452
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,233
This is so wrong.

453
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,680
 I had no other choice.

454
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,730

455
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,899
What would you like to eat?

456
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,365
Well... I'll have hangover soup...

457
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,198
One hangover soup, please.

458
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,265
Okay.

459
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:14,167
Oh? That woman...

460
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,065
Why? Do you know her?

461
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:18,466
Hold on.

462
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,365
- Excuse me. 
 - What?

463
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:22,765
It is you. You remember me, right?

464
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,332
Roseville! 203!

465
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,799
I don't know...

466
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,500
I think you have the wrong person.

467
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,598
Oh? Ma'am!

468
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,932
Stop!

469
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:33,165
Editor Na!

470
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:34,865
We'll come back later!

471
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,798
Ma'am! Let's talk for a minute!

472
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:40,433
Ma'am!

473
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,799
Editor Na!

474
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,633
Ma'am!

475
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,532
Move, move, move, move!

476
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,267
I'm sorry!

477
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:03,932
Wait up.

478
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:09,700
Ma'am! Ma'am!

479
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,464
Why are you chasing me?

480
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:14,332
Why are you running away?

481
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:15,732
Unbelievable...

482
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:17,932
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

483
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:23,832
Ma'am... Please give me back my security deposit.

484
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,832
Why are you doing this to me?

485
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,466
Don't you know I lost that building to the auction?

486
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:30,365
Of course, I know.

487
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:32,431
But you own a lot of buildings.

488
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:35,532
That multiplex wasn't your entire fortune.

489
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:37,799
Whatever. Let's solve this legally.

490
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,932
You know, right? I have no obligation to return your deposit.

491
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:44,165
Can't you still help me out?

492
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:49,699
It took me ten years to save that money. It's all I had.

493
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:52,033
You're killing me.

494
00:28:57,066 --> 00:29:02,033
So why book a restaurant during work hours after being so humiliated?

495
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,232
That really wasn't me.

496
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:05,865
Come on. You don't have to pretend with me.

497
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:07,531
But it really wasn't me.

498
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:10,166
It really wasn't?

499
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:15,066
- Then I got excited about nothing. 
 - What?

500
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:18,098
I really wanted to go to that restaurant.

501
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:20,531
I was surprised that you knew and booked it.

502
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:23,765
I thought we were truly a match made in heaven.

503
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:25,931
- But I guess not. 
 - Oh!

504
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:32,165
Surprise!

505
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,366
- I got you! 
 - What?

506
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:34,733
I actually did book it.

507
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:37,332
What do you think about my acting? Oscar-worthy, right?

508
00:29:37,332 --> 00:29:38,866
Oh, come on!

509
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,466
But I heard it's really expensive.

510
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:46,099
- Will it be okay? 
 - Of course!

511
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:49,065
Money isn't the problem when you're so happy like this.

512
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:51,431
Oh, come on!

513
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:54,000
You're so witty.

514
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,365
Are you not happy with the food?

515
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:05,466
What?

516
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,365
You hardly seem to be eating.

517
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:10,900
No. It's delicious.

518
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,800
Just a sec.

519
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,166
Young Won!

520
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:26,133
- What? 
 - Oh!

521
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:28,799
What are you doing here?

522
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,199
What are you two doing here?

523
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,965
We're on a date.

524
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,431
Who are you here with?

525
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,033
What? Oh, I...

526
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,666
No way. Are you...

527
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:41,733
- ...on a blind date? 
 - What?

528
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:43,365
Oh, yes!

529
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:47,066
Wow, I wonder what he's like! I'll leave after I see him.

530
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:49,333
- What? 
 - Oh, then me, too!

531
00:30:56,033 --> 00:31:00,398
Can you two just mind your own business and go on your date?

532
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:02,798
Okay. After we see him.

533
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,899
Don't meet anyone who's like CE...

534
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,367
What?

535
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,790
Don't meet anyone who's like your ex.

536
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,499
- Meet a proper guy. 
 - Why? What was her ex like?

537
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:16,865
Don't get me started. He was a selfish jerk.

538
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:18,966
A money-grubbing bastard!

539
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,431
Oh, so he was a total scumbag.

540
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:24,299
No, not so much...

541
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,531
If you're done, can I take your plates?

542
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:27,566
Oh, yes.

543
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:32,599
Why don't you two just forget me and go on your date?

544
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,866
I'll just see what he looks like.

545
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:37,132
But what's taking so long?

546
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,099
He must be taking a dump.

547
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,531
He's taking too long.

548
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:52,600
He must have constipation.

549
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,999
 I left. See you outside.

550
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,598
Oh, no.

551
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:01,199
He had urgent business and left.

552
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,465
I'll be going now, then.

553
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,599
Have a nice date.

554
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,400
Bye.

555
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:12,499
Oh no.

556
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,531
She was rejected.

557
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,833
Obviously.

558
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:19,998
I had no idea those two would come here.

559
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,799
We almost got caught.

560
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,232
It's good we didn't.

561
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,032
Let's go somewhere else. You need to get some dinner.

562
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:29,132
No, I... Can we call it a night?

563
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:31,565
- What? 
 - I'm actually a little tired.

564
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:35,065
Oh, so that's why you hardly ate.

565
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:37,133
Let's go. Go and get some rest.

566
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:42,931
The food is great here!

567
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:45,066
I'm glad you like it.

568
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,331
But this is unusual.

569
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:51,366
You only went to cheap restaurants with Cutie Pie.

570
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:53,632
I brought you here because it's you.

571
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,366
You're so much more special than her.

572
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:58,767
Aw, shucks.

573
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:02,165
Here, have this. I cut it all up for you.

574
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:03,699
Oh, my!

575
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:06,132
This is unbelievable.

576
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,765
Were you always this sweet?

577
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:09,965
Oh, well.

578
00:33:09,965 --> 00:33:12,632
Cutie Pie lost a huge jackpot!

579
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,732
Come on, stop talking about her.

580
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:19,199
Now, all I have is you, my Joo! Ui joo Ui Joo!

581
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,200
Okay.

582
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,265
What shall we do after dinner?

583
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:24,466
Watch a movie?

584
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:25,432
No.

585
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:29,299
I have something else I want to do.

586
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,365
What? Shopping?

587
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,098
No.

588
00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:33,866
Not that.

589
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:43,966
Slowly, slowly.

590
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,466
Don't rush it. Don't rush it.

591
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:47,431
- Slowly, slowly. 
 - Oh, okay. Slowly.

592
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:52,531
What's this?

593
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:54,598
- So strong... 
 - Is this for real?

594
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:56,299
You're unbelievable.

595
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,400
Cutie Pie...

596
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:03,599
I love you.

597
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,499
Cutie Pie.

598
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:10,866
What?

599
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,333
What?

600
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,567
Get out! I said get out!

601
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,998
I'm sorry! Ui Joo Ui Joo!

602
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:21,533
Shut up!

603
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:28,332
Joo! Ui Joo Ui Joo! Hear me out.

604
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,366
Call me that one more time.

605
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:33,033
Then I'll ju-jitsu you to pieces.

606
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:36,566
- You kept saying Cutie Pie... 
 - Again?

607
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:40,265
I mean, you kept bringing her up, so her name got stuck in my head,

608
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:43,165
and it came out reflectively before I realized.

609
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,665
Forget it. Let's break up.

610
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,065
It's over between us. The end.

611
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,599
Okay?

612
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,166
Ui Joo...

613
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:55,233
Yeo Ui Joo!

614
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:04,765
 She's so cold.

615
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:07,865
 She could've given back a portion of your deposit.

616
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:11,698
 No. She didn't say anything wrong.

617
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:15,265
 I was ignorant. I'm the one to blame.

618
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:17,433
 I'm so humiliated.

619
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:21,066
 Can you pretend today didn't happen?

620
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:24,433
I'm leaving.

621
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:31,865
Mr. Shin Gyeom. Can I go home now?

622
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:32,966
What?

623
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,231
Okay.

624
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,000
Thank you, sir.

625
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:39,931
What are you thinking about?

626
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:43,531
The security deposit. She won't get it back, right?

627
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:44,766
What?

628
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:46,531
Are you still thinking about that?

629
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:48,798
- You're out of your mind. 
 - Forget it.

630
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:51,233
Why are you concerned about that?

631
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,866
You said it was good seeing them happy.

632
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:57,266
Stop caring about Editor Na for real now.

633
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,900
Okay.

634
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,532
Cleaning is the best way to distract yourself.

635
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,398
- Hi. 
 - Hello.

636
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,265
Here. Take this.

637
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:30,732
- What is this? 
 - I'm not sure.

638
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:33,698
A woman asked me to give this to you.

639
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:35,632
Some lady? Who?

640
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:36,832
I don't know.

641
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,165
Anyway, I've delivered it to you. Okay?

642
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:41,234
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

643
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,166
What could this be?

644
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,900

645
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:50,532
What's this?

646
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,500
 I couldn't sleep after seeing you yesterday because of my conscience. I hope you'll shrug off the bad memories and start fresh.

647
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,732
 Did you get your security deposit back?

648
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:57,931
I don't believe this! That's great!

649
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,132
Right?

650
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:04,465
I felt so grateful that I wanted to say thank you,

651
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,766
but there's no way to contact her.

652
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,599
You said you met her by chance at a restaurant.

653
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,698
Call them. You never know.

654
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:13,465
She might be a regular.

655
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,432
You could be right.

656
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,665
Thank you, Sunbae.

657
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:18,599
Don't thank me.

658
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,632
The heavens helped you because you're so kind.

659
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,031
Come on.

660
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:27,031
The heavens must've deserted me because I'm bad.

661
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:28,265
What are you talking about?

662
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:29,865
- It's over. 
 - What?

663
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:32,798
- It's over between me and Editor Nam. 
 - Why?

664
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:34,798
Never mind. It's not worth talking about it.

665
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,333
Just know that it's over.

666
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,964
Shocking news!

667
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:44,732
Editor Na got her security deposit back

668
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:46,099
from her former landlady.

669
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,698
Oh. Really?

670
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,032
Yeah. Amazing, right?

671
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:50,765
I can see what will happen.

672
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:53,100
Editor Na's energy will soar through the roof.

673
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,032
Yeah, I bet she feels great.

674
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:57,265
She got the money and a letter.

675
00:37:57,266 --> 00:38:00,331
Right! Money and a letter...

676
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:02,800
What?

677
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,700
I didn't say anything about a letter.

678
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,066
What?

679
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:10,933
Wow. I got goose bumps.

680
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,765
- Was it you again? 
 - What are you talking about?

681
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:16,999
I can see your panicked look right now.

682
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,666
It's not like that.

683
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,131
Hey.

684
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,265
Hey, Shin Gyeom! You...

685
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,665
You...

686
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,466
That fool.

687
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:26,799
I told him to stop caring.

688
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,633
What is he thinking?

689
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,732
Young Won, aren't you spending too much?

690
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:36,099
Oh, no. I got my security deposit back.

691
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,598
I should treat you.

692
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:39,832
Have as much as you want.

693
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,166
Okay.

694
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,565
Wow!

695
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:47,900
You know... I'm going to buy a place with that money.

696
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,198
Really?

697
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,132
If you get a bank loan on top of that, you can buy the apartment you're living in...

698
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,632
No. I'm going to build a house.

699
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:56,665
What?

700
00:38:56,666 --> 00:39:00,898
I've been covering narrow houses built by the homeowners.

701
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:03,031
It's possible with little capital,

702
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:07,499
and what's more, customizing my house to fit my needs is so appealing.

703
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:08,966
Really?

704
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:10,198
Take a look at this.

705
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,533
This is for future reference.

706
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:18,098
They're all splendid, right?

707
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:20,899
Yes, I guess they are.

708
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,698
But there's a saying.

709
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:26,565
- You age ten years while building a house. 
 - What?

710
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,632
It means it's really tough.

711
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,598
If you want to build a house yourself, you need to know architecture like a professional.

712
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:34,532
You have to visit the construction site often.

713
00:39:34,532 --> 00:39:35,933
That's not all.

714
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:38,300
Getting permits is very complicated.

715
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:41,266
Is that so?

716
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:43,598
- She said anyone could do it. 
 - What?

717
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,732
Who said that? She must not know that well.

718
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:48,599
Building your own house isn't an easy task.

719
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,400
It'll be too hard for you.

720
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:59,366
So... You think I can't do it?

721
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,434
What?

722
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:07,099
It seems like you're saying that.

723
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,833
I should forget it since I'm not competent enough.

724
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,399
That's not it.

725
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:16,165
- I don't want to see you suffer... 
 - Forget it.

726
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,399
Just eat.

727
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:28,232
What happened to your nature man?

728
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:32,432
He'll do the interview as long as his face isn't exposed.

729
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,632
That's great.

730
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,964
Connect it with Editor Na's special article.

731
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:39,565
He built the hut he lives in, right?

732
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:42,366
If all goes well, it will be a truly fresh article.

733
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:43,899
Our thoughts on narrow houses were so...

734
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,699
 I'm sorry. Please don't be mad, Young Won.

735
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:49,333
Who's texting during a meeting?

736
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:53,066
Who is it? Huh?

737
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,432
- It's you again, right? 
 - What?

738
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:55,232
Oh, I...

739
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:57,399
Who were you texting?

740
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,566
The man of nature...

741
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,865
The man of nature has a phone?

742
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:02,132
How dare you!

743
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:03,299
Give it.

744
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:05,600
Give it here. Stop resisting!

745
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:09,733
Look at this.

746
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,798
I'm sorry, Ui Joo. Please don't be mad. TT.

747
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:15,165
Man of nature, my foot.

748
00:41:15,165 --> 00:41:17,266
You sent it to your girlfriend.

749
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,066
I apologize.

750
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,999
Get it together. Huh?

751
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,399
Why fight and text during a meeting?

752
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,931
We didn't fight.

753
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:24,866
We're over.

754
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,032
We're not over.

755
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:26,732
We fought.

756
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,199
Do you want to fight with me?

757
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,833
Do you want your office life to be over?

758
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:32,165
What silliness is this in front of the CEO?

759
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,132
It's okay.

760
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:35,999
Let's continue with the meeting.

761
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:41,733
Thank the stars that CEO Yoo is your boss.

762
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,765
Stop scowling.

763
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,100
Why you...

764
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,899
Stop it.

765
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:51,699
Editor Yeo!

766
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:55,433
Don't show personal emotions during work hours!

767
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:02,500
This is why office romance can't work.

768
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:20,566
 When will you confirm my special article, sir?

769
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:22,900
Sir?

770
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,431
Not Ja Sung?

771
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:26,834
Sir?

772
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:30,150
She must be super angry.

773
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,400
What should I do?

774
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,060

775
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,850

776
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,864
 I'm sorry.

777
00:42:50,864 --> 00:42:53,599
 What I said was wrong.

778
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,699
Sir!

779
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:57,399
Don't you know how to knock?

780
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,732
I forgot. I apologize.

781
00:43:00,732 --> 00:43:01,931
What is it?

782
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:05,232
This is the fridge advertorial proposal we're working on.

783
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:07,500
Okay.

784
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,465
Wait, but...

785
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:09,565
Who is Nam Sang?

786
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:11,567
What? Nam...

787
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:14,332
Why I ought to...

788
00:43:14,332 --> 00:43:18,266
Editor Nam is not in his right mind now.

789
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:22,500
I'm sorry. I'll make him correct it.

790
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:26,798
Stop.

791
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:29,699
Correct it later. I'll take a look at it first.

792
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,964
No, I'll have it corrected and give it to you later.

793
00:43:31,964 --> 00:43:33,532
No, I said I'll take a look at it first.

794
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:34,598
No, I'll have it corrected...

795
00:43:34,598 --> 00:43:36,866
- No, wait... 
 - Oh?

796
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,300
What the...

797
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,299
I'm sorry. What I said was wrong.

798
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,833
I'm going to kill Editor Nam!

799
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:07,432
It really wasn't me.

800
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:09,000
You're not weaseling your way out of this!

801
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,498
It was stuck to your advertorial proposal.

802
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:13,032
- But it wasn't me. 
 - Then who else?

803
00:44:13,032 --> 00:44:15,999
Who else here would have to apologize after fighting with their girlfriend?

804
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,932
We didn't fight. We're over.

805
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:19,199
We're not over. We fought.

806
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,165
What?

807
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:22,765
But I really didn't write this note.

808
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:25,131
Why would I use honorifics to Editor Yeo?

809
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:28,232
You must've done something incredibly wrong to have to resort to honorifics!

810
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,964
We didn't fight. We're over!

811
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:31,332
We're not over. We fought!

812
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:32,532
Why I ought to...!

813
00:44:32,532 --> 00:44:34,233
But it really wasn't me!

814
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:36,890
Darn it!

815
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,132
Check the handwriting.

816
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:44,565
Yes!

817
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:46,660
We should compare the handwriting.

818
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,630
What?

819
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,999
Okay, then. Let's do it.

820
00:44:49,999 --> 00:44:51,132
- Do it. 
 - Okay, do it.

821
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:54,400
- Do it, do it, do it. 
 - I don't believe you two.

822
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,698
There's no time for this during work hours.

823
00:44:57,698 --> 00:44:59,532
Stop this idiocy and get back to work!

824
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:01,233
Sir!

825
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,964
I've been wrongfully accused.

826
00:45:04,065 --> 00:45:08,099
I must check the handwriting and clear my name. Give it to me.

827
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,466
Give it to me.

828
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:09,698
- Wait... 
 - Give it to me.

829
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:10,999
- Seriously... 
 - Give it.

830
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,532
- Give it to me! 
 - Come on!

831
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:14,567
- What? 
 - What?

832
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:18,965
That's enough!

833
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,399
I was going to let it slide.

834
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:22,032
Why don't you know when to stop?

835
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:23,999
Do I have to yell at you like this?

836
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:25,432
Do I have to get mad?

837
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,099
- I apologize. 
 - Forget it!

838
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,066
Get back to work!

839
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:39,165
Young Won is already angry.

840
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:41,465
If people find out about us because of me...

841
00:45:41,465 --> 00:45:42,499
I can't let that happen.

842
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:44,870
Then it'll be the end for me.

843
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,599
 It wasn't me.

844
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,766
 It really wasn't me.

845
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:55,566
 Yes. I know it wasn't you.

846
00:45:55,566 --> 00:46:00,460
 Once again, I'm really sorry, Editor Nam.

847
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:12,465
I need this room. How long will you be here?

848
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:14,399
Editor Yeo...

849
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:18,964
I'm sorry. Can you forgive me?

850
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:20,032
What are you doing?

851
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:22,899
I told you it's over between us.

852
00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:25,933
Why did you do that and humiliate me as well?

853
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:28,132
I really didn't write the note.

854
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:29,333
Forget it. Cut...

855
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:32,232
Cutie Pie might've accepted the apology but you won't?

856
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:33,766
But it really wasn't me!

857
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:37,899
I was going to say cut the crap and save your breath.

858
00:46:37,899 --> 00:46:41,232
I guess all you can think about is Cutie Pie.

859
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:42,999
No, that's not it...

860
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:43,964
Forget it!

861
00:46:43,964 --> 00:46:47,832
It's really over between us.

862
00:46:56,965 --> 00:46:59,699
Please stop being mad, all right?

863
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:01,765
I'm not mad.

864
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:03,998
I know you're mad. I'm sorry.

865
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:05,665
I wasn't thinking straight.

866
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:08,599
I said that because I didn't want you to suffer...

867
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:10,798
I said it's okay. Stop worrying about it.

868
00:47:10,798 --> 00:47:12,766
If you keep doing this, we might get caught.

869
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,532
It's just us here. Who would know...

870
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,400
I know!

871
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,165
Did you two get back together?

872
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:24,531
Did you, Young Won?

873
00:47:24,532 --> 00:47:26,232
Sunbae...

874
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:44,964
So...

875
00:47:44,964 --> 00:47:48,998
You weren't keeping things professional.

876
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:53,799
Yet, we had to make a humiliating promise in front of the assistants.

877
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:54,665
I'm sorry.

878
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:58,598
- The restaurant reservation and note were all you. 
 - What?

879
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:01,331
Oh, but Young Won didn't know.

880
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:03,733
It was all me. I'm sorry.

881
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:06,565
Not knowing, I made Sang Soon spend so much money.

882
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:11,799
Not knowing, I berated him about writing a note like a loser.

883
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:17,299
This situation is hilarious!

884
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,533
Wait. Why do you look so somber?

885
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,100
Is this funny only to me?

886
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,232
It's so funny.

887
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:30,798
Are you smiling?

888
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:33,232
How can you smile?

889
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:36,734
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

890
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:39,333
My poor Sang Soon.

891
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,499
I feel so bad for him.

892
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:44,633
- Wait, Sunbae! 
 - Editor Yeo!

893
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,766
Sir!

894
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:49,998
I'm sorry.

895
00:48:49,998 --> 00:48:52,470
I have no excuse.

896
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,031
Right... You said you need this room.

897
00:49:00,031 --> 00:49:03,765
I'm done.

898
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:05,399
Hey, Nam Sang Soon.

899
00:49:05,399 --> 00:49:06,599
I'm sorry.

900
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,699
For getting you in trouble because of me.

901
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:12,898
But that note...

902
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:14,565
I know. You didn't write it.

903
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:15,999
What? How do you know?

904
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:18,332
What's the use of knowing how I know?

905
00:49:18,332 --> 00:49:20,799
Anyway, sorry.

906
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:22,866
I berated you when I didn't know the truth.

907
00:49:22,866 --> 00:49:24,466
No.

908
00:49:24,466 --> 00:49:25,931
No, no.

909
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:28,666
If you think about it, it's all my fault.

910
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,666
I'm insanely sorry.

911
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:35,067
And I will never make the same mistake again.

912
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:36,732
I promise.

913
00:49:36,732 --> 00:49:38,131
Okay.

914
00:49:38,131 --> 00:49:40,398
You promised.

915
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:41,666
Of course.

916
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:44,067
You're not mad anymore, right?

917
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,632
Thank you, Ui Joo, Ui Joo.

918
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:52,367
I will never speak about Cutie Pie...

919
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:56,132
This cursed mouth! Mouth! Mouth! Mouth!

920
00:49:56,132 --> 00:49:58,266
I should hit that mouth.

921
00:49:58,266 --> 00:50:00,633
With my mouth.

922
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:01,432
What?

923
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,400
Bring it in.

924
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,332
Oh, come on.

925
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,098
What if the CEO sees us?

926
00:50:07,098 --> 00:50:08,798
It's okay. Trust me.

927
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,133
Bring it in.

928
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,399
But still...

929
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,433
Ui Joo Ui Joo!

930
00:50:30,232 --> 00:50:32,765
You left your cell phone.

931
00:50:32,765 --> 00:50:37,580
Oh, thank you, Sang Soon Sang Soon.

932
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:44,798
So? Did you two make up?

933
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:46,831
You're being so obvious about it.

934
00:50:46,831 --> 00:50:48,799
Did you not see the CEO get angry?

935
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,866
Is he a joke to you?

936
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:52,065
Stop.

937
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:53,733
That's enough.

938
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:54,731
Oh, sir.

939
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:56,099
You don't have to raise your voice.

940
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,432
I'll take care of this.

941
00:50:58,432 --> 00:51:01,232
If you can't leave your emotions at the door...

942
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:02,099
Don't do that.

943
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,666
You heard him. Don't...

944
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,133
What?

945
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:09,599
Cough and love are things you can't hide.

946
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,199
They like each other. They're in love.

947
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,199
How can they not show it?

948
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:17,200
But it could disrupt the workplace...

949
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,431
That's another thing that can't be hidden.

950
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:22,700
Your narrow mindedness.

951
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,932
- What? N-N-Narrow-minded? 
 - Yes.

952
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:27,600
Dating coworkers and showing emotion aren't crimes.

953
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,199
It's the fourth industrial revolution era.

954
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,465
Nagging about that is close-minded.

955
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:34,166
How is the fourth industrial revolution relevant to office romance?

956
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,131
Enough.

957
00:51:35,131 --> 00:51:36,499
As of now,

958
00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:39,298
I, the CEO, give you permission to be obvious

959
00:51:39,298 --> 00:51:41,432
about your office romance.

960
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,933
What?

961
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:47,530
I want a free and lovely workplace.

962
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,399
 Thank you.

963
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:12,566
Hello?

964
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:13,998
I've got news. Hey.

965
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:16,065
Editor Na went to meet her former landlady.

966
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:17,031
What?

967
00:52:17,032 --> 00:52:18,699
She can't be reached. How?

968
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:23,064
She asked the restaurant to call her if the landlady ever came again.

969
00:52:23,064 --> 00:52:24,666
And they called.

970
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,298
She left to tell her, thank you.

971
00:52:26,298 --> 00:52:27,999
What?

972
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,398
What are you doing?

973
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,400
Where do you think you're going?

974
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,666
To stop Editor Na from meeting her?

975
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:36,265
Because if she does, you'll get caught?

976
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:37,700
Let go.

977
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,032
Will you still say you didn't do it?

978
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,065
I said let go.

979
00:52:41,065 --> 00:52:43,032
You don't need to go. I lied.

980
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:44,065
- What? 
 - Hey.

981
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:47,066
If she were that easy to find, Editor Na would've found her ages ago.

982
00:52:47,066 --> 00:52:48,031
You bastard...

983
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,033
What are you playing at?

984
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:50,499
I want to ask the same question!

985
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:51,899
Pull yourself together!

986
00:52:51,899 --> 00:52:53,632
Stop caring about Editor Na!

987
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:57,233
Why jump through hoops to give her that money?

988
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:01,132
What did you say?

989
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:07,166
Editor Na.

990
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,232
What did you just say?

991
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,399
It was Photographer Shin's money?

992
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,500
The security deposit?

993
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,899
Am I really that narrow-minded?

994
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:27,232
Am I?

995
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:28,864
Joo!

996
00:53:28,864 --> 00:53:30,831
What do you want for dinner?

997
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:34,131
Let's have what you want, Soon.

998
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,532
Then how about pork rinds that you like?

999
00:53:36,532 --> 00:53:38,798
I'll buy it as an apology.

1000
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,899
I'm sorry.

1001
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:44,033
To celebrate us making up, we're having a party.

1002
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:45,732
I'm sorry.

1003
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:48,100
Oh, okay.

1004
00:53:48,766 --> 00:53:49,798
Let's go, Joo.

1005
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:51,933
Okay, Soon.

1006
00:53:57,232 --> 00:53:58,932
Sir! How about a drink?

1007
00:53:58,932 --> 00:54:00,198
To apologize for making a scene earlier...

1008
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,600
I'm sorry. I have a previous engagement.

1009
00:54:06,966 --> 00:54:08,866
- Mi Ra... 
 - I also have a previous engagement.

1010
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:10,966
I'm sorry.

1011
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,366
- Joo Hee... 
 - I have to work overtime.

1012
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:19,933
I'm lonely.

1013
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:22,598
It's the fourth industrial revolution era,

1014
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:25,766
but loneliness is still an unsolvable problem.

1015
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,199
My carelessness led to Editor Yeo finding out about us.

1016
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:39,867
I'm sorry.

1017
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,498
You were already angry...

1018
00:54:41,498 --> 00:54:43,233
Yes.

1019
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,999
I'm angry.

1020
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:48,366
I won't feed you excuses.

1021
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:54,366
Photographer Shin told me.

1022
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:56,099
What?

1023
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,899
 Her former landlady?

1024
00:54:57,899 --> 00:54:58,665
 Yes.

1025
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:00,931
 She ran into her while covering a story.

1026
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:04,733
 It didn't seem like she'd get her money back.

1027
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:08,600
 Editor Na blamed herself. She looked resigned.

1028
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,999
 Imagine how she must feel.

1029
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:14,964
 So that's why she looked so down.

1030
00:55:14,964 --> 00:55:19,465
 I don't know about anyone else, but I thought you should know.

1031
00:55:24,967 --> 00:55:28,032
 Don't ever tell her that I gave this to you.

1032
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:29,932
 Okay?

1033
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:34,233
I'm giving it back.

1034
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,565
Why did you do it?

1035
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:41,800
Because I know how you feel.

1036
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,566
What?

1037
00:55:43,566 --> 00:55:46,233
- What do you... 
 - I also...

1038
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:50,666
...lost all the money I saved up once.

1039
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,832
I was betrayed by someone I trusted.

1040
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:59,366
It was the biggest ordeal and scar of my life.

1041
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,666
I thought it was no use trying to make it.

1042
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,933
The pain was unimaginable.

1043
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:09,766
I wanted to die.

1044
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:13,399
That kind of despair...

1045
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:17,300
I didn't want you to carry that in your life.

1046
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:21,567
But I guess I did an unnecessary thing.

1047
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:24,467
I'm sorry if I upset you.

1048
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:27,832
I am upset.

1049
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:32,900
Not with you but with myself.

1050
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,065
What?

1051
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:37,866
You're sincerely concerned for me.

1052
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,534
But I grumbled about such a trifle matter.

1053
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,699
I'm upset with myself.

1054
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:46,833
Young Won.

1055
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,798
I'm the one that's sorry.

1056
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:50,532
I made you walk on eggshells.

1057
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,798
Oh, no. Don't say that.

1058
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:54,900
Right now,

1059
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,266
I'm a whole lot happier

1060
00:56:58,266 --> 00:57:00,632
than when I got the security deposit back.

1061
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:03,199
Since you're by my side,

1062
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,632
since you're so thoughtful toward me,

1063
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:09,266
I'm so happy.

1064
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:21,565
Right!

1065
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:24,166
Is the new place okay?

1066
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:25,431
Yes.

1067
00:57:25,431 --> 00:57:26,899
It is, but...

1068
00:57:26,899 --> 00:57:29,532
It was much better when I stayed at the office.

1069
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:33,131
I could talk with you over a bottle of beer.

1070
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:34,566
I loved that.

1071
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:36,431
That wasn't much.

1072
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:39,366
Even if it's a hollow compliment, thanks.

1073
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:41,832
It's not a hollow compliment.

1074
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,031
I like you.

1075
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:47,266
What?

1076
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:50,367
I said I like you.

1077
00:57:58,233 --> 00:58:00,566
Hey, Mi Ra. What's up?

1078
00:58:00,566 --> 00:58:03,699
Weren't you having dinner with Photographer Shin?

1079
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:06,899
What? Did he reject you?

1080
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:10,799
I'm sorry. I can't go because I'm working.

1081
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:13,933
Yeah. Sorry.

1082
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,232
She hurt me and got hurt right back.

1083
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,666
Serves her right.

1084
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,666
You reap what you sow.

1085
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:29,000
What goes around comes around.

1086
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:31,964
What does that stare mean?

1087
00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:34,399
I can draw up two interpretations.

1088
00:58:34,399 --> 00:58:37,366
Petty old fool.

1089
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:38,999
Narrow-minded loser.

1090
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:41,565
No. A fool who still likes Mi Ra...

1091
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:45,299
Don't say that I like her or whatever.

1092
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:46,699
- I don't! 
 - What?

1093
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:49,165
I'm going on a blind date tonight.

1094
00:58:49,165 --> 00:58:51,032
Bye.

1095
00:58:53,766 --> 00:58:57,232
Did he give up on her already?

1096
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:24,533
Why are you here alone?

1097
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,165
Well.

1098
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:36,299
I guess it's something you can't handle sober.

1099
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:40,500
Don't be too upset.

1100
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:43,633
Things don't work out in life.

1101
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:46,160
It's not just you...

1102
01:00:05,132 --> 01:00:10,232
I wonder what kind of house you'll build.

1103
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,465
I'm not going to.

1104
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:16,931
Someone told me that you age ten years while building a house.

1105
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:19,833
I'll help you.

1106
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:23,180
So you'll only age about... five years?

1107
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,730
♫  Everyone goes through this kind of day  ♫

1108

01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,766
 Just as you beautifully decorate your house,

1116
01:00:56,766 --> 01:01:02,334
 you tend to your love so that it shines.

1117
01:01:02,334 --> 01:01:06,770
 Just like a well-built house with a strong foundation,

1118
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,970
 I hope our love will be forever.

1119
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,298
 We're connecting our stories into one, right?

1120
01:01:22,298 --> 01:01:25,860
 Take a look at the material on the man of nature.

Hello? Editor Nam.

 A trip?

1133
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:07,999
 Let's forget the past pain and have a great time.

1134
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:09,500
 What if we get married?

1135
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,366
 Seriously!

1136
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:12,367
 Marriage isn't such a bad thing...

1137
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:14,232
 My relationship with him...

1138
01:03:14,232 --> 01:03:16,765
 I need to reconsider it.

1139

 Sang Soon, let's...

1140
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:20,899
 I know what you're going to say, but my answer's no.

1141
01:03:20,899 --> 01:03:22,800
 Dad?

1142
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,098
 Want to see a picture?

1143
01:03:24,098 --> 01:03:27,432
 Is this man's name Yoo Ja Sung?

1144
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:31,166
 Oh? How do you know his name?

1145
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:33,433
 I'm sorry.

1146
01:03:33,433 --> 01:03:36,090
 And thank you for everything.
