1
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,590

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,220

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,890

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,100

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,570

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,360

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,070

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,680

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,000

10
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,060

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,090
♫  I like the bright mornings. You like the starry nights  ♫

12
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,890
♫  We’re so different  ♫

13
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:17,060
♫  Like putting one ice cube in an americano  ♫

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,760
♫  Our first encounter was lukewarm  ♫

15
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,400
What happened?

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,366
Why are you here...?

17
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,267
Stop!

18
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:37,366
Don't misunderstand.

19
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,132
Are you sick?

20
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,180
I must've fallen asleep while doing that.

21
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:08,199
I see.

22
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,000
Are you feeling okay?

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,165
Yes. Thank you for worrying...

24
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:15,365
I'm not asking because I'm worried about you.

25
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,432
It's because I'm worried about myself.

26
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:20,698
If you're still sick tonight, it could be bothersome for me.

27
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:23,166
I'm sure I won't be. I'm really fine.

28
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,765
That's a relief then.

29
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:26,699
Sorry for the trouble.

30
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,300
Bye.

31
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,165
Are you going somewhere?

32
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,833
I'm going to work out.

33
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,234
Oh.

34
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,432
The password to the front door is 0000.

35
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:14,598
What?

36
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,165
Isn't that too easy?

37
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,865
What if there's a burglar?

38
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,499
As you can see, there's nothing to steal.

39
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:21,466
Yes.

40
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,164
Why is there nothing? It's so empty.

41
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:24,531
This is how I live.

42
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,132
With nothing. Empty.

43
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,001
Why?

44
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,166
Why are you so curious?

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,167
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,666
See you later.

47
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,440

48
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:59,266
Why call me and not the security office?

49
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,164
I did, but there was no response.

50
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:04,665
So why didn't you stay home instead of going out?

51
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,899
I feel bad that I'm burdening you.

52
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,965
So I wanted to make you breakfast.

53
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:12,232
But there is no rice or cooking utensils.

54
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:15,810
So I went to buy this...

55
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,266
Do I look like I would eat that for breakfast?

56
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:22,980
Me, Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung?

57
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,533
The soft tofu stew is amazing.

58
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:38,098
I've only seen high-rise apartments that offer breakfast like this in magazines.

59
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,967
The service is incredible.

60
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,098
It's too early to say it's incredible.

61
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:45,190
Follow me.

62
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,160

63
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:04,430
 A gym with the best equipment to stay fit.

64
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:11,660
 An education zone that has various programs.

65
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,832
 Lastly, this is the sky lounge.

66
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,831
No one would be impressed by a hotel!

67
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,431
Use the facilities while you're here.

68
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,465
If you're going to write an article that brings in money,

69
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:30,467
it'll be helpful to experience these things.

70
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,634
Okay.

71
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,132
Look around more if you want.

72
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,733
Bye.

73
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:37,699
Yes?

74
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,266
Don't tell the others you're staying here.

75
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,999
I don't want any misunderstandings to occur.

76
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,500
Yes, Sir.

77
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,632
What a view!

78
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,134
Good morning. Good morning.

79
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,766
Editor Yeo, how was the blind date?

80
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,832
Isn't my friend awesome?

81
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:05,164
- I got rejected. 
 - What?

82
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:08,199
He rejected me to my face.

83
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,565
Are you all right?

84
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,166
Yes, I'm fine. No problem.

85
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,431
I got back together with my boyfriend.

86
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,298
That's a relief.

87
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,899
How can you introduce her to that son of a...

88
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,431
that person with such bad manners?

89
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:21,899
Bad manners?

90
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,766
He's known for being extremely polite.

91
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:27,599
His nickname is the Virtuous Minister Hwang Hui of Doctors Without Borders.

92
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,198
Minister Hwang Hui, my foot.

93
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,399
Then how could he storm out before I finished asking my question?

94
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,698
What did you ask?

95
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:34,865
The basics.

96
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:36,932
Do you live in Gangnam? Is your car foreign-made?

97
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:38,266
What's your monthly profit?

98
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,666
No wonder he rejected you!

99
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,600
Seriously...

100
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,432
I was a fool to introduce

101
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:47,567
the upright and pure Minister Hwang Hui to a materialistic person like you.

102
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,899
What did you say?

103
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,700
Why you...

104
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,667
Did I say something wrong?

105
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,099
Stop it this instant!

106
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:56,067
I don't need this first thing in the morning!

107
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,100
Get to work!

108
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh! Sir!

109
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,332
We're opening a bazaar two days from now.

110
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:07,099
I wanted to discuss something with you.

111
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,064
Do you have time for a meeting in the afternoon?

112
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,465
I'll be out then.

113
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:12,633
We can talk over lunch.

114
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,190
Oh. Okay, sir.

115
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:21,832
Over lunch? I'll get indigestion.

116
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,398
Here.

117
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,700
There you go.

118
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,299
Sir!

119
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,832
You don't have to look at the menu here.

120
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,098
The soft tofu stew here is amazing.

121
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,866
Is it?

122
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,831
Then I'll have stir-fried squid with rice.

123
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,532
I had soft tofu stew for breakfast.

124
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:02,666
Oh, I see.

125
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,399
The rest of you will have soft tofu stew, right?

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,100
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

127
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,099
You'll have soft tofu stew, right?

128
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,665
No, I'll have kimchi stew.

129
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,833
I had soft tofu stew for breakfast.

130
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:11,566
What?

131
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,599
CEO Yoo also said he had that for breakfast.

132
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,467
What a great coincidence!

133
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,899
How is this a great coincidence?

134
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,999
Are you saying we had breakfast together or something?

135
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:26,066
What?

136
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,965
Among the fifty million Korean citizens,

137
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:30,966
do you think only she and I ate soft tofu stew for breakfast this morning?

138
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,566
There'd be thousands, no, tens of thousands.

139
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,766
Did all those people have breakfast with me?

140
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:36,965
Should I be misunderstood like that?

141
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,032
No, I didn't mean...

142
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:41,570
I'm saying this in case you do misunderstand!

143
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,264
The bazaar is a huge annual event.

144
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:59,731
We help the disadvantaged and promote our magazine.

145
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,331
We brainstormed for more creative ideas.

146
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:05,531
And?

147
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:10,199
It'll be great if you do free real estate consultation.

148
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,366
We did well, right?

149
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,465
- Did you just say "free"? 
 - Yes.

150
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,331
Do you know how much I charge by the hour?

151
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:22,134
But for the success of our bazaar...

152
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:24,600
Will you do it?

153
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,920
Please?

154
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,532
All right.

155
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,065
I'll do it as a talent donation to people ignorant of real estate.

156
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:38,065
Proceed.

157
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:40,900
All right! Thank you!

158
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,634
Awesome!

159
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,600
I told you he would say yes.

160
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,570
Thank you.

161
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,099
What are you doing?

162
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,666
I'm sorry. You're eating.

163
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:59,132
I smell the same shampoo from Editor Na and Yoo.

164
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:00,331
Hold on.

165
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:02,733
It's Kerastin, right?

166
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:03,733
Also Kerastin, Editor Na.

167
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:06,666
Right? Right?

168
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,733
I have a great sense of smell.

169
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,099
- Right? 
 - Right.

170
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,865
What a great coincidence!

171
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,465
Not again! How is this a great coincidence?

172
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:19,100
Are you saying Editor Na and I live together?

173
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,198
Among the fifty million Korean citizens,

174
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:24,164
do you think only she and I washed our hair with Kerastin?

175
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:26,864
There'd be thousands, no, tens of thousands.

176
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,665
Do all those people live with me?

177
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:29,699
Should I be misunderstood like that?

178
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,000
No, I wasn't...

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,732
I'm saying this in case you do misunderstand!

180
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,867
Oh, well, I just smelled the same shampoo.

181
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,066
I have a great sense of smell.

182
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,700
That sense of smell is useless!

183
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,833
What's up with him?

184
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,701
If we didn't know better, we would think he actually lived with Editor Na.

185
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,366
Did you call for me?

186
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:08,167
- Why are you so careless? 
 - Me?

187
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,667
Are you going to broadcast...

188
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,799
that we live together to everyone?

189
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,599
When did I...

190
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,365
What would you have done without me?

191
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:18,032
If it weren't for my quick wit

192
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:21,320
and crisis handling skills, everyone would've found out

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,466
that we're living together.

194
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,899
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,599
Be careful from now on.

196
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:32,450
Cultivate crisis handling skills like me.

197
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:40,964
Crisis handling skills, my foot.

198
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:44,332
We almost got caught because of you.

199
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:49,065
Wow, there is so much variety.

200
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:51,666
Are these the donated items for the bazaar?

201
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,233
Yes.

202
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,131
The response from our readers is great.

203
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:58,965
Robust PR on paper and social media did it.

204
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:00,499
Just a second.

205
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,331
Okay. Keep up the good work.

206
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,590
Hello, Artist Myeong!

207
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:08,299
I also brought some stuff for the flea market.

208
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:11,132
I dry-cleaned them all.

209
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:12,732
You brought so much.

210
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:14,833
I wanted to help the disadvantaged, too.

211
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,065
I brought everything I don't wear.

212
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:20,131
But... this is totally new.

213
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:22,433
No way! That's a super expensive brand.

214
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,600
You know it.

215
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,933
- What are you doing? 
 - Okay, got it!

216
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:30,834
Hey.

217
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,932
My cutie pie likes this.

218
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,231
Can you sell this to me?

219
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,766
I won't sell it to you.

220
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,300
You know why.

221
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:41,633
I'm sorry about earlier.

222
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,633
I take back what I said about you deserving to be rejected.

223
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,499
I apologize.

224
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,633
Well, then.

225
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,299
Okay, I'll be kind.

226
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,766
- I'll sell it to you. 
 - Really?

227
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:53,298
How much were you going to sell it for?

228
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,899
₩80,000 ($80).

229
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,732
But since it's you...

230
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,400
Yes, give me a discount. ₩50,000 ($50)?

231
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
₩100,000 ($100).

232
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,099
What?

233
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,832
You said you were thinking of ₩80,000.

234
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,798
Yes.

235
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,999
But since it's you, ₩100,000.

236
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,698
No? Then forget it.

237
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:10,799
Come on, I said I apologize.

238
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,766
Give me a discount.

239
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,699
- How about ₩60,000 ($60)? 
 - ₩100,000.

240
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,465
Come on, give me a discount.

241
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,966
- ₩70,000 ($70)? 
 - ₩100,000.

242
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,566
Okay, okay, ₩100,000.

243
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,940

244
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,560
 Should I tell him I'll be late?

245
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,300
 I have to work overtime, so I'll be late...

246
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,033
Is this overdoing it?

247
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,180
Yes, it is.

248
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,833
 I changed the code to the front door.

249
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,267
He said it's okay because there's nothing to steal.

250
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,367
Why change it all of a sudden?

251
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:15,033
 5721763352324371!

252
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:18,360
Why is it so long and complicated?

253
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:27,750
She'll be here soon.

254
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:39,133
When my cutie pie wears this, she'll look so glamorous.

255
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,433
What's this?

256
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:51,766
She's so forgetful.

257
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:57,434
Two... Four... Six?

258
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:02,333
How can she leave ₩300,000 in her jacket?

259
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:07,250
Okay! I'll give it to her tomorrow and get her to buy lunch.

260
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,710

261
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,232
It's such a scary world.

262
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:22,750
It's good that the culprit was caught.

263
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,570
 There's been a report of a break-in recently in our area. The culprit was said to have waited for a time when the woman would be alone.

264
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,620
 Did he change the password because of me?

265
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,931
She should've told me if she was going to be late.

266
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,366
I shouldn't have let her stay with me.

267
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:59,799
So troublesome.

268
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,570
I'm so annoyed.

269
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:11,650
Did something happen to her on her way home?

270
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:33,970
Five. Seven. Two. One.

271
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,020
Where was I?

272
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,498
I have to start over.

273
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,166
Again.

274
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:52,566
Five. Seven.

275
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,133
Six, three, three, five.

276
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,899
Yikes.

277
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:59,665
Are you planning to come in before the day is over?

278
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:01,770
You're telling me.

279
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,399
I was immersed in reading.

280
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,332
Must you disturb me like this?

281
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,665
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:17,766
The code is so long that it's hard to memorize.

283
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,199
It is?

284
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,766
It's easy if you memorize it like this.

285
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,399
The lot area of this place is 57,330㎡.

286
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,732
Convert it to pyeong and it's 17,342.325!

287
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,931
The building area is 11,131㎡.

288
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:31,932
Convert it to pyeong and it's 3,367.1275!

289
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:34,132
Put that in a sequence and flip it over.

290
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:37,565
Then it's 5721763352324371.

291
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:41,033
What do you think? Easy, right?

292
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,399
Yes, sure.

293
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:44,799
Oh, I changed the code because

294
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,165
I remembered I have key real estate information

295
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,032
in my study that is worth more than ten billion won.

296
00:18:49,032 --> 00:18:50,399
No other reason.

297
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,699
Then, goodbye.

298
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,620
Bye.

299
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:02,300
I didn't ask.

300
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,331
 Did you work hard today to achieve the goal of buying your own home?

301
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:10,631
 Are you, by any chance, spending money,

302
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,420
 swayed by love and dating?

303
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,032
 You make me... care.

304
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,267
 It'll continue to be like that.

305
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:22,732
 My sights are set much further.

306
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:26,032
 Since I, Gaeryong Yoo Ja-sung, am working hard...

307
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,540
 Are you feeling okay?

308
00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:33,164
 I changed the code to the front door.

309
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:34,133
 No other reason.

310
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,598
 That's it for today's video.

311
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,164
 Have you not liked or subscribed yet?

312
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:41,132
 If you don't want to be a homeowner, then do whatever you like.

313
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:43,366
 Goodbye.

314
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:45,032
What?

315
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:47,433
When did this end?

316
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,900
Why do I keep thinking about CEO Yoo?

317
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,666
This won't do.

318
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,610
I should go to bed.

319
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:08,565
 I have a lot on my mind tonight.

320
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:11,832
 It might be because I'm at a different place right now.

321
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:15,999
 Wherever that place may be, I hope you get some rest.

322
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,399
What?

323
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,680
It's Dragon.

324
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,860
♫  I like the bright mornings. You like the starry nights  ♫

325
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,000
♫  We’re so different  ♫

326
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,532
 You're surprised by my DM, right?

327
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:32,765
 I wanted to ask you, are you free the day after tomorrow?

328
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,366
 I'm an editor at Monthly Magazine House.

329
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,299
 We're hosting a bazaar.

330
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,832
 I'd like to invite you.

331
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:43,966
 Thank you for the invitation, but I'm busy...

332
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:46,299
 That's too bad.

333
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:49,732
 I hope to see you some other time.

334
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,832
 Sure... Goodbye...

335
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:54,166
 I'm always rooting for you.

336
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,230
 Thank you...

337
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,820
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

338
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,350
♫  You know this too  ♫

339
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,000

340
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,031
Editor Yeo!

341
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,899
Editor Yeo! Editor Yeo!

342
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,200
What?

343
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:21,064
- The jacket from yesterday... 
 - ₩100,000.

344
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:21,967
No, that's not...

345
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,531
I know what you're going to say.

346
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,832
Never.

347
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:26,400
I already donated that money,

348
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,700
so don't bring up the jacket again.

349
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:37,666
What? She has no clue.

350
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,233
Wait.

351
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,065
Do I have to return the money to her?

352
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:45,931
She brought it to the flea market.

353
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:48,900
Someone else would've pocketed the money.

354
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,765
Right, Sang Soon?

355
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:52,966
Of course, Sang Soon.

356
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,932
Wow, smells good! Yes.

357
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:57,599
Wow, good!

358
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,299
 Can you have dinner at home?

359
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,632
 I want to repay your kindness somehow.

360
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:05,799
 I'd like to cook for you.

361
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,132
How bothersome!

362
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:13,499
She's being so troublesome.

363
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,065
So troublesome.

364
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,264
 See you at home at 7 p.m.

365
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:23,565
What?

366
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,867
What should I cook?

367
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,899
- Sunbae! 
 - Yes.

368
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,666
Young Won.

369
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,899
Do you want to have dinner with me?

370
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,633
My boyfriend will be tied up at work.

371
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,299
I don't think I can tonight.

372
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:40,232
I'm meeting with the friend I'm staying with...

373
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,533
Then I could join you.

374
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,465
- What? 
 - I'll buy.

375
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:46,566
I was going to meet my friend,

376
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,632
but my mom suddenly asked me to come

377
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,799
so I have to go.

378
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,198
Are you going to Chuncheon?

379
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,665
You'll eat spicy stir-fried chicken then!

380
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:53,966
I'm craving it, too.

381
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:55,198
I'll tag along.

382
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:58,031
But we won't be eating that.

383
00:22:58,032 --> 00:22:59,165
Because...

384
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,232
My mom doesn't like spicy stir-fried chicken.

385
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:04,533
Why not? It's so delicious.

386
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,999
Then I'll just eat it in Seoul.

387
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,234
Who should I eat it with?

388
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:16,199
Take a look at this.

389
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,099
- What is that? 
 - What do you think?

390
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,765
A promo text for plastic surgery.

391
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:22,531
How can he send spam to the woman

392
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:25,165
he rejected to her face at a blind date?

393
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,466
Minister Hwang Hui of Doctors Without Borders?

394
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:30,599
Oh, well, that's totally understandable...

395
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:33,399
Not!

396
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:34,765
That bastard!

397
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:37,532
He should be scolded by the late Minister Hwang Hui.

398
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,966
Unbelievable!

399
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,598
- What are you doing? 
 - What do you think?

400
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:42,933
I'm going to set him straight.

401
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,000
Hey!

402
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,866
How dare you insult our Editor Yeo!

403
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,431
Do you know how precious she is?

404
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,765
Do you know what a gem she is?

405
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,698
Stop that! Why go overboard?

406
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,899
Forget it!

407
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,799
You're no friend of mine.

408
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,300
How dare you...

409
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:06,067
Hi, Mom. I'll call you later.

410
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:08,299
What was that? What was that act?

411
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:09,800
Next time...

412
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,800
When I meet him, I'll tell him off.

413
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,266
This was just practice.

414
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:19,198
Well, that did make me feel better.

415
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:22,432
Right, right, right?

416
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:24,299
Editor Nam, you're unbelievable.

417
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,899
Why take my side all of a sudden?

418
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,264
Yes.

419
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:31,065
What?

420
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:32,832
Is it...

421
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:35,865
because Sunbae's jacket

422
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,867
impressed your girlfriend so much?

423
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:44,098
Right? Right?

424
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:45,899
So you're grateful to Sunbae, right?

425
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,932
Yes, right.

426
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:49,499
I knew it.

427
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,899
Yes, yes, yes. You should be grateful.

428
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,232
It's originally super expensive.

429
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:56,032
Right.

430
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:08,601
Are these items for the auction in tomorrow's bazaar?

431
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:12,832
Yes, sir. This baby will make the biggest sale.

432
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:17,132
Oh! This is the bag donated by the designer label Guccia.

433
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:20,632
It'll be at least ₩2 million. Incredible, right?

434
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,066
Since you mention incredible,

435
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:25,233
it'll be incredible to gift it to my cutie pie.

436
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,366
Okay! I'm participating in the auction.

437
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:28,832
Wait.

438
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,065
I called dibs on this.

439
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,998
- Editor Nam! Don't touch. 
 - What?

440
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,931
It's totally my style.

441
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,632
I called dibs on this, so don't even think about it.

442
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:38,966
How dare you...

443
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,031
Say such an obvious thing.

444
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:43,832
I won't participate.

445
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,799
You buy it, Editor Yeo.

446
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,799
You all heard her. Don't even think about it.

447
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,899
Or else, I'll scold you.

448
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,299
Stop it.

449
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,634
Why are you going overboard?

450
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:57,332
Why? He got a one million won jacket for just ₩100,000.

451
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,698
He earned ₩900,000 ($900).

452
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:00,501
 Plus ₩300,000 ($300).

453
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:04,532
No. It's not new, so in the used market, it'll be over ₩500,000 ($500).

454
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:07,665
 Whatever it is, plus ₩300,000 ($300).

455
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,365
You made a lot of money, Editor Nam.

456
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:11,999
It's no wonder you're so grateful.

457
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,633
Of course!

458
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:18,000
Editor Yeo. I'm so, so, so thankful!

459
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,401
It's prettier the more I look at it.

460
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:35,799
- What do you think about it? 
 - It's so pretty.

461
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,232
Then delay buying your own home for a few months and buy it.

462
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:44,365
If you participate in the auction, I'll give up on it.

463
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:46,565
No, it's okay.

464
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:50,366
I'm satisfied with just looking at it up close.

465
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:54,632
It's so pretty, right?

466
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,732
I must've worked too hard.

467
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,531
I need a drink.

468
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:06,633
How about we calmly go out for just one round of drinks?

469
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:08,698
I have a previous engagement.

470
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:11,699
I'll be going now. Bye.

471
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:14,833
Today's my father's birthday.

472
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,566
Drink with me.

473
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,366
I can't meet up with my boyfriend tonight.

474
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:21,165
Let's have spicy stir-fried chicken for snacks.

475
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,966
- You buy the drinks then. 
 - What?

476
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:24,598
The person who decides the snacks should buy.

477
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:26,466
Chief Editor!

478
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:28,900
- You buy. 
 - What?

479
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,899
How long are you going to make Editor Yeo buy?

480
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:34,732
You traitor! Did I tell you to buy? Why are you overreacting?

481
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:38,831
You know Editor Yeo struggles because she can't pay her credit card bills.

482
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:41,899
But she still donates clothes to help the poor.

483
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,399
She's a gem.

484
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,565
She's more dazzling than a diamond.

485
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:48,499
You should buy her a drink, not make her buy!

486
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,765
You're heartless.

487
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,431
- Jeez. 
 - Sheesh.

488
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:55,465
All right, all right. I'll buy. Happy?

489
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,799
You heard him, right? Eat up. I'll be going now.

490
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,633
Bye...

491
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,365
What's up with him?

492
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:04,632
Editor Na.

493
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:06,098
Photographer Shin!

494
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:08,098
I heard from Editor Yeo when we were shooting.

495
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:09,866
You're going to Chuncheon?

496
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:10,900
Well...

497
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,766
I'll drive you there.

498
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:13,932
Pardon?

499
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,264
To Chuncheon?

500
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:16,632
Oh, no. It's okay.

501
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,264
Please don't refuse.

502
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:21,932
Thank you, but it's really okay.

503
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,899
I wanted to go for a drive, honestly.

504
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,634
Here. Get in.

505
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,399
No, no, It's really okay.

506
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,632
I'm not okay.

507
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:29,999
I'm not refusing...

508
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,132
I said I'm not okay.

509
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:33,434
But I'm really okay.

510
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,966
It's okay to go all the way to Chuncheon.

511
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,166
Oh, no. It's okay.

512
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:47,599
I'm so grateful that you're taking me to the bus terminal.

513
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,899
Drop me off over there.

514
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,598
I can't do that.

515
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,232
I'll park and wait until you get on the bus.

516
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,865
Oh, no, that's unnecessary.

517
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,000
Let me out over there.

518
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,666
- No, I'll see you get on the bus... 
 - Let me out!

519
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:00,966
Pardon?

520
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,198
I'm sorry. I feel... like I'm causing you so much trouble, so...

521
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,433
Right...

522
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:11,399
All right.

523
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,632
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

524
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,500
Have a safe trip.

525
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,632
 I probably won't run into him if I leave now.

526
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,399
My bag.

527
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,733
Editor Na!

528
00:29:56,265 --> 00:29:58,732
Thank you. I keep burdening you.

529
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:00,667
No, you're not.

530
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,865
You can go now.

531
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:06,332
I already parked the car. I'll wait until the bus comes.

532
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,765
It's okay.

533
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,733
Oh, right. I didn't buy the ticket.

534
00:30:10,734 --> 00:30:13,131
It'll take a while. So you should leave...

535
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:14,698
I bought it.

536
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,366
The earliest bus.

537
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,032
What? Why did you...?

538
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:22,198
Since you left your bag, I figured you wouldn't have time to buy a ticket.

539
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:23,431
I'll send it to you.

540
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:24,867
Okay.

541
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,966
Thank you.

542
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:35,966
 I'm sorry. Due to unavoidable circumstances, I'll be a little late.

543
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,800
So why say you'll cook for a busy person like me?

544
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,632
So troublesome.

545
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,432
I'm so annoyed.

546
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:47,332
May I take your order?

547
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:49,932
A cake that's most popular with the ladies.

548
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,333
Yes, sir.

549
00:30:56,432 --> 00:30:58,399
Give and take,

550
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,765
since that's my philosophy.

551
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:02,466
So troublesome.

552
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,931
I'm so annoyed.

553
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:09,220
And a bottle of champagne that's popular with the ladies.

554
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,766
I'll be going now.

555
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:15,631
You really can go now.

556
00:31:15,631 --> 00:31:17,098
I'll go after I see you leave.

557
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:18,365
Oh, no.

558
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:19,699
Nonsense. The parking fee will be too much.

559
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:20,368
Go now.

560
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,098
The bus to Chuncheon will leave now.

561
00:31:22,098 --> 00:31:24,790
Oh! Get on the bus.

562
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,366
Too much kindness

563
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:38,560
is making me want to cuss.

564
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:52,400
Sir!

565
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:55,567
I'm sorry, but can you let me off here?

566
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,032
It's against regulation to stop at a non-bus stop.

567
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:00,299
I have urgent business.

568
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,960
Please?

569
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:10,540

570
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,400

571
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,134
Sir.

572
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:28,266
I'm so sorry.

573
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:32,967
An unbelievably unavoidable circumstance occurred.

574
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,865
I don't think I'll be able to make it tonight.

575
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:38,032
Is that so? That's a relief.

576
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:42,165
Something important came up, so I was about to call you.

577
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm busy, so I'll hang up now.

578
00:32:57,766 --> 00:33:00,565
Yes, yes. I just sent it.

579
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:03,032
I understand. It's the time difference.

580
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:06,300
Yes, okay. Bye.

581
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,532
Why you little...

582
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:13,499
At times like these, I hate doing overseas lodging articles.

583
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:15,390
What a headache!

584
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,965
 Everyone says this looks good on me.

585
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,366
 Be nice to Editor Yeo.

586
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:25,167
 Okay?

587
00:33:26,432 --> 00:33:28,132
Okay.

588
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:31,333
I should be nice to her.

589
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:34,433
I shouldn't be doing this.

590
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,433
Right, Sang Soon?

591
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,790
Of course, Sang Soon.

592
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,066
Good.

593
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:51,080
 This was in your jacket. Nam Sang Soon.

594
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,380
Good job, Sang Soon.

595
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:18,550
What's keeping her? It's so late.

596
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:23,999
 What happened to you?

597
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:26,620
 Is there something wrong...

598
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,430

599
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,432
Hey! Editor Nam!

600
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:05,833
What's up?

601
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,866
The dry cleaners called me this morning.

602
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:09,532
They said they forgot to tell me,

603
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:13,065
but there was ₩300,000 in the pocket so they put it right back.

604
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,732
How dare you take my money?

605
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:15,931
Hold on now.

606
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:16,833
Yesterday, I...

607
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,899
Yesterday what?

608
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:21,565
So that's why you were nice to me.

609
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:24,298
I wondered why you were acting strange.

610
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:28,366
You also made me buy drinks.

611
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,366
You're such a miscreant!

612
00:35:30,366 --> 00:35:31,132
How can you say that?

613
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:32,666
Shame on you!

614
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,833
Listen to me. So yesterday, I...

615
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:35,798
Forget it!

616
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:36,965
Give me my money.

617
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:37,833
Give me my ₩300,000...

618
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:38,867
I did!

619
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:41,298
I put it in your drawer yesterday!

620
00:35:41,298 --> 00:35:42,699
What?

621
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,698
Come take a look.

622
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,033
See?

623
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,265
It's gone.

624
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:49,599
What a laugh.

625
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,565
How dare you pretend, you petty thief!

626
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,198
Wait... wait... wait. Wait.

627
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,499
- Hey, let go. Let go. 
 - Calm down.

628
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,665
Let go.

629
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,064
Don't stop her. He deserves it.

630
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:59,132
I really put it in here.

631
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,500
But it's not there.

632
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,131
Are you saying there's another thief?

633
00:36:03,131 --> 00:36:05,499
That nonsense won't work. Give me my money!

634
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,467
And my money for drinks.

635
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:07,667
But...

636
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,165
The car has arrived.

637
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,166
Yes?

638
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,332
Let's go.

639
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:13,666
You have until today.

640
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,668
Give me my money.

641
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:17,133
And my money for drinks.

642
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,966
Unbelievable.

643
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,540

644
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,110

645
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,630

646
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,350

647
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,590

648
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,930

649
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,999
Move the boxes.

650
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,599
Help out in the parking lot.

651
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,833
So many cars are coming in.

652
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,898
Oh, the banner is wrinkling.

653
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,466
Pull on both sides.

654
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,765
We can't have our name all wrinkled.

655
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:50,699
Pull. Pull.

656
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,330
Good. Tie it now.

657
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:00,732
I feel sorry for you.

658
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:04,098
You're in charge of the toughest booth, the flea market.

659
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,599
Oh, I forgot to say.

660
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,665
If the flea market does better than last year, as the chief editor,

661
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:11,932
I'll give you a ₩100,000 gift card!

662
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:12,901
- Really? 
 - Really?

663
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,899
You should've said that sooner.

664
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,232
Then I would've taken on the flea market.

665
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:18,232
You're so greedy for money.

666
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:20,565
Steal the gift card, why don't you?

667
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:22,233
I didn't steal. I left it in your drawer.

668
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:25,432
Whatever. Wire my ₩300,000 by today.

669
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:27,532
And my money for drinks.

670
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:28,431
Seriously!

671
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:31,133
I put it in her drawer!

672
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:33,865
What the?

673
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:35,699
Why is he acting upset?

674
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,332
Oh? The CEO is here.

675
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:38,833
What?

676
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,099
Focus on the bazaar.

677
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:43,933
Sir!

678
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,465
I'll promote the flea market to my customers.

679
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:50,565
Get the gift card and buy a bag.

680
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:53,032
I saw a lot of good stuff at the flea market.

681
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:56,898
If I get the gift card, I want to buy a gift for the friend I'm staying with.

682
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:58,734
What?

683
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,933
Young Won.

684
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:02,632
Are you going to use that bag forever?

685
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,432
What will I do with you?

686
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,933
We expect a bigger turnout than last year.

687
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,232
Carry out the event without any mistakes.

688
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:15,440
Of course, sir.

689
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,510
♫  Just listen here we are again  ♫

690
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,070
♫  Through the fire through the rain  ♫

691
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,950
♫  The roads we crossed  ♫

692
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,820

693
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,120

694
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,230
♫  And I still feel the same  ♫

695
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,840
A 30% discount.

696
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,260
♫  Story of us  ♫

697
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,710
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

698
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,560
♫  Stay with me until the die  ♫

699
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,300

700
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,166
Come see the flea market!

701
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:50,866
You'll get hoarse.

702
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:53,200
Wow, thank you!

703
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,999
You have so many customers.

704
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,231
Why shout for more?

705
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:57,365
Take it easy.

706
00:38:57,366 --> 00:39:00,966
If I want to raise sales, I must work harder.

707
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,165
What in the world are you getting for your friend?

708
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:06,433
I'm thinking about it.

709
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:09,265
A curtain would look pretty on the windows.

710
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,366
Stop your delusion.

711
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:16,550
You can't be a homeowner if you take care of the people around you with your budget.

712
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,099
If you really want to be a homeowner, just think about saving money.

713
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,666
Money!

714
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,760
Next.

715
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,250
His place needs kitchen utensils, too.

716
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,466
No.

717
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:43,370
Should I buy him a lamp?

718
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,300
I'm torn. Torn.

719
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,933
Why be torn about that?

720
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,732
Your goal is to stop paying monthly rent.

721
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:54,165
Love and dating are a luxury.

722
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,480
Just focus on saving money! Money!

723
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,220
Next.

724
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,500
 Rest when you're on a break.

725
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,732
Do you have to speak like that?

726
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:18,632
Why not use nicer words?

727
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,064
Forget it.

728
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:23,765
Beating around the bush, giving false hope isn't my style.

729
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:25,499
Will you do that when you have a girlfriend?

730
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,365
Will you do that to your girlfriend?

731
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:29,666
I wouldn't do that to my girlfriend.

732
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,432
Because I wouldn't have one.

733
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:32,766
Don't be too sure of yourself.

734
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,966
Anything can happen.

735
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:41,100
I didn't know I'd like someone so much like this.

736
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,031
Are you talking about the girl you like again?

737
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:45,532
What? Oh, well...

738
00:40:45,532 --> 00:40:47,898
Fine. You live like that.

739
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:51,299
But I won't.

740
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:53,832
Thank you.

741
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,490

742
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,665
What's this?

743
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,865
 These malicious comments are everywhere.

744
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:12,366
 Who's doing this?

745
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:14,565
 It's a ghost handle, so we don't know.

746
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:18,565
 Did the CEO see this? He'll be upset.

747
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,499
 Our future will be more upsetting.

748
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,232
 We pushed him to do the counseling booth.

749
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:27,265
 If he finds out he's getting nasty comments, we're screwed.

750
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:30,298
 Nothing's happened. He must not have seen them.

751
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:34,399
 Call and tell the digital team to delete it.

752
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:35,866
 Yes, sir.

753
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:39,700
I hope he hasn't seen it.

754
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,799
But who did it?

755
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:45,233
They don't even know him.

756
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,132
Sir!

757
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:54,368
You can't leave in the middle of counseling...

758
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:57,000
Stop. I told you I have urgent business.

759
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,132
Take care of the rest, Chief Editor.

760
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:00,933
Yes, but...

761
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:02,798
You will be back, right?

762
00:42:02,798 --> 00:42:06,231
We really need you at the auction.

763
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,932
I'll be back by then.

764
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:09,733
Yes, sir.

765
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,800
What urgent business could it be?

766
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,130
He didn't say anything, so I don't think it's because of the comments.

767
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:29,930

768
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,360

769
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,366
The comments are not only on our page,

770
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:38,866
but also on those tagged to Monthly Magazine House.

771
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:41,666
Why are they doing this?

772
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:43,833
It'll be chaos if the CEO finds out.

773
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,600
There's a photo like this too.

774
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,100

775
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,565
What's this?

776
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,665
What an attention seeker!

777
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,499
The handwriting is peculiar.

778
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:57,866
If we investigate the handwriting, we can catch him.

779
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,465
You're right.

780
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:03,299
We should get the handwriting of everyone here and request NISI for a forensic.

781
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:05,365
We could catch the culprit this time next year.

782
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:09,266
We'll get tortured by the CEO until then.

783
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:10,666
What?

784
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:13,399
You can see a mirror sold at the booth.

785
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:16,432
There's a reflection.

786
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:19,132
It's very hazy and good.

787
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:20,865
Request NISI for a forensic.

788
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:23,132
We could catch the culprit in two years.

789
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,898
We'll get tortured by the CEO until then.

790
00:43:25,899 --> 00:43:28,766
They do that on all the TV shows.

791
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,499
I just saw the text.

792
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:32,598
There's a photo?

793
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:36,200
Show me. Who would do such a thing?

794
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,970

795
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,970

796
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:09,000

797
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:41,332
You did this, right?

798
00:44:41,332 --> 00:44:42,866
Delete all the mean comments.

799
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:44,231
What are you talking about?

800
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:45,065
I didn't do that.

801
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:46,265
Really?

802
00:44:46,265 --> 00:44:49,765
Then let me check your phone.

803
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,332
Darn it. Hey!

804
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:17,166
Move, move.

805
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,999
- Hey! 
 - Sorry. Excuse me.

806
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,532
Move.

807
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,866
What the...?

808
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:29,032
What's going on?

809
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:31,167
What's going on? Who is it?

810
00:45:49,132 --> 00:45:51,198
It's a relief it ended at that.

811
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:52,499
Are you really okay?

812
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,632
Yes.

813
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,398
But is Chan okay?

814
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:57,131
He's totally fine.

815
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:59,665
He's setting up to shoot the auction.

816
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:00,832
I'm glad to hear that.

817
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,665
You'll be going, too, right?

818
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:06,064
No, I have something else I have to do.

819
00:46:06,065 --> 00:46:07,666
You go on ahead.

820
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,300
Okay. See you later.

821
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,160

822
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:24,833
What should I buy him?

823
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,432
Is Editor Na okay?

824
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:35,633
Except for the scratch on her wrist, she's fine.

825
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:37,466
Really? That's a relief.

826
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:40,031
Since she caught the troll,

827
00:46:40,032 --> 00:46:42,632
give her the gift card regardless of sales.

828
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,232
I already gave it to her.

829
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:49,332
By the way, where is the CEO? The auction is about to start.

830
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,267
What did Secretary Hwang say?

831
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,434
He dropped the CEO off. He'll be here soon.

832
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:58,165
But what urgent business did the CEO have?

833
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:01,132
He mentioned a tenant refusing to move out.

834
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:03,899
I think he left so that he wouldn't suffer a loss.

835
00:47:03,899 --> 00:47:05,965
What?

836
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:08,732
Is that urgent business? Enough to stop the counseling booth?

837
00:47:08,733 --> 00:47:10,531
It was free.

838
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:13,399
What makes money is more important to him.

839
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:15,799
That's unbelievable.

840
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,967
No wonder he got nasty comments.

841
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:20,432
If you think about it, it's really a fact.

842
00:47:20,432 --> 00:47:22,430
A fact attack.

843
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,220

844
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:38,265
Next is the highlight of this event.

845
00:47:38,265 --> 00:47:41,365
A limited edition donated by designer label Guccia.

846
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:42,398
Guccia?

847
00:47:42,399 --> 00:47:44,398
We'll start the bid at ₩200,000 ($200).

848
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:45,933
- ₩200,000! 
 - ₩200,000.

849
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:47,933
- ₩220,000! ($220) 
 - ₩220,000.

850
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:50,565
- ₩250,000 ($250)! 
 - ₩250,000.

851
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:54,566
- Any more bids? 
 - There won't be. ₩250,000 will do it.

852
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:58,500
- ₩300,000 ($300)! 
 - I have ₩300,000.

853
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:00,832
- ₩310,000 ($310)! 
 - ₩310,000.

854
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,331
- You're bidding with my ₩300,000? 
 - ₩320,000!

855
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:05,432
- I have ₩320,000 ($320). 
 - It's not your money.

856
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:07,866
What's this? You said you wouldn't participate.

857
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:11,032
- Why participate? 
 - That's before I was unfairly branded a thief.

858
00:48:11,032 --> 00:48:13,031
- That bag is my cutie pie's. 
 - Are there no more bids?

859
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:15,466
- You petty thief! 
 - ₩330,000 ($330).

860
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:16,531
₩350,000 ($350)!

861
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:18,499
- ₩350,000. 
 - Why you!

862
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,280
- ₩400,000 ($400). 
 - I have KRW 400,000.

863
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,430
₩500,000 ($500)!

864
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,832
- What the? 
 - I have ₩500,000.

865
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,367
- What are you doing? 
 - Buy the bag and tell her how you feel.

866
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,698
Buy it. Think about the aftermath later.

867
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:29,532
You!

868
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,099
Photographer Shin?

869
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:32,499
Are you buying it for your girlfriend?

870
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,733
What? Oh, no.

871
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,665
He was pranking me.

872
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,498
- Prank? 
 - Why prank?

873
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,165
You're dead!

874
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,800
- No more bids? 
 - Hey, Shin Gyeom!

875
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:46,099
That timid fool.

876
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:48,732
What? Why are there no bids?

877
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,499
Do I have to buy that?

878
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,132
- ₩510,000 ($510)! 
 - ₩520,000 ($520).

879
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,133
₩520,000.

880
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:56,565
If you have a conscience, then back off.

881
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,366
₩530,000 ($530)!

882
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,698
I told you I returned it.

883
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,131
₩535,000 ($535)!

884
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:01,966
₩537,000 ($537)!

885
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:03,766
Back off! I'm going to kill you.

886
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:05,231
Kill me, kill me. I dare you.

887
00:49:05,232 --> 00:49:07,665
- You're embarrassing me. 
 - Kill me, I dare you.

888
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:10,333
- ₩ 540,000 ($540)! 
 - ₩1 million ($1,000)!

889
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:13,333
I have ₩1 million.

890
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,166
Are there any more bids?

891
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,630

892
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,832
There. Okay.

893
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:26,632
It's going to rain later.

894
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,231
Let's wrap up and go get a drink.

895
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:29,299
Sure.

896
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,599
Where do you think you're going?

897
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,966
You can't go anywhere till I get my money back.

898
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,966
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

899
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:37,064
Stop holding out and wire the money right now.

900
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:40,066
You heard him. Wire it right now.

901
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,700
And my money for drinks!

902
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:48,732
How can you not believe me either?

903
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:51,398
I swear I put the money in her drawer.

904
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:53,365
So? It's not there.

905
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:56,665
I'm telling the truth! I put it in there!

906
00:49:56,665 --> 00:49:59,198
So? It's not there.

907
00:49:59,198 --> 00:50:00,832
This is so frustrating!

908
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,064
You're unbelievable.

909
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,999
The pot calls the CEO kettle black.

910
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,232
Even though the CEO is greedy for money, he doesn't play dirty like you did.

911
00:50:10,232 --> 00:50:11,932
Play dirty?

912
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:15,699
Wire Editor Yeo's money right now!

913
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,500
Who took it?

914
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,900
What kind of petty thief took it?

915
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,398
Let's go home.

916
00:50:29,399 --> 00:50:31,566
We must go get a drink.

917
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,033
Let's go.

918
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,165
Editor Nam sent the money.

919
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:38,833
Really?

920
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:41,265
He must've felt guilty.

921
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:43,633
Why isn't he sending my money for the drinks?

922
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800
- What? 
 - Why isn't this opening?

923
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:51,532
It's stuck?

924
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:55,599
It opened.

925
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,898
What's this?

926
00:50:56,899 --> 00:51:00,131
That must've got stuck in there. What is it?

927
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:02,380
This was in your jacket...

928
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:09,966
- Is that...? 
 - It must've gotten behind the drawer.

929
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,932
You should've looked more carefully!

930
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:14,399
Did you call someone a thief without checking?

931
00:51:14,399 --> 00:51:17,431
I wasn't the only one. You did that, too.

932
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:19,966
I never said I didn't! I know I did it, too.

933
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:24,266
What do we do when he finds out? He'll flip out.

934
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:26,867
You saw it, right?

935
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,533
I asked if you saw it!

936
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,232
Oh, well, Editor Nam...

937
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:36,740
The money I wired!

938
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:43,166
Oh, yes, I saw it.

939
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,399
Let me make this clear.

940
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:49,333
It's not because I admit I stole your money.

941
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:53,933
I sent it because being accused as a thief

942
00:51:53,933 --> 00:51:58,699
is making me angry and humiliated!

943
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:05,767
So I sent it to tell you to leave.

944
00:52:05,767 --> 00:52:07,790
Got it?

945
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:11,266
I'm going home now.

946
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:13,167
Editor Nam!

947
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,966
I'll buy dinner.

948
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:15,834
What?

949
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:19,133
I got my money, so I should buy dinner.

950
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,066
Forget it.

951
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:25,767
Will you buy Korean beef?

952
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,500
Yeah.

953
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:28,332
I'm going to eat ₩300,000 worth.

954
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,899
You're going down.

955
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:31,165
All right.

956
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:33,666
Korean beef? You're so dead.

957
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:37,030
You better watch out.

958
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:42,090
Hurry up!

959
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:00,964
What are you doing?

960
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:03,300
Oh, you're here.

961
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,233
I got this with the gift certificate Chief Editor gave me.

962
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:10,166
As a gift to you.

963
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:12,032
What do you think?

964
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,899
I heard what happened today.

965
00:53:23,899 --> 00:53:27,298
Oh, you heard.

966
00:53:27,298 --> 00:53:32,300
But sir, please don't be upset about mean comments.

967
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,833
That guy doesn't even know you.

968
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,199
- You're the one who doesn't know me. 
 - What?

969
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,899
Looks like you're misunderstanding again just because you lived with me for a couple of days.

970
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:42,266
I really am a bastard who only cares about money.

971
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,331
The comment was not wrong.

972
00:53:44,331 --> 00:53:45,866
I'm not concerned about it at all.

973
00:53:45,866 --> 00:53:49,366
Why are you unnecessarily fussing around?

974
00:53:49,366 --> 00:53:50,599
Unnecessarily?

975
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,199
I need to move out of here when it sells.

976
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,599
I live here because I don't want to waste money.

977
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,733
This is how much I focus on money.

978
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,732
Get rid of that right away.

979
00:54:00,732 --> 00:54:03,580
It'll become a nuisance when I move out.

980
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:15,466
I'm sorry.

981
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:28,540
♫  The fights and the scars repeat for the same reason  ♫

982
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,920
♫  I was so afraid of saying goodbye  ♫

983
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,165

984
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:40,730

985
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,030
♫  That I acted like I was fine  ♫

986
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,399
Forget it.

987
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:47,540
Just think about my goal.

988
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:53,930
♫  I’m so lonely and you were my only light  ♫

989
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,190
Why do I feel so disappointed?

990
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:03,599
I should feel angry in this situation. That would be normal.

991
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,490
But I only feel hurt and sad.

992
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:08,910
♫  Why are you leaving me alone?  ♫

993
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:14,190
♫  Why are you relying on my deepened faith 
 to give endless excuses?  ♫

994
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:22,130
♫  I want to leave everything behind and go next to you  ♫

995
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:28,350
♫  Because I think I can forget all the painful times  ♫

996
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:35,750
♫  I’m looking for you like this  ♫

997
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,450
♫  But where are you?  ♫

998
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:52,730
♫  Leaving me behind here?  ♫

999
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,367
You're here.

1000
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,198
Oh, it's raining.

1001
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,710
I set the table. Let's go in.

1002
00:56:14,032 --> 00:56:16,466
This rice wine reminds me of Dad.

1003
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:18,566
He always drank it when it rained.

1004
00:56:18,566 --> 00:56:21,099
Why bring him up?

1005
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:23,098
He ran away to save himself.

1006
00:56:23,098 --> 00:56:24,732
He didn't run away.

1007
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:27,500
Yes, he did.

1008
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,031
He left home, saying he would earn money.

1009
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:32,810
He hasn't called in more than ten years.

1010
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,166
What's wrong?

1011
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:41,666
You visit whenever there's something wrong.

1012
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,866
I do?

1013
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,833
Come to think of it,

1014
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:52,332
the fact that you're here waiting for me gives me great comfort.

1015
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:56,599
I use up all your money. What comfort am I?

1016
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:57,732
I only make it harder for you.

1017
00:56:57,732 --> 00:57:00,866
What are you talking about? Don't say that.

1018
00:57:00,866 --> 00:57:04,199
I really wanted to see you today.

1019
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:07,366
Let's toast.

1020
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:11,333
Let's toast.

1021
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,167
Cheers.

1022
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,710

1023
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:25,899
Hello? What's up?

1024
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:27,765
How's your wrist?

1025
00:57:27,765 --> 00:57:30,166
It's fine.

1026
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,800
What? Right now?

1027
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,566
Oh, I can't.

1028
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:36,265
I'm at my mother's house.

1029
00:57:36,265 --> 00:57:39,140
Oh, I see.

1030
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,700
You must be exhausted going all the way to Chuncheon.

1031
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,131
But seeing my mom made everything better.

1032
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,132
 That's good.

1033
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,333
By the way, Hyung isn't picking up his phone.

1034
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,298
I'm worried.

1035
00:57:54,298 --> 00:57:58,934
Did he hear about the malicious comments by any chance?

1036
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,999
Yes, he did.

1037
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:04,932
But I don't think you have to worry.

1038
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:06,798
He said he's okay.

1039
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,231
That the comments weren't wrong.

1040
00:58:08,232 --> 00:58:12,170
That makes me worry more.

1041
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,680
 Here.

1042
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,780
 Cleaning Service Available Any Time

1043
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,620
 Here. Enjoy it.

1044
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:36,032
 We'll save up and live in a house like that one day.

1045
00:58:36,032 --> 00:58:38,620
 Isn't this our house?

1046
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:42,730
 Let's eat.

1047
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,290

1048
00:58:56,367 --> 00:59:00,299
 Dad, wake up!

1049
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:01,699
 Mom!

1050
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:05,833
 Dad! Wake up!

1051
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:10,066
 Wake up! Mom! Dad!

1052
00:59:10,066 --> 00:59:13,850
 Wake up! Please!

1053
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:21,960

1054
00:59:24,433 --> 00:59:27,233
 I'm going to become rich.

1055
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:29,560
 I'm going to make a lot of money.

1056
00:59:43,733 --> 00:59:48,420
 I won't forget the pledge I made then.

1057
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:57,032
 And I forgot that today's the anniversary of his parents' death.

1058
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,300
 To achieve your goal, personal feelings are a luxury.

1059
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:35,433
 But when you get tired on the journey, you tend to yearn for warmth.

1060
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:44,100
 Of course, some endure it alone.

1061
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:05,732
 But they might be ignoring the fact that they are exhausted.

1062
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:41,367
You're here.

1063
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:52,633
 Today, I'd like to extend warmth to that person.

1064
01:01:52,633 --> 01:01:55,380
 And I want to say...

1065
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:06,533
Sir!

1066
01:02:13,834 --> 01:02:16,160
 Welcome home.

1067
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,520
 I've been waiting.

1068
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,430
♫  Here I am  ♫

1069

1079
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:15,931
 Editor Na got it as a gift! From a man!

1080
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:20,433
 If she meets him or dates him, I have no intention of getting involved.

1081
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,298
 What do you think? He's really handsome.

1082
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,998
 How can she leave when she did such a sloppy job?

1083
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:26,698
 He was totally jealous.

1084
01:03:26,698 --> 01:03:28,732
 The server for the subscription website shut down.

1085
01:03:28,732 --> 01:03:31,200
 So the announcement is delayed.

1086
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,132
 Editor Nam! Wake up! Wake up!

1087
01:03:33,132 --> 01:03:35,666
 Why ask me to pick out furniture for his place?

1088
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:38,331
 Then... was that really...?

1089
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:39,964
 Where should I put this?

1090
01:03:39,964 --> 01:03:40,520
 What?

1091
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,650
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

1092
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:45,510
♫  Stay with me until the die  ♫

1093
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:49,600
♫  Write the story of us  ♫

1094
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:57,960
