1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,460

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,150

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,030

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,430

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,540

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,170

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,690

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,680

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,430

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,980

11
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,800
You're here.

12
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,310
Sir!

13
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,220
♫  I want to leave everything behind and go next to you  ♫

14
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,440
♫  Because I think I can forget all the painful times  ♫

15
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,960
♫  I’m looking for you like this  ♫

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,090
♫  But where are you?  ♫

17
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,440
Thank you...

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,160
♫  But where are you?  ♫

19
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,980
for being home...

20
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
♫  are you?  ♫

21
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,610
for being by my side.

22
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,340
♫  Leaving me behind here?  ♫

23
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,800

24
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:55,167
Is he still asleep?

25
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,299
Oh, sir.

26
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:03,699
What are you doing here?

27
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,599
You said you'd be at your mother's house.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
Pardon?

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,666
You know that I came back last night.

30
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,933
Did you come back last night?

31
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,900
You even saw me.

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,200
Don't you remember?

34
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,200
Did I?

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,032
I must've been too drunk.

36
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,433
I see, so you don't...

37
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,132
remember...

38
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,533
Why?

39
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:36,533
Did I do something wrong?

40
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:40,432
No, you didn't.

41
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:43,100
Then I'll be off to work now.

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,665
How much did I drink?

43
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,500
 Thank you...

44
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,766
 for being home...

45
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:05,033
 for being by my side.

46
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,431
 It was just meaningless drunk talk.

47
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,800
  I got excited all by myself for nothing.

48
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,790
What was I expecting?

49
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,832
Incredible!

50
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:24,266
What do you call this color?

51
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,567
Stop.

52
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,099
Why aren't you all working?

53
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,733
Sir! Come take a look at this.

54
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:34,332
This is the bag that sold for 1 million won,

55
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,266
and Editor Na got it as a gift! From a man!

56
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:40,565
Some guy said he was a fan and asked for it to be delivered to her.

57
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,031
A male fan?

58
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,331
A man asked me to deliver it when I was cleaning up the equipment.

59
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,166
I envy you, Sunbaenim.

60
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,031
Are you sure this was just a simple gift from a fan?

61
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:53,366
And not because he's interested in her?

62
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,201
Really?!

63
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:57,100
Why else give such an expensive gift?

64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,798
- Don't you think so, Photographer Shin? 
 - What?

65
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,265
Oh, yes, I guess that's possible.

66
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,665
Stop.

67
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,999
Why are you making such a big deal?

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,131
Stop wasting time and get to work.

69
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,398
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,298
Why isn't this a big deal?

71
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,300
But let's get to work.

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,633
Good for you.

73
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,633
I envy you.

74
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you sighing?

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,765
Do you feel uncomfortable receiving this bag?

76
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,700
Yes.

77
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,432
What's the use of feeling uncomfortable?

78
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:31,699
Let this bag retire and hire this baby.

79
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,634
It's so pretty!

80
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,467
Oh? What's this?

81
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,520
There's a note.

82
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,470

83
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,233
 That's a relief.

84
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,067
 I'll continue to root for you.

85
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,100
 I'll always root for you! Fight on!

86
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,898
 Yes... Goodbye...

87
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,398
 I'm always rooting for you.

88
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,298
 I'm an editor at Monthly Magazine Home.

89
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,298
 We're hosting a bazaar.

90
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:14,134
 I'd like to invite you.

91
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:18,380
Could it be Dragon?

92
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,532

93
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:29,966
 Hi, Dragon. Sorry this is so abrupt, but did you come to the bazaar yesterday?

94
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:37,132
 Someone saying they're my fan sent me a gift.

95
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:40,390
 I was wondering if it was you.

96
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,490
 I think I told you I couldn't go.

97
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,766
So it wasn't Dragon.

98
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,999
 I'm sorry. My mistake.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,334
 Hope you have a great day.

100
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,320
What is she doing during work hours?

101
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:12,298
Why are you wandering around during work hours?

102
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,131
Oh, I went to the restroom...

103
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,232
You didn't go there to do something else?

104
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,199
What?

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,298
 He must be psychic. He really is.

106
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:23,199
I hope you're not neglecting your work because you're excited about that gift.

107
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,665
I'm warning you in advance.

108
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,966
Keep private and public matters separate.

109
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,631
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,966
Right.

111
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,900
Why haven't I received today's interview questions yet?

112
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,332
I emailed them to you the moment I got to work.

113
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,898
Then why didn't you tell me that?

114
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,332
That's true.

115
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:42,465
You are usually on top of those things. Why did you—

116
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:47,265
If you had trained her well, I wouldn't be yelling at her right now.

117
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,800
Sir?

118
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,199
Why's he taking it out on me?

119
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,332
I'm sorry I caused you problems.

120
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,565
No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

121
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:02,131
It wasn't even a huge mistake.

122
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,967
His temper is getting worse.

123
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,280
You can say that again.

124
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,298
Clean-cut and neat.

125
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:20,040
The questions are good and not superflous.

126
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,065
Right.

127
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:37,133
As long as she does her job, it's none of my business.

128
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:42,598
Use this as the main photo for the decorations booth.

129
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,433
You can choose the photo for the auction...

130
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,899
- Oh, right! 
 - What?

131
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,332
You must've caught the man on camera.

132
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,532
Young Won's fan who bought the bag.

133
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,231
Find him for me so I can show her.

134
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,866
Oh, yes, sure.

135
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,060
Just a sec.

136
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,000
That Nam Sang Soon is no help at all.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,532
What should I do?

138
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,366
These are the only pictures of him.

139
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,566
That's too bad.

140
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,366
- Then I'll be going now. 
 - Hey.

141
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,033
You know there's another photo.

142
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,798
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,199
You're a photographer.

144
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:25,665
How can you not remember what you took?

145
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,366
Move.

146
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,532
Found it.

147
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:34,900
That's him!

148
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,799
Wow, you got him good.

149
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,999
- Print it out for me. 
 - Sure.

150
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:41,165
Oh, there it was.

151
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,520
I forgot.

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,731
Wow, amazing.

153
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:50,632
He looks like a painting.

154
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,566
You really don't know him?

155
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:53,499
No.

156
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,200
Yes?

157
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,532
What do you think?

158
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,499
He's really handsome.

159
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,598
Forget it.

160
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,064
I have a lot to do today.

161
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:02,566
Please, leave so I can work.

162
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,399
Stop being so coy.

163
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,032
Tell me.

164
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:09,360
Will you meet him if he calls you?

165
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,600
Wow, he really looks so handsome...

166
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,767
Handsome, my foot!

167
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,598
Put this photo away right now!

168
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:24,533
What are you doing during work hours?

169
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,766
What's going on?

170
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:31,699
Yikes!

171
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,500
How long have you been standing there?

172
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,366
I didn't even know you were there and raised my voice.

173
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,798
I asked what's going on.

174
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,598
Editor Na forgot your strict warning.

175
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:50,866
She was engrossed with the man who bought her the bag.

176
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,199
She didn't seem to be able to separate private and public matters,

177
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,532
so I was berating her as a part of staff training.

178
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,999
I did well, right?

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,899
You're the one who can't separate private and public matters.

180
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,666
Sir?

181
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,160
Can't you see the clock?

182
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,098
It's been five minutes since lunchtime began.

183
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:12,064
She's off the clock now.

184
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:13,231
If she does her job well,

185
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,100
it doesn't matter if she looks at his photo,

186
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,199
if she meets him or dates him.

187
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,598
I have no intention of getting involved.

188
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:23,965
So please keep out of the staff's personal issues as well.

189
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:25,900
Understood?

190
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,065
Yes, sir.

191
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:37,599
Oh, well, how about we eat what Editor Na wants today?

192
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,999
What do you want to eat, Editor Na?

193
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:48,766
Awesome! Assistant Yook found the man's number.

194
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,560
What?

195
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:54,432
Busted!

196
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:58,366
You're the one who gave her the bag, right?

197
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,065
Whatever.

198
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:03,365
You looked flustered the moment I found his photo.

199
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,899
You were doing this. This!

200
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,431
You were doing this, no?

201
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,267
I hate you.

202
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:12,567
All right. It's me. Happy?

203
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,666
You're no help at all.

204
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,465
You timid fool.

205
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,264
So was that guy your stand-in?

206
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:20,233
Is he someone you know?

207
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,332
No. He was a total stranger.

208
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,231
I didn't want anyone to find out by asking someone I know.

209
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:25,033
What'll you do, though?

210
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:28,631
It's a matter of time before they find him.

211
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:29,899
I can see what'll happen.

212
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,400
You'll get busted.

213
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:39,333
♫  I'll run to you no matter what  ♫

214
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,298
♫  My love for you is unconditional  ♫

215
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:56,050
♫  My love for you is extra special  ♫

216
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,999
♫  I'll cross the Pacific and the Atlantic  ♫

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,566
♫  I'll even cross the Indian Ocean  ♫

218
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,131
♫  If you call me, I'll run to you  ♫

219
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:11,810
♫  I'll run to you no matter what  ♫

220
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:20,140
♫  No matter what  ♫

221
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes, that looks fine.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,733
What is this social negligence?

223
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:38,499
Before you blame society, think about why society turned its back on you.

224
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:42,731
You talk about the subscription so much that we lost interest.

225
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:45,133
Is the announcement tomorrow?

226
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,733
No. It was supposed to be last night.

227
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:50,131
The server for the subscription website shut down,

228
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,066
so the announcement was delayed.

229
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,631
I stayed up all night looking at it.

230
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,566
But you can still dance?

231
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes, yes, yes.

232
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:02,399
A good psychic said...

233
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,167
That you'll get it this time.

234
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,165
Right.

235
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,665
But that good psychic...

236
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,532
You did what he told you.

237
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,399
Yes. You have psychic skills.

238
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,566
So what was it this time?

239
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:13,500
There's nothing surprising.

240
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,832
You didn't stop washing or stop talking.

241
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:18,999
Well, there is something.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,532
I stuck by it very thoroughly.

243
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:27,264
And I'm going to stick by it until I win.

244
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,232
What is it?

245
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:31,400
There is something.

246
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,333
So what is it?

247
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,298
Seriously.

248
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,970
Then I'll tell only you...

249
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,433
What!

250
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,999
What is it?

251
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,199
Don't ask.

252
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,965
It's better not to know.

253
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:54,298
Crazy bastard.

254
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:55,431
Reel it in.

255
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,532
The CEO is especially temperamental today.

256
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:00,565
We're able to talk to you like this because he went out.

257
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:01,899
Okay, then.

258
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,433
While he's gone, I'll go get a cup of coffee.

259
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:13,820
♪ My love for you is special! ♪

260
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:23,499
The place we're covering today is a second home.

261
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,866
It's for people who want a work-life balance,

262
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,699
so the focus of the design is rest and healing.

263
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
But it goes beyond individual needs...

264
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:30,899
 If she does her job well,

265
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,800
 it doesn't matter if she looks at his photo,

266
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,933
 if she meets him or dates him.

267
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,598
 I have no intention of getting involved.

268
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:41,064
 Then why thank me for being by his side?

269
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,900
 I know he was drunk, but why say such a thing?

270
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,867
 Why? Why?

271
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:48,167
If promotion goes well, the next home that's scheduled for sale...

272
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,264
Focus.

273
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,832
Why are you distracted during work hours?

274
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,131
I distinctly told you

275
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:57,199
to separate private and public matters.

276
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,099
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,131
If the promotion of the second home goes well,

278
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,399
we'll be able to successfully sell the next place

279
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,420
that's scheduled for sale.

280
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,710

281
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,966
 The scenery must be different from the city to be popular as a second home.

282
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:31,532
 The ocean view is what a lot of people want.

283
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,733
 To resist the humidity of a coastal area,

284
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:38,366
 we used materials with high mass per unit.

285
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:41,798
 Befitting its purpose as a resting place,

286
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,566
 we installed a premium infinity pool to make it as good as a pool villa.

287
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,898
When I bought this house per CEO Yoo's advice, it was more for investment purposes.

288
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,665
You made an excellent choice.

289
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,366
This second home is near Seoul.

290
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:58,533
With the increase of surrounding tourism infrastructure,

291
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,798
the price of the house is continuously rising.

292
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,933
Well,

293
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,366
- I'm not going to sell this house. 
 - Pardon?

294
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:04,832
I love it so much.

295
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,231
My place in Seoul is stuffy, but here, I feel relaxed.

296
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:11,899
So I'm going to settle here after I retire.

297
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:14,299
I understand how you feel.

298
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,831
A home is a place that must be comfortable even if you only stay there for a day.

299
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:22,800
Right? You understand me perfectly.

300
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,299
- Where do you live...? 
 - I—

301
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,966
Excuse me.

302
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,467
Can I get some water?

303
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:30,300
Sure. I'll be right back.

304
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:37,065
Talk about private matters on your own time.

305
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:41,167
Don't waste work hours with talk that doesn't make money.

306
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,133
Yes, sir.

307
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,098
Go to the car and get our magazine.

308
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,340
To give to the homeowner.

309
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,567
Yes, sir.

310
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,265
Hello?

311
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,733
 This is the apartment's management office.

312
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:10,232
 A woman who says she lives in #5501 keeps asking to open the main gate.

313
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:12,765
She does live with me.

314
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:16,033
Her name? Na Young Won.

315
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,666
Bye.

316
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,666
What?

317
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:24,300
Does Editor Na live with you at your house?

318
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,431
Don't misunderstand.

319
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:28,165
She's a new tenant of mine.

320
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,232
She had nowhere to go during a water leak repair,

321
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,030
so I'm letting her stay with me for the time being.

322
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,833
Yes, Secretary Hwang.

323
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,399
An urgent sale?

324
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,599
What's the address?

325
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,665
Okay.

326
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,798
I'm in the neighborhood, so I'll go see for myself and decide.

327
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:55,967
Okay.

328
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,966
- Editor Na... 
 - Don't worry about me.

329
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,466
I'll stay in the car alone while you—

330
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:01,132
Right.

331
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:03,598
- To think about something else again? 
 - Sir?

332
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:06,532
It's clearly working hours.

333
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:11,465
Don't waste time and get back to the office and do your job.

334
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,632
Yes, sir.

335
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:15,890
I got it.

336
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,032
What?

337
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:32,300
Give me the company card.

338
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
What did you say?

339
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:34,799
The company card.

340
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,365
It's clearly working hours.

341
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:38,531
I'm not spending my money on transportation.

342
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:42,033
As you said, private and public matters must be separate.

343
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,166
Give me the company card.

344
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,431
Okay.

345
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:48,866
You have a point.

346
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,600
Here.

347
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,634
Okay.

348
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,798
- Yes, sir. 
  - We're in Gangwon-do Province!

349
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:35,799
 I know that.

350
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,298
 But you still took a cab instead of the bus?

351
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:41,433
 The fee will be over ₩200,000 ($200).

352
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,698
The bus will take too long.

353
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:55,965
 Wasting work time on the road goes against your wishes.

354
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,065
Even so, how can you take a cab all the way to Seoul?

355
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:02,032
 I'll return to the office quickly and do my job faithfully.

356
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:03,800
But...

357
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,866
Wait. Editor Na...

358
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,600
Okay. Let's wait and see.

359
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,966
How faithfully you'll do your job.

360
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:23,131
Gyeom, I've been thinking.

361
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,632
I think you should tell her before...

362
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:30,499
Wow. "I'm the fan that sent you the bag as a gift."

363
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:34,533
It'll be better to tell her upfront than confessing after I get caught.

364
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,200
That's what I was going to say.

365
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,299
Finally, I feel so relieved!

366
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,333
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted.

367
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,366
You made a good decision.

368
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,234
What's this?

369
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,599
"Do you have time today?"

370
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,465
Your fan emailed you to meet up?

371
00:21:57,465 --> 00:22:01,566
Awesome! The time has come!

372
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:03,865
We're working.

373
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,632
If the CEO finds out, it'll be hell.

374
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,333
Okay.

375
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,833
But...

376
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,068
Why do you think he's asking to see me?

377
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,299
Wow. You're unbelievable.

378
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,732
Are you slow, or are you pretending not to know?

379
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,332
It's obvious.

380
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:26,499
"I fell in love the moment I saw you at the bazaar."

381
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,600
Or...

382
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,965
"I've had a crush on you for a long time."

383
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,165
It's one or the other.

384
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:32,399
Come on.

385
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,000
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

386
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,965
Nope. This is totally undeniable.

387
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:41,232
If you feel uncomfortable, I can go with you.

388
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,165
It's okay.

389
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,365
I'll go alone.

390
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,599
Okay.

391
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,600
Good luck, Young Won.

392
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,665
Your tough and dry life will now become rich with moisture.

393
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,133
It has to be dewy.

394
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,700
You look so moisturized.

395
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,067
I can go with you if you want.

396
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,265
 She spends more than her daily wage on a taxi

397
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,533
 and gets excited over seeing that man?

398
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:25,233
All right.

399
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:28,165
Let's see how faithfully she'll do her job.

400
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:30,633
Let's just wait and see.

401
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,366
What is it?

402
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:38,698
It's the first draft of the promo article that I covered last week.

403
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:40,899
I'll be leaving the office now.

404
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,098
Stop.

405
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:45,032
What about the storyboard for today's cover? If you didn't do it, work overtime.

406
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,732
I finished it.

407
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,365
What? Already?

408
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:50,631
Yes. I'll email it to you.

409
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,198
- Goodbye. 
 - Stop.

410
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:54,432
Did you prepare the questions for the next place?

411
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,466
- If you didn't do it, work overtime. 
 - I finished that as well.

412
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:58,767
What? Did you finish it already?

413
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:02,399
Yes. I'll also email it to you.

414
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,899
Wow, you're incredible.

415
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:07,400
You worked at such a great speed.

416
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,899
Right? It's because I took a cab and got to work quickly.

417
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:13,733
Was it really because of the cab?

418
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,068
Not because you're meeting someone today?

419
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,799
- What? 
 - If I had known this would happen,

420
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,466
I would have gotten you a plane.

421
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,300
Then I'd have next month's articles already!

422
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,698
Okay then. I'll try to take a plane next time.

423
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,133
Goodbye.

424
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:35,932
Fine. Okay.

425
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,999
As long as she does her job, it's none of my business.

426
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,366
As long as she does her job.

427
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:49,966
But she didn't do her job!

428
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,367
Does she call this doing her job?

429
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:59,666
Editor Na! Where is Editor Na?

430
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,266
She just left.

431
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,932
I heeded your stern warning about keeping myself

432
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:08,498
uninvolved during the staff's off-work hours and let her leave on the dot.

433
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:10,833
Since she said she finished her work.

434
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,599
- I did well, right? 
 - What are you talking about?

435
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,364
How can she leave when she did such a sloppy job?

436
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:18,666
Call her back right now!

437
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:23,999
- What mistakes did she make?  
 - I don't believe this.

438
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:29,298
How can an editor of ten years make this kind of fatal mistake?

439
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:32,932
But, sir, what fatal mistake did she make?

440
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,098
Not the front side. The back side.

441
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,599
Sir?

442
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:41,098
What's wrong with this? It's blank.

443
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:43,399
That's the problem.

444
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:44,932
I told her over and over again.

445
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:48,267
The first draft must be written on scrap paper.

446
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:53,067
The fatal mistake you mentioned is scrap paper?

447
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:56,399
What? There's no more fatal mistake than this.

448
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:01,465
This kind of waste builds up and leads to us shutting down.

449
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:03,700
Shutting down?

450
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,631
Why are you looking at me with disbelief?

451
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,066
I'm not saying this because of scrap paper.

452
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:12,565
- I'm talking about her state of mind. 
 - Her state of mind?

453
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:15,599
That's right. She never made this mistake before.

454
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,698
But she's totally engrossed with her fan or whoever it is.

455
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:21,099
If she starts dating him, she'll screw up the promo articles.

456
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,899
That's why I'm saying this!

457
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,667
If that's the case, you don't have to worry.

458
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,900
What?

459
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,399
 Hello.

460
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,165
 Thank you for the gift.

461
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:54,133
 But I can't receive such an expensive present.

462
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,766
 Please, deliver it to him.

463
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:58,531
 I left the bag with the coffee shop owner.

464
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,466
 Just a sec.

465
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:01,899
 I'll take this.

466
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:03,265
 Thank you.

467
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:08,367
 Your message of encouragement was a huge gift.

468
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:18,800
 Thank you so much.

469
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,133
What? Scrap paper?

470
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:34,032
 Yes. He went crazy over something so trivial,

471
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:36,765
saying you'll ruin the promo article

472
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:40,999
if you start dating him and how your state of mind is wrong.

473
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,598
He was foaming at the mouth, demanding we call you back.

474
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,232
 Did she?

475
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:47,833
 Did she only go to return the bag?

476
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,899
 Yes.

477
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,365
 She had no intention of accepting it from the start,

478
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:55,399
 so you don't have to worry.

479
00:27:56,101 --> 00:28:01,066
 Still. She made a fatal mistake.

480
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,232
 - Call her this instant! 
 - Yes, sir.

481
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:04,534
 I'll reprimand her sternly...

482
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:09,531
 It's okay. It's late now, so I'll talk to her later.

483
00:28:09,531 --> 00:28:11,499
 He lowered his tail immediately.

484
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:15,499
It looked like he went crazy thinking you went to meet him.

485
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:16,798
He was totally jealous.

486
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,299
Come on. That's nonsense.

487
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,199
Oh. The bus is here.

488
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,132
I'll hang up now.

489
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:28,666
It's late. Stop pretending to work. Let's go.

490
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,399
Okay.

491
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,800
You'll bore a hole in the monitor.

492
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,099
Aren't you going home?

493
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,466
No. I'm going to wait a little more.

494
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,131
Okay. Good luck.

495
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:40,833
Have a good weekend.

496
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,067
Let's go.

497
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:58,100
- Oh? Editor Nam! 
 - Sang Soon!

498
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,766
Wake up!

499
00:28:58,767 --> 00:28:59,799
- Wake up! 
 - What happened? 
 - Hey!

500
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,465
- Hey! 
 - Wake up! Wake up!

501
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:02,631
What's wrong with him?

502
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:04,165
He was up all night staring at the website.

503
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:05,666
- Call 911. 
 - Okay.

504
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,265
Editor Nam! Wake up!

505
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:08,933
Oh, no.

506
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,932
- What are you doing? 
 - His belt's on too tight. It'll be hard to breathe.

507
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:15,765
Why did he put it on so tight?

508
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:17,532
I'll do it.

509
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,299
Who cares about that in an emergency?!

510
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,466
Stop!

511
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,865
Don't touch this area!

512
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,265
Editor Nam could die!

513
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:25,167
This bastard

514
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,432
- isn't wearing underwear. 
 - What?

515
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,633
The psychic told him to go commando to win.

516
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:34,600
He's such a crazy bastard.

517
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,666
Oh? He woke up.

518
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,032
Are you coming to your senses?

519
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:40,765
Should I cancel the 911 call?

520
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,799
- Yes, cancel it. 
 - Okay.

521
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,500
Are you all right?

522
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:49,600
What? What's he saying?

523
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,434
Did you get it? Got what?

524
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
The monitor...

525
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,790

526
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,066
What? Did he really get it?

527
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:14,932
Did he faint because of the shock?

528
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:17,531
Awesome! Congratulations!

529
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:18,932
- Congratulations! 
 - Are you coming to your senses?

530
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:20,933
Do you want a glass of water?

531
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,132
No.

532
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,900
I'll be going now!

533
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,632
I need to go tell my cutie pie

534
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:33,398
this great news and propose to her.

535
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:38,399
This marriage will happen no matter what!

536
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:43,433
- I got it! 
 - Yay!

537
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:58,132
 Did you do your best to gather seed money?

538
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:01,165
 Are you doing the ₩10,000 calendar well?

539
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,632
 Are you reading real estate books...

540
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:07,232
 It looked like he went crazy thinking you went to meet him.

541
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,467
 If it can't be done...

542
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,832
 Was it really because of the cab?

543
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,766
 Not because you're meeting someone today?

544
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:15,032
Was that really why?

545
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:16,765
 He was totally jealous.

546
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:17,599
 Stop.

547
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,399
 What about the storyboard for today's cover?

548
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,198
 If you didn't do it, work overtime. Stop.

549
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:23,132
 Did you prepare the questions for the next place?

550
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,832
 If you didn't do it, work overtime.

551
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,933
So...

552
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,420
Was that on purpose so I wouldn't be able to go?

553
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:35,300
No way.

554
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,965
Oh? He must be home.

555
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,233
 You're here.

556
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,432
 Sir?

557
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:04,733
 Now I remember.

558
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:11,133
 How you greeted me last night

559
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:15,933
 and what I said.

560
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,932
 You were drunk,

561
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:22,566
 - so you don't need to worry about... 
 - No.

562
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,020
 I meant it.

563
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,033
 Thank you

564
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,966
 for being home,

565
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,733
 for being by my side.

566
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:06,499
 That's it for today's video.

567
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,599
 Have you not liked or subscribed yet?

568
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,367
 What?

569
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,632
 That's it for today's video.

570
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:29,500
 Have you not liked or subscribed yet?

571
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,166
 If you don't want to be a homeowner, then do whatever you like.

572
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,100
 Goodbye.

573
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:44,232
What was that dream?

574
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:47,890
I must be mad.

575
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,399
Let's sleep.

576
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:44,800
What are you doing here?

577
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:00,166
You're up early.

578
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,231
I heard about the scrap paper yesterday.

579
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:04,698
I'll be more careful next time...

580
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:06,698
Do you have plans for today?

581
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:08,499
Sir?

582
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:09,766
Well, not really.

583
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,231
Good.

584
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,266
Accompany me somewhere then.

585
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,290
Where?

586
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,132
Oh? Why a furniture store all of a sudden?

587
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:22,666
You asked why my place was so empty,

588
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:24,466
so I'm going to fill it.

589
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:26,466
Yes, but why bring me...

590
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,832
I'd like you to pick the furniture.

591
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,830
Let's go in.

592
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,630

593
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,633
What?

594
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:38,040
Why ask me to pick out furniture for his place?

595
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,340
What's he up to this time?

596
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,330
♫  Hey, I feel that  ♫

597
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,333
What about this one?

598
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,732
Do you like it?

599
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:00,533
Pardon?

600
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,366
Yes.

601
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,732
Then I'll take this.

602
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:04,633
What?

603
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,898
How about this one?

604
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:08,999
It was in our advertorial.

605
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,465
It's very comfortable, and you can customize the color and size.

606
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:16,300
Do you like it?

607
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,299
Yes, sure.

608
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,200
Then I'll take this.

609
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,330
♫  Baby, I’m there  ♫

610
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,410
♫  Don’t mind  ♫

611
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,930
♫  So you won’t think that you’re alone  ♫

612
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,599
What the...?

613
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,360
What's up with him?

614
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,100
♫  I’m there,  ♫

615
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,270
♫  Baby, I’m there  ♫

616
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,220
♫  Like a dream, like a dream  ♫

617
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,750
♫  Always, there for you  ♫

618
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,300
♫  Don’t worry  ♫

619
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,840
♫  Don’t worry  ♫

620
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,830
♫  You’re my love  ♫

621
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:53,020
♫  Please look at me. I'll stand here.  ♫

622
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:59,434
I could've done it.

623
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,533
Thank you.

624
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,732
Wow. You two look so good together.

625
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:07,599
- Pardon? 
 - You're newly-weds, right?

626
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,599
We have a newly-wed special event going on.

627
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,198
We're not a couple.

628
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,165
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

629
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,830
Then take your time and look around.

630
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:21,565
That's some misunderstanding.

631
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:23,031
By chance, did it make you feel unpleasant?

632
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,398
What?

633
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,531
No, not particularly.

634
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:27,865
Good, then.

635
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:30,740
I didn't feel unpleasant, either.

636
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:36,200
Seriously, what's gotten into him?

637
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:52,832
It fits my taste perfectly, so I don't know if you'll like it.

638
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:55,233
It's fine as long as you like it.

639
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,200
Pardon?

640
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,600
Yesterday, you said it while we were on assignment.

641
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,333
A home is a place that must be cozy and comfortable, even if you only live there for a day.

642
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:07,966
I want you to feel like that while you're here.

643
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,833
Oh. I see.

644
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,132
Thank you.

645
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:16,966
It felt like something was lacking.

646
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,066
I see there's one thing that is missing.

647
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:24,999
Can I bring out the plant you got for me?

648
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, yes. Of course!

649
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,932
What?

650
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:42,533
That's why he okayed everything I liked?

651
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:45,799
 He was totally jealous.

652
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:47,698
Then...

653
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,180
Was that really...?

654
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:51,998
No, no.

655
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,865
Don't overthink it.

656
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:18,698
Where...

657
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,365
Should I put this?

658
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:21,966
Pardon?

659
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,500
♫  We’re so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

660
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,990
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

661
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,950
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

662
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,920
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

663
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,160
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

664
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,400
♫  You know this too  ♫

665
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,566
I need to go to the restroom.

666
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,432
 Oh! Oh, hi! Welcome.

667
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,666
You came a long way.

668
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:29,099
My neighborhood has all the hot spots.

669
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,432
Why did you call us all the way here?

670
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:33,732
Oh, my goodness.

671
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:37,565
This is a hidden gem only the residents know.

672
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:41,532
This pigs' feet place has been here for over thirty years.

673
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:43,599
Yes, great.

674
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,799
I'm buying today.

675
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,966
What? You are?

676
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:52,598
Yes. Since I won a subscription, I'm buying.

677
00:40:52,598 --> 00:40:54,898
Right! Did you propose to your girlfriend?

678
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,332
- What did she say? 
 - Don't get me started.

679
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,898
From my cutie pie's huge beautiful eyes

680
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:03,898
dropped tears of joy and happiness.

681
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:07,931
I, manly Nam Sang Soon, couldn't help but cry with her.

682
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:09,132
He cried again.

683
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,833
So then, you're getting married?

684
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,590
You'll be hearing wedding bells soon.

685
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,200
Why aren't you picking up?

686
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,532
It's a bother.

687
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:25,132
I don't know how people found out I won,

688
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,365
but all these banks are calling me,

689
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:31,033
talking about a loan for the intermediate payment.

690
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,599
There's another one.

691
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,867
Lettuce...

692
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:48,934
Oh, sir! Are you going somewhere?

693
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:51,031
Yes. I go on surveys on the weekends.

694
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:52,865
I'm leaving a little later than usual today.

695
00:41:52,866 --> 00:41:56,466
Oh, I see.

696
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:58,332
I thought you were taking the day off.

697
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:02,200
I was going to cook for you like I promised last time.

698
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,031
I didn't waste money.

699
00:42:08,032 --> 00:42:12,133
I used the money left over from the ₩10,000 calendar.

700
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,333
Yes, Secretary Hwang.

701
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,333
 I'm here, sir.

702
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:21,799
 You can come down.

703
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,767
What?

704
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:24,499
Are you very sick?

705
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,631
What? Who's sick? Me?

706
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:30,632
If you're sick, you should rest. Why did you come?

707
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,531
What? I came because I'm not sick.

708
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:35,466
Since you're sick, get a good rest today.

709
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,667
But I'm not sick.

710
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,533
What?

711
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:42,367
Am I sick?

712
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,966
He's so straight as an arrow.

713
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:46,966
If he's sick, he should rest.

714
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:49,865
Is Secretary Hwang sick?

715
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:51,099
Yes.

716
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,766
He has a cold, but it's nothing to worry about.

717
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:57,499
I guess I have no choice but to stay home.

718
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,365
Let's have lunch together then.

719
00:42:59,365 --> 00:43:00,332
Oh, really?

720
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:03,599
Oh! Then I'll run to the supermarket real quick.

721
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,866
I forgot to buy something.

722
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:09,030
I'll be right back!

723
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:19,165
It's me.

724
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,599
I have something to ask you.

725
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,332
What do you do on the weekends?

726
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:29,200
I've worked the weekends for the past three years.

727
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,532
But suddenly, I'm not working today.

728
00:43:32,532 --> 00:43:35,198
The CEO suddenly told me to rest because I'm sick.

729
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,466
No.

730
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:37,665
I'm not sick.

731
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,698
But he said I'm sick and told me to rest.

732
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:41,665
- I don't know what that means. 
 - What?

733
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,200
He lied?

734
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,700
To have lunch with me?

735
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,267
Why?

736
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:50,698
What do I mean "why"?

737
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,365
This isn't overthinking it.

738
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:53,534
Right?

739
00:43:53,534 --> 00:43:56,200
This is totally undeniable!

740
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,165
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

741
00:43:58,165 --> 00:43:59,231
Hello!

742
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:00,365
Oh, welcome.

743
00:44:00,366 --> 00:44:02,531
One big plate of pigs' feet and noodles to go.

744
00:44:02,532 --> 00:44:03,500
Okay.

745
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:04,865
Oh? Hello!

746
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:07,699
Oh, hello!

747
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:08,898
You're all here.

748
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,565
Is there no pigs' feet place in Gangnam?

749
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,031
Why come crawling all the way here?

750
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:13,599
Hey. "Crawling"?

751
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,198
How can you say that?

752
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,265
You know my wife only eats pigs' feet from here,

753
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:20,665
so I come all the way here to get take out.

754
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:23,599
All the way from Gangnam.

755
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:28,866
Since I'm here, I'll join you.

756
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,066
Who said you could sit?

757
00:44:47,032 --> 00:44:50,000
I hope it's seasoned right.

758
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,499
Does it suit your taste?

759
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:56,665
Yes, well,

760
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,900
it's umber one among the home-cooked meals I've had.

761
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,599
Really?

762
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,399
Actually, this is my first time eating a home-cooked meal.

763
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:09,366
Oh... I see.

764
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,300
Then I'm the first and last?

765
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,320
You could say that.

766
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:32,100
Thank you.

767
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:40,432
It's quite nice eating at home.

768
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:41,333
Right?

769
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:46,532
It might be bothersome to cook, but it's two or three times more delicious than eating out.

770
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:48,332
Not that much.

771
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,632
Oh, right.

772
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:50,698
I went overboard again.

773
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:56,566
Not two or three times, but 200 or 300 times more delicious.

774
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:16,332
I told you to come with me when I moved,

775
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,766
but you firmly said that it'd get reconstructed.

776
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:21,332
You insisted,

777
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,599
but look at this.

778
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,466
Why bring up what's already passed?

779
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:29,966
Because I feel bad.

780
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,399
You know,

781
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,832
the property his wife wanted to buy in Gangnam

782
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:38,066
has gone up ₩800 million.

783
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:40,280
₩800 million?

784
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:48,032
Aren't you leaving?

785
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:50,766
Your wife must be waiting for her pigs' feet.

786
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,765
Not as much as you're waiting for the reconstruction.

787
00:46:53,765 --> 00:46:55,800
You leave!

788
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,432
- Okay. If you don't, then we will. 
 - What?

789
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:00,865
What's taking Editor Nam so long in the bathroom?

790
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:01,532
Get up.

791
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:03,432
All right, all right.

792
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:04,599
I'll leave.

793
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,531
Ma'am! I'll take what I ordered to go.

794
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,832
Okay.

795
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:12,600
Here you go.

796
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,064
I feel like coming to my hometown when I'm here.

797
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,966
Please don't ever leave.

798
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:20,598
If this area gets reconstructed, this place will go.

799
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:23,332
Don't worry about that at all.

800
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,733
This area will never be reconstructed.

801
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:27,999
That bastard!

802
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,833
Let it go, okay?

803
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:34,532
To preserve good restaurants like this, this area should never be reconstructed.

804
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:49,840
Just leave, you pigs' feet-like bastard!

805
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:09,799
Blood.

806
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:16,832
Camping is all about daytime drinking and barbecue.

807
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:18,999
 Your call cannot be connected...

808
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,531
Why isn't he picking up?

809
00:48:20,532 --> 00:48:22,232
Who?

810
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,698
Ja Sung.

811
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,999
He said he'd be home, but he's not picking up.

812
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,966
Is he sick?

813
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:28,933
Hey.

814
00:48:28,934 --> 00:48:31,965
I'm the one that's aching all over.

815
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:34,300
I need to lie down.

816
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:40,865
Hey.

817
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:42,332
Where's the sleeping bag?

818
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,333
And the space heater?

819
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:47,432
Hey!

820
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:49,165
Where are the sleeping bag and space heater?

821
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:50,100
What?

822
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,865
Oh, those?

823
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:53,165
I don't know.

824
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,320
I lost them.

825
00:49:02,633 --> 00:49:05,231
 You'll get a cold if you sleep in the office.

826
00:49:05,232 --> 00:49:07,099
 Use these.

827
00:49:14,232 --> 00:49:15,933
 Thank you, Photographer Shin.

828
00:49:15,934 --> 00:49:17,432
 For taking care of me.

829
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:21,100
 And for keeping my secret.

830
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:28,900
Why did that bastard have to come?

831
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:32,999
Oh, jeez. I'm so sorry.

832
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,632
I could've broken your nose.

833
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:37,399
It's okay. It's okay.

834
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:40,933
Who cares about a nose?

835
00:49:40,933 --> 00:49:44,350
I have an apartment to live in with my cutie pie.

836
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:48,866
Oh, my phone's ringing.

837
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,266
Oh, hey, Honey.

838
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:53,966
What?

839
00:49:55,066 --> 00:49:57,065
Right now?

840
00:49:59,632 --> 00:50:01,199
All right. Okay.

841
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:04,766
I'm sorry. I have to go home.

842
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:05,566
- What? 
 - What?

843
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:06,732
Already?

844
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:09,799
You said your wife told you to come home at 11 p.m.

845
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,799
Yes, but the Wi-Fi router isn't working.

846
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,665
The kids can't watch online lectures.

847
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:19,231
She wants me to buy a new one right now.

848
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:21,833
- Get home safely. 
 - Goodbye.

849
00:50:25,366 --> 00:50:27,999
You're very drunk.

850
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:29,999
- I'll walk him home. 
 - Okay.

851
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,031
- Over here. 
 - Goodbye.

852
00:50:31,032 --> 00:50:32,533
- Here? 
 - Yes, here.

853
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:35,133
Get a grip, please.

854
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,732
What am I doing

855
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:40,399
on my precious weekend?

856
00:50:41,899 --> 00:50:47,870
The bank is working really hard on the weekend.

857
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:54,834
What?

858
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,200
Thank you.

859
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:13,333
Reading is good, but you should rest your mind on the weekend.

860
00:51:17,832 --> 00:51:19,799
How did you know that was there?

861
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,231
Even I didn't know, and I own this place.

862
00:51:21,232 --> 00:51:25,700
That's why you should show interest in the place you live in.

863
00:51:26,899 --> 00:51:28,866
What kind of movies do you like?

864
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:29,934
I don't know.

865
00:51:29,935 --> 00:51:32,366
I don't watch movies that much.

866
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:36,566
What's the latest movie you watched?

867
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,832
- "Shiri" (1999)? 
 - What?

868
00:51:39,832 --> 00:51:40,966
Right!

869
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:43,132
I also saw "Taegukgi" (2004).

870
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,630
I'll just choose.

871
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,265
If you get sleepy during the movie, you can take a nap on the couch.

872
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:52,799
A nap?

873
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,531
It's such a waste to have to sleep at night. Why would you take a nap?

874
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:58,100
That's a total waste of time.

875
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:03,498
 One of the first things you plant in the spring is potatoes.

876
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:05,632
 It's still cold, but the warmth in the earth

877
00:52:05,633 --> 00:52:08,099
 pushes the potato sprouts outside.

878
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:12,300
 Sprouting, blooming flowers, and bearing fruit...

879
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,332
 All of this is about timing.

880
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,299
Then...

881
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,640
I should organize the interview recording.

882
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,630
♫  I know that warm feeling  ♫

883
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:29,232
 My place in Seoul is stuffy, but here, I feel so relaxed.

884
00:52:29,232 --> 00:52:32,231
 So when I retire, I'm going to settle here.

885
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,099
 I understand how you feel.

886
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:40,732
 A home is a place that must be comfortable even if you stay there for a day.

887
00:52:40,732 --> 00:52:45,899
 I want a home to be comfortable and cozy.

888
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:52,130
 Especially on days off, when you take a break from the exhausting routine and stay home.

889
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,840
♫  I feel like I’m home  ♫

890
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,500
♫  Whenever I think of you  ♫

891
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,200
♫  Here I am  ♫

892
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,160
♫  A flame is alive in my heart  ♫

893
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,580
 What should we eat?

894
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,830
♫  I’ll be right here  ♫

895
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,033
 What should we do?

896
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:14,865
 Careful, careful.

897
00:53:14,865 --> 00:53:17,300
 Over there.

898
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,100
♫  Here I am  ♫

899
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,999
 Where small worries turn into joy

900
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,633
 and small joys turn into a good memory.

901
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:28,270
 Also...

902
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,560
♫  Everything is just fine  ♫

903
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,260

904
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,550
 A happy place where you can be with someone dear to you.

905
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,160
♫  Of someone quietly holding me  ♫

906
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:46,898
 I hope

907
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:49,766
 this home is such a place

908
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:51,980
 to him today.

909
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,299
 Is that really all?

910
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,290
 You don't have another motive?

911
00:54:04,399 --> 00:54:06,732
 I'm asking if you like Editor Na.

912
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:10,064
 If not, it doesn't make sense to take her in.

913
00:54:10,065 --> 00:54:12,999
 A residence must be stable for one to work hard.

914
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,466
 That way, it won't interfere with me making money.

915
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:17,632
 I figured it was more profitable for me.

916
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:18,999
 You know me.

917
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,265
 You know I have no interest in liking or dating someone.

918
00:54:22,265 --> 00:54:25,599
 Still, things may change while you're living together.

919
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,933
 Editor Na might knock down that iron wall of yours.

920
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,332
 No.

921
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,180
 That will never happen.

922
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,765
He got so drunk.

923
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,232
Hey.

924
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:06,698
Let's go for a second round after this.

925
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,533
I'm buying!

926
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,132
Nam Sang Soon.

927
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:11,599
Be honest.

928
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,299
Something happened with your cutie pie, right?

929
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,770
What are you talking about?

930
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,800
Why did you say it was the bank?

931
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:26,365
Why are you looking at my phone?

932
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:29,550
Why are you avoiding her calls?

933
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:40,064
 I'll be waiting in front of the academy.

934
00:55:40,065 --> 00:55:42,299
 I'll be late because of the special lecture.

935
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,432
 Let's meet next time.

936
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:45,999
 I'm in front of the academy. I'll be waiting...

937
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,367
 No, no.

938
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:51,799
 I should surprise her.

939
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:57,499
 I bought this years ago.

940
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,610
 I'm finally giving it to her.

941
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,333
 There she is.

942
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:08,399
 Sang Soon. You can do it. Be confident.

943
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:10,670
 Fight on, fight on, fight on.

944
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:30,933
 Why did you hide?

945
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:33,566
You're not the one who cheated.

946
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,531
So what are you going to do?

947
00:56:36,532 --> 00:56:38,231
Break up with her?

948
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:40,466
Are you crazy?

949
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:43,233
How can I break up with her?

950
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:48,533
I'm just... going to pretend I didn't see.

951
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:49,300
What?

952
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,367
I didn't see it.

953
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,299
If I didn't see it, we can let it pass.

954
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:56,766
You crazy bastard, what's the use in—

955
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:58,898
And I understand her.

956
00:56:58,899 --> 00:57:02,099
It must've been really hard for her to wait for me for so long.

957
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:05,800
So she could've faltered for a minute.

958
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:08,865
But if she finds out I won a subscription,

959
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:12,033
if she knows I own an apartment now,

960
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:14,398
she'll change her mind, right?

961
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:18,199
So until then, no matter how long it takes,

962
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:21,800
I can wait.

963
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,600
Then why aren't you taking her calls?

964
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,732
In case she says she wants to break up.

965
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:37,367
What?

966
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,000
What will I do?

967
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:49,100
What will I do, huh?

968
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:56,800
What's the use of owning an apartment if I don't have my cutie pie

969
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,200
whom I want to share it with?

970
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:07,700
What will I do?

971
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,367
What?

972
00:58:33,065 --> 00:58:38,333
Did I, Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung, take a nap?

973
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:02,898
 I can't believe you misunderstood.

974
00:59:02,899 --> 00:59:05,599
 I did it because I took pity on you.

975
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,633
 She'll totally misunderstand your kindness.

976
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:11,565
 Looks like you're misunderstanding again just because we lived together a few days.

977
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:14,630
 I really am a bastard who only knows money.

978
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:20,390
I was a fool again.

979
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,320

980
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,300
Why did you come here without telling me?

981
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,632
To get some fresh air for a bit.

982
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:27,980
Why didn't you pick up? I was worried.

983
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:34,866
Here.

984
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:36,966
I'm fine.

985
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,531
You look cold. Just put it on.

986
01:00:39,532 --> 01:00:43,032
I said I'm fine! Stop being nice to me!

987
01:00:43,032 --> 01:00:43,767
What?

988
01:00:43,768 --> 01:00:46,433
Don't worry about me like this!

989
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:50,500
Don't watch a movie or eat lunch with me!

990
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,865
Don't tell me to have a comfortable and cozy stay!

991
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,433
I said don't be nice to me.

992
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:04,566
You know how I am.

993
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:06,966
I'm stupid and foolish.

994
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:08,966
So if you're nice to me, then I'll misunderstand.

995
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:11,099
You don't mean it that way,

996
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:15,033
but I'll keep misunderstanding and thinking that you like me.

997
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:17,570
You didn't misunderstand.

998
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:29,833
I tried hard to push you away, but I realized it was no use.

999
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:33,700
 I remembered what happened that night.

1000
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,930
 You're here.

1001
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,866
 Thank you...

1002
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:52,266
 for being home...

1003
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:55,870
 for being by my side.

1004
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,067
I like you.

1005
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,120
I said I like you.

1006
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,970

~ Preview ~

1021
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,365
 You look very pretty today.

1022
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:19,332
 What kind of crazy woman would date CEO Yoo?

1023
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:22,099
 There could be that one person.

1024
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,332
 - What? 
 - What?

1025
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,733
 Sir, what were you doing there with Editor Na?

1026
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:29,333
 I thought you'd be glum about your cutie pie.

1027
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:30,466
 I told you.

1028
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:32,127
 I'm going to pretend I didn't see.

1029
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:34,900
 My cutie pie and I will never break up.

1030
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,367
 It's my first time dating, so I'm clumsy at it.

1031
01:03:38,367 --> 01:03:40,900
 But I'll try hard.

1032
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,930
 You're the first person to make me be happy all day.

1033
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:48,160
♫  Write the story of us  ♫
