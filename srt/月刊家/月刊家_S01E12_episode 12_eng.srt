1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,460

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,290

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,820

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,210

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,400

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,220

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,950

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,500

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,590

10
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,080

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,866
 Last night, he found out

12
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:04,010
 that you like Editor Na, too.

13
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:13,132
Gyeom!

14
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,000
Gyeom.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,067
I'll get the doctor.

16
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:18,700
Are you okay?

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,666
Can you hear me?

18
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,399
Why am I here...?

19
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,300
Lie still.

20
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,198
You got into an accident after having a drink.

21
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,233
Don't you remember?

22
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:36,067
I guess I drank too much with my friends.

23
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,932
I'm sorry about this.

24
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:42,600
I'm such a nuisance on your birthday.

25
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:48,565
 He drank alone, then got in an accident when he was crossing the street.

26
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:56,098
 Is something wrong, Ja Sung?

27
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:58,400
 What's taking so long?

28
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,330

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,199
Ja Sung.

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,799
 I'm sorry I took so long to call you.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,566
Gyeom is hurt, so I'm at the hospital.

32
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:11,732
What happened?

33
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,466
Is he all right?

34
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,566
It's not serious, thankfully, so don't worry.

35
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,964
I'll call you tomorrow.

36
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,870
Okay.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,133
I wonder what happened.

38
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,470
I hope he's okay.

39
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,300

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,567
I got everything you asked for.

41
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,732
Laptop charger?

42
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,165
Where is it?

43
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,432
Hold on.

44
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:44,567
I found it.

45
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,340
Okay. I'll be right there.

46
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,866
Where should I put all this?

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:01,990

48
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:10,999
Why is this here...?

49
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,231
 This is the bag that sold for one million won yesterday.

50
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:18,932
 Editor Na got it as a gift! From a man!

51
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:23,790
 A man asked me to deliver it when I was wrapping up.

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,560

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,899
What? A light concussion?

54
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,031
Yes.

55
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:44,866
He'll be discharged tomorrow, so he asked to be excused for today.

56
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,132
Did he get into an accident after drinking alone?

57
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:48,898
Was he going through something bad?

58
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,299
What?

59
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:54,132
I'm sure it wasn't anything like that. He just drank by himself.

60
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:55,465
I'll be going now.

61
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:58,099
Okay. Thank you.

62
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,599
Oh, gosh, I'm glad Photographer Shin is okay.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,665
Yes. Seriously.

64
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:07,132
He shouldn't have drunk so much.

65
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:10,580
"You have no right to say that."

66
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,799
Are you talking to me?

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,999
Editor Yeo asked me to tell you that.

68
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:19,400
What?

69
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,332
Editor Yeo, I'm sorry.

70
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:24,665
Please stop being angry.

71
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,066
"I told you not to talk to me."

72
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,866
"I don't consider you a friend anymore."

73
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,867
"I'm severing ties."

74
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:34,200
She asked me to say that.

75
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,264
Stop that, Editor Yeo.

76
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,198
Sang Soon says he's sorry.

77
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,766
Sang Soon?

78
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,665
Is there someone here with that name?

79
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,533
The only Sang Soon I know is singer Lee Hyo Ri's husband.

80
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,966
Yeo Ui Joo!

81
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:05,332
Do you really not want me to call your parents?

82
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:06,599
I told you I'm fine.

83
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,631
I'll be discharged tomorrow anyway.

84
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:11,000
They'll worry for nothing.

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,566
Photographer Shin.

86
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,167
Thank you.

87
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,766
Great vibe, right?

88
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,398
I'm buying tonight.

89
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:36,499
What's gotten into you?

90
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,800
Ta-da!

91
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,898
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:44,799
Where are you going?

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,932
Do you have to ask?

94
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,264
You said it'd be just the two of us.

95
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,164
Come on. Stop being like that and make up.

96
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,100
Forget it.

97
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,370
Wait, Editor Yeo.

98
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:58,399
Yeo Ui Joo!

99
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,367
Let her go.

100
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,264
She left her coat and went out in this frigid cold.

101
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,399
That says it all.

102
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,631
Editor Yeo is being too harsh.

103
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:16,767
You're going to all this length.

104
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,466
It's all my fault.

105
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,532
What? What is it?

106
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,699
It's terrible you're hurt like this.

107
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,932
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,934
I messed up the shoot's schedule.

109
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:47,665
That's not what I meant.

110
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,667
You need to get well, so we can keep being convenience store mates.

111
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,699
There are lots of new 1+1 items—

112
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,699
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do that anymore.

113
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,600
Why?

114
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,432
I'm going to become busier.

115
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,966
I'm going to study fine art.

116
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:05,367
Oh, I see.

117
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:08,199
It's a shame, but I'll root for you.

118
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,833
Thank you.

119
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,264
Look at the time.

120
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,898
Editor Na, ask Ja Sung to buy you something delicious.

121
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,366
No, I'm fine.

122
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,064
Actually, I'm asking you to take care of Ja Sung.

123
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,531
He didn't have dinner because of me.

124
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,032
Really?

125
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:25,164
Yes.

126
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,899
So please eat with him.

127
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,766
What are you doing? Take her out.

128
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,890
I'll be right back.

129
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,532
What should we eat?

130
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:41,099
What are you in the mood for?

131
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:45,199
What about your coat?

132
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,700
What?

133
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,170
Oh, I forgot. Just a sec.

134
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,200
 He said

135
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,799
 it's the first time he's seen you in love and happy.

136
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:18,720
 He wanted to protect that.

137
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,566
You must've been very shocked.

138
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,910
He's like a brother to you, and he got hurt.

139
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:47,999
Don't worry about work.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,665
I'll make sure there's no disruption while you're out of—

141
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:53,900
But there was, thanks to you.

142
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,599
I was so caught up in dating you.

143
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,299
I slacked off.

144
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,000
What?

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,433
What do you mean...?

146
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,690
Let's break up.

147
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,699
I don't think dating suits me.

148
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,098
It's not for me.

149
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,264
What are you saying right—

150
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:13,999
You know about it, too.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,667
I have long-term goals.

152
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,131
I wasn't able to think about it when we were together.

153
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:22,634
But being away from you for a day made me come to my senses.

154
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:25,700
This is not what I should be doing right now.

155
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,267
I no longer want to waste time and emotions.

156
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,899
Waste?

157
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:37,199
So...

158
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,231
Dating me is a waste...?

159
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,832
Yes.

160
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:43,000
So let's end this.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,530
I have to go.

162
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:25,110
♫  The fights and the scars repeat for the same reason  ♫

163
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,760

164
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,250
♫  I was so afraid of saying goodbye  ♫

165
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,090
♫  That I acted like I was fine  ♫

166
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,590
♫  I’m talking again  ♫

167
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:50,165
 You're the first person

168
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,631
  to make me feel happy all day.

169
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:55,632
 I'll become a boyfriend you can always be proud of.

170
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,590
♫  I want to leave everything behind and go next to you  ♫

171
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:07,780
♫  Because I think I can forget all the painful times  ♫

172
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:16,530
♫  I’m looking for you like this  ♫

173
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,750
♫  But where are you? Leaving me behind here?  ♫

174
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:31,100
♫  Leaving me behind here?  ♫

175
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, my head.

176
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:52,034
What...?

177
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:54,100
Why am I here?

178
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,134
 Open the door.

179
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:06,231
 I said open the door.

180
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:09,232
 If you don't open it, I'll break in.

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,467
 What are you doing here?

182
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,432
 Open the door.

183
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,532
 I just...

184
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:29,932
 don't understand.

185
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:34,033
 You talked about being a boyfriend I'll be proud of.

186
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,598
 Isn't it so funny?

187
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,098
 I didn't know I'd get dumped like this,

188
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:38,000
 and I said I love you.

189
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,566
 And I threw you a birthday party.

190
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:40,665
 I did.

191
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,699
 I'm leaving.

192
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,266
 I'm leaving your company.

193
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,032
 And I'm leaving your apartment.

194
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,432
 I'm so pitiable.

195
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,800
 I'm humiliated.

196
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,367
 I don't understand this situation.

197
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,900
 I really don't understand this.

198
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,833
 I can't understand it.

199
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,434
 Darn it.

200
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,832
 I'll pretend yesterday didn't happen.

201
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,332
 Don't ever do that again.

202
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,065
Who is that crazy bastard?

203
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,660
♫  A tiger is coming down. A tiger is coming down.  ♫

204
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,780
♫  A beast is coming down.  ♫

205
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,670
♫  Through the deep valley to this pine forest  ♫

206
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,130
♫  It swings its wide head  ♫

207
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,430
♫  Its ears are both pricked up  ♫

208
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,210
♫  Its body is striped  ♫

209
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,220
♫  Its fluffed tail  ♫

210
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,820
♫  A tiger is coming down. A tiger is coming down.  ♫

211
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,298
What a fool.

212
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,064
Did something good happen?

213
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:30,367
You already won a subscription.

214
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,667
Since you brought that up...

215
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,199
His apartment price rose by ₩50 million.

216
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,999
What? Already?

217
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,231
You know how I heard?

218
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:40,566
Through the group chat of the pre-residents.

219
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,165
Wow, congratulations!

220
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,832
Thanks.

221
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,899
So today, I will...

222
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,566
Buy dinner after work!

223
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:49,866
Yes!

224
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:52,165
- What? 
 - No?

225
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:54,633
Actually, I was going to buy coffee.

226
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:55,899
What the heck.

227
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,231
The price rose ₩50 million.

228
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:59,332
So dinner is nothing.

229
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,734
I'll buy!

230
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,500
- Count me out. 
 - So now you're speaking to me?

231
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,666
Tell that to him, Mi Ra.

232
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,699
It's good if you don't come.

233
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:12,933
One less mouth to feed.

234
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,964
You were walking on eggshells yesterday. What's up?

235
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:19,531
After the price rose, I began to think.

236
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:22,798
Friends? It doesn't matter if I lose one.

237
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,866
The price rose ₩50 million.

238
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:29,132
No need to cling to someone who's cutting me off.

239
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:31,399
The price rose ₩50 million.

240
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,266
Stop being like that and make up with Yeo Ui Joo.

241
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,098
Yeo Ui Joo? Who's that?

242
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:40,531
The only Yeo Ui Joo I know is the magic pearl called "yeouijoo" in "Dragon Ball."

243
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,830

244
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,665
Nam Sang Soon is such a jerk.

245
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,266
Blockhead!

246
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,232
Where is it?

247
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,699
Young Won!

248
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,665
What are you doing here?

249
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:12,967
Sunbae.

250
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,200
What is it?

251
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,332
What's wrong?

252
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,133
Did something happen?

253
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,064
Waste time and emotions?

254
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:26,131
That's why he dumped you?

255
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:30,332
That's the worst break-up talk I've ever heard!

256
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,767
He shouldn't have started dating then. I should go talk to him.

257
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,900
No, don't.

258
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,098
You're right.

259
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:41,733
What use is it when you've already broken up?

260
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,231
This is a blessing in disguise.

261
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:46,733
Forget that scumbag.

262
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:51,331
Also, there's something you need to take to heart.

263
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,598
What is it?

264
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:55,665
Don't you go crying to him, and don't be clingy.

265
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,566
That's the most pathetic thing in the world—

266
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,665
I did.

267
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,699
What?

268
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,432
I cried and threw a tantrum.

269
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,698
Oh, no.

270
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:08,899
How can I face him now?

271
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,132
There's a seat over there.

272
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,533
Okay.

273
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,766
Here. Sit.

274
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,433
Good.

275
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,499
Two bowls of chicken ginseng soup, please.

276
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,332
I don't feel like eating. It's okay if I don't eat.

277
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:28,031
Why won't you eat?

278
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:30,132
You should eat more in times like this.

279
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,699
Show him you can eat well and thrive without him.

280
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:36,365
Oh? Editor Na! Editor Yeo!

281
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,866
What?

282
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,999
You were discharged?

283
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,132
Are you feeling okay?

284
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,865
Yes, totally.

285
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,132
Can we join you?

286
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,633
What?

287
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,299
You two should eat together comfortably.

288
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,365
It's not like we don't know each other.

289
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,499
Let's eat together.

290
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,266
It's okay, right?

291
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,065
You must like chicken ginseng soup a lot.

292
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,500
Yes, I like it very much.

293
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,332
Did you hear that, soup?

294
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,098
He likes you.

295
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,165
But don't trust him.

296
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,866
There's no guarantee he'll still like you tomorrow.

297
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,232
- What are you...? 
 - He seems so fickle.

298
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:32,399
I'm afraid he'll dump the soup overnight.

299
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,431
Sunbae.

300
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:34,865
What?

301
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:38,332
I'm just worried that the soup will be hurt, but he won't even care.

302
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,134
Then only the soup will be pitiful.

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,932
Don't you think so, sir?

304
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,932
What are you going on about all for no reason?

305
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,733
Is it really for no reason, though?

306
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:52,466
I'm saying this as a person who loves chicken soup.

307
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,531
Eat up the chicken soup you love so much.

308
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,433
It's good.

309
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,966
But why aren't you eating, Editor Na?

310
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,665
What? Oh.

311
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:08,666
I am.

312
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,799
That heartless bastard.

313
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,198
You bawled your eyes out yesterday.

314
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:24,366
Yet he's eating like nothing has happened.

315
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,366
I'm getting goosebumps.

316
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,900
What's wrong? Indigestion?

317
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,799
Oh, no. Are you okay?

318
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,699
Oh, dear.

319
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

320
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,532
Here's the advertorial proposal.

321
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:59,000
Thank you. You may leave.

322
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:07,533
Why aren't you leaving?

323
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:13,732
I'm sorry about yesterday.

324
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:15,031
I was too drunk.

325
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:16,499
Didn't you see the note?

326
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,350
I said I'll pretend yesterday didn't happen.

327
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:22,932
Yes.

328
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,432
Thank you.

329
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,733
For pretending it didn't happen.

330
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:32,367
That will never happen again.

331
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:36,310
But if I do something ridiculous like that,

332
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:42,799
please be cold to me like you are now.

333
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,600
That way, I won't have any lingering feelings.

334
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,430
Good day.

335
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,810
♫  You’ve fall asleep  ♫

336
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:06,010
♫  And I want to see you from a little closer  ♫

337
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,520
♫  It would be so nice  ♫

338
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,040
 I can't understand it.

339
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,950
♫  Comfortable with each other  ♫

340
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,470
♫  Always be my side  ♫

341
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,300
♫  On days you start to sigh  ♫

342
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,910
♫  Come to me  ♫

343
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:48,390
♫  Even things you couldn’t ask me  ♫

344
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,360
♫  Are okay with me, if it’s you  ♫

345
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,630
♫  Always be your side  ♫

346
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,130
♫  Even feelings that you can’t figure out  ♫

347
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,700
 Don't go.

348
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,560
♫  Tell me  ♫

349
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,310
 Don't go.

350
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:22,500
♫  When you wanna go somewhere  ♫

351
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,950
♫  Tell me  ♫

352
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,532
Oh? Mi Ra.

353
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,568
What brings you here?

354
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,867
Here.

355
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:50,931
What's this?

356
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:55,700
I wanted you to take good care of yourself since you were discharged quickly.

357
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,100
You can have some, too, Chan.

358
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,865
 Why me?

359
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,399
 You're being so obvious.

360
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,499
I'm fine.

361
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:05,165
But since you brought it for me, I'll eat it well.

362
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:07,433
- Thank you. 
 - Bon Appetit.

363
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,933
Thanks.

364
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:18,340
You're eating well thanks to me.

365
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,299
Yes. I'll be down in a sec.

366
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,466
Jeez.

367
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,833
You're the one eating well thanks to me.

368
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:32,750
She's now using Gyeom as an excuse.

369
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,165
Oh my.

370
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:36,799
She's cute.

371
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,367
Awesome!

372
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,566
With this devotion,

373
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,000
there's nothing else to do

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,431
but say yes to her.

375
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:57,433
A home is a vessel in which we place our life.

376
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:59,599
Editor Na made it. It's good, right?

377
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,367
I suppose so.

378
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,466
Right?

379
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:05,098
So I want to ask you.

380
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,566
She could write special articles like this now.

381
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:13,200
It's a shame she's only writing promos that just anyone can—

382
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,167
Just anyone?

383
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,799
Oh, what I mean is,

384
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,365
an article from just writing down what you say, a culmination of only your hard work,

385
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:23,832
making her write something that easy

386
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,132
could be a loss to our magazine.

387
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,566
Okay then.

388
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:31,732
Starting today, Editor Na will write special articles.

389
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:35,366
Then who will write your promo articles?

390
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:39,098
You will until I find a freelance editor.

391
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:40,332
What? Me?

392
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,500
That will be all.

393
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,190
Sir, sir!

394
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,832
He had no problems shoving food into his mouth sitting next to you,

395
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,832
but I guess he can't bear to work with you.

396
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,090
He replaced you the first chance he got.

397
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,765
It's a blessing in disguise.

398
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:12,598
It's a good thing, anyway.

399
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,531
You can now write articles that you want.

400
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:18,598
Forget him completely and live a new life.

401
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,598
Write good articles, get a scouting offer,

402
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:23,632
and go to another magazine so you won't see him.

403
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,665
Live like that.

404
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,366
Right.

405
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,899
I should.

406
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,665
I'll head out now.

407
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,166
Okay.

408
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,670
What will I do with her?

409
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,766
Hello, Photographer Shin?

410
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:50,833
What?

411
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:53,233
Chief Editor instead of Editor Na?

412
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:56,598
Yes. Set a schedule with Chief Editor for the shoot.

413
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,899
And reschedule my advertorial shoot schedule.

414
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,367
By the way,

415
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:04,134
did something happen between Editor Na and Ja Sung?

416
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:07,600
The vibe was weird at lunch.

417
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,732
What's the use of noticing that now?

418
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:13,666
You should've noticed before lunch.

419
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,020
What do you mean?

420
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,132
What are you doing?

421
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,899
Is it true?

422
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:35,532
That you dated and dumped Editor Na?

423
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,067
Did you stop me just to ask that?

424
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:39,466
You don't want to waste time and emotions?

425
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,466
Is it true you broke up because of that ridiculous reason?

426
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,065
Yes, that's right.

427
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:44,900
So what?

428
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,832
Why did you start dating her if you were going to end it like this?

429
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,765
If you were going to hurt her, why date her?!

430
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:51,531
I didn't know dating would be such a hindrance.

431
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:53,865
You know money is the most important to me.

432
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,766
Hyung.

433
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:57,733
You're the worst.

434
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,440
You're not the person I thought you were.

435
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,699
When are you moving in?

436
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:34,766
In August, two years from now.

437
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:37,400
Two years later...

438
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,698
The price rose ₩50 million already.

439
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,765
At this rate, you'll pay back the loan

440
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,999
for the installment payment and then some when you move in.

441
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,633
I know.

442
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:49,065
This is why people bank everything on a subscription.

443
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:51,665
The meat is running out. Should I order more?

444
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:54,865
Yes! Order all you want!

445
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,466
They also do take-out.

446
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,865
If you want, you can take a bag home.

447
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:01,366
- Really? 
 - Just kidding!

448
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,698
Two more portions of rib eye, please.

449
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:05,865
Drink up!

450
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:09,440
- Cheers! 
 - Congratulations.

451
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:12,532
Hello?

452
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:15,160
Yes, I'm Nam Sang Soon.

453
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,066
What?

454
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:36,167
I feel better now that I'm home.

455
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,733
Home sweet home.

456
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,534
 Stop.

457
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,532
 "Home"?

458
00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:47,700
 It's your boyfriend's... No.

459
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,031
 Your ex-boyfriend's home.

460
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,132
Beat it.

461
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,700
I can't stand the sight of you.

462
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,733
 Have you given up on becoming a homeowner?

463
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:57,799
Do you want to be poor...?

464
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,165
It's me.

465
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:03,190
I know it's me. I know I'm poor, so leave me alone!

466
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,799
Don't ever appear again.

467
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:11,499
I don't want to think about you.

468
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,531
I invested in this art village, and it sold out.

469
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:27,598
There's a second village scheduled for construction.

470
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,066
Write an article that can get that sold out, too.

471
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,666
Yes, sir.

472
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:35,531
Wow, how did you sell all of them?

473
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:38,400
As expected, you really are...

474
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,865
He's really something for sure.

475
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,666
How can he be so rude?

476
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,660

477
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,598
 The first floor is a studio for artists to work.

478
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:03,000
 Above that is the living space.

479
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,900
 There's also a gallery where they can sell their work.

480
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:12,332
This fusion of home and office is the trend.

481
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,399
It's called a homeffice.

482
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,934
This is good.

483
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:19,667
But I don't think I could live here.

484
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,566
I need to go to the office

485
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,932
to get away from my wife's nagging and to breathe.

486
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:27,799
Working at home?

487
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,599
That's horrible.

488
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,190
Ah, thank you.

489
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,140
Thank you.

490
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:39,165
I'm so envious of you.

491
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:42,899
I'd like to work at home like you.

492
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,732
Thank you.

493
00:30:44,732 --> 00:30:47,399
Seeing this place reminds me of this phrase.

494
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:52,332
"A home is a vessel in which we place our life."

495
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,598
The artist is a busy person.

496
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,567
Please proceed with the interview.

497
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:57,632
Oh, yes.

498
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,598
I apologize. It's his first time covering a story with me.

499
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,399
There will be some shortcomings.

500
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:02,467
It's okay.

501
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:05,466
Can you tell us the floor area ratio first?

502
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,733
Oh, the floor area ratio is—

503
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:11,799
The ratio of a building's total floor area to the lot size.

504
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,865
- Did you know that? 
 - Yes.

505
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:15,700
Then the total floor area is?

506
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,899
The total sum of the areas of all floors.

507
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:22,410
I know my stuff, right?

508
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,733
I guess I underestimated you.

509
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:31,999
I thought you didn't know basic real estate terms.

510
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,367
This is nothing.

511
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:36,032
Did you study because of the reconstruction?

512
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:39,766
If I had known, I would've worked with you sooner.

513
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,832
Instead of hiring freelancers in the future, I can just—

514
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:45,199
Oh, no. That won't do.

515
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,965
Actually, I hastily memorized what Editor Na told me.

516
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:51,666
What?

517
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:55,733
She said I had to know basic real estate terms before the interview.

518
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,565
She emphasized it so much!

519
00:31:57,565 --> 00:32:01,565
It seemed she studied up on it properly.

520
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,733
 Floor area ratio, building-to-land ratio,

521
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:05,300
 station district, security right.

522
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,966
 Appraised value of land, standard market price,

523
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,432
 and current price base.

524
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:11,233
 I'm studying hard on real estate nowadays.

525
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,565
Sir? Sir?

526
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,265
Yes?

527
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,698
Are you not coming?

528
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:18,199
Oh, right.

529
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,264
Let's go, Editor Na.

530
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:22,399
I'm not Editor Na.

531
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:23,967
So?

532
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:27,333
You just called me Editor Na.

533
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:34,298
I was going to say, "Chief Editor who learned from Editor Na."

534
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:35,799
Let's go, Chief Editor.

535
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,630
Yes, sir.

536
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,531
Hello.

537
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:51,850
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

538
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,467
Did you eat?

539
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,032
If you didn't, let's order something.

540
00:32:58,032 --> 00:33:02,340
I didn't eat anything because of a meeting...

541
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,466
What's up? Why the long face?

542
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:11,233
Oh, well...

543
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,700
I get it.

544
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,866
The bill for dinner last night was huge, right?

545
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:17,431
So? Was the bill ₩50 million?

546
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:21,300
Did he spend all that money in an instant?

547
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,833
What?

548
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,999
He is so petty.

549
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,098
If you live like that, nothing will work out for you.

550
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,600
Got it, girls?

551
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,932
Yes.

552
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:35,660
That's why nothing's working out for me.

553
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,599
What?

554
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,467
What's up with him?

555
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:44,832
He might lose his apartment.

556
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:46,220
What do you mean?

557
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,980

558
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,570
I'm going crazy.

559
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,900
You still haven't gotten the money?

560
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:02,465
I can't believe you couldn't get a loan because of low credit.

561
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:04,600
What do I do?

562
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,400
It was my last hope in my miserable life.

563
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,865
Fate is so cruel.

564
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:12,500
How can it give and snatch away at once?

565
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,100
I don't want to lose it.

566
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,799
Chief Editor, do you have any money...?

567
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,632
Where would I get ₩50 million?

568
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:23,265
I'm scared to even spend ₩5,000 with my wife hawk-eyeing me.

569
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:24,398
Right?

570
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,380
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:32,232
Come on. Why don't you ask Editor Yeo?

572
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:34,165
Her lease was changed to a monthly rent.

573
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:36,165
She got her deposit back.

574
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:37,732
How can I ask Editor Yeo?

575
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:38,667
I have a conscience.

576
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,165
Just beg for forgiveness, you fool.

577
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,499
You can't afford not to.

578
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:43,898
No, I can't.

579
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:46,200
If I ask her for money,

580
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,167
I won't be able to face her for the rest of my life.

581
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:57,365
 At least he has a sense of decency.

582
00:34:57,366 --> 00:35:00,332
 How would he dare to ask me?

583
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:03,899
So I'm going to interview architect Yoo Ji Sun.

584
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:08,060
I'll show you the title and concept.

585
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,380

586
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,530

587
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,099
What's wrong?

588
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,231
I'm sorry. I made a typo.

589
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:19,931
What? A typo?

590
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,110
Oh, there...

591
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,370

592
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,330

593
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,880
I think I saw it wrong.

594
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,064
I'm sorry to interrupt your meeting.

595
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:41,160
We're getting lunch. Pick a dish.

596
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,030

597
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,633
What's wrong?

598
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,333
What?

599
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,230
Nothing.

600
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,180

601
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,960

602
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,666
What do you want? Did you choose?

603
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,167
Young Won.

604
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,033
Hey!

605
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,431
Right.

606
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:02,931
I don't want anything.

607
00:36:02,931 --> 00:36:05,270
I need to use the restroom.

608
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,033
I told her to live a new life.

609
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:15,470
But she's totally lost it.

610
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:22,633
This is Editor Nam's storyboard.

611
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:24,580
Wait.

612
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:27,367
- Mi Ra is dying with joy, right? 
 - What?

613
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,366
She didn't say anything?

614
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:33,033
She must not have seen the lunch box yet.

615
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,466
If she had, she'd be boasting to you.

616
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:36,967
What?

617
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,665
 You broke down the solid wall called Jang Chan.

618
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,200
 Mi Ra, you win.

619
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,090
 Let's officially go on a date.

620
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,531
The heart is a funny thing.

621
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:54,132
When someone keeps saying they like you,

622
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:55,832
you eventually open your heart.

623
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,367
- Close it. 
 - What?

624
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:00,666
Close your heart.

625
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,966
Mi Ra doesn't like you.

626
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,132
What nonsense is that...?

627
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,633
It's not nonsense.

628
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,133
What?

629
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,100
Then who...?

630
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:17,340
 Attractive dimples.

631
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:37,900
No!

632
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,630
Mi Ra!

633
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,166
What's wrong?

634
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,499
I thought I put in your favorite chocolate,

635
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:52,532
but I forgot.

636
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:53,999
Give it here. I'll put it in and give it back.

637
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,332
No, it's okay.

638
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,790
I said I'll put chocolate in!

639
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:08,665
You know, Jang Chan is a strange person.

640
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:09,566
No.

641
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,620
Let's just say he's a sad person.

642
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:25,833
I'm sorry.

643
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:50,232
Oh, wait up!

644
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,432
23% of ₩50 million is...

645
00:39:12,432 --> 00:39:14,531
The interest alone is ₩12 million!

646
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,740
This is insane.

647
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:19,699
Oh, whatever.

648
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,865
There's no other way.

649
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:23,832
What?

650
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,533
What's this?

651
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,266
Settle the middle payment with that.

652
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:32,766
Wait.

653
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,933
Why all of a sudden?

654
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:38,064
What use is that question?

655
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:39,432
Pay me back.

656
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:41,500
With interest.

657
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,232
Forget it.

658
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,898
How can I ask you for money?

659
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:45,232
Don't want it? Then give it back.

660
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,466
No, no, no.

661
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:49,000
Seriously.

662
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,466
Thank you, Ui Joo.

663
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:55,998
I won't ever forget your kindness.

664
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,466
What would you do without me?

665
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:02,699
- You, Nam Sang Soon! 
 - Ouch, ouch!

666
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,434
I'm leaving.

667
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:08,200
Hello?

668
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,632
Yes.

669
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,200
It hurts.

670
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,064
 What are you doing?

671
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,198
 I distinctly told you to never do this again!

672
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,332
 I just don't understand. I just can't.

673
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,832
 Can you please just understand now?

674
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,064
 Doesn't it affect you at all?

675
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:41,166
 Am I the only one hurting?

676
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,266
 Yes.

677
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:45,432
 It doesn't affect me. I'm not hurting one bit.

678
00:40:45,432 --> 00:40:47,064
 So leave right now.

679
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:48,665
 No.

680
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:50,333
 I can't.

681
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,000
 What?

682
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,967
 I'm not here because I want to be.

683
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,499
 - You called me here. 
 -  What?

684
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:58,899
 This is a dream. Your dream.

685
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:02,367
 You're shamelessly dreaming about me!

686
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:05,865
Yoo Ja Sung.

687
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,966
What are you doing?

688
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:55,800
A home is a vessel in which we place our life?

689
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:59,866
My life is a total disaster.

690
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:05,066
What time is it?

691
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,566
Where's my phone?

692
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,099
 My boyfrnd dumped me.

693
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,165
 I wanna forgt him, but I caaaant.

694
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:20,732
 What do I do?

695
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:24,432
I must've written it while I was drunk.

696
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:28,366
I should just hang myself.

697
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,467
Oh? Sunbae?

698
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:40,499
I was talking to Photographer Shin about work,

699
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,799
and learned he's going to the countryside by himself.

700
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,398
So I asked him to include us.

701
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:49,265
Can you take me back? I want to stay home.

702
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:50,832
You're spoiling the mood.

703
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:55,132
It could look weird if it's just me and him.

704
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:59,198
I want to get some fresh air, so be quiet and come along.

705
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:01,999
Yes. Since we're out, let's have fun.

706
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,332
Yes!

707
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,299
Let's stop by a service station.

708
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,198
Young Won loves the braised potatoes sold there.

709
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,867
Right, Young Won?

710
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:11,334
Yes.

711
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,231
I have to hear my wife's nagging at home.

712
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:26,500
It's better to chill out at the office.

713
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:28,766
Oh, right.

714
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:31,200
No need for tiptoeing.

715
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:35,933
Feels good.

716
00:43:41,566 --> 00:43:45,833
I'll show you what chilling out is.

717
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:48,434
What?

718
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:51,366
What's that noise?

719
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,534
Where's his desk?

720
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,566
What?

721
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,099
Sir?

722
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,265
What are you doing?

723
00:44:13,265 --> 00:44:15,799
I came to read a book,

724
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,565
and moved my desk since it seemed more efficient.

725
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:20,166
What?

726
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,966
Oh, sir.

727
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:24,799
How can this be more efficient?

728
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:27,632
I guess it is.

729
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,999
But why move it yourself? We could've done it tomorrow.

730
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:34,632
I wanted to do it. What are you doing here on the weekend?

731
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:38,164
There was nothing to do at home, so I came to the office...

732
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:41,398
Not to muck around and waste electricity, I hope?

733
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:42,999
Sir?

734
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,531
Oh, of course not.

735
00:44:44,532 --> 00:44:47,099
I've come to write the promo article.

736
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,798
I did well, right?

737
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:50,665
Yes. Then get to work.

738
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,433
Yes, sir.

739
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,690

740
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:55,966
Why are you doing that?

741
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:58,533
I just want to.

742
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,766
I'll help you. Where...

743
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:00,799
Where...

744
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,665
Your nose must bother you.

745
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:04,532
Sir?

746
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,966
Since you're so nosy.

747
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:08,432
Just let me do it.

748
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:10,131
Don't mind me and go to work.

749
00:45:10,131 --> 00:45:13,964
- But still... 
 - Just mind your own business.

750
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:17,266
I beg of you.

751
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:27,898
 Can anyone write an article for me?

752
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:30,100
 I'll pay.

753
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:37,700
No, I have my dignity as the chief editor.

754
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,666
I'll write it myself.

755
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:45,600
But I really don't want to!

756
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:03,260
Si... si... si... sir!

757
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:06,532
Okay.

758
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,064
Oh, my heart.

759
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:17,465
What is he doing?

760
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,565
This is great!

761
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:31,200
- Right, Young Won? 
 - Yes. Totally.

762
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,332
Thank you for inviting me.

763
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:36,600
No problem.

764
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,365
The air is so fresh.

765
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:44,000
It's so therapeutic.

766
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:48,899
Queen Yeo!

767
00:46:50,467 --> 00:46:52,432
Oh? What are you doing here?

768
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:53,898
I heard from Photographer Shin.

769
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:56,299
I should be where Queen Yeo is.

770
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,432
Why are you calling me Queen Yeo?

771
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:00,432
You are my sovereign overlord.

772
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:02,165
You saved me from the pits.

773
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:03,566
Stop.

774
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:04,433
Did you call him?

775
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:06,265
Come on, let's go inside.

776
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:09,064
Queen Yeo, give me your bag. I'll carry it.

777
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:10,966
Let's go, let's go!

778
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:13,765
What is he talking about?

779
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:15,799
Why is he calling you "Queen Yeo"?

780
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,132
Don't worry about it.

781
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:19,832
Let's go inside.

782
00:47:19,832 --> 00:47:21,365
This is great.

783
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:25,999
Wow, awesome.

784
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:32,931
Since you always stayed at your studio, I forgot you were from a rich family.

785
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:34,299
But now it's really hitting me.

786
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,467
Yes.

787
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:37,265
Is this your parents' vacation home?

788
00:47:37,265 --> 00:47:38,199
Yes.

789
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,067
Did CEO Yoo get this for them?

790
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:46,299
What? CEO Yoo didn't get this for them?

791
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,265
I heard CEO Yoo is close with your parents.

792
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,766
What's wrong?

793
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,966
I heard CEO Yoo talk about it the other time.

794
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:54,099
Shut up!

795
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,400
Do I have to hear that name all the way here?

796
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,067
Okay. I won't mention him.

797
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:02,766
I shouldn't spoil Queen Yeo's mood.

798
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:04,799
Why? I'm curious, too.

799
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,932
Did CEO Yoo get your parents this house?

800
00:48:06,932 --> 00:48:08,632
Oh, yes.

801
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:12,300
Wow, he really is competent.

802
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,799
How did he find this house?

803
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,933
- Amazing. 
 - Editor Na, shut up!

804
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,365
Queen Yeo doesn't want to hear that name.

805
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,131
You shut up, for goodness' sake.

806
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,265
Please? All right?

807
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:24,365
Let's take a walk around the neighborhood.

808
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:26,132
Sounds great. Let's go.

809
00:48:26,132 --> 00:48:28,099
I'll quickly go to the bathroom.

810
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,531
Go on ahead.

811
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,032
Okay.

812
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,933
 Thank you for being so thoughtful.

813
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,665
 This was your idea.

814
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:52,798
 You said let's take her to cheer her up.

815
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:56,031
 I worried about her but didn't think to try this.

816
00:48:56,032 --> 00:49:01,499
 I feel bad I didn't catch on quickly enough and made her eat with Ja Sung.

817
00:49:01,499 --> 00:49:06,432
 I, too, feel bad about telling you about Young Won and CEO Yoo.

818
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:10,534
 You told me so I wouldn't make a mistake again.

819
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,932
 If Young Won finds out, all hell will break loose,

820
00:49:12,932 --> 00:49:16,365
 so please keep it a secret from her.

821
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:20,533
 Of course. Let's do everything to cheer her up.

822
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:24,266
 Yes. So she won't have time to feel glum.

823
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:36,699
 They're doing their best to cheer me up.

824
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:39,000
 I shouldn't be so down.

825
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:41,600
I should make an effort.

826
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,266
I can get over him.

827
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:58,899
What is it this time?

828
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:12,898
What are you doing, sir?

829
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:17,064
I'm organizing. It'll look better if the books are shelved according to color.

830
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:19,265
Oh, sir.

831
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,333
It doesn't matter how an archive looks...

832
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:27,167
I guess it does. I'll help, too.

833
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:30,332
- You're like a light bulb. 
 - Sir?

834
00:50:30,332 --> 00:50:34,166
Your memory is flickering. I told you to let me do it.

835
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,631
I begged you to mind your own business.

836
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:39,232
But I'm your subordinate, I can't...

837
00:50:39,232 --> 00:50:41,633
Mind your own business, okay?

838
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:44,832
I'm begging you. Please.

839
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,832
Wow, this place is so pretty.

840
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,064
Right?

841
00:50:50,065 --> 00:50:52,966
Look over there. Doesn't it bring back memories?

842
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,967
It does. My inner child is waking up.

843
00:50:58,066 --> 00:50:59,966
It's cold. Let's go.

844
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:01,499
Already?

845
00:51:01,499 --> 00:51:03,299
Let's hang out here a bit more.

846
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,700
Yes. My inner child is waking up. Let's play "Red Light, Green Light."

847
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,031
That's so childish. We're too old to...

848
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:12,301
- Let's do it. 
 - Let's do it!

849
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,499
Let's get a move on it!

850
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,334
Queen Yeo! Please be careful.

851
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:19,167
Here I go.

852
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,700
- She seems to be feeling better, right? 
 - She does, but let's work harder.

853
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,066
Green light, red light.

854
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,031
You two are so funny.

855
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:30,899
You're almost here, set me free in the next one.

856
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:34,160
Green light, red light.

857
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:38,265
Why are you two just goofing around?

858
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:41,590
Green light, red light.

859
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,730
Oh no!

860
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:49,100
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

861
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,850
- Are you alright? 
 - Young Won.

862
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:55,232
Gotcha.

863
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:57,399
Oh, come on!

864
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,990
I tricked you. You're it.

865
00:52:07,432 --> 00:52:08,801
- Careful. 
 - You scared me.

866
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:10,800
Careful, careful.

867
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,150
Queen Yeo.

868
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:15,732
Are you all right?

869
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,433
What?

870
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,532
Your leg.

871
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:21,799
I'm fine.

872
00:52:21,799 --> 00:52:25,220
I...

873
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,060
hope you stop hurting.

874
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:33,832
I hope you'll heal soon.

875
00:52:34,933 --> 00:52:37,332
Don't worry.

876
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:39,467
This is nothing.

877
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,332
What should we do now?

878
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,380
How about we go to old school today?

879
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:57,330
♫  I never dreamt that you could leave me  ♫

880
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:00,340
♫  I can't believe you could abandon me  ♫

881
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,570
♫  It seemed like you'd give me anything whenever I wanted it  ♫

882
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,630
♫  (Saba saba saba)  ♫

883
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,210
♫  You wrestled with yourself flattering me, 
 who was cranky and moody  ♫

884
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:11,360

885
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,520
♫  I live for the look, I die for the look  ♫

886
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,450
♫  On the way that this guy comes and goes  ♫

889
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:28,600
Sir, I finished the article...

890
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,840
Where is he now?

891
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,580

892
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,000
Where did he go?

893
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,899
Sir!

894
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:01,199
What are you doing?

895
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:05,132
There's so much dust everywhere.

896
00:54:05,132 --> 00:54:08,765
What? Why are you doing this?

897
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:13,733
Aigoo, this won't do. Let me help you with this one.

898
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:15,770
Not again.

899
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,466
I begged you to comply with my request.

900
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:22,966
- But sir... 
 - How can I make you do as I ask?

901
00:54:22,966 --> 00:54:25,800
Should I get down on my knees?

902
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,933
No.

903
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:30,350
I'm too tired to keep begging you.

904
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,760
All right.

905
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:42,765
Sir! Are you okay? Move over. I will...

906
00:54:42,765 --> 00:54:46,400
Stop! Just let me do it.

907
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,533
Let me see.

908
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:58,032
You're bleeding.

909
00:54:58,032 --> 00:55:01,040
I told you to let me do it.

910
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,567
Sir.

911
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:12,433
Is there something you want to forget?

912
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:13,933
What?

913
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,730

914
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:25,600
I know how you feel.

915
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,300
There was a time

916
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:38,900
when my place almost got approved for reconstruction but it fell through at the last minute.

917
00:55:40,065 --> 00:55:43,533
If I stayed still, I kept thinking about it.

918
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:48,800
So I cleaned the house so many times.

919
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,200
But exhausting yourself doesn't make you forget.

920
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:59,133
The very act of struggling to forget means you're actually thinking about it.

921
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,100
Then what can I do?

922
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,960
I don't know.

923
00:56:12,466 --> 00:56:15,667
How about just letting it be?

924
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,199
What?

925
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:22,999
If it comes to mind, just let it be. It'll fade eventually.

926
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:25,967
You'll forget as time goes by.

927
00:56:27,034 --> 00:56:29,499
That's what I learned.

928
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:31,866
Time heals all wounds.

929
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:34,766
Will it really?

930
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,699
Of course.

931
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:41,599
Even this finger will heal with time.

932
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:48,932
Okay, then. Get some rest. I'll tidy up the break room.

933
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:23,366
It's so good.

934
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:27,866
So? Are you having fun?

935
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:30,965
Yes. My stress is being released.

936
00:57:30,965 --> 00:57:32,999
Right? It's good you came, right?

937
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,531
Yes. I played like crazy. I'm eating good food.

938
00:57:37,531 --> 00:57:39,870
It would've been a shame if I hadn't come.

939
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:47,267
- Excuse me. 
 - Sure.

940
00:57:47,267 --> 00:57:49,100
Hi, Mom.

941
00:57:51,065 --> 00:57:53,600
Our plan worked, right?

942
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,490
Yes. I think she's feeling much better.

943
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:01,133
What are you talking about? What's up with Editor Na?

944
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:04,065
- Oh, well... 
 - Curiosity killed the cat.

945
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:08,632
Just know we came to cheer her up because she's going through some stuff.

946
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:14,565
As expected. There's no end to our Queen Yeo's good deeds!

947
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:17,732
Right? I'm awesome, right?

948
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:21,266
So why am I single? Where's my Mr. Right?

949
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:23,933
Don't worry. He'll show up soon.

950
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,367
I don't know who he is, but he's blessed.

951
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:28,265
So blessed!

952
00:58:28,266 --> 00:58:32,066
That's it? Set me up with someone, you, Nam Sang-soon!

953
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:34,767
Huh? Set me up.

954
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:37,466
Oh, hold on.

955
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:39,400
Cheers.

956
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:47,780
This is so good.

957
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:02,033
All right. I'm hanging up now.

958
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:06,132
Stay safe and healthy.

959
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:07,765
Bye.

960
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,730
Daebak. Look at the stars.

961
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:30,490
 Do you know that a home is a container that holds life?

962
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:37,832
 My place was literally a mess today.

963
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:40,450
 Just like my life.

964
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:47,600
 So I left as if I was running away from home. I think it was a wise choice.

965
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,333
 Red light.

966
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:56,699
 Spending the day outside, bustling about, I tried not to think about him.

967
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:59,130
 And it worked.

968
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:18,267
 Actually, that's a lie.

969
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:22,231
 Green light, red light.

970
01:00:22,232 --> 01:00:25,465

994
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,864
 Hey, Shin Gyeom!

995
01:02:59,864 --> 01:03:02,199
 What's up with him?

996
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:07,367
 Treat me however you want. I won't have any lingering feelings anymore.

997
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,398
 Do I...?

998
01:03:08,398 --> 01:03:09,798
 - Oh, no! 
 - Ouch, hot!

999
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:13,932
 You really are bad for my heart.

1000
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:16,366
 Rich guy?

1001
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:20,898
 What's my purpose in toiling away, earning money?

1002
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:23,333
 I don't know and I feel empty.

1003
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,700
 You broke up because of me.

1004
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,998
