1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:07,990

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,600

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,130

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,120

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,070

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,580

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,380

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,730

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,640

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,160

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,080
When did this break off?

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,400
I need to get a new one.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,380
Wait. I shouldn't waste anything.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
Right.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,529
Right, right.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,440
I was thrifty to a fault

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,490
and saved up ₩105,200 ($105.20) in a week.

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,120
I'll get the ₩100 million seed money in no time.

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,769
₩105,200 in a week.

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,709
That's ₩420,800 in a month.

21
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,450
In a year that's...

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,239
₩5,049,600 ($5,049.60).

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,920
To get to ₩100 mil...

24
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,099
Nineteen point...

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,510
Twenty years?

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,910
"In no time," my foot!

27
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,650
I'll be half a century old in order to save ₩100 mil.

28
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,600
No way.

29
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,020
How can I save up faster?

30
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,099
 A good way to cut back on spending habits

31
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,620
 is the super frugal method of

32
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,789
 spending only ₩10,000 ($10) a day.

33
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,500
 It's the ₩10,000 calendar.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,150
♫  Like putting one ice cube in an americano  ♫

35
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,759
 Spending only ₩10,000.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,479
 You can do it, right?

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,650
Yes.

38
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,730
♫  Like putting one ice cube in an americano  ♫

39
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,720
 This is a ₩10,000 calendar I made.

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,220
 Project Spend ₩10,000 a Day.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,679
 Until the day I become a homeowner,

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,810
 today's me will never be indebted to tomorrow's me.

43
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,740
♫  I'm not the only one  ♫

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,370
 I hope you succeed.

45
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,340
 Fighting.

46
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,589
Yes, what is it?

47
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:12,000
 Sir, there's a buyer for the place you're living in.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,279
Good.

49
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:15,560
I'll sign the contract and move out tomorrow.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,810

51
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,439
Hello. Good morning.

52
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,600
 Good morning.

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,870
Are you okay?

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,150
Huh? About what?

55
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,170
You lost ₩5 mil. because of the armchair incident.

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,230
Oh, that.

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,140
The CEO said it would be paid off as a company expense.

58
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,830
Really? No way!

59
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,069
Really? I was so worried. That's wonderful!

60
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,910
What's wrong?

61
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,889
That heartless man who only cares about money?

62
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,539
It happened while doing company work.

63
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,370
If the company didn't take responsibility,

64
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,990
he worried there would be problems with the Labor Law.

65
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,000
I guess he got legal counsel in case you sued.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,190
Still, it's not like him to be so generous.

67
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,880
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Your life was rough, but it may be getting better.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,760
Thank you.

70
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,990
Next is the new advertisement we got.

71
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,540

72
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,250
They want this as an advertorial in this month's issue.

73
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,480
The ad fee is thirty percent higher than others.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,000
Chief Editor, put this in this month's issue.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Sir?

76
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,820
I don't think we can...

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,820
All the spots are full.

78
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,219
Then shorten the Special article and put this in.

79
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,740
Sir?

80
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,030
Sir, this isn't right.

81
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,699
An athlete's foot ad in Monthly Magazine Home?

82
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,670
It's hideous.

83
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,539
Before you became the CEO,

84
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:48,320
we carefully selected ads and ran them minimally.

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,329
Maintaining dignity is our first priority.

86
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:51,769
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

87
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,130
Then dropping is the only way.

88
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,299
That's right. We should drop this ad...

89
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,119
Not the ad. You, Chief Editor.

90
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,590
If you don't agree with me, I'll drop you.

91
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,380
From this company.

92
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,059
I'll put the ad in quietly.

93
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,579
As long as I'm CEO, dignity isn't the first priority.

94
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,449
Maintaining money is.

95
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,569
If it makes money, I will run it.

96
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,560
Understand?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,849
The industry's most dignified magazine has fallen.

98
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:30,850
Nothing will change by grumbling.

99
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,410
Editor Yeo, make your dobira one page. Put it in there. 
  (T/N: dobira is a title page)

100
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,400
It's not my article!

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,570
Tell Editor Nam to do it.

102
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,230
Are you crazy?

103
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,739
My article is a special about Korea's architectural legend, the late Lee Dong Wook.

104
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:44,990
If it becomes the page facing the athlete's foot ad, the bereaved family will be so angry.

105
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,609
And what about my luxury interior article?

106
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:48,679
It's okay to be the page facing the ad?

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,640
Do you really want to know?

108
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,090
Both of you, shut up!

109
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,410
Enough.

110
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,799
Help me out here. Come on.

111
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,229
Cut yours this time, Editor Yeo.

112
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,899
Next time this happens, I'll cut his twice. Okay?

113
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,420
Darn it!

114
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,390
This is insane.

115
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,750
I'm so stressed!

116
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,249
To blow off steam, let's get sweet coffee.

117
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,250
You're buying?

118
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,080
Me?

119
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Are you crazy?

120
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,259
Editor Na, you buy.

121
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,200
- Me? 
 - Yes.

122
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,150
You don't have to pay ₩5 mil. ($5,000) for the armchair.

123
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,209
Don't feign ignorance now.

124
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,649
No way.

125
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,600
She might be hungry, but she saved ₩5 mil.

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,679
You're buying, right?

127
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:47,559
You took pity on her yesterday, but what use was that?

128
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,000
You're sucking her dry.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,930
Sucking her dry?

130
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,870
She saved ₩5 mil. She can buy a cup of coffee.

131
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,860
Right? Editor Na?

132
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,110
So? What do you say?

133
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,360
- You're buying, right? 
 - You're buying, right?

134
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,241
- You're buying? 
 - You're buying?

135
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,750
You're buying?

136
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,781
All right.

137
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,680
- She's buying! 
 - She's buying!

138
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,050
She's buying!

139
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,000
 It'll cost about ₩20,000 ($20).

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,720
 I swore not to be indebted to tomorrow's me,

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,110
 but I can't say no.

142
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,699
 Hey, tomorrow's me.

143
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,910
 I'm sorry, but your ₩10,000 ($10) is mine.

144
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,309
- Editor Na Zero Won? 
 - Yes.

145
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:31,399
Thanks to you using company funds, she doesn't have to spend ₩5 mil.

146
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,760
So I told her to buy us coffee.

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,840
I did well, right?

148
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,740
If you decide on what to drink, text Mi Ra, please.

149
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,040
 This is a ₩10,000 calendar I made.

150
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,600
 Project Spend ₩10,000 a Day.

151
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,630
 Until the day I become a home owner,

152
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:07,060
 today's me will never be indebted to tomorrow's me.

153
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,759
Should I not take out the whipped cream?

154
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,290
Stop going back and forth.

155
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,579
Who's going back and forth? I only go forth.

156
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,379
I want a slice of cake, too. The mushy one.

157
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,310
- Tiramisu. 
 - Okay.

158
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,859
What will you have?

159
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,209
I... I don't want coffee today.

160
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,340
Don't buy mine.

161
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,480
Then your credit card, please.

162
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,310
Stop.

163
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,710
Do you want coffee? I'm buying.

164
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,930
What?

165
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,329
Why?

166
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,289
It can boost all of your work efficiency.

167
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,219
Those being treated work better because they're in a good mood.

168
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:05,359
The ones buying won't because they'll be in a bad mood.

169
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,850
As the CEO of this company,

170
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,500
I can't have even one person be less efficient.

171
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,219
Here, take it.

172
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,380
Yes, sir.

173
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,320
Thank you.

174
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,380
Unbelievable.

175
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,629
Is this for real?

176
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,949
The CEO is buying coffee.

177
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:26,909
It's the first time in the three months he's been here.

178
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,089
Indeed.

179
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,789
He's all about money. The athlete's foot ad says it all.

180
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:32,219
Yet he's buying coffee?

181
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,639
Even when he paid for the armchair?

182
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,789
Isn't it strange?

183
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:39,040
As long as we get coffee, who cares?

184
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,000
You got lucky.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,299
You've saved money again.

186
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,990
I know.

187
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,210
I'll have a latte.

188
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,250
No, mocha.

189
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,490

190
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,370
I think your suggestion is better.

191
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,740
I'll use this as the main photo.

192
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,130
I told you. Good choice.

193
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,479
I was getting hungry, too.

194
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:20,389
Want to get 1+1 gimbap at the convenience store?

195
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,710
- Sure. 
 - Great.

196
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,509
Let's see if there's something new.

197
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,990
Oh, First Lady Lunch Box.

198
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,610
Look.

199
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,680
Do you want to get this instead?

200
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,510
I do.

201
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,000
But it's expensive.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,599
I've started a project to spend only ₩10,000 a day.

203
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:46,249
Only ₩10,000 for transportation and living costs.

204
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,170
I need to spend less on eating out.

205
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,990
Tuna kimchi and Jeonju bibimbap.

206
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,820
Butter soy sauce and bulgogi.

207
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,890
It's neck and neck.

208
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,680
Hey! Check this out.

209
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,770
First Lady Lunch Box is 1+1.

210
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,419
What? Really?

211
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,680
I've never seen a lunch box go for 1+1.

212
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,440
I guess it's a promotion because it's a new item.

213
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,499
Let's get this.

214
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,129
It's ₩3,000 ($3) for a lunch box each.

215
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,820
Awesome. Of course, we need to get this.

216
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,619
Save our seats outside. I'll pay the cashier.

217
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,220
All right!

219
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,680
I can't believe this is ₩3,000.

220
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,050
I'm tacky, right?

221
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,840
But still, every little bit helps.

222
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,980
And one day I'll have money to buy a house.

223
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,839
But since you're so talented, I bet the CEO pays you a lot.

224
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,779
You'll probably earn enough to buy a house soon.

225
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,269
Well, I'm going to work here only for a few months.

226
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,301
Why?

227
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:11,940
My passion right now is art photography.

228
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,530
I want to study fine art properly.

229
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,349
"Why take art photos that don't make money?"

230
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:24,160
"Poor backward is?" You were going to say that, right?

231
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,460
No.

232
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,030
If you say the word "specialty" backward?

233
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,780
Admirable?

234
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,149
That you have a dream you want to achieve,

235
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:38,400
and have the courage to give up money because of that dream is admirable.

236
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,709
Your drive to challenge yourself is fantastic.

237
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,310
Honestly, I'm kind of envious.

238
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,750

239
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,229
Hi, Honey.

240
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,579
Come home after 10 p.m. today.

241
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,739
Again?

242
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,000
How will I kill time...?

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,620
Hello? Honey?

244
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,160
What do I do until then?

245
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,649
 Lunch box ₩3,000. Store side dishes for dinner ₩5,000.

246
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:28,909
 If I walk home, I have ₩2,000 left today.

247
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,210
 Okay. Great.

248
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,961
Wow, big news!

249
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,589
Yikes! What is it?

250
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:38,329
The pork ribs place across the street is closing.

251
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,369
It was on TV and hit the jackpot.

252
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,729
- Really? 
 - There's always a long line. Why close?

253
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:44,269
They got a lot of complaints from neighbors.

254
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:45,659
They're moving to Jejudo Island.

255
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,790
Today's the last day.

256
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,890
I never went, thinking I'll go once the hype died down.

257
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,570
This won't do.

258
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,709
Let's all go there today.

259
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,600
I can't.

260
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,409
I have dinner plans with my cutie pie...

261
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,439
It's canceled. She has a make-up class.

262
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,650
Okay. Let's go.

263
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,530
Great!

264
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,349
You're buying, right?

265
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:07,820
Me?

266
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,300
You must be mad.

267
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,309
Editor Na, you buy.

268
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,750
- Me? 
 - You saved money on the armchair and coffee.

269
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,940
You should buy at a time like this.

270
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,109
What do you think? You all agree, right?

271
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:27,979
Yes. You've had good luck, so why not be generous?

272
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:31,130
What do you say? You're buying, right?

273
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,240
You're buying, right?

274
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,710
Oh, well. Sure.

275
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,489
 Gangnam, Yeouido. Gwanghwamun, etc. A location with easy access to capital business districts.

276
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:16,330
 An apartment close to the workplace.

277
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,569
 A low building, only five stories high.

278
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,229
 Low floor area ratio

279
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:26,880
 will allow it to become a high-rise apartment when it's reconstructed.

280
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,120
 Okay. Pass.

281
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,269
Secretary Hwang.

282
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,239
When Geumma Apartments

283
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,700
comes on the market, buy it immediately.

284
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,920
I told you not to look at the camera.

285
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,289
You asked for candid photos of you working.

286
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:00,900
I feel awkward taking photos.

287
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,120
Don't be self-conscious and look over there.

288
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,200
It's six people, so it'll cost at least ₩100,000 ($100).

289
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,400
Not be indebted to tomorrow's me? BS...

290
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,530
I'll be indebted to ten days of me.

291
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,860
It can't be helped.

292
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,149
Since I'm buying, I'll go all out.

293
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:30,529
I'll buy.

294
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,039
 Didn't you decide to use a ₩10,000 calendar so you could save up to buy a house?

295
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,259
Then what should I do?

296
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,159
It looks like I can't get out of it.

297
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,359
 Did they buy you coffee?

298
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,939
 Did they pay for the armchair?

299
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,289
No, but...

300
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,309
 So why buy them drinks?

301
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:48,879
 Stop being a pushover.

302
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,489
 Find a way to get out of it.

303
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,720
Okay. I'll find a way no matter what.

304
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,930
My purse.

305
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,719
Where's my purse?

306
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,690
Oh, no. Look again.

307
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,560
It's not here.

308
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,759
I think I lost it when I went out for lunch.

309
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,869
What should I do? I don't think I can buy drinks tonight.

310
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,769
Oh, well. It can't be helped.

311
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,139
It's okay. I'll buy.

312
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,449
- Really? 
 - Sure! Just wire the money to me.

313
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,259
As soon as I've paid.

314
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:28,589
The bank security card was in my purse, so I don't think I can.

315
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,570
Nonsense.

316
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,890
There are other ways to transfer money.

317
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,109
Naver pay, Talks, Kakao pay...

318
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,969
Choose one and wire the money.

319
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,799
I didn't know you were so old-fashioned.

320
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,890
You have to enjoy the advances in technology.

321
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,960
Yes, sir.

322
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,720
 That could happen, too.

323
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,199
Oh. The advances in technology are dragging me down.

324
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,290
Is there another way?

325
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,300
Ouch, my stomach.

326
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,430
My stomach hurts.

327
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,019
Young Won, are you all right?

328
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,970
What's wrong with you?

329
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:04,529
- I think I have terrible indigestion. 
 - Oh, no!

330
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm sorry, but I think I have to go to the hospital.

331
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,170
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

332
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,570
My stomach!

333
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,689
119! 119!

334
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,150
Call 119! His eyes rolled back!

335
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,289
See, Editor Na?

336
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,509
That's what I call acting that will fool people.

337
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,310
What you did was child's play!

338
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,699
 What if that happens?

339
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:34,609
My bad acting is dragging me down.

340
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,630
What should I do?

341
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,409
 As soon as I decided to spend ₩10,000 a day,

342
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:47,190
 I'm facing a huge challenge.

343
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,819
 I've been pressured into buying drinks for my coworkers unexpectedly.

344
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:56,119
 How can I get out of this?

345
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,199
 - Crying...  
 - Here's your coffee.

346
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,000
Thanks.

347
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,859
Let's see the photos you took.

348
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,760
Okay.

349
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,010
Here.

350
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,909
You're really good.

351
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:12,869
I know.

352
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:14,529
I've been thinking...

353
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,559
I've looked around and realized you're the best.

354
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,159
So you must keep on working at Monthly Magazine Home for me.

355
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,319
No way.

356
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,039
I told you I'm going to New York. I'm going to study fine art there.

357
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,350
Your dream was to take advertisement photos.

358
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,220
Why fine art, all of a sudden?

359
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,229
Why take art photos that don't make money?

360
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:39,449
Taking art photos that don't make money is my new dream.

361
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:42,059
And there's someone who's rooting for me.

362
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,529
Did you get a girlfriend?

363
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:46,070
What? No.

364
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,819
You should find a girlfriend.

365
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,569
Stop thinking only about making money.

366
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:53,140
Money is my girlfriend. Happy?

367
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,650
Wrap it up!

368
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,929
Calmly!

369
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:10,370
Everybody! Let's go eat pork ribs!

370
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,950
Let's get ready to leave.

371
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,560
Stop!

372
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,660
Oh! Sir!

373
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,139
You said you were going home straight from the site.

374
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,199
I was going to, but I remembered something.

375
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,609
- Editor Na Zero Won, stay. 
 - Sir?

376
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:31,210
Work overtime. There's research you need to do for the next article.

377
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,140
Yes, sir.

378
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,589
Wait. Sir. Stop, stop.

379
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:38,769
Editor Na is buying drinks today.

380
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,719
Unfortunately, the restaurant closes after today.

381
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,039
Can she do the research tomorrow?

382
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,549
No. She must do it today.

383
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,099
Oh, but sir...

384
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,799
Oh! There's something else to search for.

385
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,759
Sir?

386
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,229
A new chief editor.

387
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,940
I don't need a chief editor that postpones work.

388
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,869
Work hard overtime.

389
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,350
I will.

390
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,300

391
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,910

392
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,660
 What?

393
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:26,700
 What's with the face?

394
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,650
What is all this?

395
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,430
Why are you all here?

396
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,089
Mi Ra and I are here to help Young Won.

397
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,539
We're also here to help Editor Na.

398
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,489
Since we are one.

399
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,939
I'm sure the two of you want her to finish up quickly so she can buy drinks.

400
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,959
- No, we don't. 
 - No, we don't.

401
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:58,229
Anyway, with all of us helping out,

402
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:04,529
we found all the material that you wanted her to find.

403
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,669
Here! Ten!

404
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,850
We did well, right?

405
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,189
I'm almost at the front of the line. Come quickly.

406
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:28,350
They'll close when there's no more meat left.

407
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,569
We'll be going now.

408
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,699
Everyone move!

409
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,169
Move! Move!

410
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,980
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

411
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,100
See you tomorrow.

412
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,060
Hurry.

413
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,320
Stop!

414
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,989
- There's one more thing you must find. 
 - What?

415
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,309
- One more? 
 - Yes.

416
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,389
It's something I really need but forgot.

417
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,390
What if we came early tomorrow and...

418
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,190
No, of course not.

419
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,940
What is it? What's the material you need?

420
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,349
Find the magazine with a photo of this house.

421
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:32,139
Is this a house? Isn't it a dog?

422
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:34,589
How is this a dog? It's definitely a house.

423
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:38,110
I clearly remember seeing it. Find it right now.

424
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,079
Yes, sir.

425
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,499
Everyone move!

426
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,890
Move! Move!

427
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,670
 Woof, woof!

428
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,360
It's not here. Let's go to the back.

429
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,339
Shit, It's not here.

430
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:20,090
Where's the dog-like (crappy) house?

431
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,619
The CEO said he saw it.

432
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,880
Is this really necessary?

433
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,179
We only have one ladder.

434
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:27,559
They'll close when there's no more meat left.

435
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,099
I'm going to find it.

436
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,249
I'm going to find it no matter what.

437
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,059
 There's no way you'll find out.

438
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,729
  Where will you find a dog-like...

439
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:35,969
I found it! I found it!

440
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:38,180
Sir!

441
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,199
I found it!

442
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:42,189
- What? Did you find it? 
 - I found it! I found it!

443
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,729
Let me down. Hurry!

444
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:45,410
Don't move.

445
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,569
Let me down. Wait.

446
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,890
Wait, wait!

447
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,889
Are you okay?

448
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,540
Sir?

449
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,180
Oh, yes.

450
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:36,309
If you're okay, get out quickly.

451
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,469
Are you all right?

452
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:41,260
- Are you okay? Are you hurt? 
 - Yes, of course.

453
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,859
Careful, careful, careful.

454
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,659
I'm okay, so straighten the bookshelves first.

455
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:49,319
I don't know how long I can hold on.

456
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,929
You can just come out.

457
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,570
Yes. The angle...

458
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,959
Don't step on me.

459
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,590
Ouch, my leg, my leg.

460
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,759
I apologize.

461
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,190
This whole mess is my fault.

462
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,949
In any case, we can go since we found it, right?

463
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,419
Let's go.

464
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,699
Before they're out of meat.

465
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:37,270
Stop!

466
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,439
How much will you drink if you go right now?

467
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,789
I'm not sure.

468
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,219
I'm hungry.

469
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,489
I feel like drinking a lot today.

470
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:50,769
Don't you remember what I said last time?

471
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:52,899
If you drink a lot, your work will suffer the next day.

472
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:54,729
Well, then... We'll drink a little.

473
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:56,859
How can I believe that?

474
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,859
From now on, get-togethers without me are forbidden.

475
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,229
What?

476
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,919
And I won't be going today, so no get-together tonight.

477
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,389
- Why? 
 - Why?

478
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:13,370
Today's get-together is forbidden.

479
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,080
Forbidden!

480
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,269
I'm getting it.

481
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,889
What? What are you getting?

482
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,839
I'm getting a hunch.

483
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,980
A hunch that the CEO likes you.

484
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,840
What?

485
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:33,789
I'm sure he likes you.

486
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,719
My hunch is 100% right.

487
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,360
What nonsense is that?

488
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,409
It's not nonsense!

489
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,959
He hates wasting money the most.

490
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,129
But he pays for the armchair and coffee.

491
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:46,279
He even forbids a get-together to stop you from spending.

492
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,210
Come on...

493
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:50,649
His way of showing affection is through money.

494
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,699
Since he likes you, he won't let you spend money.

495
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,289
What do you mean?

496
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:57,159
The armchair is because of Labor Laws.

497
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,249
The coffee is for work efficiency.

498
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:01,859
The get-together is to ensure good work performance.

499
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,699
Then what about saving you in the archive?

500
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,579
How will you explain that?

501
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:09,089
He's not one to sacrifice himself.

502
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:14,269
That's... If I get hurt, there will be nobody to write his article.

503
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,789
If you're going to say weird things, just go.

504
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:20,809
Oh, come on.

505
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:23,399
I'll stop now, okay? Happy?

506
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,120
Okay.

507
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,990

508
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,349
It's so dirty here.

509
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,889
Clean up, will you?

510
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,079
Am I your mother? Huh?

511
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,649
My mom? You nag more than my mom does.

512
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:43,549
If you're finished with work, go home.

513
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,069
My nagging is for your well-being.

514
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:47,259
No nagging is pleasant to hear.

515
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,189
There is nagging that's pleasant to hear.

516
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:51,579
"Do you want to be poor? No."

517
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:54,360
- What? 
 - Never mind.

518
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,040
What?

519
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,050
What is it?

520
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,609
It's certainly humiliating content. It's funny.

521
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:09,070
I'm not looking at it because it was funny.

522
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,829
I'm looking at it because she's pretty.

523
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,450
What? This?

524
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,580
Don't go overboard.

525
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,900
Your mom must go home now.

526
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,350
- Bye. 
 - Okay, Son.

527
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,409
No, no, no.

528
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,880
I shouldn't waste anything.

529
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,310
The bathroom is so clean. What a nice place!

530
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,389
Right!

531
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,249
CEO Yoo let you lease this place without a security deposit.

532
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:00,189
Are you still going to deny it?

533
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,489
It was vacant for a long time, so he wanted to get rent.

534
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,379
Come on.

535
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,550
All right.

536
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,720
By the way, what's that?

537
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,290
It's a ₩10,000 calendar.

538
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,880
I made that to spend only ₩10,000 a day.

539
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,319
Right.

540
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,119
I guess my hunch has gone bad.

541
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:29,380
He's a guy who would marry for money.

542
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,559
You're not his type.

543
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,819
Do you have to do something as tacky as that?

544
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:38,889
Doing tacky things will help me save up and get me a huge house.

545
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:43,939
Actually, nowadays, I'm trying to save up money to buy a house.

546
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:46,850
What? Buy a house?

547
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,589
I told you.

548
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,709
The population is decreasing. Housing will be plenty.

549
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:55,050
- What use is... 
 - There is use.

550
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,519
I want to own a home

551
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,840
so that I don't have to pay rent.

552
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,129
Please keep this a secret.

553
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,339
What?

554
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:07,529
About CEO Yoo not taking a security deposit,

555
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:10,079
and how I'm gathering seed money.

556
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,469
I don't want pity from others.

557
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:16,219
Okay. Then I'll root for you.

558
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:19,490
I'll help you save up.

559
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,590
I'll help you plenty.

560
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,520
This is so soft! Plenty!

561
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,090
Sir. Your things have been moved.

562
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,479
Let me know if you need anything else.

563
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,829
I won't be needing anything.

564
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:53,019
How about getting some basic furniture?

565
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:56,180
It looks uncomfortable living like that.

566
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,419
You have to be uncomfortable to earn money.

567
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,860
No need to waste money on a place that will be sold soon.

568
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,090
 I decided to spend ₩10,000 a day starting today.

569
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,330
 I succeeded thanks to my boss.

570
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,530
 He didn't intend it, but he paid for the coffee I was supposed to buy,

571
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:20,520
 and helped me get out of buying drinks for my coworkers.

572
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,630
 Thank you so much!

573
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,780
 He seems like a really nice guy.

574
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,210
♫  I breathe in your scent  ♫

575
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,880
♫  And I don't dare to blink  ♫

576
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,050
♫  If we could always be like  ♫

577
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:44,509
 Heartless brute who only knows money. Ogre. Rude jerk.

578
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,829
 That's what I thought he was.

579
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:49,029
 but I was mistaken.

580
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,999
 I think he's a nice guy, too.

581
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:55,379
 Thank you for your comment, Dragon.

582
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,179
 I feel so supported.

583
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,390
 I'll always root for you. Fighting!

584
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,410
♫  And I still feel the same  ♫

585
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,720
♫  You and I, we write the  ♫

586
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,020
♫  Story of us  ♫

587
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,500
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

588
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,610
♫  Stay with me until the day I die  ♫

589
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,580
♫  Write the story of us  ♫

590
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,970
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

591
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,080
♫  Stay with me until the day I die  ♫

592
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,490
♫  Write the story of us  ♫

593
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,960

594
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,110
 I will return the pain you caused me! You'll die by my hands, Yoo Ja Sung!

595
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,859
 It's good.

596
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,830
It's good. Anything else?

597
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,029
Well, it's not something I can write,

598
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:02,859
but I prepared this because I thought it would be good.

599
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:05,819
- What is it? 
 - She's a pro.

600
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:07,730
Thank you.

601
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,649
What? Houses in Ikseon-dong?

602
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,800
Yes, like houses in Ikseon-dong,

603
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,040
there are old houses that embody the history of modern dwellings.

604
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,249
What if we could preserve them instead of reconstructing them?

605
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:22,059
- Kill it. Next. 
 - What?

606
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:24,960
I'm killing it. I'm killing the story.

607
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,670
Did you not hear me?

608
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,611
- Are you an expert on reconstruction? Well? 
 - No.

609
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:35,619
We need to demolish old houses quickly and reconstruct them.

610
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:38,380
Preserve, my foot. Sheesh...

611
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,329
This is so frustrating!

612
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:42,289
Let's take ten minutes.

613
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:45,960
Your nonsense is so annoying.

614
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,851
- Don't talk about reconstruction in front of him. 
 - Why not?

615
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:58,029
He lives in a run-down apartment in Gangbuk. He's been waiting for reconstruction for ten years.

616
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:02,229
What's worse, his wife wanted to move to Gangnam a few years ago for their kids' education.

617
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:05,219
But he said no, saying they'll hit the jackpot with reconstruction.

618
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:07,650
See how it turned out? House prices soared in Gangnam.

619
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,239
So now he walks on ice around his wife.

620
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,340
She treats him with scorn.

621
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,839
By the way, why does Chief Editor often tiptoe around?

622
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,529
That?

623
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:27,659
 We were so curious that we asked him one time.

624
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:30,090
 - Wow. 
 - Slow down.

625
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,930
 You know that my kids are a junior and senior in high school, right?

626
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,039
 With the SATs around the corner, my wife is on edge.

627
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,609
 She said if she hears my footsteps, she'll rip my legs out.

628
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:45,449
 What can I do?

629
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:47,589
 So tiptoeing became a habit.

630
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:50,179
 Still... Tiptoeing is too much.

631
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:53,870
 No, it's not. She's the queen.

632
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,019
 You know I walk on eggshells around her.

633
00:36:57,019 --> 00:37:02,030
 I'm going to calmly go smoke a cigarette.

634
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,439
 I feel so sorry for him. Tiptoeing, my foot.

635
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,179
 I know.

636
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:13,929
 Even my aunt's pet dog walks on all fours.

637
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:16,710
 - His life is worse than a dog's. 
 - He should've moved.

638
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,409
 Why wait for a reconstruction that won't happen?

639
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,290
 What did you say?

640
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,050
 Reconstruction that won't happen?

641
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,469
 It sounds like you don't want the reconstruction to happen.

642
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:32,351
 - No, that's not it... 
 - Quiet!

643
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:36,030
 Do you know my agony?

644
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,371
 - You bastards. 
 - Are you okay...?

645
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:45,240
 We shouldn't have said such a rash thing at that time.

646
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,169
 I e-mailed the article to you.

647
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:50,989
 Will you give me your comments tomorrow?

648
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:52,519
 - I'm heading out... 
 - No.

649
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,520
 You can go after I confirm it.

650
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,580
 Oh, okay.

651
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,399
 But you know,

652
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:01,229
 you'll have to wait for a long time.

653
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:02,659
 What?

654
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:04,760
 For how long?

655
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,339
 Until my apartment goes under reconstruction.

656
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,310
 - What...? 
 - I'm waiting for reconstruction that won't happen?

657
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,729
 You can wait for my confirmation that I won't give!

658
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:17,300
 Feel how much agony I am in!

659
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,789
 Oh, no.

660
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:23,449
 Oh, yes.

661
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:25,869
 Okay. Call me when the brand launches.

662
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,209
 Okay.

663
00:38:27,209 --> 00:38:30,259
 Chief Editor. I'm Sang Soon.

664
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:32,949
 I'm out of toilet paper. Can you give me some?

665
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:34,599
 Oh, really?

666
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,139
 Okay.

667
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:40,160
 But you know, you'll have to wait for a long time.

668
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,639
 Why?

669
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,129
 Is there no toilet paper in the next booth?

670
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:46,329
 Then how long...

671
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:48,159
 Until my apartment goes under reconstruction.

672
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,039
 Yikes!

673
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:52,129
 I'm waiting for reconstruction that won't happen?

674
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,669
 Then you wait for toilet paper that won't come.

675
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:58,939
 Feel how much agony I am in!

676
00:38:58,939 --> 00:39:00,709
 Chief Editor! Chief Editor!

677
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:04,470
- He really did that? 
 - Yes. He was such a stinker.

678
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,119
He acted like a huge jerk.

679
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,109
Don't ever talk about reconstruction or tiptoeing in front of him.

680
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:12,660
Okay.

681
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:14,639
Oh, dear.

682
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,350
A home is an issue for everyone.

683
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,900
Come in.

684
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,280
- Are you free? 
 - What brings you here?

685
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,410
I want to set up a schedule for a shoot before I go to a pre-interview.

686
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,349
I'm scouting sites with Editor Nam tomorrow.

687
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:34,080
- So I'll be free the day after tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

688
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,899
What kind of a house will you be covering?

689
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:38,989
It's a house made by a famous architect.

690
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:43,109
The CEO invested in the townhouse she newly built.

691
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:47,179
An article that makes you want to buy that house...

692
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:50,980
An article that makes money. Write that.

693
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,949
Wow. You sound just like him.

694
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:55,979
I was nagged by him more than you were.

695
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,049
Yeah.

696
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:00,709
We're so in synch when we badmouth the CEO.

697
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:06,749
Okay. Let's badmouth the CEO over beer and snacks at the convenience store.

698
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:09,019
You're thinking about spending money again?

699
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:12,419
- If you say "poor" backward? 
 - "Family in turmoil"?

700
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,149
Okay.

701
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,519
We can do this.

702
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,460
Fighting!

703
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:19,160
I'm going now.

704
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,650
- See you at the site. 
 - Okay.

705
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,309
"Do you want to be poor? No."

706
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:33,040
- Huh? 
 - You said there is nagging that's pleasant to hear.

707
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,889
Was it Editor Na?

708
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,919
Hey. Your family is stinking rich. Why listen to that?

709
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,880
Hey.

710
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:41,659
Don't ever say that in front of Editor Na.

711
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,769
Wow. Wait.

712
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:46,439
Do you like Editor Na?

713
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,189
That's why you said she looked pretty yesterday while looking at that ridiculous photo?

714
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:52,680
Don't ever say that either. Got it?

715
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,830
Don't.

716
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,879
I can see what's happening.

717
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,590
He has a crush.

718
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,189
This article has a huge investment at stake.

719
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,149
Stay sharp, and cover the story well.

720
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:14,519
Don't worry.

721
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,149
I've been studying real estate very hard.

722
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:20,450
That's a given.

723
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,140
Wait.

724
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,039
Floor area ratio, building-to-land ratio, station district, security right.

725
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,540
Appraised value of land, standard market price, current price base.

726
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,209
Hello.

727
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:44,140
Welcome. Come on in.

728
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,030

729
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,160

730
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,420
This is my husband's rec room.

731
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,880
Awesome.

732
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,799
It's a natural wine cellar.

733
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:19,890
It's my husband's favorite space.

734
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,939
I don't know if you noticed, but I made this house for my husband.

735
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:30,919
That's so romantic.

736
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:35,169
No doubt you love your husband so much.

737
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:39,219
Of course. And he loves me a lot, too.

738
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,630
I'm ten years older but he takes good care of me.

739
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,249
He's here.

740
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,560
- Just a second. 
 - Sure.

741
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,490
What she just said...

742
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,129
Don't write it. Write a story that makes money.

743
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:58,060
I got it.

744
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,649
Say hello, Honey.

745
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:11,579
This is the CEO of Monthly Magazine Home.

746
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:13,679
Hello, I'm Yoo Ja Sung.

747
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,969
Nice to meet you.

748
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,310
This is the editor.

749
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,390
Hello. Nice to meet you.

750
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,439
What's wrong?

751
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,360
Huh? Oh, nothing.

752
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,050
- Nice to meet you, too. 
 - Sure.

753
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,349
What about Min Joon? Is he okay?

754
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,559
Yes.

755
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,619
We have a five-year-old son.

756
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,309
Our neighbors are watching him so we can focus on the interview.

757
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:44,150
I see.

758
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,800
That bastard.

759
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,000

760
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,230
 Come on!

761
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:23,220
 Hey! I told you not to pee there!

762
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,679
 I've repeatedly told you not to come. Why do you keep coming?

763
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:27,299
 I don't have enough time to even study as it is.

764
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:30,389
 So you should eat better.

765
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,729
 Here. I grilled pork belly...

766
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:34,089
 Let's break up.

767
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,159
 What?

768
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,169
 Let's break up.

769
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,669
 What's with you all of a sudden?

770
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,279
 I'm sick of you.

771
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,549
 I'm sick of your cheap clothes and your cheap bag. I hate everything about you.

772
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:47,649
 What?

773
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:48,919
 I hate everything about you!

774
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,949
 But you know what I hate the most?

775
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:53,599
 That semi-basement stench coming from you.

776
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,539
 I hate that the most.

777
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,329
 Your smell crosses the line.

778
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:58,919
 What?

779
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,900
 You bastard...

780
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,590
 Young Won...

781
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,039
 Noona.

782
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,289
 Let's not be pathetic.

783
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:13,949
 Let me go, okay?

784
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,110
 Let's end this. Please.

785
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,440

786
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,700
Long time no see.

787
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,459
Thanks for pretending not to know me. I'll buy you a meal.

788
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,589
What? A meal?

789
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,279
Are you crazy?

790
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,240
Do you think I'll eat with you?

791
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,729
Pay me back with cash.

792
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:59,599
I bought you meals, drinks, and clothes.

793
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,479
Remember?

794
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:02,129
Yes, but what can I do?

795
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,690
I receive an allowance from my wife...

796
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,040
Pathetic loser.

797
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:14,219
You're still sponging off of people.

798
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:17,889
Sponging off? That's harsh.

799
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:21,079
Let's not cross the line.

800
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,959
Line?

801
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:27,450
Line? You crossed the line first!

802
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,519
What?

803
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,239
We broke up five years ago.

804
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:32,219
And your son is five years old?

805
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:34,649
That means you two-timed me

806
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:36,189
and knocked her up! Does your wife know?

807
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,150
Be quiet!

808
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:38,429
If she finds out, I'm screwed!

809
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,770
Get your hands off me!

810
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,100
Come on.

811
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,539
Noona, can you please overlook this?

812
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,769
Noona...

813
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:54,370
You always called me that when you needed something.

814
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:01,769
I mean, falling out of love isn't a crime!

815
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,600
Unbelievable.

816
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,749
I was going to overlook it, but I can't.

817
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,990
You're a grade-A jerk. I feel sorry for your wife.

818
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,719
Where are you, Honey?

819
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,809
- Wait, wait. 
 - What? Hey, hey.

820
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,639
- Wait. 
 - Are you insane?

821
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,259
Wait.

822
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,380
Sorry, sorry.

823
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,030
What the...

824
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:57,090
That bastard.

825
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,790
I'm trapped?

826
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,050

827
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,280
Hello!

828
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,890
I've been locked in!

829
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,439
Here. Please don't refuse and take it with you.

830
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,379
No, thank you.

831
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,090
Accepting gifts from my sources is forbidden.

832
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:36,349
Think of us as friends, not a source.

833
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:38,290
Please.

834
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:42,810
By the way, where's the editor?

835
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,419
Oh, I met her in the wine cellar.

836
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:48,509
She said she was leaving on urgent matters.

837
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,239
She went to the basement parking lot.

838
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,019
She told me to ask CEO Yoo to do the interview.

839
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:54,650
Pardon?

840
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,390
Oh, come on!

841
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,930
Come on, phone!

842
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,530
Come on. We're an IT powerhouse!

843
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,350
It never works when I need it to.

844
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,000
What? No!

845
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,199
Why is this my life?

846
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,920
That bastard. I'm going to kill him!

847
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,970

848
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,099
 Your call cannot be connected. Please leave a message...

849
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,980
How can she leave without saying anything?

850
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,050
What are you doing here?

851
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,379
Oh, I...

852
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,469
I was putting this back.

853
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,229
I don't think I can take it.

854
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,399
You're so uptight.

855
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,469
I'll put that back. You head on upstairs.

856
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,090
Okay.

857
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,549
You bastard!

858
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,489
I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

859
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,399
Stop! Stop! Editor Na Zero Won!

860
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,829
Yeah, I'm Na Zero Won.

861
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,080
What's it to you?

862
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,090
Na Zero Won?

863
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,760
What?

864
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,120
Sir!

865
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,210
What are you doing here?

866
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:17,080
Honey. What are you doing here?

867
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,390
What? Oh, nothing.

868
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,680
Let's go, let's go.

869
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,349
 Floor area ratio, building-to-land ratio, station district, security right.

870
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:39,150
 Appraised value of land, standard market price, current price base.

871
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,309
Are you okay?

872
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:51,270
No. I'm not okay at all.

873
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,180
So I'm planning on exposing everything so that I'll be okay.

874
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,760
Editor Na.

875
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,539
Honey.

876
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,870
You said she left on urgent matters.

877
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,589
Well...

878
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:21,080
What happened was...

879
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,230
Daddy!

880
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,470
They're joined at the hip.

881
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:30,049
He called crying for his daddy.

882
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:32,580
So we brought him home.

883
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:38,160
Sorry. What were you about to say?

884
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,010
Well... Let's go inside and...

885
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,070
I'm sorry.

886
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:53,370
I left without a word during an interview.

887
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,470
Noona!

888
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,380
Noona!

889
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,610
I'm really sorry.

890
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:12,990
I was going to get you out as soon as my wife left.

891
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,700
You always have a plan.

892
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,819
I have a plan, too.

893
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,220
What?

894
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,439
This wasn't planned.

895
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,050
It's because I'm so angry.

896
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,360
I'm sorry for leaving during an interview.

897
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,750
It wasn't your fault. You don't have to apologize.

898
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,580
Why didn't you say anything to them?

899
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:56,840
I wanted to expose everything,

900
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,100
but his wife and child are not at fault.

901
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,369
He's a stinking bastard to me,

902
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:08,700
but to them, he's the best husband and dad.

903
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:14,000
So I'm going to brush it off as bad luck.

904
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,699
But I'll write the article as planned.

905
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,820
Forget it. I'm not proceeding with this.

906
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,419
If it's because of me...

907
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,989
No.

908
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,819
The house didn't meet my expectations.

909
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:32,750
It's a waste of paper to put it in our magazine.

910
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,350
I see.

911
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,290

912
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,189
 Again?

913
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,089
How many times is this already?

914
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:04,390
I can't climb up fifteen flights of stairs. Darn it!

915
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,500
It looks like my life...

916
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,340
Scraps.

917
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,840
It's all just scraps.

918
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,130
Seriously.

919
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,420
I barely get by with ₩10,000 a day

920
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:45,760
while that parasitic bastard lives in a mansion.

921
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,330
♫  It’s especially quiet in my room today  ♫

922
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,230
He married well.

923
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,150
So well.

924
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,560
♫  Feels like tomorrow will be better  ♫

925
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,040
That's why he dumped me, I'm sure.

926
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,040
He's living his dream as he wished.

927
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:09,620
♫  It was a day filled with easy sighs  ♫

928
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,250
 There are times my home looks so shabby.

929
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,680
♫  When I try to act like I’m OK and smile  ♫

930
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,719
 I'm sorry. I'll repent for the rest of my life.

931
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,580
 Have a good life, Noona.

932
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,110
♫  Feels like tomorrow will be better  ♫

933
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:30,200
 I don't know about others,

934
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,660
 but I wanted my life to be better than his.

935
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,070
 The current score? I lost big time.

936
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:42,180
♫  In a small corner of my heart  ♫

937
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,619
 I think that's what a home is.

938
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,400
 It measures my assets.

939
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,560
♫  For a tomorrow that’ll be different from today  ♫

940
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,639
 You can carry a designer wallet with no money in it.

941
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,240
 But you can't buy a nice house with no money.

942
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,700
♫  Thank you for getting through this lonely day  ♫

943
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:14,270
♫  Let’s let go of this day that has passed  ♫

944
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:18,170
♫  Everyone goes through this kind of day  ♫

945
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:23,480
 Your home is your status that you can't hide.

946
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,750
♫  For a tomorrow that’ll be different from today  ♫

947
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,050
♫  Thank you for getting through this lonely day  ♫

948
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,210
 I really need a drink right now,

949
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,290
♫  Tomorrow, we’ll be happier  ♫

950
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,290
 but I should save up to buy a house.

951
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:48,180
 I'm going to restrain myself.

952
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,350
What's wrong with you?

953
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:58,659
Why are you so happy? It's annoying.

954
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,229
I have a friend who works at a hip rooftop restaurant.

955
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,129
He sent me a coupon.

956
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,189
Free 500cc of draft beer.

957
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,859
He sent two! Totally dope!

958
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,399
Bye.

959
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,129
Hey! Sell that to me.

960
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,660
Why do you want a coupon?

961
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,059
Spend your own money.

962
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,930
No. I need those free beer coupons.

963
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,929
You're not going to go with Editor Na, are you?

964
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,039
Come on! Stop acting like you're working class.

965
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,219
It's not right.

966
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,170
I'll double it.

967
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:27,240
- Yeah, right. 
 - Triple.

968
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,239
Show them the coupon before you order.

969
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,400
I'll send it to you now.

970
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,469
Hello?

971
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,829
What brings you to call at this hour?

972
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:41,820
 Editor Na!

973
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:44,480
Want to go for a glass of beer with me?

974
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:53,699
What's the occasion? You forbade get-togethers.

975
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,740
Get-togethers without me are forbidden.

976
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,940
I'm here, so this is okay.

977
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,650
I see.

978
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:05,140
But why are you buying me a drink?

979
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,689
To increase work efficiency.

980
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,529
Increase work efficiency?

981
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:14,009
Yes. A drink could cheer you up.

982
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,759
Then you'll write my promo article better.

983
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,050
I see.

984
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,829
Thanks, anyway.

985
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:24,309
I really needed a drink.

986
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,560
Help yourself.

987
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,669
What? Back so soon?

988
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:43,639
No way. Did your crush reject you?

989
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,560
Shut up. She had a previous engagement.

990
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:50,520
I'll buy beer next time.

991
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,720
Bastard.

992
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:03,650
I'm so embarrassed that I dated him for over three years.

993
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,809
But you know what embarrasses me more?

994
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,660
How I am right now.

995
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:14,179
I wanted to live a lot better than that bastard did.

996
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,779
But I tremble at even ₩10,000

997
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,629
in the hopes that I can buy a house one day.

998
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,239
I feel so pathetic.

999
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,659
I think you're a lot cooler.

1000
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,730
Thank...

1001
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,899
What?

1002
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,639
He's a freeloader mooching off of his wife.

1003
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,869
You're doing the best you can. You're much better than him.

1004
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,329
Do you really mean that?

1005
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,650
Yes.

1006
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:46,409
You'll meet someone a million times better than him.

1007
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,360
Editor Na.

1008
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:56,309
 I'm sure CEO Yoo likes you.

1009
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,949
 My hunch is 100% right.

1010
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:01,809
 Stop! The coffee... I'll buy it.

1011
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,529
 Get-togethers without me are forbidden.

1012
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,909
 Forget it. I'm not proceeding with this.

1013
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:12,550
 His way of showing affection is through money.

1014
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,669
Drink as much as you want.

1015
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:19,990
There's no set price today like last time.

1016
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:27,330
 Are you okay?

1017
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,950
Sir,

1018
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,590
do you like me?

1019
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,459
What?

1020
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,930
Telling me that I'll meet someone that's a million times better...

1021
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:50,590
Do you mean yourself?

1022
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,130
You like me, don't you?

1023
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:01,660
I'm right. Aren't I?

1024
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:05,609
Can I... give you an answer this way?

1025
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:07,390
Sir?

1026
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,890
♫  Just listen here we are again  ♫

1027
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,460
♫  Through the fire through the rain  ♫

1028
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,880
♫  The roads we crossed they built  ♫

1029
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,410
♫  Story of us  ♫

1030
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:35,200
♫  Here we are again and I still feel the same  ♫

1031
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,850
♫  You and I, we write the story of us  ♫

1032
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:42,320
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

1033
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,160
♫  Stay with me until the die  ♫

1034
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,370
♫  Write the story of us  ♫

1035
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,770
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

1036
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:54,640
♫  Stay with me until the die  ♫

1037
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,050

1038
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,910

~ Preview ~

1039
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,980
 The forth Industrial Revolution era...

1040
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,969
 What? Someone died there?

1041
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:05,960
 Go confront him.

1042
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:07,759
 Give me a discount on the rent!

1043
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,779
 Move out.

1044
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,399
 Do you think I won't?

1045
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,789
 What? Half-deposit?

1046
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,390
 The monthly rent will be expensive.

1047
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,170
 It's ₩1 mil.

1048
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:15,349
 Does she work two jobs?

1049
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:17,109
 How can she have no worries about money?

1050
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:19,229
 When will you grow up?

1051
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,509
 I'm not going to take over my dad's business.

1052
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,489
 I thought we were partners.

1053
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,609
 You're always misunderstanding people.

1054
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:29,400
 I said that's enough!

1055
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,950
♫  I breathe in your scent  ♫

1056
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,150
♫  And I don’t dare to blink  ♫

1057
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:37,010
♫  If we could always be like this  ♫

1058
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:43,930
