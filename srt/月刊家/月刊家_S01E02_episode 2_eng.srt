1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,990

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,640

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,150

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,080

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,640

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,400

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,640

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,320

9
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,370

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,190

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,150
Homeownership plan...

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,049
 You have entered the wrong password.

13
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,400
Who is it?

14
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,990
 You have entered the wrong password.

15
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,238

16
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:32,520

17
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,770
Who is it?

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,799
 It's security.

19
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh. Just a second.

20
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,979
How did you get in here?

21
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,379
I moved in here just a moment ago.

22
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,309
Did you move in? I wasn't notified.

23
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,250
It was a sudden move.

24
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,789
Check with the landlord, CEO Yoo Ja Sung.

25
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,690
Oh, Yoo...

26
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,119
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,540
This place was empty for a long time,

28
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,620
but I got a call that sounds could be heard from here.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,669
Then lock up well. Good night.

30
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:26,930
I apologize for the trouble.

31
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,100
But where's all your...

32
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,219
 I'm Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung, CEO of Jasung Real Estate Investment Company.

33
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,819
 What's Gaeryong?

34
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,889
 It means "a dragon that's risen from a ditch."

35
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,689
 I started with nothing. Now I'm a success story.

36
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,729
 Do you think this only happens to others?

37
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,929
Yes.

38
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,228
It only happens to others.

39
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,469
Not everyone can succeed through real estate.

40
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,940
 Throw away that sense of defeat.

41
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,070
 Instead of cursing the darkness, light a candle.

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,660
 I will become your candle.

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,980
 If you use my methods and do your best,

44
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,049
 I guarantee

45
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:23,580
 you can own a house, too.

46
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,550
Really?

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,980

48
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,970
 A lower maintenance fee compared to small complexes.

49
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,189
 Thanks to active sales, liquidity is excellent here.

50
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,030
 It's the area's landmark and leading apartment.

51
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,770
 Exactly 9 minutes and 13 seconds.

52
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,009
 An apartment complex with an elementary school,

53
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,980
 also known as ACES.

54
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,690
 It's near a subway station.

55
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,619
 You can enjoy various services that are all within arm's reach.

56
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:39,570
 It meets all the requirements perfectly. Pass!

57
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,669
 Excuse me, Sir.

58
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,808
- Why don't you let me do the survey... 
 - No.

59
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,769
I only trust my eyes and feet.

60
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:54,279
I have to do the legwork and see for myself to know if it's worth investing in.

61
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,919
How many apartments are up for sale in that complex?

62
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,920
Two in the 80㎡ range and one in the 120㎡ range.

63
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,200
Then it's about ₩2 bil. ($2 mil.) in total.

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,889
I'll send the money right now. Buy them all.

65
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,420
Yes, Sir.

66
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,330

67
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,160
Stop.

68
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,239
Sir?

69
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,330
Can't you see that?

70
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,549
It's two cents more expensive here. Go over there.

71
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:30,120
Yes, Sir.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,589
I never suffer a loss in money.

73
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,120
You know that.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,909
Area for common use, lot area,

75
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,739
building area, total floor space...

76
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:54,839
Property Survey is a must...

77
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,599
What are you doing?

78
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,380
You're here!

79
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,349
You let me stay without a security deposit,

80
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,460
so I'm doing this to repay your kindness.

81
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,719
Don't go overboard.

82
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:10,859
I told you I'm collecting rent from a spare apartment.

83
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:12,929
Don't waste manpower unnecessarily.

84
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:16,600
But I want to show you my gratitude.

85
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,999
Oh, and I watched Jasung TV.

86
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,969
You took time out of your busy schedule to give

87
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:23,699
hope and dreams to homeless people like me—

88
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,509
I did that to promote my company.

89
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:27,769
No other reason.

90
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:31,179
But it's really good info that's too good for only me to know.

91
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,449
Do the others at the magazine know about it?

92
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:34,849
If they don't, I'll tell them—

93
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:36,679
They all know.

94
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:40,189
What? But you have so few subscribers.

95
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,380
It was pitiful...

96
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,459
Content ahead of its time gets acknowledged later.

97
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,940
Don't do anything useless.

98
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,400
Okay.

99
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,769
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

100
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:02,220
I'll do what you say, and become a homeowner.

101
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,240
Fighting! 
  (T/N: Used in Korean to cheer on someone and to wish good luck)

102
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Do what you want.

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,419
Now get out and get to work.

104
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,950
Editor Na Zero Won.

105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,590
Yes, Sir.

106
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,690
Hello.

107
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,629
You're here early.

108
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:25,869
Hi.

109
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,330
Here you go.

110
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,900
Oh, thanks.

111
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,240
Are you feeling okay?

112
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,409
Yes.

113
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,970
Did CEO Yoo take you home well?

114
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,709
Did he ask for gas money?

115
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:38,729
No.

116
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,349
I'll be damned. That money-loving scrooge?

117
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,520
How could he set a ₩30,000 ($30) limit per person?

118
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,689
He's a billionaire. How can he be so stingy?

119
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,900
I don't think he's that stingy.

120
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,240
What?

121
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,400
Actually...

122
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,929
I've come to rent an apartment of his.

123
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:02,669
What? The better place is his?

124
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:05,470
It's a bit complicated,

125
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,479
but he leased it to me without a security deposit.

126
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,379
What? I don't believe it!

127
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,479
He's not a person to be so generous.

128
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,250
He never suffers a loss in money.

129
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,459
He must have some other intention.

130
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,200
I don't think so.

131
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,100
Yes?

132
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,039
Yes, she is a tenant.

133
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,739
She'll be living there for a while.

134
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,780
Does she know what kind of place #707 is?

135
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,010
I told you not to talk about it.

136
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,270
Watch what you say.

137
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,849
Watch what I say?

138
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,490
I'm not making things up.

139
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,850
She would never live here if she knew.

140
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,770
Now it truly feels like my home.

141
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,590
Excuse me.

142
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,949
 To become a homeowner, you must first save up.

143
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:30,860
 The minimum amount of money to buy a house.

144
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,380
 That's called seed money.

145
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,099
But how much?

146
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,969
 It'll differ between people,

147
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:46,469
 but if you want to save money, you must learn

148
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,310
 how much you spend and stop wasting it.

149
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,819
Monthly rent ₩400,000 ($400). Mom ₩300,000 ($300).

150
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,510
Gas bill ₩8,000 ($8). Electricity ₩32,000 ($32).

151
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,560
Internet cost  ₩40,000 ($40).

152
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,820
Cellphone bill ₩89,000 ($89).

153
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,500
Just breathing for a month costs me one million won.

154
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,539
This is why I can't save up. I've never wasted any money...

155
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:26,570
 Lies!

156
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,430
You startled me!

157
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,960
 Did you say you never waste money?

158
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,890
I think I watched too many of his videos. I'm seeing things.

159
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,680
I need to go to bed.

160
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,860
 Here's your coffee.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,570

162
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,560
 Are you still going to say you don't waste money?

163
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,100
I should be allowed a cup of coffee every day.

164
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,100
 A coffee a day costs ₩4,000 ($4), for a week, that's ₩28,000 ($28).

165
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
 In a month, ₩120,000 ($120).

166
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,180
 In one year, it's ₩1,460,000 ($1,460). Can you still say that?

167
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,160
Oh, I didn't realize it was that much.

168
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,490
Still... you get energy from a cup of coffee, so—

169
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,070
 Stop!

170
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,440
 Say the word "poor" backward.

171
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,020
Poor backward?

172
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,420
"Family in turmoil"?

173
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,620
 That's right, Na Zero Won!

174
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,950
 Do you want to keep being poor without your own home?

175
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,940
No. Not at all!

176
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,670
 Are you still going to say you don't waste money?

177
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,160
 This one charges ₩1,200 ($1.20) in service fees since it's not your bank!

178
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,290
 Hurry and take your money out from your own bank!

179
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,120
But that's...

180
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,260
I have to cross the road, and it's a little far.

181
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,090
 If you say the word "poor" backward?

182
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,530
"Family in turmoil."

183
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,830
Fine, fine.

184
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,590
I'll go. I will.

185
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,470
Isn't it amazing?

186
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,410
Wow, fifty percent? That's awesome!

187
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,880
No. I don't want to buy it.

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,200
I need to save up.

189
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,510
What? At times like this, spending it freely is saving up!

190
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,960
Pardon?

191
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,160
Look at my shopping basket.

192
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,810
It would be over ₩1,000,000 ($1,000) if I paid the full retail price,

193
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,590
but it's now ₩480,000 ($480).

194
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,360
I saved more than ₩520,000 ($520).

195
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,540
At times like this, spending is saving.

196
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,990
Oh, Editor Park. What's up?

197
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,480
That's right. It's saving money.

198
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,210
 - If you say the word "poor" backward?  
  - Seriously...

199
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,320
I won't buy it!

200
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,190
Editor Na, everything going okay?

201
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,460
Yes.

202
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,030
You know that advertorials are mandatory, don't you? 
  (T/N: Advertorial: Ads in the form of editorial content)

203
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,650
It's a luxury brand armchair. The company sent the materials over.

204
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,560
Since you've been doing it for ten years, you should be able to handle it without any issues.

205
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,030
I'll do my best.

206
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,020
Okay then.

207
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,990
Wow, it's almost the price of a security deposit.

208
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,590
♫  Why is everyone so down?  ♫

209
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,770
♫  What's the problem, say something  ♫

210
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,000
♫  It’s so icy here  ♫

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,230
♫  Is this the trend these days?  ♫

212
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,100
♫  Why is everyone so boring?  ♫

213
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,680
♫  Actually, I guess I'm the same  ♫

♫  Tell me what I got to do  ♫

215
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,990
♫  Hurry and turn on the bluetooth  ♫

216
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,440
You're crazy. You've gone nuts.

217
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,160
Turn off that horrible music!

218
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,830
Why are you ruining the mood?

219
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,260
If you start the day with a lot of energy,

220
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,690
isn't it good, good, good for us?

221
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,590
Energy, my butt.

222
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,100
Sit down and work. Are you here to play?

223
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,640
I'm in a great mood, like I'm here to play.

224
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,000
Look at this.

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,880
Maybe because it's an unpopular area where I live in Kyeonggi-do,

226
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,300
but the housing lottery competition rate for where I put in my application is just 2.3:1.

227
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,230
I feel hopeful about finally getting picked!

228
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,150
Get off.

229
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,479
Stop talking nonsense.

230
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,579
Hopeful, my butt!

231
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,949
If you don't want to fail, bring me a travel destination article.

232
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,650
Yes, Sir.

233
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,919
You're flipping out again.

234
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,020
Just answer your phone!

235
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,529
I got a call.

236
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,960
Answer your phone now!

237
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,059
This is Nam Sang Soon of Monthly Magazine Home.

238
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,169
Oh! Do you want to change the interview schedule?

239
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:43,799
Oh, dear.

240
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,390
All right then.

241
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,130
I'll take this call outside.

242
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,209
Yes, yes. Oh, no, Sir. Not at all.

243
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,630
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

244
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,580
Is he applying for a housing lottery competition?

245
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,590
Not just applying.

246
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,559
It's his life's goal and hope.

247
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,079
He says if he wants to marry his cutie pie, a hotshot private academy teacher,

248
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,059
he has to at least own an apartment to feel confident. That's why he's like that.

249
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,399
Winning that housing lottery is his only hope.

250
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,399
All that his parents have is their house,

251
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,569
and he's living there flat broke.

252
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:22,939
Is he broke?

253
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,879
You have a subscription account, right?

254
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,080
Oh, not yet...

255
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,690
Would you like to open a subscription account?

256
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,479
What is that?

257
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:36,559
It qualifies you to buy an apartment at a low price.

258
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,059
There's a subscription deposit, subscription installment...

259
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:42,099
The earlier you open the account, the better.

260
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:46,099
You can deposit ₩20,000 ($20) to ₩100,000 ($100) a month.

261
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:48,400
I...

262
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,770
I can barely pay the rent, so I'm here to cancel my savings.

263
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:58,279
So you don't have it?

264
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,879
- What will you do? 
 - About what?

265
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,619
The population is dropping. House prices will drop.

266
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,179
A subscription account will become meaningless.

267
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:07,660
Right, Young Won?

268
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,670
I'm going to a storyboard meeting now.

269
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,999
I shouldn't have canceled my savings,

270
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,330
let alone open a subscription account.

271
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,510
I should've saved up when I was younger.

272
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,869
No.

273
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:30,139
I can save up starting right now and buy my own house.

274
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,810
I can do it.

275
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,780
Are you busy?

276
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,849
Let's brainstorm on the house and advertorial.

277
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,760
Come sit over here.

278
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,669
Are you sleeping here?

279
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,229
Don't you go home?

280
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:55,899
This is my home.

281
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,830
I eat, sleep and do everything here.

282
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,069
Oh? Editor Na.

283
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,540
- Will you excuse me for a bit? 
 - Sure.

284
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,790
Okay, okay. Stay calm, stay calm.

285
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,620
All right! I got it!

286
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,529
Come take a look at this.

287
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:22,829
Okay.

288
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,929
It's super sweet, right?

289
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:24,959
₩1.2 mil. ($1,200)?

290
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,329
It's a limited edition that opened at 2 o'clock.

291
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,309
It's so popular that it's almost impossible to buy.

292
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,850
There's a package for you.

293
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,538
Wow, thank you, thank you.

294
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:35,070
Gently, gently.

295
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,579
- Come here, my baby. 
 - Wait.

296
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,209
Did you buy another expensive chair?

297
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:41,179
You already bought this.

298
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,549
That's black.

299
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:44,319
This is gray.

300
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,289
Gray, my foot.

301
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,300
Put it there...

302
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,690
The moment I sit...

303
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,780
It's so comfy.

304
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,730
 Photographer Shin is in a dire situation, too...

305
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,879
Oh! Are you heading home?

306
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:17,380
Yes.

307
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,789
Are you going somewhere?

308
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,489
Yes. It's Friday.

309
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,989
I'm dragging Ja Sung out to go night camping.

310
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:25,650
Where...

311
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,170
- Wait a moment. 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

312
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,640
Yeah, Ja Sung.

313
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,170
He eats and sleeps at the studio, but he drives an expensive car...

314
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,569
What? What did you say?

315
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:42,640
Oh, that your car is cool.

316
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,109
It's really expensive, right?

317
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:50,740
Oh, since I got a down payment from the magazine, I bought it.

318
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,940
But you know...

319
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,680
Nevermind.

320
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,589
Have fun camping.

321
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:03,059
Come on. It looks like you have something to say.

322
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,350
Just say it. It's okay.

323
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,300
Well...

324
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,869
I've lived longer than you, so I'll say one thing.

325
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:14,409
You're a rising star right now.

326
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:16,480
You've gained attention and more income,

327
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,709
but at times like this, you need to save more.

328
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:21,610
What?

329
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,150
Say the word "poor" backward.

330
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,749
"Family in turmoil"?

331
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,989
Right. You can become poor in an instant.

332
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:35,889
If I had known this at your age, I wouldn't be living like this at my age.

333
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,729
I have so many regrets.

334
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:38,959
Oh, I see.

335
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,029
I've been too meddlesome.

336
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,130
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,899
But seriously, I'm concerned for you as someone more experienced in life.

338
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:47,809
I see...

339
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:50,540
Let's hang in there together!

340
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
Fighting!

341
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,360
Fighting!

342
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,150
We can do it!

343
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,980
We can do it!

344
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,279
I'm off.

345
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,980
Bye.

346
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,359
 What do you think?

347
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,380
 You said you wanted to have dinner. Why are we here?

348
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,969
Looks good.

349
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:18,839
Are you buying another house?

350
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,039
No, not me.

351
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,810
Your father.

352
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,339
- This is your house. 
 - What?

353
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:27,179
He asked me to find you a place since you don't have a place in Korea.

354
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,150
So I recommended this one.

355
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,419
Forget it.

356
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:32,049
You asked me to help for a few months at the publishing company!

357
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,889
I'm returning to New York after that to work on my own things.

358
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:34,720
I don't need a house.

359
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,159
The location is good.

360
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,889
Its price will keep rising.

361
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:40,430
Buy it as an investment.

362
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,529
Really? Then tell dad I'll buy it,

363
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,599
and give me the money. I have a house I really want to invest in.

364
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,499
You? Where? What kind of house?

365
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,269
It's a great house.

366
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,969
There are only three in this whole world.

367
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,810
It's the finest luxury camping car!

368
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,809
- Ouch, that hurts! 
 - When will you grow up?

369
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,909
It's Friday. Let's go camping.

370
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:02,950
It's Friday.

371
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,779
- Forget it. I don't have time. 
 - I want to go.

372
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,610
Stop!

373
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,619
What is it?

374
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:13,089
I just wanted to ask you...

375
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:16,629
Can I change the curtains to my own?

376
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:18,329
Do whatever you want.

377
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:19,829
Then can I drive a nail in the wall?

378
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:20,929
 That, you can't do.

379
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,380
Look here, Editor Na Zero Won.

380
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,069
Are you going to live there forever?

381
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:27,769
Or are you going to buy that apartment?

382
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:31,939
You're renting it temporarily. What are you doing?

383
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,790
I didn't buy it,

384
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,599
but I live in it.

385
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,989
Anyway, I won't drive a nail in.

386
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:42,200
Thank you for your time.

387
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,189
She's going to be a headache.

388
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,620
I regret having her as a tenant.

389
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,229
What? Is Editor Na your tenant?

390
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,169
Since when? How?

391
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,339
It's a long story.

392
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,569
She saw my video and is determined to buy a house,

393
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,370
but I don't know how she has no savings at her age.

394
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,590
Let's leave then.

395
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,590
Oh, so that's why she said that to me earlier.

396
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,690
The style is a little outdated, but...

397
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,470
Should I buy a new one?

398
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,129
No.

399
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:29,670
I need to save up.

400
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,050
I compliment you, Young Won.

401
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,650
Good job in restraining yourself.

402
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,960
Too bad...

403
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,210
This isn't doing it for me.

404
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,550
Compliments are better when they come from other people.

405
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,980
♫  We’re so different,  ♫

406
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,649
 Join an internet café on homeownership and make companions.

407
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:51,719
 When you walk alone, it's lonely,

408
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,559
 but when you walk with others,

409
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,350
 it's fun.

410
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,190
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

411
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,680
Home Ownership Coarse Salt Café...

412
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,339
♫  You know this too  ♫

413
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,760

414
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,550
There are so many people trying to live their lives diligently.

415
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,700
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

416
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,830
They're all my companions from now on.

417
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,740
  Hello. I'm an office worker in my thirties.

418
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,920

419
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,050
 Good morning!

420
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,099
What the...?

421
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,750
Why is the air purifier so angry all of a sudden?

422
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,309
Why are you such a mess?

423
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:42,069
What's this smell?

424
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:43,879
The same clothes as Friday.

425
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:45,009
A beard...

426
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,449
Oily hair!

427
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:48,279
Did you not wash your hair during the weekend?

428
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,479
Correct!

429
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:52,249
Right after work on Friday, I went to a psychic.

430
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,989
He told me if I wanted to get the subscription,

431
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:57,089
I needed to avoid water till tomorrow,

432
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,059
and I shouldn't change my clothes,

433
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:01,629
so I'm even wearing the same underwear.

434
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:04,059
You stink! You didn't even change your socks?

435
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,499
He's in the same underwear! Why would he have changed his socks?

436
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:07,829
Correct!

437
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,010
Get that out of my face!

438
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,940
Oh! I almost forgot.

439
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,409
Here. Take one each.

440
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:16,810

441
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,370

442
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,040
Don't come near.

443
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,859
The psychic said

444
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,469
if I'm charitable before the announcement,

445
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:43,339
it'll give me good fortune.

446
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:44,499
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

447
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:46,469
Since you mentioned enjoying it,

448
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:49,079
I want to say it's a brand my cutie pie enjoys.

449
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,320
It's supposed to be really good.

450
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,109
But do you know what's even better?

451
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:56,080
No idea.

452
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,070
How I feel right now.

453
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,470
I feel good. I think I'll get it this time!

454
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,829
If I get it, I'll get married immediately.

455
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:09,099
With my cutie pie!

456
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,599
All right. Stop talking. Your breath stinks.

457
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,700
It's unsightly!

458
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,020
I'm gonna give one to the CEO.

459
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,420
Oh my god!

460
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,959
That filthy maniac.

461
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:41,089
I need to clear my airway with the scent of coffee.

462
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,459
He is really passionate about the subscription.

463
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,999
I didn't know he wanted it that bad.

464
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,429
Don't get me started.

465
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:49,970
Last time...

466
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,420
 After bowing 108 times, he busted his kneecaps.

467
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,750
 And last winter, he went to early morning prayers...

468
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,179
 the cold paralyzed his jaw.

469
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,320
He got cupping done on his face and made a fuss.

470
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,349
I don't think this is right.

471
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:42,420
Just in case, don't eat the red ginseng...

472
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,610
You ate it.

473
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,840
I feel kind of weak these days.

474
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,870
Well, since you already ate it...

475
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,690
There's no use telling you now.

476
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,820
Let's just hope Editor Nam gets the subscription.

477
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,040
Wow, this is great!

478
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,480
Did you invest in here, too?

479
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,481
How many houses do you have?

480
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,030
Why do you want to know?

481
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,430
Seriously.

482
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,820
Why? Are you going to buy one?

483
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,110
Shut up.

484
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,710
The real deal is much better than what I saw on the storyboard.

485
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,430
Ah, the scent of phytoncide.

486
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,209
If you live in a wooden hanok near a forest,

487
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:36,059
it'll relax you instantly. It's a house you'd want to live—

488
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,560
Stop.

489
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,359
Not a house you want to live in, but a house you want to buy. I told you to put the emphasis on that.

490
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,729
It's a two-minute walk to the forest.

491
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,119
It's built from top-quality Geumgang pine from Gangwon-do,

492
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,170
so the price will keep rising.

493
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,519
A house you want to buy.

494
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,250
A house that makes money. Emphasize that!

495
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,980
Yes, Sir.

496
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,469

497
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:11,560

498
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,169
 Upstairs is in the hanok style.

499
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,510
The beauty of Korea's traditional hanok stands out.

500
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,690
As you can see, the lumber is all Geumgang Pine.

501
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,260
 The expansive windows make the house unique.

502
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,689
Upstairs is hanok. Downstairs is western.

503
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:34,869
To draw a contrast, it's focused on modern beauty.

504
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:37,129
The floors are marble.

505
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:41,030
The stretch of straight lines is impressive.

506
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,339
 I'll fill my stomach right now so I don't have to eat dinner.

507
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,959
 Try this after you're done.

508
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,069
It's Sikhye I made myself. 
  (T/N: Sikhye - sweet rice punch)

509
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:16,479
Thank you for cooperating with the shoot and also for treating us to lunch.

510
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,639
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

511
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:21,169
We'll wrap up the shoot in about two hours.

512
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,770
Don't worry about me and take your time.

513
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,399
Are you satisfied with this hanok village?

514
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,440
Of course.

515
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,359
It's because tourism spiked when it became known as a beautiful hanok village,

516
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,499
and businesses flocked, causing its price to rise.

517
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:40,350
That's why you want to recommend it to our readers.

518
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,150
That's what you're saying, right?

519
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,519
Oh, sure.

520
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,200
You can say that.

521
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,839
Put what CEO Jang just said in your article.

522
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,609
Sir?

523
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,319
You fed her the words...

524
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,110
Put it in.

525
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,110
Yes, Sir.

526
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,710
Ja Sung. We'll get indigestion. Let us eat.

527
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,399
It's so good.

528
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:00,710
- Really? 
 - Yes!

529
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,630
The kimchi is especially incredible, right?

530
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,830
- Right. 
 - Yes.

531
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,830
Should I pack you some?

532
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,310
- Really? 
 - It's okay.

533
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,600
We can't bother you when we're here for work.

534
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,159
It's all right. I'll pack some for you.

535
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,040
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

536
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,129
Thank you.

537
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,570
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

538
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,109
 Good job, you guys.

539
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:36,690
 Thank you. Good job.

540
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,770
Right! You'll take kimchi home, too, right?

541
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,829
I'm good. I don't like kimchi.

542
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:44,829
I'll be by the car, packing up.

543
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:46,930
 Okay. See you.

544
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,329
You have to take some.

545
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:48,850
What?

546
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,070
You said the kimchi was delicious.

547
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,090
I'm good, too.

548
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,160
What do you mean, "good"?

549
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,140
Didn't I tell you to save up?

550
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,169
Not having to buy kimchi when you're eating

551
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:00,879
instant noodles at the studio will be huge.

552
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:04,089
Take some kimchi no matter what, okay?

553
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:07,420
No, it's okay. I'm good. For real.

554
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,760
You just don't listen, do you?

555
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,340
You'll regret it later. For sure.

556
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,450
Did you have to get the kimchi?

557
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,510
It's what you said.

558
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,880
Save up to make seed money.

559
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,159
I'm going to succeed in buying a house.

560
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:36,700
Yes, whatever.

561
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,030
It bothers me that you have so few subscribers.

562
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,859
What about a collab with a popular channel?

563
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:48,800
Or change the title and thumbnail...

564
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,059
What?

565
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,660
What?

566
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,050
What the...?

567
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,490
What?

568
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,190
What are you going to do about this?

569
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,140
How will you take responsibility?

570
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,640
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,309
I'll pay for the dry cleaning and car wash...

572
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,019
The washing machine can remove the stains.

573
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,240
It's about time your car got deep cleaned anyway.

574
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,770
It's not really her fault. Don't be mad.

575
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,370
Are you really not hurt?

576
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,889
That's enough!

577
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:48,519
If you're so worried about her, you take her!

578
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,880
And this kimchi!

579
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,909
He's really going.

580
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,960
Sheesh, what a temper.

581
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:25,030
Oh, wait!

582
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,690
It's not much, but take what's left.

583
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,700
You saw me be such a nuisance...

584
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:52,060
I said you'd regret not taking the kimchi,

585
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,919
but I'm the one regretting it. I feel bad about what happened to the CEO,

586
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:59,859
and I feel so embarrassed in front of you.

587
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,810
About what?

588
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,839
There's no reason to apologize or be embarrassed.

589
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,980
Get some rest now.

590
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,710
Thanks for the ride.

591
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,530
Oh? Editor Na!

592
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,320
All I did was be a nuisance...

593
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,010
Embarrass myself...

594
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:42,110
Is this all worth it to save money?

595
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,909
 Of course!

596
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,720
 If you want to make seed money!

597
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,129
 Anyway, you got some kimchi for free!

598
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:51,429
 You've already saved up a lot this week.

599
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:53,540
That's right.

600
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,269
 Five cups of coffee costing ￦4,000 ($4) is ￦20,000 ($20).

601
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:04,589
 Bank fee is ￦1,200 ($1.20).

602
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:06,649
 Clothes are ￦38,000 ($38).

603
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:08,489
 Curtains are ￦21,000 ($21).

604
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:10,779
 Kimchi is ￦25,000 ($25).

605
00:36:10,779 --> 00:36:13,750
 The total is ￦105,200! ($105.20)

606
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,649
￦105,200?

607
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:20,080
Incredible! I saved a lot!

608
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,360
I might buy a house faster than I thought.

609
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,550
I feel so bad about what happened to the CEO.

610
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,720
 Sir, I'm so sorry about what happened today.

611
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,820

612
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,980
Young Won!

613
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,349
How did it go yesterday?

614
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,569
What?

615
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,439
Oh, fine.

616
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,899
Sunbaenim!

617
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:14,210
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

618
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,309
This is for you...

619
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:21,080
I did the research for the armchair advertorial.

620
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,170
You organized it so well.

621
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,979
I didn't even ask you to do this. Thanks.

622
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:28,900
No problem.

623
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,629
I'll work even harder.

624
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:33,630
- I'm going inside now. 
 - Okay.

625
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,319
Amazing.

626
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:39,469
She did a shoot with me all night last night.

627
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:40,699
When did she prepare this?

628
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:42,520
- She pulled an all-nighter? 
 - Yes.

629
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,229
She's always so passionate.

630
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:48,370
She works so hard to become an editor.

631
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,150
She's like you when you were an assistant.

632
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,050
Good morning. Good morning.

633
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,840
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

634
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,859
Good morning.

635
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,369
- Good morning. 
 - Hi.

636
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:59,380
Hello.

637
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,380
You look great today.

638
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,569
Oh, right. Today's the announcement, right?

639
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:10,680
What's the result? What?

640
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,130
Did you get it?

641
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,079
Yes.

642
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,999
- What? 
 - Really?

643
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:17,620
- Awesome! 
 - I got it!

644
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:22,750
I became the loser.

645
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,059
For heaven's sake.

646
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:28,369
I'm going to strangle that psychic.

647
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:34,099
I'll demand a refund and compensation for mental damage.

648
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:36,769
There's something else I should get back.

649
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:39,509
Send me money for the red ginseng

650
00:38:39,509 --> 00:38:41,679
I gave you yesterday to my bank account...

651
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,970

652
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,029
I knew you'd do this, so I didn't touch it.

653
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:49,420
Take it and get a refund.

654
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:58,219
What? Where's yours?

655
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,949
Oh, I...

656
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:02,559
ate some...

657
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,439
Take what's left...

658
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:05,059
Are you insane?

659
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:09,369
How can I get a refund for what you already ate?

660
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,170
Sorry I got mad.

661
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,709
Editor Na, just...

662
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,359
wire me the money. It's ₩78,000 ($78).

663
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,220
What?

664
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,339
I was going to tell you not to eat it in case this happened.

665
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:31,889
He's so generous before the announcement,

666
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:34,849
then does a 180 when he gets rejected.

667
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:38,990
So he's nicknamed "Bipolar Subscription."

668
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,319
I wish you had told me earlier.

669
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,920
Sorry.

670
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,230
Yes?

671
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,600
The red ginseng is on the table there.

672
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,700
It seems like you also knew that there won't be any positive results.

673
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,199
It's an obvious outcome considering your points.

674
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,660
Sir?

675
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,900
No homeownership period is eight to nine years. That's eighteen points.

676
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,720
No dependents. That's five points.

677
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,800
Occupant savings period is ten to eleven years. That's twelve points.

678
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,200
How much is that in total?

679
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,600

680
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,100
Thirty-five points.

681
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,900
You need at least fifty points.

682
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,340
Don't try to get an apartment, then get married.

683
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,100
Get married first, have kids, gain more points,

684
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,600
then apply for the newlyweds' special housing supply.

685
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,910
I want to buy an apartment before I get married.

686
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,790
Then you can't get married.

687
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,460
Sir?

688
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,750
Then is there another way to buy an apartment?

689
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,000
What's this?

690
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,090
- Is this a code? 
 - My bank account number.

691
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,100
1:1 consultation is ₩2 mil. ($2.000) an hour.

692
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,290
I'll be going now.

693
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,800
What are you looking at?

694
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,860
Send me money for the red ginseng!

695
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,630
Sheesh, that idiot.

696
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,900

697
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,000

698
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,300

699
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,700
Come on.

700
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
You said you got rejected.

701
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,200
What's the use of checking again?

702
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,900
Just in case I saw wrong.

703
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,770
I was right. I did get rejected.

704
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,160
Jeez.

705
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,900
I need to own an apartment to get married,

706
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,170
but I need to be married to own an apartment.

707
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,100
How ironic.

708
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,080
Lower your standards.

709
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,530
You said you need a loan

710
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,700
even if you win the subscription.

711
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,140
Give up on the subscription.

712
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,770
Get a loan and get a lease on a deposit basis or buy a multiplex housing unit.

713
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:29,051
I don't want to! I want to be a husband fit for my cutie pie!

714
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:32,320
Why does that qualification entail an apartment?

715
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,750
You said she doesn't care about that, so why?

716
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,080
Why make things harder for yourself?

717
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,930
- Mom! 
 - What the...?

718
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,420
You're so like my mom right now.

719
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,910
Why nag like my mother?

720
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,301
Who are you to judge my life?

721
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:49,390
Hey. I'm saying this because I'm worried about you!

722
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,190
Why are you worried about me?

723
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,430
Yes, just send him the money.

724
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,610
There's a reason he's called "Bipolar Subscription."

725
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,990
 Stop!

726
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:03,041
 Are you the same person who was determined to gather seed money by getting free kimchi?

727
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,660
I can't help it.

728
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,140
If I don't send him the money, he'll be mad.

729
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,440
 Did you ask him for the red ginseng?

730
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,630
 He gifted it to you but now wants it back.

731
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,039
 Does it make any sense?

732
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,350
 Stand firm no matter what.

733
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,150
 Save money like hell.

734
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,250
 Didn't you decide to be tough?

735
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,350
 Have you already lost the will to own a house?

736
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,750
No, Sir!

737
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,350
I will never crumble.

738
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,550
I'll be tougher.

739
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,580
 Wow, she's tough.

740
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,920
Editor Na is tough as a tire.

741
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,490
Why? What is it?

742
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,160
 I'm sorry.

743
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,439
 I want to send you the money,

744
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:47,090
 but financially, I'm in a bad situation.

745
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,620
 I'll return the leftover red ginseng.

746
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,840
 I've put it on your desk.

747
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,200
I'll make her regret this.

748
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,800
I'll get the money from her no matter what.

749
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,900
You wait.

750
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,320
Let it slide.

751
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,660
Young Won's really pitiable.

752
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,600
Pitiable?

753
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,190
More than me, who lost all his money by investing in cryptocurrency to gather marriage funds?

754
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,370
Yes. More than you.

755
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,580
More than me, who is broke and lives with his parents?

756
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,420
Yes. More than you.

757
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,480
If you knew how she's been living,

758
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,890
you'd want to give her wild ginseng, let alone red ginseng.

759
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,990
You keep it, Editor Na.

760
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,980
What? But I can't send you the money...

761
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,840
It's okay. I won't ask for it. Just keep it.

762
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,970
What's up with you?

763
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,450
You were fuming about getting your money back.

764
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,590
I can't ask for money from Editor Na.

765
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,330
I heard that...

766
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,450
Anyway, I want to give it to you, so just take it.

767
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,880
Thank you.

768
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,520
Stop. Don't waste time on small talk.

769
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,320
When you're in the office, focus on work.

770
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,610
So you heard what?

771
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,650
What did you hear?

772
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,450
 What? Huh? Why the sudden change?

773
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,580
 Editor Na has got it rough.

774
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,030
 She lived such a pitiable life.

775
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,460
  Thank you for the red ginseng.

776
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,470
 I'm so grateful.

777
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,230
 Sure.

778
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,880
 What? What? What happened to her?

779
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,330
 If you need help with anything, let me know.

780
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,470
 Just forget it.

781
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,009
 Editor Yeo told me.

782
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:03,550
 Editor Na's life was filled with misfortune.

783
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,130
 I couldn't listen without crying.

784
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,290
 Forget what?

785
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,400
 What's with the attitude?

786
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,560
Crap.

787
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,330
Editor Na. Sorry.

788
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,830
I sent the wrong text.

789
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,120

790
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,130
You'll be the death of me.

791
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,780
I was worried he'd keep hounding you about paying him back for the red ginseng.

792
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,080
So I told him about your life. I'm sorry.

793
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:43,420
I wasn't spreading the word.

794
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,260
The Chief Editor kept bugging me about it.

795
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,590
How dare you drag me into this!

796
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,030
I asked secretly.

797
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,130
Editor Na, don't be upset.

798
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,440
At least you don't have to give me money.

799
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,810
Yes.

800
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:07,100
And it's not like you're making things up.

801
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,350
I have a photoshoot.

802
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:13,310
I'll be at the studio.

803
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,990
Okay.

804
00:47:17,661 --> 00:47:19,590
- It's all your fault. 
 - Why's it my fault?

805
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,591
It's your fault.

806
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:23,650
Why's it my fault?

807
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,560
How humiliating...

808
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,130
Now everyone knows about my miserable life.

809
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,140
Just let it go.

810
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,030
Just focus on how I saved money on ginseng.

811
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,880
Let's work.

812
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,120
We finished setting up.

813
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,020
Okay.

814
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,090
Let's start the shoot.

815
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,770
 Okay.

816
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,820
 - Good job. 
 - Good job.

817
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,560
 - Good job. 
 - Good job.

818
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,690
Sunbaenim!

819
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,250
Fire extinguisher!

820
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,680
Oh, no!

821
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,920
I'm sorry, Sunbaenim.

822
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,390
This wouldn't have happened if it weren't for me.

823
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,140
I'm so sorry.

824
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,810
This happened while saving a person.

825
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,410
Won't the company take responsibility?

826
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,340
And instead, I'll get fired.

827
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,250
Since I caused all this.

828
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,410
If I just hadn't made the mistake...

829
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,980
If people in this field hear about me,

830
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,830
no one will hire me as an editor.

831
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,110

832
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,260
What am I going to do?

833
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,000
Do you really have ten years of experience?

834
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
How can you set an armchair worth ₩5 million ($5,000) on fire by mistake? It doesn't make sense.

835
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,300
I'm sorry.

836
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,000
Have you talked with the company?

837
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,300
They said it's beyond repair. They want full compensation.

838
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:39,900
Make an official apology once more. You pay for the armchair and take it home.

839
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,000
Yes, Sir.

840
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,800
What's the use of saving money on kimchi?

841
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,500
More money is leaking out because you did a bad job. First, do your main job well.

842
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,900
If not, you'll not only have no home, you'll have no job either.

843
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,000
Understand?

844
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm sorry.

845
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,400
An apology is useless. Get out.

846
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:23,490
♫  It’s especially quiet in my room today  ♫

847
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:30,450
♫  Feels like it’s embracing me  ♫

848
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:38,180
♫  Things didn’t go my way today  ♫

849
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:45,340
♫  It was a day filled with easy sighs  ♫

850
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:54,880
♫  When I try to act like I’m OK and smile  ♫

851
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:01,950
♫  Feels like tomorrow will be better  ♫

852
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:08,940
♫  Just like the many dreams  ♫

853
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,400
 Thank you so much.

854
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,900
 I'll repay you as soon as I become an editor.

855
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,960
 You're a really good sunbaenim.

856
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,800
♫  Everyone goes through this kind of day  ♫

857
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:27,170
Sure, I lost a lot of money, but I've become a good sunbaenim.

858
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:33,540
♫  For a tomorrow that’ll be different from today  ♫

859
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,000
♫  Thank you for getting through this lonely day  ♫

860
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,560
Good sunbaenim? Who am I kidding?

861
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,950
I'm a broke sunbaenim causing a nuisance

862
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,180
and getting humiliated.

863
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,220
What's the use of saving money by getting pitied?

864
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,840
♫  Lonely day  ♫

865
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,200
I lost ₩5 million in a second.

866
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,100
When will I ever buy my own house?

867
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,990
When will I ever?

868
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,050
Ouch, it hurts.

869
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,500
Editor Na seems to be in a tight spot.

870
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,400
Go easy on her.

871
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,000
You've been through difficult times, too.

872
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,800
Hey. How dare you compare her to me?

873
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,300
I'm Gaeryong. The last dragon of our age to rise from a ditch.

874
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,900
The ditch I struggled to get out of...

875
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,100
Do you think she's ever lived there?

876
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,800
Do you think she made an effort like me?

877
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,200
If she had, she wouldn't be living like that at that age.

878
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,100
What do you mean, "go easy on her"? She should've done her job well.

879
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,000
The armchair incident wasn't Editor Na's fault.

880
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,700
- What? 
 - She told me not to tell,

881
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,200
but I have to say something since you're being so harsh.

882
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:05,200
An assistant made a mistake and caused the fire.

883
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,600
What? Why didn't she say anything?

884
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,100
She was probably protecting her junior.

885
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,700
Jeez.

886
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,700
She's not in a position to protect someone.

887
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,100
She's protecting someone despite her situation.

888
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,300
Doesn't that make her a really good person? I think she is.

889
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,600
Forget it. End of conversation.

890
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:38,410
She doesn't even turn off her computer.

891
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,900
  Hello. I'm an office worker in my thirties.

892
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,600
 Until now, to me, buying a house was out of the question.

893
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,150
If she only worked this hard...

894
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,500
 My parents tried to buy a house but got scammed.

895
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,700
 It destroyed our family.

896
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,600
 My dad got on a deep-sea fishing vessel, then disappeared.

897
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,500
 My mom became bedridden.

898
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,100
 Mom!

899
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,230
 Dad!

900
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:21,710

901
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,700
  My parents were virtually non-existent.

902
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,730
 Mom...

903
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,600
 From then on, I passed through the homes of relatives.

904
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,050
 I made money any way I could.

905
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:54,780
 It was the only way to survive.

906
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,160
 The ditch I struggled to get out of...

907
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,399
 Do you think she has ever lived there?

908
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:09,970
 Do you think she made an effort like me?

909
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,150
 I haven't heard from you all day.

910
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,690
 Did you have a lot to do today?

911
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,390
 I'll call you after class.

912
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,300
 I'll go wash my hands.

913
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,500
  Okay.

914
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,040
 Be careful.

915
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,400
 Be careful.

916
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,580
  My cutie pie. Hurry back!

917
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,490
 Mom: I set you up with someone next week.

918
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,160
 He's a lawyer who owns an apartment in Gangnam.

919
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,300
 How can you meet a man who has no apartment?

920
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,400
 Break up with him now.

921
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,520
 What do you want to do today?

922
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,870
  Whatever my cutie pie wants...

923
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,230
 I'll do it all.

924
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:51,290
 I read in a book that

925
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,530
 a house must be a place where you can

926
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:59,340
 grab a beam in a dark corner and cry.

927
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:04,420
 My house provided that for me today.

928
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,490
 Why?

929
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:10,800
 Because I lost a huge sum of money.

930
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,000
 Just yesterday, I had high hopes for homeownership.

931
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,979
 I guess homeownership

932
00:58:18,979 --> 00:58:23,940
 is unattainable for someone like me.

933
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:31,900
Jeez. Not even one comment.

934
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:38,850
I can't even make companions.

935
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,070
Hey, you shameless stomach.

936
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,220
What do you want me to do?

937
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,580
I lost ₩5 million. Got it?

938
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:50,509
No dinner for you from now on.

939
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:53,070
Let's do that.

940
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,200
Editor Na.

941
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,860
She must be so upset.

942
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,421
 Should I ask her to get some air with me?

943
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:15,440
Jeez...

944
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,640
Is that too much?

945
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,140
What?

946
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,540
Editor Na?

947
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,610
₩1,600 ($1.60) for 1+1 means ₩800 ($0.80) for one.

948
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,830
No.

949
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:41,249
If I buy one that's ₩1,100 ($1.10),

950
00:59:41,249 --> 00:59:43,360
I'll be saving ₩500 ($0.50).

951
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:46,430
Do you want to split it with me?

952
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,539
Buy 1+1 and split it with me.

953
00:59:50,539 --> 00:59:53,420
Then you'll be saving more. Right?

954
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,720
I thought you'd be bummed out, but you're not.

955
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,410
Right.

956
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:08,330

957
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,950
What is it this time?

958
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,030
Yes, Sir?

959
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,950
That armchair.

960
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,800
The company will pay it off as a company expense.

961
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,441
Sir?

962
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:21,140
When I thought about it, the accident occurred during work.

963
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:25,910
If the company doesn't take responsibility, it might violate the Labor Law.

964
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,420
Oh, thank you.

965
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,970
Thank you so much!

966
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:35,180
No way!

967
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,460
No way...

968
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,261
No way.

969
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:40,560
Ja Sung said that?

970
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,530
That's such a relief!

971
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,100
It really is.

972
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,390
Ouch, hot.

973
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,690
Do you want to become convenience store mates?

974
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,390
What?

975
01:00:58,390 --> 01:00:59,680
Convenience store mates?

976
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,940
Yes. Let's meet up and target 1+1 items.

977
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,540
To save money.

978
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,880
Per your advice, from now on,

979
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,220
I'm saving up, too.

980
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,680
That's great!

981
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,180
Good thinking!

982
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,390
To shake on that, how about 1+1 instant rice?

983
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:20,600
Sure.

984
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,770
I'll go buy it.

985
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,370
Okay.

986
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,270
 My first reply!

987
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,380

988
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:37,510

989
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:40,220

990
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,670
 Thank you.

991
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,770
 The money problem got solved miraculously.

992
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,290
 What luck!

993
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,390
 I've decided not to despair.

994
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,540
 I'll hang in there!

995
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,630
♫  Every little thing you say  ♫

996
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:58,430
♫  It saves me from falling much deeper  ♫

997
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:03,510
♫  I lay down my head on you shoulder  ♫

998
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,050
 I'm glad for you.

999
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,310
 I'll continue to root for you.

1000
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:10,090
♫  Just listen here we are again  ♫

1001
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,700
♫  Through the fire through the rain  ♫

1002
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,450
♫  The roads we crossed they built  ♫

1003
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,670
♫  Story of us  ♫

1004
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:22,450
♫  Here we are again and I still feel the same  ♫

1005
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:27,080
♫  You and I, we write the story of us  ♫

1006
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,530
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

1007
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:32,590
♫  Stay with me until the die  ♫

1008
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,930
♫  Write the story of us  ♫

1009
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,010
♫  Sway with me like firefly  ♫

1010
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:42,060
♫  Stay with me until the die  ♫

1011
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:45,750
♫  Write the story of us  ♫

1012
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,450

1013
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:26,270

1014
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:30,410

1015
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:40,540

~ Preview ~

1016
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:43,180
 I've started a project to spend only ₩10,000 ($10) a day.

1017
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,710
 I'll keep rooting for you. Fighting!

1018
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,110
 It's certainly humiliating content.

1019
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:48,380
 I'm looking at it because she's pretty.

1020
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,380
 Do you like Editor Na?

1021
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,690
 Editor Na, you're buying.

1022
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:52,490
 Me?

1023
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,820
 Editor Na Zero Won, stay. Work overtime.

1024
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:57,060
 His way of showing affection is through money.

1025
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:00,320
 He likes you so he won't let you spend money.

1026
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,560
 What's the occasion?

1027
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,930
 I'm buying to increase work efficiency.

1028
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,650
 Do you like me?

1029
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,610
 Can I answer you with this?

1030
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,950
♫  I bet, you know  ♫

1031
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:16,400
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

1032
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:23,960
