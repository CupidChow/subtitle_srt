1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,540

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,150

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,060

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,480

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,550

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,480

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,740

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,580

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,260

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,700
I like you.

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:01,930

12
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,633
I said I like you.

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,765
I know this is sudden.

14
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:27,566
You can take your time to respond.

15
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:30,280
- I can wait— 
 - I like you, too.

16
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,533
What?

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,766
Sir, I said I like you, too.

18
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,500
Hyung!

19
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:01,134
Oh? Editor Na?

20
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,465
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,732
Oh, this.

22
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:07,999
I came here for this.

23
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,265
Yes.

24
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:13,566
I left this in CEO Yoo's car while covering a story.

25
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:16,898
But what brings you here?

26
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:18,431
I came because I was worried about you.

27
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:20,632
You said you'd be home resting, but I couldn't reach you.

28
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:22,834
I worried you were sick.

29
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:23,999
I'm fine.

30
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,799
I'm glad.

31
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:26,900
Editor Na.

32
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,698
Let's go have a beer at Hyung's place.

33
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:30,599
What?

34
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,567
Oh, no, no.

35
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:35,200
I have something else I need to do.

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,466
Well, then.

37
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,840
I'll get going.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:50,070

39
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,780
 Did you sleep well last night?

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,120
 Yes, I'm having breakfast now.

41
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:23,380
 Then are we... in a relationship starting today?

42
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:26,934
 Yes.

43
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:29,299
Yes!

44
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:32,999
You seem happy.

45
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:35,999
You said you were looking to invest in Jejudo.

46
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,300
Did you finally land something?

47
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,666
No.

48
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,732
But I think I landed something even better.

49
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,867
 Na Young Won's heart.

50
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,766
Seeing how happy you are, I guess you really hit the jackpot.

51
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,132
Yes, well...

52
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,800
I did hit it, and it's bursting.

53
00:03:56,767 --> 00:04:00,633
  This Yoo Ja Sung's heart.

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,832
Hi, Editor Nam.

55
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,833
Hello.

56
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,431
Take a seat.

57
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,798
How's your nose? Let me see.

58
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:13,466
It's all right.

59
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:14,631
- Don't say that. 
 - Ouch.

60
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,298
It must've hurt so bad.

61
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,532
I said I'm fine.

62
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:18,565
How can you be?

63
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:21,830
You got hit by a piece of pig's bone.

64
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,230

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,833
Why aren't you picking up?

66
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,633
I have to get ready for work.

67
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,964
I'll take personal calls later.

68
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:33,198
What's up with you?

69
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:35,832
Refusing to take your cutie pie's call?

70
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:38,064
- Amazing. 
 - Good morning!

71
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:40,232
Oh, sir!

72
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:42,465
Did something good happen?

73
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:45,665
I've never heard such a cheery morning greeting from you.

74
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,198
Yes, well...

75
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:50,599
- Should I make you feel even better? 
 - What?

76
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,631
The thing is, our Editor Nam

77
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:55,565
didn't take his girlfriend cutie pie's call

78
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:59,031
since work hours are about to begin.

79
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:03,699
I mean, showing off at work that you're in a relationship is so tacky.

80
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:06,965
It's ill-advised behavior that disregards

81
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:09,565
your warning to keep things professional at work.

82
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:10,631
Right?

83
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:11,600
Yes, of course.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,933
What do you think about his excellent behavior?

85
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,266
Doesn't it make you feel good?

86
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,533
Yes, very good.

87
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,900
Quite excellent. I'll be off.

88
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,233
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,500
See you later.

90
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,232
Right.

91
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,164
I should own up to what I said.

92
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,031
No ill-advised behavior.

93
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:36,070
Keep things professional...

94
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,370
♫  You’re my love  ♫

95
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,080
♫  Look at me, I’ll be standing right here  ♫

96
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,720
♫  Like a dream, like a dream  ♫

97
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,310
♫  Always, there for you.  ♫

98
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,120
♫  Don’t worry. (Baby just hold my hand)  ♫

99
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,010
♫  Don’t worry. (Don’t ever let go of me)  ♫

100
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,860
♫  Like a dream, like a dream  ♫

101
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,460
♫  I’m always there for you  ♫

102
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,066
Hello.

103
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,565
 Wow, amazing!

104
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:05,399
Why do you look so different today?

105
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,931
She changed her style.

106
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,298
It looks so good on you.

107
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,134
Thanks.

108
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,565
Doesn't Sunbae Ui Joo have that dress, too?

109
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:13,366
Wow, you have a sharp eye.

110
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,698
I lent her my dress.

111
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:17,032
Wow, I wouldn't have known.

112
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:18,234
It fits you perfectly.

113
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:20,832
Thank you.

114
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,765
Oh! Editor Nam!

115
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,866
I heard you won a subscription.

116
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,699
Congratulations!

117
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,600
Finally!

118
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,300
Thanks.

119
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,465
Okay. Let's all get to work.

120
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:40,810
The CEO is glaring at us.

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,532
MBTI is a personality test.

122
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,999
It analyzes people into sixteen types.

123
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,866
People do it a lot nowadays.

124
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,431
For this issue, I'd like to write an article

125
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,798
on interior design preference by MBTI type.

126
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:03,264
I need your test results as samples,

127
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:04,999
so please give the results to me by today.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,666
How long will the test take?

129
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,900
Ten minutes.

130
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,199
You can see how compatible you are with others.

131
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,465
- Is that so? 
 -  You look very pretty today.

132
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,632
I wonder who will be compatible with me.

133
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:19,899
I think the most compatible person

134
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,267
is me, Choi Go.

135
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,767
 Have lunch with me.

136
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,534
Stop!

137
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,232
- What are you doing? 
 - Pardon?

138
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:33,866
Why are you on your phone during a meeting?

139
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:36,099
I'm sorry. It was an important text.

140
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,332
Important how?

141
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,798
Is it work-related? Let me see.

142
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,232
Oh, no, no. It's personal.

143
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:43,366
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:47,266
I don't know who it is, but tell them to stop texting during work hours.

145
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,898
They know you're at work. Why do they keep texting?

146
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:50,834
Lacking such common sense!

147
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:52,631
They need to screw their heads on straight!

148
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:54,031
Don't forget

149
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:58,066
CEO Yoo's stern warning on only focusing on work during work hours!

150
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,100
Got it?

151
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,800
Yes.

152
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,867
I did well, right?

153
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:07,899
Yes, you did well. Very well.

154
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,599
So when will you send in your results?

155
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,366
What results?

156
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,799
You know, the MB whatever...

157
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,599
Here's the revised storyboard for the second home.

158
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,031
I'm sorry about earlier.

159
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:27,233
It's okay.

160
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:32,999
I know I shouldn't, but I can't control my feelings.

161
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,798
Should we just go public instead?

162
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,331
Tell them we're dating?

163
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:38,032
Pardon?

164
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:41,434
No, let's not.

165
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,965
You said to keep things professional.

166
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:47,865
If we date openly, I'm worried about what people might think.

167
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:52,164
And they'll also be uncomfortable around me.

168
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,399
Right.

169
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,866
You have a point.

170
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,633
Then I'll be more careful from now on.

171
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,732
I'll do my best so people won't find out.

172
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:02,632
Okay.

173
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:03,833
On that note,

174
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,433
let's go get lunch secretly.

175
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,832
That's not a good idea.

176
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,770
Why not?

177
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,965
Sir.

178
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,466
Let's go.

179
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:20,099
Where?

180
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:21,999
We were invited to an advertiser's franchise.

181
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,365
All of us have to have lunch there.

182
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,098
I told you that in the meeting earlier, too.

183
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,099
I know, I know.

184
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,732
All right, I'll go.

185
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,899
Here.

186
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,499
Editor Nam isn't coming?

187
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,332
He has an interview with an architect.

188
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,980
He's having lunch there.

189
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,334
Stop.

190
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,431
Editor Na Zero Won, don't sit there. Sit somewhere else.

191
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:49,299
Sir?

192
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,798
This is what's wrong with you. You are tactless.

193
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,965
What do you mean...?

194
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:57,732
You have many opportunities to talk with me while covering stories.

195
00:09:57,732 --> 00:10:01,399
I want to talk to other people during informal occasions.

196
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,766
Yes, sir.

197
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,832
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,598
Anyone who'd like to have an honest talk with me, please sit.

199
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,800
First come, first serve.

200
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,733
They're hesitating because they all want to sit.

201
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:26,264
The competition is fierce.

202
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:29,934
You must feel so great, sir.

203
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,166
I guess the honor is mine!

204
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:59,834
Here we go, I'll serve you first.

205
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,834
Give that to me, I'll serve.

206
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:05,466
- It's okay. I'll do it. 
 - I'll do it.

207
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:09,734
I want to serve you all today.

208
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,298
Okay. Here you go, Chief Editor Choi Go.

209
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:16,432
Just like your name, I know how hard you work all the time.

210
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:19,666
I always anticipate your articles, our trustworthy Editor Yeo.

211
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,299
Oh, thank you.

212
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:25,632
Joo Hee, Mi Ra.

213
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:30,732
It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that our office runs well thanks to the assistants, so thank you always.

214
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,400
- Oh, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

215
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,399
Hold out your dish, too, Editor Na.

216
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,867
Everyone has some, right?

217
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,300
Let's enjoy and eat up and let's fight on!

218
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:50,432
Sir, you left out Young Won.

219
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,232
What?

220
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:55,700
Oh, dear. I forgot about Editor Na Zero Won.

221
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,120
Oh, well. It's okay. I'll do it...

222
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,465
This is your problem, Editor Na, this. Not having a presence.

223
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:04,266
- Sir? 
 - If you didn't get some, you should've spoken up.

224
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:08,533
Why didn't you say anything? This is what I don't like about you.

225
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,733
There's one left here.

226
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,667
Eat.

227
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:15,866
Thank you.

228
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:20,433
You were going to give it to her anyway. You could've given it to her nicely.

229
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:24,465
Well, she ended up getting the biggest one.

230
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:28,832
It's weird how the biggest abalone was left.

231
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,766
Eat up.

232
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,233
Did you have meat by yourself?

233
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,733
Even abalone gets stuck in my teeth!

234
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:44,965
I'm sorry about earlier. I was cold to you so they wouldn't know about us.

235
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,499
I hope you're not upset.

236
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:51,666
Oh, no. I'm not. You did well.

237
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,331
If you keep this going, no one will suspect anything.

238
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:59,598
See? I get things done when I set my mind to it.

239
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:02,600
Sir, what are you doing there with Editor Na?

240
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,266
What?

241
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:09,598
Editor Na! This is what's wrong with you! Stop pestering me!

242
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:14,467
It's lunchtime! Talk about work during work hours! Why would you bother me during off-hours?

243
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:18,434
This is what I don't like about you. This!

244
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:28,699
Why is he so harsh on you today?

245
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,066
It seems like you did something really bad.

246
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,432
No. I didn't do anything wrong.

247
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:38,899
Then why's he like that? He has such a temper.

248
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:45,666
And why walk like that like an old man?

249
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:52,667
Hey. How long are you going to haul that bag around?

250
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,799
I can't keep it in the studio. Someone might see.

251
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,467
Then send it to Editor Na's house. And tell her how you feel.

252
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:00,599
We're at the office. Someone might hear you!

253
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:03,419
- No one will... 
 - Hear what?

254
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,934
- Editor Na! 
 - Who shouldn't hear what?

255
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:11,066
Oh, nothing. By the way, you must have an important appointment.

256
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,966
- What? 
 - Yes, your look is awesome. You look like a movie star.

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,099
Oh, not at all. I was at Sunbae Ui Joo's last night and...

258
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,532
Never mind. I'll be going in now. Bye.

259
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,432
Bye.

260
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,766
Get a grip.

261
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,965
What a shame. For that look, that bag in there is perfect.

262
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:40,065
Shut up. I almost got caught because of you.

263
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,100
Let's just go to the shoot.

264
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,500
Why's it because of me?

265
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,280

266
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,733
Editor Nam.

267
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,298
Oh, Editor Nam. Oh, dear.

268
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:59,232
You must be exhausted from the interview.

269
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,766
Did you have lunch?

270
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,267
Yes, I did.

271
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:08,131
Just a second. I have something to give you.

272
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,699
What's this?

273
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:16,299
20% discount coupon for Shinna Hotel Wedding Hall.

274
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,165
Don't be moved just yet.

275
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,666
20% discount for Jung Ongdal Saem-mool bridal makeup.

276
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,767
Wait, there's more.

277
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:27,600
20% discount for Park Sul-nam wedding hanbok.

278
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
What are these for?

279
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,432
What do you mean? You got an apartment, and you proposed.

280
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,065
You're getting married soon, right?

281
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:39,499
So I prepared these gifts. What do you think? You're so moved, right?

282
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,867
Oh, right. I'm so moved.

283
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:45,367
That's incredible. They're big names in the wedding business.

284
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,933
I used to work at a wedding magazine.

285
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:53,966
I used all my contacts there for this. I bent over backward to get these coupons.

286
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,733
Why go to all that trouble?

287
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,232
What? How can you say that?

288
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:05,099
Why do you think? Editor Nam and I are very close. He's like a brother to me.

289
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,965
I prepared this as his brother.

290
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:09,832
Thank you.

291
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,201
- Don't thank me yet. 
 - What?

292
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:16,466
I'll help you get the lowest prices on everything wedding-related.

293
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:20,199
Stop that. Why give him gifts he doesn't want?

294
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Why are you dampening the mood? Are you jealous?

295
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,599
But I have bad news. I can't do this for you when you get married.

296
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:31,067
Why? Because he's the only one I think of as a brother.

297
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:34,400
My brother, Editor Nam. I love you.

298
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,799
Your big brother loves you a lot.

299
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,734
Thanks.

300
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,132
Oh, right.

301
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,310
Jeez.

302
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,365
She seems to be happy with my acting.

303
00:16:56,365 --> 00:17:00,233
Is it this easy to make a woman happy?

304
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,899
- Hello? 
 -  Hello, sir.

305
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,199
 The water leak repair work has just finished. Your tenant can come back right away.

306
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,532
What? Already?

307
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,800
Wasn't it going to take a few more days?

308
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:24,600
Yes, it was supposed to,  but I nagged them to work faster for you.

309
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,265
Why? I'm not special. You didn't have to nag them.

310
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:33,532
I'll tell my tenant so don't contact her.

311
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:45,620
 I just got word that the repair work on your place...

312
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,190
 will take longer.

313
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,264
 Oh, no.

314
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:55,933
 I'm sorry. I don't want to inconvenience you more.

315
00:17:55,933 --> 00:18:01,734
 Don't be. I'm very happy that we can be together longer.

316
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:04,733
What? He's making me blush.

317
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:09,467
 Let's have dinner, just the two of us. Alone.

318
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,067
 Sure.

319
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,566
Wow, it's the long-awaited first date.

320
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,100
Should I let my hair down?

321
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:32,031
No. It's better up.

322
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,833
What the? What?

323
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,466
What?

324
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:44,000
Ouch, that hurts.

325
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What's going on?

326
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,566

327
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:10,666
₩1.05 million? ₩1.05 million ($1,050)?

328
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,532
This is insane.

329
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,099
Even with my remaining living expenses, I only have ₩500,000 ($500).

330
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,465
How will I get ₩1.05 million? Darn it.

331
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,300

332
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,031
Oh? Right. My monthly rent.

333
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,399
 Could I pay this month's rent next month?

334
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,765
  I need the money for an emergency.

335
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,765
How can I ask him that?

336
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:58,365
Even if it's urgent, how can I humiliate myself like that in front of my boyfriend?

337
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,533
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:09,531
I ruined your expensive designer dress.

339
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,999
Yes.

340
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:12,499
I don't think I can get it fixed.

341
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,966
I'll pay for it,

342
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:18,432
but can I pay by installment?

343
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:22,434
I'll pay ₩100,000 every month without fail.

344
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:23,999
I'm sorry,

345
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,466
but that won't do.

346
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,366
Right.

347
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,065
Of course.

348
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:31,431
Of course, it won't do.

349
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:33,399
That dress doesn't even cost ₩100,000.

350
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,399
- What? 
 - That's an ST.

351
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,198
It's not designer. It's styled after it.

352
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,399
An imitation.

353
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,633
- You know? 
 - What?

354
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:42,367
I can't wear designer clothes all the time.

355
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,732
Wow, I had no clue.

356
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,667
I died and was resurrected.

357
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:50,734
Right. Since you were resurrected, live well.

358
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,599
Sunbae.

359
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:57,466
I love you.

360
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:05,198
Here's the revised article.

361
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,233
Thank you.

362
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,832
What shall we have for dinner?

363
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,966
Korean? Western?

364
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:11,833
Japanese!

365
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:16,666
Sir. I don't think I can have dinner tonight.

366
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,067
- What? 
 - I have plans with Sunbae Ui Joo.

367
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,766
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,633
Why all of a sudden?

369
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,932
She drops me and makes plans with Editor Yeo?

370
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,633
Why?

371
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,033
What do you mean, "why"?

372
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:42,400
Editor Yeo must've clung on, saying she's bored.

373
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,266
Darn it.

374
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,266
Editor Yeo, do you have time tonight?

375
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,333
Why do you ask?

376
00:21:55,334 --> 00:22:00,465
If it's because of work, I have other plans tonight.

377
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:02,567
Really?

378
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,666
Then what should I do about this invitation?

379
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,264
Invitation?

380
00:22:07,265 --> 00:22:09,230
Oh, dear.

381
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,400

382
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,866
Oh, that's Gorgeous.

383
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,866
The high-end fashion magazine targeting the upper class.

384
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,899
They're famous for being elite.

385
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,731
Yes, that's probably why they chose the guests extremely carefully.

386
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,098
But I have a previous engagement.

387
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,132
I was hoping you would go instead.

388
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,633
- Me? 
 - Yes.

389
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:33,998
The only one to go to this dignified event in my place is you.

390
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:37,565
Oh, well. That is true.

391
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,632
But I have other plans. I'm sorry.

392
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:42,899
Stop. Stop.

393
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:46,799
I heard that actor Gong Yoo would be there.

394
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,132
Is he that famous?

395
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,333
What? Gong Yoo?

396
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,733
Yes.

397
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,665
I don't know celebrities that well.

398
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,132
Oh, and who else...

399
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:59,133
Oh, oh. Actor Hyun Bin.

400
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,965
I'll go. I'm going.

401
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:02,132
I will go.

402
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,066
What about your plans?

403
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,431
Who cares about the measly plan?

404
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:09,500
It's Gong Yoo and Hyun Bin, after all.

405
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,365
I don't want the others to know.

406
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,299
They might feel hurt.

407
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,299
Of course.

408
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,399
Thank you, sir.

409
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,860

410
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,966
What shall we eat for dinner later?

411
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:37,366
Oh, I meant to tell you.

412
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:39,665
- I don't think I can do dinner tonight. 
 - Why not?

413
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:44,232
I forgot I have to give the CEO some material by today.

414
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,332
Oh, really?

415
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,266
- Then I'll help you. 
 - What?

416
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:50,100
Editor Na, Editor Na, Editor Na!

417
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:52,431
This is what's wrong with you.

418
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,031
- That you have so many problems. 
 - Sir?

419
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:56,198
Just focus on your own work!

420
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,733
If you nosily help others and tire yourself,

421
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:01,399
you can't write the important promo article.

422
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,598
For tomorrow's work, go home right now and rest.

423
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,633
Maintain your best condition!

424
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:09,366
Yes. Just go home.

425
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,598
I'm okay.

426
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,999
Okay.

427
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:13,966
It's not just an ordinary amount of problems either!

428
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,299
You're just full of problems.

429
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:20,334
I have no idea how much I have to fix you!

430
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,633
Editor Na, think hard.

431
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,399
You must've done something wrong.

432
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,065
Indeed. I wouldn't treat my parents' enemies like that.

433
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:42,866
- Editor Na. Go home quickly. 
 - Go.

434
00:24:42,866 --> 00:24:45,264
Look. He's glaring at you.

435
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:47,200
Go. Quick.

436
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,099
Well, then. I'll see you tomorrow.

437
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:54,431
I'll see you tomorrow.

438
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:55,432
Bye.

439
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,100
Editor Na!

440
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:21,365
- Please, get in. 
 - Pardon?

441
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:23,767
Let's eat dinner!

442
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,031
Oh, I'm sorry, but...

443
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:30,366
I suddenly have something important to do. I'm sorry.

444
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:32,300
Editor Na!

445
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,067
What the?

446
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:45,199
 Sunbae.

447
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,866
 I love you.

448
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,999
 (Me too.)

449
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:57,833
 It'll be our first date, but I nearly cried a river.

450
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:03,765
 Are you happy?

451
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,820
 Have you become happy so quickly?

452
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,300

453
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,531
 What?

454
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:11,531
 That's ridiculous!

455
00:26:11,532 --> 00:26:15,500
 He's over thirty and he doesn't have ₩1 million?

456
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,365
 What a relief I didn't send that text!

457
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:24,866
 If I had, that would've been so humiliating.

458
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900

459
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,060
 What the?

460
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,500

461
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,632
 Why was this sent?

462
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,633
 I didn't press send.

463
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:39,966
 Give him the moving cost and tell him to move out right away.

464
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,334
 Pathetic.

465
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:52,133
I'm humiliated. How can I face CEO Yoo?

466
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,632
Oh? Editor Na!

467
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,099
Didn't you have other plans tonight?

468
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:07,300
You're not dressed to be at a convenience store.

469
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:13,266
I did... have plans,

470
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:15,765
but I canceled.

471
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,065
Why?

472
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:20,698
No reason. I felt down.

473
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,531
You know that kind of days.

474
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:27,098
Then to change things up, how about we go to my second home?

475
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:28,833
What?

476
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,632
Oh. Camping at the Han River?

477
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:35,999
When you look at the open view of the river, you'll feel much better.

478
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,132
Maybe I should.

479
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:41,500
As a matter of fact,

480
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,765
I want to go home really, really late tonight.

481
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:50,966
There's no place like my second home to kill time.

482
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,899
I'll throw this away.

483
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:01,299
Hello?

484
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,098
What? My mail?

485
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,399
I kept all the mail for you during repairs.

486
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,431
Collect them when you move back in today.

487
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:10,098
"Move back in today"?

488
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,264
What do you mean...

489
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:12,899
 Didn't CEO Yoo tell you?

490
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,031
The water leak repair work is done.

491
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:18,132
He said he'd tell you himself and wouldn't even let me tell you.

492
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:19,431
 He must've forgotten.

493
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,032
Right.

494
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,633
Okay.

495
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:25,766
Thank you.

496
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,130
 I just got word that the repair work on your place will take longer.

497
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,300
 Don't be. I'm so happy.

498
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,500
 That we can be together longer.

499
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,800
Oh, then this was...

500
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:49,567
Editor Na! I'm home.

501
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:55,232
Is she not home yet?

502
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,600
Editor Na?

503
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,833
What? Where is all her stuff?

504
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:17,531
 I heard the water leak repair work is done.

505
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,732
 I'll return to my apartment.

506
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:21,832
 Thank you for everything.

507
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,698
What?

508
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:25,800
She left, just like that?

509
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,032
Without even seeing me?

510
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:32,466
Does she not want to be with me?

511
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,100
Wait.

512
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,332
Did she avoid having dinner on purpose?

513
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,265
 Stop.

514
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:40,431
 This is what's wrong with you. You are tactless.

515
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:42,232
 I'm sorry.

516
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,865
 No, wait.

517
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,599
She definitely said she wasn't upset.

518
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,799
 This is what's wrong with you! Stop pestering me!

519
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,431
 Editor Na, Editor Na, Editor Na!

520
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:54,533
 I have no idea how much I have to fix you!

521
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:56,365
I wouldn't want to be with me either.

522
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:58,966
I wouldn't want to...

523
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:26,832
You must be tired preparing for the wedding.

524
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,431
I'm buying, so eat up.

525
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:30,066
Thank you so much, Chief Editor.

526
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:31,733
We're off work. Call me Hyung.

527
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:33,265
Oh, how could I?

528
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,967
You're like a real younger brother to me.

529
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,466
Oh, dear. The expensive meat is burning.

530
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,400
Eat up.

531
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,066
Thank you. Hyung.

532
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,865
Good.

533
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:52,200
Since I'm your hyung,

534
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:55,865
I'd like to ask a favor for my child.

535
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:56,300
What?

536
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:59,699
The new male math teacher where your fiance works.

537
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,932
The one who cost more than ten billion won to recruit.

538
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:04,966
The unrivaled number one instructor in Daechi-dong.

539
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:07,765
What? I don't know him.

540
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,399
Didn't you hear from your cutie pie?

541
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:14,400
Take a look. It's him.

542
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,920

543
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,999
Only children who pass the level test can take his classes.

544
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:31,233
My child didn't make the cut by one point.

545
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:38,199
Ask your cutie pie to get your nephew into his class.

546
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,631
That won't work.

547
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,299
Why not?

548
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,531
My child said that those two are very close.

549
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:49,032
They're joined at the hip at the academy.

550
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:53,266
There's even a false rumor they're dating.

551
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:55,665
Please help me out.

552
00:31:55,666 --> 00:32:00,232
I talked big, saying I could get my child in through you.

553
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:02,566
If I don't, my wife said she'd rip my head off.

554
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,700
You know how she is.

555
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,100
Dongsaeng Sang Soon. 
  (T/N: Dongsaeng - younger brother)

556
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,032
Call your cutie pie and ask...

557
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:11,632
I said no!

558
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,965
No.

560
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:18,032
Don't be sorry.

561
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:20,366
You won't do anything that'll make you sorry.

562
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:22,466
You'll do this favor for me, right?

563
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:23,967
My dongsaeng Sang Soon?

564
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:26,500
I'm really sorry, Hyung.

565
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,433
You bastard.

566
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,199
How dare you call me Hyung?

567
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:36,598
If you really were my dongsaeng, I'd have broken your legs right now.

568
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,932
I'd have knocked out all your front teeth!

569
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:40,632
Jeez!

570
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,232
I'm sorry, Chief Editor.

571
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:44,833
Forget it.

572
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,566
You pay for this expensive beef.

573
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:47,665
What?

574
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,366
Darn it!

575
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:52,167
Chief Editor...

576
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,832
This is insane.

577
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,900
It's me, Mi Ra.

578
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,666
Why don't you ask?

579
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:41,199
About why I'm secretly living at the office?

580
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:44,800
If you wanted to tell me, you would have.

581
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:48,399
That's right.

582
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,765
By the way, what were you watching?

583
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:51,466
Just some YouTube videos.

584
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,165
Oh? Chan has a channel.

585
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,431
What's his content theme?

586
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,865
There's no theme at all.

587
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:58,665
He just films us hanging out.

588
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:00,266
What?

589
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:17,999
Wait.

590
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:21,233
Was it too harsh just leaving a note?

591
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,867
Hi, Ui Joo.

592
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:34,298
Oh, I'm not at my friend's house. The repair is done, so I came home.

593
00:34:34,298 --> 00:34:35,499
Are you nearby?

594
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,199
Sure. See you soon.

595
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,866
Bye.

596
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:43,033
What? Is she already here?

597
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,333
What?

598
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,532
Sir!

599
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:58,165
- How can your love change? 
 - What?

600
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:00,799
Have I been dumped after one day of dating?

601
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,665
Do you not like me anymore?

602
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,566
Sir...

603
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:04,833
Yes.

604
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,499
I know I deserve it.

605
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,167
I was cold to you on purpose.

606
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:13,031
But I overdid it. I went too far.

607
00:35:13,032 --> 00:35:14,398
I understand that I hurt you.

608
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:15,833
No, that's not it...

609
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,166
I'm sorry. What I did was wrong.

610
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,599
So please give me another chance.

611
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,165
I can't get dumped without going on a first date.

612
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,999
Go on at least three dates with me. Please?

613
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,499
I promise I'll be good to you...

614
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,066
I said that's not it!

615
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,799
What?

616
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,532
It was because I was humiliated.

617
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:40,932
The text that I sent you... I was so humiliated by it.

618
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,665
Text?

619
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:46,734
What do you mean...?

620
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,100

621
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,466
It's humiliating.

622
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:59,598
When you saw that, I knew you'd think I was pathetic.

623
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:03,399
So I didn't have the guts to see you.

624
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:07,899
But I really wasn't going to send it.

625
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,031
Honest.

626
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:12,666
I don't know how it got sent, but it was an accident.

627
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,499
The emergency is resolved.

628
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:17,500
I don't need the money now.

629
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:19,499
I know I said it,

630
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,532
but it's so pathetic.

631
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:28,866
I think I lack so much to be with you.

632
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:31,534
No.

633
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,600
- Oh, right. 
  - Young Won!

634
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,332
Why is Editor Yeo here?

635
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,733
 Young Won, I'm here!

636
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:46,499
 I'm here. Open the door.

637
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,299
 Young Won!

638
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:53,832
Stay here.

639
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:03,467
What took you so long?

640
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:09,632
Sunbae! Your clothes...

641
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:11,132
I'll explain later.

642
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,531
I'm so mad. I need a drink first.

643
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,466
Sunbae. Want to get drinks outside?

644
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,365
There's a great new cart bar.

645
00:37:17,366 --> 00:37:19,198
What? A cart bar?

646
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,265
Do you think I'd go to a cart bar in this?

647
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:24,133
I'm just going to stay here and drink.

648
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:37,600
What the...

649
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,165
A VVIP secret party?

650
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,966
Yes.

651
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:46,232
CEO Yoo gave me an invitation and told me not to tell anyone.

652
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:48,865
That's why I lied to you.

653
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,799
Sorry.

654
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,933
I flipped out at Gong Yoo and Hyun Bin.

655
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:55,231
- So why are you here? 
 - What do you think?

656
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:59,299
This is all because of that bastard Yoo Ja Sung.

657
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,770

658
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,080

659
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,190

660
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,233
As it turns out, the party was yesterday.

661
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,031
CEO Yoo said it was today,

662
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:17,033
but it was yesterday.

663
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:20,920
He did it on purpose to screw me over.

664
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,390
That son of a gun!

665
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:25,065
- Sunbae. 
 - That son of a...?

666
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:27,132
He must've made a mistake.

667
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,967
Forget it!  You're not what's wrong. He is.

668
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:33,132
He's a problematic man!

669
00:38:33,132 --> 00:38:35,832
- Sunbae... 
 - Problematic man?

670
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,131
"I got the date wrong."

671
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:45,499
"It was a mistake."

672
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,666
"I'm sorry."

673
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,964
Now he apologizes?

674
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,332
I can't stand him.

675
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:55,067
I hope he gets stuck somewhere and can't get out!

676
00:38:58,032 --> 00:38:59,732
I drank on an empty stomach.

677
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm feeling the booze.

678
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,000
Why? Do you want to go home?

679
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,898
I'm going, all right.

680
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:08,833
To the bathroom.

681
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,067
Come out.

682
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:34,333
Goodbye.

683
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,100
♫  You make me  ♫

684
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,630
♫  Much better when you’re here  ♫

685
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,500
♫  I’m lucky  ♫

686
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,064
You're the first person to

687
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:54,799
make me this happy.

688
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,066
You don't lack anything at all.

689
00:39:58,066 --> 00:39:59,934
You're an amazing woman.

690
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,320
♫  From falling much deeper  ♫

691
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,260
♫  Just listen here we are again  ♫

692
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,840
♫  Through the fire, through the rain  ♫

693
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,900
♫  The roads we crossed they built  ♫

694
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,250
♫  Story of us  ♫

695
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,820
♫  Write the story of us  ♫

696
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,950

697
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,967
Hi.

698
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:21,170
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

699
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,900
Hello.

700
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,399
- Give me. 
 - Sir?

701
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,565
The wedding hall discount coupon I gave you.

702
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:31,565
Calmly hand it over!

703
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:34,140
Oh, okay.

704
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:43,698
There's more. I sent you a whole lot yesterday!

705
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:47,231
Give back the makeup and hanbok coupons, too!

706
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:49,732
What are you doing? Taking back what you gave?

707
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,999
You said they were gifts because he's like a dongsaeng.

708
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,733
Dongsaeng, my foot.

709
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,431
I sent them because I was in need.

710
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:57,098
My wife is about to divorce me.

711
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:58,432
I'm about to be a divorcé.

712
00:40:58,432 --> 00:40:59,665
What? Why?

713
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,400
This bastard didn't do me a small favor.

714
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,533
So our marriage will be destroyed.

715
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:06,766
How do you feel, Editor Nam?

716
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,066
Destroying a family?

717
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,833
What favor did you ask?

719
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:12,864
Forget it.

720
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:14,399
Who's supervising at the print shop?

721
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:16,098
Who's going to check for typos?

722
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,666
You and me.

723
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,265
Jeez. I'm not going!

724
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:23,233
My life is a typo. I'm not going.

725
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,599
Editor Nam, you go.

726
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:25,567
What? Me?

727
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,032
Why? You don't want to do this, either?

728
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,399
I really want to ask.

729
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,833
I want to ask Socrates.

730
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,732
♪ Oh, Socrates! ♪

731
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:34,999
♪ Why is Sang Soon like this? ♪

732
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,598
♪ Oh, Socrates! ♪

733
00:41:36,598 --> 00:41:38,964
♪ Why is that bastard like that? ♪

734
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:40,867
♪ Oh, Socrates! ♪

735
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:43,470
♪ Oh, Socrates! ♪

736
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:45,833
Darn it!

737
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,133
My coffee's gone cold!

738
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,233
What?

739
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:58,999
Why did you ask for such an unreasonable favor?

740
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,032
Why is that unreasonable?

741
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:03,233
Is it that hard to put in a good word for me?

742
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,799
It could be.

743
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:06,232
He might have his reasons.

744
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,366
His reasons?

745
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:09,199
More desperate than mine?

746
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,334
I'm on the brink of a divorce!

747
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:13,699
Chief Editor.

748
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,899
Just leave Editor Nam alone.

749
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:17,299
You'll regret this later.

750
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,032
Why would I?

751
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:22,232
He just lost a good Hyung.

752
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:27,033
I'm going to make him regret this forever.

753
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,532
It's the first draft of the ocean view second home.

754
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:36,666
I'll be waiting for feedback.

755
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:37,532
Editor Na.

756
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:38,832
Yes?

757
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:40,900
Can't you stay a little longer?

758
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,300
What?

759
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,433
I guess not.

760
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,432
No.

761
00:42:46,432 --> 00:42:48,499
Since it's work hours.

762
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,360
Yes.

763
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,531
- Editor Na. 
 - Sir?

764
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:08,398
Your article lacks material.

765
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:09,632
We need additional coverage.

766
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:10,767
Let's go right away.

767
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:11,834
Yes, sir.

768
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:16,431
You got reprimanded so much yesterday, yet you make a mistake again.

769
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:19,032
This is what's wrong with you, Chief Editor!

770
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:20,898
Unnecessarily butting in on other's business!

771
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:23,932
Do your own job well!

772
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,333
See you later.

773
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,299
That rude bastard.

774
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:34,433
I'm going to butt heads with him one day.

775
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,765
What are you staring at?

776
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,866
Are you done with the presentation for today's meeting?

777
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:41,700
Well...

778
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,866
Can you give me one more day?

779
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:45,432
I want to add a little more material.

780
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:46,433
Never mind.

781
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:48,366
What's the use in adding more now?

782
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:50,565
Add character to your personality instead!

783
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:51,698
Chief Editor!

784
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:52,865
What?

785
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:54,432
Editor Nam didn't do me a favor.

786
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,166
Why should I do him a favor?

787
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,566
I don't see any reason why.

788
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:00,873
Do the presentation today, no matter what!

789
00:44:00,873 --> 00:44:03,366
Yes, sir.

790
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:05,390
Seriously.

791
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:24,290

792
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:31,366
You walk better than me, who's used to surveying.

793
00:44:31,366 --> 00:44:32,333
Aren't you tired?

794
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,598
It's strange how I don't feel tired at all today.

795
00:44:34,598 --> 00:44:38,132
We're here for work, but I'm so excited.

796
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:39,800
We really are a perfect couple.

797
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,166
A match made in heaven.

798
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,580
I was thinking that exact same thing.

799
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,667
Isn't it so beautiful?

800
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:56,964
Yes. Beautiful.

801
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,034
Very.

802
00:44:58,034 --> 00:44:59,800
Seriously.

803
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,666
It's so surreal how beautiful it is.

804
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,867
Yes. It's so surreal.

805
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,967
Truly.

806
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:08,398
Right.

807
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:11,299
I read something about this temple.

808
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:16,633
"United minds make flowers bloom even in ruins."

809
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:20,799
This place fell into ruins because of a huge forest fire.

810
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:24,199
But seeing how it is so firmly restored,

811
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,900
I think that description fits perfectly.

812
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,065
Yes. I hope nothing like that happens again.

813
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:34,500
We are visitors who come and go,

814
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,250
but this place is a precious home to the monks.

815
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:00,200
Editor Na.

816
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,066
Your heels...

817
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,500
When did that happen?

818
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,332
It's probably because of my shoes.

819
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,798
I didn't know.

820
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:11,966
Stay here. I'll go get some ointment...

821
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:12,967
No, no.

822
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:13,834
I'm fine.

823
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:16,700
I didn't even know it hurt until now.

824
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,090
It's okay. Come on in.

825
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,590
♫  You’re my love  ♫

826
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,800
Get on.

827
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,299
What?

828
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,766
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

829
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:52,132
I'm not fine. Get on my back now.

830
00:46:52,132 --> 00:46:53,632
But I'm really okay.

831
00:46:53,632 --> 00:46:55,720
I'm not moving until you get on.

832
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,760
♫  Don’t worry. (Don’t ever let go of me)  ♫

833
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,430
♫  Like a dream, like a dream  ♫

834
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,020
♫  Always, there for you  ♫

835
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,670
♫  Don’t worry  ♫

836
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,770
♫  Baby just hold my hand  ♫

837
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:06,850
♫  Don’t worry  ♫

838
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,760
♫  Don’t ever let go of me  ♫

839
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,499
People are staring.

840
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:14,200
Who cares?

841
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,031
We can't show that we're dating at work,

842
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:18,120
so I want to show off here.

843
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,970
♫  You’re my love  ♫

844
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,365
My special article for this issue

845
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:30,399
is on the beautiful resorts near Seoraksan Mountain.

846
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:32,667
Take a look at this.

847
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,132
Wow, it's pretty.

848
00:47:35,132 --> 00:47:36,067
It's amazing.

849
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:38,966
Can I get a discount on that place if I go through you?

850
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:40,998
Oh, don't do that.

851
00:47:40,998 --> 00:47:44,798
He won't do you a favor.

852
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:47,433
Well. I'll ask.

853
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:48,466
Really?

854
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,132
Thank you. All right!

855
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,165
What's gotten into you?

856
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,698
Doing a favor for someone?

857
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:55,299
Stop it, please!

858
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:57,231
So it's me you won't do a favor for.

859
00:47:57,232 --> 00:47:59,200
Chief Editor!

860
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,410
Continue, please.

861
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:07,100
When it snows, the view is a masterpiece.

862
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,432
It's pretty.

863
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:11,365
What do you think? Amazing, right?

864
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:14,530

865
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:22,566
As I expected, you are all shocked.

866
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,098
Okay.

867
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:29,732

868
00:48:29,732 --> 00:48:32,165

869
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:37,799
I believe that even foreigners will respond quite enthusiastically.

870
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:39,533
That's all.

871
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,466
This lodging is amazing, right?

872
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,367
No.

873
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,799
Don't turn around.

874
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,500
What?

875
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:47,933
Don't turn around.

876
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:50,966
What's the matter?

877
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:52,367
No...

878
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:59,033

879
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:01,410
 I hope you have a nice life.

880
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,132
I'm sorry.

881
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:10,499
Let's take a break.

882
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:11,401
Editor Nam.

883
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:14,640
Editor Nam! Sang Soon!

884
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:39,967
Oh, dear...

885
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:42,666
I'm sorry, Editor Nam.

886
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:45,733
I didn't know.

887
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,665
I was being petty.

888
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:50,366
It's not your fault.

889
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:53,031
It's okay.

890
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,332
Yes?

891
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:57,300
Thanks for saying that.

892
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:08,166
I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but don't be too distressed.

893
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,766
There's nothing you can do if it's not meant to be.

894
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:12,367
No.

895
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,667
It's just a hiccup.

896
00:50:18,132 --> 00:50:21,432
We've been together for three years.

897
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:24,599
All those years, we had no problem.

898
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,333
We can't end just like this.

899
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:35,399
I will turn it all back.

900
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,300
Wait and see.

901
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,333
My cutie pie and I will never break up.

902
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,200
I can't believe this.

903
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:06,532
This is for you.

904
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:07,866
What?

905
00:51:07,866 --> 00:51:09,965
Why?

906
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:13,566
It's a thank you gift for the camping gear and yesterday's beer.

907
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:15,431
It's okay. You eat it.

908
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:17,298
- Still... 
 - I'm really sorry.

909
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:19,999
But I actually don't like chocolate.

910
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:22,380
I'll just accept your appreciation.

911
00:51:23,467 --> 00:51:25,333
Yes, Editor Yeo?

912
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,833
I'll be down right away.

913
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,830
Bye.

914
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:37,399
Going for a poop?

915
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:39,699
Oh, hello.

916
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:42,433
I was delivering the schedule sheet.

917
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,332
Do you want this?

918
00:51:44,332 --> 00:51:45,465
What?

919
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:47,199
Why?

920
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:49,660
Enjoy it.

921
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,410
What the...? Making me feel burdened...

922
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:04,866
This is a restaurant a local recommended.

923
00:52:04,866 --> 00:52:07,966
Please refer to it in the article.

924
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:09,667
Okay.

925
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,298
 Why aren't you eating the shrimp?

926
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,699
 Pardon?

927
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,833
Oh, because there's so much to eat.

928
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,298
I'm taking it slow.

929
00:52:19,298 --> 00:52:20,300
Come on.

930
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,199
This is a shrimp restaurant. You must eat shrimp.

931
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,665
Here. Say ah.

932
00:52:25,665 --> 00:52:27,232
No, it's okay.

933
00:52:27,232 --> 00:52:30,532
I want to show off that we're dating while we're here, at least.

934
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:32,433
It's okay.

935
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:36,000
Say ah.

936
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,766
Ah.

937
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:43,732
Oh, I can't eat shrimp!

938
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:45,799
What?

939
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:47,599
I'm sorry.

940
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,567
I'm so sorry.

941
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:53,964
Actually, I had shrimp when I was little and got really sick.

942
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:56,299
Then I would've taken you to eat something else instead of shrimp.

943
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,932
It's okay.

944
00:52:57,932 --> 00:53:02,590
This is for the article, so we can't cater it to me.

945
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:09,267
Actually, covering the story is good and all,

946
00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:11,867
but I brought you all the way here

947
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:16,031
because we didn't get to enjoy the beach last time we were here.

948
00:53:16,031 --> 00:53:16,999
Pardon?

949
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,700
I wanted to make you happy.

950
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,265
But I really screwed up.

951
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:26,066
You hurt your heels, and you can't even eat properly.

952
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:28,533
It's all my fault.

953
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:30,931
Oh, no.

954
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:32,331
I had a great time.

955
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:33,299
Let's go.

956
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:35,265
Let's eat something you like.

957
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:36,332
Oh, no, it's okay.

958
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:39,698
Let's just eat here and go back to Seoul quickly.

959
00:53:39,698 --> 00:53:41,532
We can't just leave like this.

960
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:45,332
Let's eat something you like and take our time heading back after enjoying the night view.

961
00:53:45,332 --> 00:53:47,599
Wait, wait...

962
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:53,499
To be honest, I have to send in an advertorial by tomorrow.

963
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:57,133
I think I have to pull an all-nighter even if we get back to Seoul now.

964
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,800
What?

965
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:23,199
I wonder if Editor Nam is doing okay.

966
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,333
The more I think of it, the worse I feel.

967
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,199
I told you you'd regret it later.

968
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:34,199
You should've grabbed me by the collar and stopped me.

969
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:36,390
What do I do?

970
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:42,900
Whose call are you avoiding?

971
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,131
My boyfriend's.

972
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:46,265
Why? Are you having problems, too?

973
00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:47,932
No.

974
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:49,366
He wants to get married.

975
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:51,800
Really?

976
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:55,133
- Congratulations... 
 - So I'm breaking up with him.

977
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:56,366
What?

978
00:54:56,366 --> 00:54:57,599
You know me.

979
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,866
I don't want to get married.

980
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:04,431
I'm not one to string along a good man.

981
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:08,964
Why don't you want to get married?

982
00:55:08,964 --> 00:55:10,865
No reason.

983
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,320

984
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:26,399
He told me not to worry about rent.

985
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:29,120
What's he doing that he forgot it?

986
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,740

987
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,732
 I said I didn't see.

988
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:11,399
 I can pretend I didn't see. Nothing's the matter.

989
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,132
 I understand everything.

990
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:15,866
 So let's put it behind us...

991
00:56:15,866 --> 00:56:18,166
 I'm sorry, Oppa.

992
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,999
 I can make you happy better than anyone.

993
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,232
 I won a subscription now, so we have an apartment we can live in.

994
00:56:26,232 --> 00:56:28,133
 Oppa.

995
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:32,666
 Someone said

996
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:37,400
 you don't know when you're living in a small place,

997
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,567
 but once you move to a bigger place,

998
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:43,432
 you see how uncomfortable the other place was.

999
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:46,765
 What are you...?

1000
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:52,265
 That apartment... I don't want to live there.

1001
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:55,033
 What?

1002
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,000
 I'm really sorry.

1003
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,398
Let me out here.

1004
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:39,700
Someone might see if we're close to the office.

1005
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,900
Oh, okay.

1006
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,533
Thanks for the ride.

1007
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:54,066
- Editor Na. 
 - Stop.

1008
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:56,666
Stop saying you're sorry.

1009
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:59,366
I'm really fine.

1010
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,300
To be honest...

1011
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:08,999
it's my first time dating, so I'm clumsy at it.

1012
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:11,833
I've been focused only on making money.

1013
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:15,433
I've never dated before.

1014
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:18,133
I'm regretting it for the first time.

1015
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:20,565
If I had dated a lot before now,

1016
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:23,932
I wouldn't have shown such a clumsy side of me.

1017
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:27,534
And you wouldn't have suffered because of me.

1018
00:58:27,534 --> 00:58:29,666
What do you mean, "suffer"?

1019
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:31,332
I really had a great time.

1020
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,600
No.

1021
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,233
I'm the one that's actually lacking.

1022
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:40,265
I'm humiliatingly inadequate for you.

1023
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:41,599
Oh, no.

1024
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,798
- That's nonsense. 
 - But...

1025
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:44,499
I'll try very hard.

1026
00:58:44,499 --> 00:58:46,299
I'm Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung.

1027
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:48,732
I had nothing and came this far.

1028
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:50,999
There's nothing I can't do if I put my mind to it.

1029
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,320
I'll make you happy no matter what...

1030
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,867
You're the first person

1031
00:59:05,867 --> 00:59:09,833
to make me feel happy all day.

1032
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:15,150
You're the one who's truly an amazing man.

1033
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:21,200
♫  Like putting one ice cube in an americano  ♫

1034
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,510
♫  Our first encounter was lukewarm  ♫

1035
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:32,020
♫  We’re so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

1036
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:37,450
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

1037
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,540
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

1038
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,630
♫  I’m not the only one who thinks this  ♫

1039
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:48,390
♫  You know this too  ♫

1040
00:59:58,533 --> 00:59:59,799
 You must be hungry.

1041
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,465
 You couldn't eat because of me.

1042
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,666
 Please wait.

1043
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,665
 I'll bring you some late-night snacks.

1044
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,832
 - No, it's okay... 
 - I refuse

1045
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:10,000
 your refusal.

1046
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,032
He changed his profile pic.

1047
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:20,600
 Someone once said

1048
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:25,050
 that united minds make flowers bloom even in ruins.

1049
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:33,260
♫  It’s especially quiet in my room today  ♫

1050
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:40,920
♫  Feels like it’s embracing me  ♫

1051
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,860
♫  Things didn’t go my way today  ♫

1052
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:49,370
 In the moment of ruin when everything is lost...

1053
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:54,260
♫  It was a day filled with easy sighs  ♫

1054
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,060
 Even if you're precariously hanging on...

1055
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,330
♫  Everyone goes through this kind of day  ♫

1056
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:02,531
 Chan and Gyeom's camping!

1057
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:04,566
 Come on, say hi.

1058
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:08,132
 The day will come when flowers bloom

1059
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:12,350
 and you can smile again.

1060
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,360
♫  Thank you for getting through this lonely day  ♫

1061
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,964
 Just like this beautiful temple that stood firm

1062
01:01:18,964 --> 01:01:22,866
 amidst all kinds of ordeals.

1063
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:24,566
Of course,

1064
01:01:24,566 --> 01:01:28,190
it'd be better if there were no ordeals.

1065
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:42,931
What?

1066
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,360
They're already back from repairing the equipment?

1067
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:54,200
Those klutzes.

1068
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,760
♫  Like a dream, like a dream  ♫

1069
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,140
♫  Always, there for you  ♫

1070
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,830
♫  Don’t worry (Baby just hold my hand)  ♫

1071
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:23,010
♫  Oh don’t worry (Don’t ever let go of me)  ♫

1072
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,890
♫  Like a dream, like a dream  ♫

1073
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:28,150
♫  I’m always there for you  ♫

1074
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,000
♫  Don’t worry (Baby just hold my hand)  ♫

1075
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,280
♫  Don’t worry  ♫

1076
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,990

~ Preview ~

1077
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:37,665
 How long will you address me so professionally?

1078
01:02:37,665 --> 01:02:39,033
 Here is the material you asked for.

1079
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:40,766
 Ja Sung.

1080
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:42,500
 Are you crazy, Editor Na?

1081
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,465
 Let's go on a date tonight.

1082
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:46,165
 Let's watch a movie.

1083
01:02:46,165 --> 01:02:47,632
 Are you okay?

1084
01:02:47,632 --> 01:02:50,265
 I won't let my personal issues affect the workplace.

1085
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:52,799
 Just turn a blind eye.

1086
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,632
 How can we turn a blind eye when he's so obvious?

1087
01:02:55,632 --> 01:02:59,499
 If I see a couple today, I'm going to end them!

1088
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:04,398
 I don't think we should tell Sunbae Ui Joo we're dating.

1089
01:03:04,399 --> 01:03:07,560
 Who is that?

1090
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:16,930
