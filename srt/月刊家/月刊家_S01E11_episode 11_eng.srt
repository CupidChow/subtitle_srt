1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,320

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,080

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,820

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,200

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,380

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,910

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,790

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,460

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,160

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,020

11
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:28,700
Then... Shall we say goodnight here?

12
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:31,598
Someone might see us.

13
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:34,498
Yes. You must be tired. Go get some sleep.

14
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:35,732
Okay.

15
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:37,999
Have a good night, too, Ja Sung.

16
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:56,900
Is this real or is it a dream?

17
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,200
That was so hot.

18
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,099
Is something good going on?

19
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,632
You seem to be in a good mood.

20
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,033
What?

21
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,398
Oh, of course, I am.

22
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,933
I'm having a drink with you at a nice place like this.

23
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:35,966
Yeah, right.

24
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,031
I should ask you the same thing.

25
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,367
You have been smiling for quite a while now.

26
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,699
Yeah.

27
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,964
Something really is going on.

28
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,067
Something good.

29
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,632
What is it?

30
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,832
Do you know the girl that I like?

31
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:59,699
She said she wasn't interested in dating,

32
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,298
so I couldn't tell her how I feel.

33
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:05,532
 If someone really great comes along,

34
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,531
 I might change my mind.

35
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,566
So I'm going to tell her.

36
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,599
This weekend.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,666
Really? That's great!

38
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,465
I hope it works out so you can introduce me to her.

39
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,366
I want to know who's making you all excited like this.

40
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,833
I'll reveal one thing.

41
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,600
She makes me feel really happy just by being with her.

42
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:33,531
So you want to be around them and see them all the time?

43
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,799
Yes, there is someone like that.

44
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,766
What? Who are you talking about?

45
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,400
What?

46
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,367
You.

47
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,799
I was talking about you.

48
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,466
Stop that. So corny.

49
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:00,767
Something's up with you.

50
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:03,199
What? Sheesh.

51
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,630

52
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,765
What a nice car!

53
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,165
This is automatic.

54
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,633
There are many cars, so let's split up.

55
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,698
Editor Na, ride with me.

56
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:37,899
Oh, should I then?

57
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:38,966
Me, too.

58
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:40,533
Can I get a ride, too?

59
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,566
What?

60
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,266
Sure.

61
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,767
Wait! You should take CEO Yoo's car, Young Won.

62
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,399
- What? 
 - What?

63
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,267
You said you had to discuss work.

64
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,499
Oh, right, right!

65
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:56,298
I can talk about that on the way to Seoul.

66
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,467
Is that okay, sir?

67
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,434
Yes, sure. Let's do that.

68
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,965
Have a safe drive back, everyone.

69
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:06,599
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,165
- What are you doing? Go. 
 - Oh, okay.

71
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,367
- Go now. 
 - I'll see you tomorrow.

72
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,400
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

73
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:17,898
You acted as if you cared about Young Won, so how could you send her into the lion's den?

74
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:21,699
It'll be uncomfortable for her the whole way back.

75
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,332
Jeez.

76
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,700
It looks like it'll be just as uncomfortable for us as well.

77
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,833
So uncomfortable.

78
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,733
By any chance, do you have

79
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:58,898
plans this evening?

80
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,933
Yes, I do. And it's very important.

81
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:06,666
Oh, I see.

82
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,100
I'm going on a date with my girlfriend Na Young Won.

83
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,866
Oh, come on!

84
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,266
What shall we do?

85
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:21,632
Well, Sunbae Ui Joo felt bad about unintentionally disrupting our date,

86
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,100
and sent a wine gift coupon.

87
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,400
- Let's go to a restaurant and pay a corkage feeâ€” 
 - Let's go home.

88
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,865
Pardon?

89
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:33,298
Well, like I said last time, I have no ulterior motive.

90
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:36,332
I decorated my place so you would be comfortable.

91
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:39,866
It's a shame it's going to waste.

92
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,867
Then should we go grocery shopping first?

93
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,199
Okay!

94
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,132
Oh, Sunbae wants to video chat.

95
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:28,965
It's okay. Take the call.

96
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,867
- Sunbae! 
  - Are you happy?

97
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes.

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,565
 Wait. Where are you?

99
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,633
 Are you at CEO Yoo's place?

100
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:42,165
 Oh, my gosh!

101
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:44,267
Just a sec.

102
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:46,366
Say hi, Ja Sung.

103
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,740
Oh, uh, okay.

104
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,164
Thanks for the gift.

105
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:52,766
 Just that?

106
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,499
 There should be something else you're truly thankful for.

107
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:56,733
What?

108
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,132
 My gift!

109
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:00,266
 Didn't you get it?

110
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:03,565
Oh. I forgot to give it to him.

111
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:09,064
Sir, I hope you really like my gift.

112
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,531
Oh, thank you.

113
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,632
Then I'll leave you two alone. Bye!

114
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:19,066
She asked me to make sure I gave it to you, but I forgot.

115
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:20,899
- Wow. 
 - Tada!

116
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,367
Here.

117
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,532
Wow, she didn't have to.

118
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,434
 Peek-a-boo!

119
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:32,065
I don't believe her.

120
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:33,733
She must be crazy.

121
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,167
I had no idea it would be this kind of gift.

122
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,499
 Ja Sung.

123
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,234
 You know, right?

124
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,066
 This is your imagination.

125
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,600
 Yes.

126
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,733
 I know.

127
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,200
Ja Sung?

128
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,800
- Ja Sung! 
 - Yes?

129
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,833
What are you thinking about?

130
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,599
What?

131
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,631
Oh, I'm sorry.

132
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:47,599
No, forgive me.

133
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:50,167
- All of a sudden? For what? 
 - What?

134
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,833
Shall we watch another movie? An action film?

135
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:59,934
Oh, well, it is getting late, so I'll get going.

136
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,130
Yes, I didn't realize the time.

137
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,533
I'll drive you home.

138
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,166
Why a restaurant?

139
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,732
I may be her convenience store mate, but I don't want to confess my feelings for her there.

140
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:22,499
What do you think is a place for the confession?

141
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,864
You've really made up your mind to do this!

142
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,931
This weekend is D-Day.

143
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,666
Wow, it's happening!

144
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,533
The frustrating secret crush will end!

145
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,766
But what will you do if Editor Na turns you down?

146
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:37,165
Give up cleanly?

147
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,667
No.

148
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,967
I'll never give up.

149
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,232
I'll wait.

150
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:45,032
Until she says yes to me.

151
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:46,099
 Okay!

152
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,733
Let's start the day energetically!

153
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,500
Yes, sir!

154
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,400
Hiyaa!

155
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,533
Morning.

156
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,567
Editor Nam.

157
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,633
What's with that bag?

158
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,570
What?

159
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,031
I thought I brought my bag.

160
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,199
But I took my mom's.

161
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,266
Editor Nam!

162
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,365
How long are you going to be so out of it?

163
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,632
Pull yourself together!

164
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,265
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:18,664
I want to, but I can't...

166
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:23,566
Just brush it aside and forget it, like me.

167
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:27,898
I'll get back at him by dating a much better guy.

168
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:30,499
I'll make my ex regret losing me.

169
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:35,767
How lucky that you can do that.

170
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,965
Good morning.

171
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,064
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning, sir.

172
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:42,964
Chief Editor, a word.

173
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,932
What are you doing down there?

175
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,967
You closed the door.

176
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,199
It's a habit.

177
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:02,966
Come in.

178
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:04,466
Yes, sir.

179
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,732
What is it, sir?

180
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:09,398
Did you finish preparing for tomorrow's meeting?

181
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:12,565
Sir? Oh, yes, of course, sir.

182
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,467
Good.

183
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,465
Let's have that meeting this afternoon.

184
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:17,831
What? So suddenly?

185
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,899
Since it was supposed to be tomorrow,

186
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,733
there are some things that are not yetâ€”

187
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,500
You just said you finished the preparations.

188
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,533
Let's just have the meeting tomorrow as planned.

189
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:26,931
Because we have other plansâ€”

190
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:29,164
I have other plans tomorrow.

191
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,333
You could change your planâ€”

192
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,232
But you don't want to, I see.

193
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:37,732
We'll have the meeting this afternoon.

194
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:38,999
Yes, sir.

195
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,580
Good day.

196
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:55,867
Is there no way? Please!

197
00:12:56,467 --> 00:13:00,020
Yes, I understand.

198
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,366
I'm so mad!

199
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,964
Why? What's wrong?

200
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:07,432
I just canceled my dermatologist appointment to prepare for the meeting today.

201
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:08,899
You can go next time.

202
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,265
There's never an open slot, so I waited a month.

203
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:13,598
The next availability is a month later!

204
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:14,799
I'm so annoyed!

205
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,300
You have no time to be.

206
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Prepare for the meeting. Hurry.

207
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,350
All right!

208
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,533
What's that, Editor Nam? What's that?

209
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:27,466
Drawers that need an advertorial concept discussion.

210
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,964
Why did you just bring them like that?

211
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:30,299
Weren't they going to assemble it?

212
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,633
They were.

213
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:34,766
But the meeting got moved up to this afternoon suddenly,

214
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,499
so they said they couldn't assemble it.

215
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:37,698
Okay, okay. Assemble it, quick!

216
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:38,434
Okay.

217
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,567
I'm going to pee first.

218
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,799
You have no time to pee. Hold it in!

219
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,533
Assemble it and then go pee.

220
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,499
Okay.

221
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,265
Chief Editor...

222
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,699
What? What?

223
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:52,032
This is all because of CEO Yoo!

224
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,733
What?

225
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,967
Why is it so itchy? 
  (T/N: It's said your ears are itchy when people talk about you)

226
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,632
What?

227
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,265
Tomorrow is CEO Yoo's birthday.

228
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:05,366
Do we need to throw a party?

229
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,232
Let's pretend we don't know.

230
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:10,231
Thanks to him, I have to work without even peeing.

231
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:12,199
- Right? 
 - Of course.

232
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,232
He doesn't care about us.

233
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,365
Let's not care about him either, birthday or not!

234
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:20,098
No need to throw a party for a selfish man.

235
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:22,264
We could at least wish him aâ€”

236
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,067
Oh, what's so great about him that we haveâ€”

237
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:29,998
That's weird. Why did you stop in the middle of badmouthing him?

238
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:32,099
What?

239
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,766
Let's just focus on preparing for the meeting.

240
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,999
Let me know if I can help with anything.

241
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,732
I can't even attend the meeting because of the interview.

242
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,299
Just do a good job at the interview.

243
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,031
You know that it's the first time that the celebrity couple is opening their home, right?

244
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:47,970
We got tons of sponsorships because of that.

245
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,866
I know.

246
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,466
I wondered why you offered to do an interview a freelancer refused.

247
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:11,399
Do you want to buy CEO Yoo a gift with the money?

248
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,699
Oh, I wouldn't say that...

249
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:15,932
Blinded by love.

250
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,232
How can you like such a selfish person?

251
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:21,399
You don't know him. He's not like that.

252
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,466
He's not like that.

253
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,533
So are you upset people are badmouthing him?

254
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,233
Yes.

255
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,466
Seriously! So blinded by love!

256
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,533
Sunbae!

257
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,398
You said you'll root for us.

258
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,666
Okay, okay. I will, I will.

259
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,064
I'm rooting for your love life.

260
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,265
Happy?

261
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:39,020
Yes.

262
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,565
What's up, Photographer Shin?

263
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:50,465
I'll examine it and give feedback at the meeting.

264
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:53,340
Yes, sir. Then I'll be leaving.

265
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,266
The person that just left was your subordinate, Yeo Ui Joo.

266
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,698
The person that just stepped in is Yeo Ui Joo

267
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:19,098
who really cares about Na Young Won.

268
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:20,265
What?

269
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:25,333
I'm probably the only person that can say this.

270
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,334
Then say it.

271
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,367
Okay.

272
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:40,366
Changing an official meeting time abruptly due to your personal schedule,

273
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,864
do you think it's acceptable or unacceptable?

274
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:45,999
Will the staff badmouth you because of that?

275
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,800
- What? 
 - Of course they will.

276
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,833
Then how would Young Won feel hearing that?

277
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,031
Will she feel good or not?

278
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:54,200
- What? 
 - Of course she won't feel good!

279
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,599
Because if people badmouth Young Won in front of you,

280
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,832
you'll obviously feel bad, too.

281
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,533
Right?

282
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,967
What are you trying to say?

283
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,399
You're the CEO,

284
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,164
but you're also Young Won's boyfriend.

285
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:11,198
So please stop thinking only about yourself

286
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,931
and care about others as well!

287
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:17,260
Don't let Young Won hear people badmouth you.

288
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,765
This was Yeo Ui Joo, Young Won's close friend

289
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:26,500
who loves her very much.

290
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,560
Good day.

291
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:39,233
I love her more than you do!

292
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,600
The nerve!

293
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,466
This tablet is also a sponsored product.

294
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,765
So it has to be shown in today's shoot.

295
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,299
Okay.

296
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:50,880
By the way,

297
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,530
will Hyung Ja Sung like it if he gets a new tablet for his birthday?

298
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,064
I bet he will.

299
00:17:57,064 --> 00:18:03,032
Did you throw a party for him every year?

300
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,931
I wanted to,

301
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:06,865
but his job always comes first.

302
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:09,199
He doesn't care about his birthday.

303
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:12,533
He probably doesn't have any good memories about it.

304
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:16,100
I hope he has a great time tomorrow.

305
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,300
I wanted to make sure he did,

306
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,032
but he said he had plans for dinner.

307
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,265
If he had a girlfriend with him, I'd be happy.

308
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:26,300
But I think he'll be working.

309
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,231
I'm worried he will overwork himself and get sick.

310
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,699
You're right.

311
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:37,432
I heard he collapsed once and that you saved him.

312
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,299
Did he tell you that?

313
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,699
Oh, it came up somehow...

314
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:47,732
Anyway, CEO Yoo owes you a lot, right?

315
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,133
No.

316
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,733
He more than paid me back.

317
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,733
 Honey!

318
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:56,999
 Honey!

319
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,290
 Stop, Honey!

320
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,100
 What's this?

321
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,366
 Is this for me?

322
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,999
 Do you think I bought it for me?

323
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:47,367
 This is extremely expensive.

324
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,299
 You're always saving money.

325
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,765
 If my goal is money, your goal seems to be photography.

326
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:55,998
 Hyung!

327
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:59,165
 Make it big and pay me back.

328
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,799
 Make it to the top.

329
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,532
 That'll justify my spending two month's worth

330
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,067
 of my tutoring fee on this.

331
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,832
 Hyung was the only one

332
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,100
who supported my dream.

333
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,431
If it weren't for him,

334
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,633
I would've given up photography.

335
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,999
I see.

336
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:25,799
No wonder you two are really close.

337
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,900
 You're the CEO,

338
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,366
 but you're also Young Won's boyfriend.

339
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:46,999
 So please, stop thinking only about yourself

340
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:49,900
 and care about others as well!

341
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:03,566
Oh, dear. Are... Are you okay? Let's see.

342
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,399
There's no time to worry about me.

343
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,965
- Hurry and finish assembling. 
 - Yes, sir.

344
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,733
Where are the others?

345
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,232
Editor Na went out for an interview,

346
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,466
and the assistants are running an errand.

347
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:14,867
Is that so?

348
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,431
Then let's go have lunch.

349
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,865
We gave up our lunch hour today.

350
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,098
Yes, to prepare more perfectly

351
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,899
for the meeting that got bumped up to today.

352
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:25,966
We'll finish assembling this before the meeting.

353
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,267
Bastard!

354
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:30,234
No. You can take your time.

355
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:32,699
- Sir? 
 - The meeting will be tomorrow as planned.

356
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,300
I'll change my schedule.

357
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,399
- All of a sudden? 
 - I shouldn't just think about myself.

358
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,998
I'll make the sacrifice.

359
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,499
For you.

360
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,966
- Sir? 
 - Sir?

361
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:45,966
I'll be outside.

362
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,599
Yes, Secretary Hwang?

363
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:49,932
Yes.

364
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:52,532
My appointment... I canceled for nothing!

365
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:55,100
Ow, my finger... I hammered for nothing.

366
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,098
My bladder... I can go pee now, right?

367
00:21:58,098 --> 00:21:59,765
If he could've changed his schedule,

368
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,634
why didn't he do it in the first place?

369
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:04,132
- I know. 
 - I should tell him off.

370
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,866
Shouldn't we go to lunch?

371
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,431
Aren't you coming?

372
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:10,665
Oh, we're coming.

373
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:11,998
Of course.

374
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,065
Get ready. Let's go.

375
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,431
I... I... I need to pee.

376
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,098
He's waiting.

377
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:19,400
You can go at the restaurant.

378
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,200
Darn it.

379
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:29,799
Thank you for buying lunch like this.

380
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,232
You're welcome.

381
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,765
It's done. Let's eat.

382
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:34,566
Okay.

383
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,099
Have some of this, too.

384
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,633
There are three potatoes.

385
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,334
Here.

386
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:46,865
Don't you like potatoes?

387
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,098
No, I love potatoes.

388
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:51,065
Especially the ones in pork back-bone stew.

389
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,666
Then you should have this.

390
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,331
Oh, stop.

391
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,599
I'm not the only hungry person.

392
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,331
I might seem like a selfish person,

393
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:03,164
but I really do care about others.

394
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,699
Enough to offer potatoes that I really like.

395
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:07,598
Oh, sure.

396
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,598
You probably didn't know because I don't express it.

397
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:13,533
But from now on, I will.

398
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:16,199
- You don't have to be so obvious... 
 - Editor Yeo.

399
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:19,132
I know the breakup is hard.

400
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,966
I hope you meet someone better

401
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,165
and get married like you wantâ€”

402
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,466
I don't believe in marriage.

403
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:25,765
What?

404
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:27,965
But you said you wanted to get married.

405
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:31,533
She said she didn't want to get married.

406
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,967
She says that all the time.

407
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,599
What?

408
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:40,598
Oh, dear.

409
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:42,132
I guess I was confused.

410
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:44,866
You got a subscription, and you'll get married.

411
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:47,033
- Congratulâ€” 
 - We broke up.

412
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,499
What?

413
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:49,899
When?

414
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:52,598
How could you be so unaffected?

415
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,998
What do you mean? He's dying.

416
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,132
He was a living corpse at the old manor.

417
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,032
What?

418
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:01,900
Were you at the old manor?

419
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,332
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

420
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,533
I was preoccupied at the manor.

421
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:16,700
Excuse me. I need to take this.

422
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,132
Hello. Artist Myung?

423
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:20,199
Yes.

424
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:23,099
Two digits is no problem.

425
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,366
Why does the chief editor walk like that?

426
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,132
Did he hurt his feet?

427
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,565
Or is he learning ballet?

428
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,665
I've never seen him walk like that.

429
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,765
He walks like that every day.

430
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,565
From before you were here until now.

431
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:38,998
Every single day.

432
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:40,599
What?

433
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:52,699
Wow.

434
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,934
I can't believe I'm at a penthouse.

435
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,898
Amazing. It befits the house of celebrities.

436
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:58,598
Are they that famous?

437
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:01,633
I guess you don't know because you were abroad.

438
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,998
Everyone knows the Lee Heart Jeon Heart (homonym of telepathic) couple.

439
00:25:03,998 --> 00:25:05,733
Lee Heart Jeon Heart?

440
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:09,031
The husband is a Lee and the wife is a Jeon. Therefore it's Lee Heart Jeon Heart.

441
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:11,299
They say Lee's heart is Jeon's heart or whatever.

442
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,098
They're known for being huge lovebirds.

443
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,399
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

444
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,264
Thanks for coming all this way.

445
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:20,350
- It's cold, so... 
 - It's cold, so...

446
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,667
- Oh, my. 
 - Oh, my.

447
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:26,499
- We're really... Lee Heart. 
 - Jeon Heart.

448
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,360

449
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,133
That sculpture...

450
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,998
Did you both design this place?

451
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,466
Of course.

452
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,300
- Give me your foot. 
 - What?

453
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,830
Why?

454
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,399
Honey!

455
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,799
How did you know my legs were sore?

456
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,299
We are...

457
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,432
- Lee Heart. 
 - Jeon Heart.

458
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:07,264
Oh, my gosh.

459
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:10,431
Wow, I thought they were acting when I saw them on TV,

460
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:11,966
but it was real.

461
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:14,198
They're said to be the next power couple.

462
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,366
I can see why.

463
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,098
Yeah. That's nice.

464
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:20,599
Envious?

465
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,965
Tell her how you feel

466
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:24,532
and become a couple like them.

467
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:26,265
Shut up.

468
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,400
We're working.

469
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,665
Next question.

470
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:35,800
What was your favorite place to go on a date?

471
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,632
Okay. One, two, three.

472
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,133
Home!

473
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,832
What's wrong?

474
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:47,098
Didn't you like dating at home?

475
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:49,065
Not that much.

476
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,767
We have different opinions for the first time.

477
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:58,466
It was frustrating for you to be stuck at home, right?

478
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:00,765
That's not why.

479
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,600
You are...

480
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:06,666
a very active person,

481
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,400
but we only met at home.

482
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,600
I feel bad about that.

483
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:17,566
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,265
No.

485
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:21,665
Don't be sorry.

486
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,765
Dating at home...

487
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:25,566
I really liked it.

488
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,366
You did?

489
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,598
I think I know how you feel.

490
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,399
I like to date at home, too.

491
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,832
Oh, you must have a boyfriend.

492
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,633
- I knew it. 
 - What?

493
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:41,232
No, no, that's not what I meant.

494
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:44,498
There can be other kinds of dates.

495
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:50,532
I like inviting people over and getting invited.

496
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,032
Oh, my.

497
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,266
Are you thirsty, too?

498
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:57,932
Yes. We really are...

499
00:27:57,932 --> 00:28:00,199
- Lee Heart. 
 - Jeon Heart.

500
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,834
- I'll get a glass of water. 
 - Okay.

501
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,232
Hurry back.

502
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,598
Wait just a sec.

503
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:07,099
I'll miss you.

504
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,032
What?

505
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:16,132
It was the first time he saw me tiptoeing?

506
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:18,799
- Jeez. 
 - I know, right?

507
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,431
He shouldn't have said he cares about others.

508
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,199
I didn't know

509
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:27,065
his interest in us was that low.

510
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:28,998
Still, let's not badmouth him.

511
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,167
Some people don't like that.

512
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,498
Who? Who doesn't like to badmouth him?

513
00:28:34,498 --> 00:28:36,466
It's me. Okay?

514
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,431
You used to badmouth him like crazy.

515
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:39,665
I'm back.

516
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,399
Oh, hi. Good job.

517
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:44,264
Choose a working title and a few photos,

518
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,633
and send it to the digital team.

519
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,065
They're promoting it on social media first.

520
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:50,500
I'm sorry, but...

521
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,265
- Do we have to run this story? 
 - What are you talking about?

522
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:57,333
While covering the story, something didn't feel right.

523
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,066
- About what? 
 - I'm not sure, but...

524
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:00,734
If you're not sure, stop talking.

525
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:04,098
I told you. We got tons of sponsorships to get them.

526
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:06,634
If we don't run the story, we have to give it all back.

527
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,932
- But still... 
 - Don't say another word.

528
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:12,031
Calmly send the material to the digital team.

529
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:13,499
You're talking nonsense.

530
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,431
- Let's start the meeting, Editor Yeo. 
 - What?

531
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:17,132
Okay.

532
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:27,532
Let's do the feature story when the casting goes well.

533
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,199
Oh. What should we do for the "Trend Hot Issue"?

534
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:31,932
Yeah.

535
00:29:31,932 --> 00:29:33,198
What do you think?

536
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:36,065
Something that will captivate young readers.

537
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,732
How about covering a dating app?

538
00:29:38,732 --> 00:29:41,399
- Dating app? 
 - People use that a lot nowadays.

539
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,299
Take a selfie and upload it onto your profile.

540
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:45,766
If you like the person, you can DM them.

541
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:48,399
If you connect well, you meet in person.

542
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,031
Do people meet like that nowadays?

543
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:52,132
Totally.

544
00:29:52,132 --> 00:29:56,067
Once you sign up, you get so many DMs.

545
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:58,166
Really?

546
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,399
How about you sign up on the app

547
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,466
to cover the story?

548
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,799
- Me? 
 - Then should I do it at this age?

549
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,798
- Go get my wife's permission. Then I'll do it. 
 - What?

550
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:14,566
It's so you'll write a story based on experience, and not superficially, okay?

551
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:17,900
You never know. You might find a good story as well as a man.

552
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,132
No.

553
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:23,132
I'm busy with the feature story. Give it to Editor Nam.

554
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:25,365
Look at his state and say that.

555
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,799
He should get less work.

556
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,366
That's why he should do it.

557
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:34,566
You never know. He might get a good woman as he writes a good story.

558
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,699
Then he'll liven up.

559
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:37,998
Yeah?

560
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:39,866
You have a point.

561
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,633
Should I give it to him?

562
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:51,031
 So please stop thinking only about yourself and care about others as well!

563
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:55,400
I deserve to get badmouthed.

564
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,032
That was a terrible mistake.

565
00:30:58,032 --> 00:31:01,966
 Was I that uninterested in others?

566
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:04,099
 I didn't know anything about them.

567
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,700
 And they're my staff.

568
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:12,233
What are you looking at?

569
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,666
Nothing.

570
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:15,566
What's up?

571
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,299
I'm going to buy a place.

572
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,598
Can you look into it for me?

573
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:21,033
Oh? What's gotten into you?

574
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,566
You didn't budge when I told you to.

575
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:26,966
There's someone I want to invite to my place.

576
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:30,164
Is it the girl you're going to ask out?

577
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:31,431
Yes.

578
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,032
So please look into it for me. A nice one.

579
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:36,965
I don't know who she is, but she's amazing.

580
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:39,931
Seeing how she changed your mind like this.

581
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,899
Yes, she's amazing.

582
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,500
Wow.

583
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:53,867
How's it going?

584
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:56,598
Are you getting DMs from women like crazy?

585
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,132
His phone must be on fire.

586
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,198
What? Why is he like that?

587
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:10,799
Well... He hasn't gotten a single DM.

588
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,666
- Not a single one? 
 - Why?

589
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,866
You said once you sign up, you get DMs like crazy.

590
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:16,400
Your battery must've died.

591
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:18,566
It's 100%. Fully charged.

592
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,866
Maybe there's no Wi-Fi.

593
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:22,866
All the bars are up.

594
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:28,165
Maybe your profile pic is a bad one.

595
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,632
You should've touched it up.

596
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:31,598
I touched it up a whole lot.

597
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,399
I see.

598
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:34,932
Okay.

599
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:37,699
Let's put up his subscription shot.

600
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:39,431
It's better than a face.

601
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:42,199
Appeal to people that you're competent.

602
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,033
It's okay.

603
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,632
He got a DM!

604
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,499
Well!

605
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,765
Her ID is Cute Girl.

606
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:04,433
Her ID gives off a good vibe.

607
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:09,367
Like the fate you feel at the first encounter,

608
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,699
aim for the best betting rate.

609
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:12,999
The safest overseas playground.

610
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,632
Scam-free website, Sports Tongtong.

611
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,698
Stop reading.

612
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:17,967
Okay.

613
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,166
Are you okay?

614
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:31,466
I think it will be best

615
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:37,966
for someone else to cover this story.

616
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:40,330
Hey, hey, hey.

617
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,899
This is a disaster!

618
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,998
I told you to take the story.

619
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:48,799
Why make things worse by making him do it?

620
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,264
I didn't know this would happen.

621
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:52,001
It's up to you to make him feel better.

622
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:54,899
- Okay? 
 - Okay, okay.

623
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,467
Darn it!

624
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,040

625
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,765
Editor Na. You still didn't send the article?

626
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:14,132
Digital Team is badgering me for it.

627
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:17,198
Something just doesn't feel right.

628
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:19,765
Stop saying that.

629
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:22,898
Your livelihood is at stake here.

630
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,065
I have a lot on my mind because of Editor Nam. Don't add to my troubles.

631
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,431
I'm sorry.

632
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:32,099
But if this article is published, I think it will cause us trouble one day.

633
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,699
You're the one causing trouble right now.

634
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,032
 - This is a disaster!  
 - What is?

635
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,100
What's this?

636
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,232
 Ouch, ouch! Let go!

637
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:53,733
 Ouch!

638
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:58,260
 - Hey! Let go of me! 
 - You let go first!

639
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,532
He'll go bald if she keeps it up.

640
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,766
They truly are a power couple.

641
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:06,765
Powerful enough to rip each other's heads off.

642
00:35:06,765 --> 00:35:08,099
What is all this?

643
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,531
They were so sweet on TV.

644
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:13,700
I know. They shot a lot of commercials together.

645
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,766
So that's why they'd been putting up a front.

646
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:22,732
They would've had to pay a penalty for breach of contract and be fired from shows.

647
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:25,167
Is this why you said something didn't feel right?

648
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,432
Did you read this vibe?

649
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:28,065
Yes.

650
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,432
Amazing.

651
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:30,898
How did you know?

652
00:35:30,899 --> 00:35:34,132
The photo team said they were so lovey-dovey they almost got jealous.

653
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:40,033
Well... Those two didn't seem like they lived together.

654
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,566
What?

655
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:45,999
 It's okay. I'll clean it up.

656
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,100
 - Go on ahead. 
 - Thank you.

657
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:54,265
 All the mail was for the woman.

658
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,265
 Not a single one for the man.

659
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:58,565
 - I'll get a glass of water. 
 - Okay.

660
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:00,499
 Hurry back.

661
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,064
 He said he did all the housework.

662
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:14,165
 But he couldn't even find a cup.

663
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,032
 What's more...

664
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,732
 Mainly only his things were new.

665
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,998
Like they set them up in a hurry.

666
00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:35,132
- It felt like he didn't live there. 
 - Wow.

667
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:37,064
I understand. Okay.

668
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:39,166
Thank you. Bye.

669
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:42,866
The sponsor asked me not to publish the article.

670
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,699
Wow.

671
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:46,698
It's good we didn't do a promo first.

672
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:49,666
Indeed. Thanks, Editor Na.

673
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,932
You saved us.

674
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:53,833
Don't mention it.

675
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,699
But they will probably

676
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:07,398
meet someone new soon.

677
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:12,966
They won't feel the misery of not being noticed.

678
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,766
Right?

679
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:19,200
Jeez.

680
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,032
- Here's the material. 
 - Yes.

681
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,765
Let me know if there's anything missing.

682
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,467
Okay.

683
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:40,132
Oh. And Mi Ra will help with the shoot tomorrow.

684
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,065
What? Why?

685
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:44,232
She asked me to switch.

686
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:45,667
What?

687
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:51,967
Seriously. She's being so obvious.

688
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:55,732
Why change the schedule?

689
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,399
I can tell what her intention is.

690
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,931
Intention?

691
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:01,165
Don't act like you don't know.

692
00:38:01,165 --> 00:38:03,799
I'm sure Mi Ra told you. You two are close.

693
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:06,099
Yeah, sure.

694
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:07,531
But how did you know?

695
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:08,898
How can I not know?

696
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:11,232
- She's so obvious about it. 
 - I guess.

697
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:14,166
So what did she fall for?

698
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,033
Good looks.

699
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:19,833
I knew it. And?

700
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,231
Attractive dimples.

701
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:23,832
Dimples?

702
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:26,666
- Do I have dimples? 
 - What?

703
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,065
Oh, I do.

704
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:32,064
How did she see this tiny detail?

705
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:34,299
What are you...

706
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,365
Seriously. I'm stumped.

707
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:39,232
Why did she have to go and like me?

708
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:42,799
I should save her from her misery and date her.

709
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,865
- No... 
 - Oh, no, no.

710
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:48,166
I should think about it a bit more.

711
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,000
Pretend you don't know.

712
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,565
Hi, Gyeom.

713
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,334
Okay. I'm heading out now.

714
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,833
What a weirdo.

715
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,334
Such a weirdo.

716
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:09,799
Cheer up.

717
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,632
The women on the app are blind.

718
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:15,031
You're a great guy.

719
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:17,132
- Unbelievable. 
 - What?

720
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:19,265
Why are you complimenting me?

721
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:20,798
I don't want your pity.

722
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:25,065
I'm being sincere. You really are a great guy.

723
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:26,566
Looks?

724
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:28,731
- You're attractive in your own way. 
 - Oh?

725
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:31,499
Height? You're tall enough.

726
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:34,698
Personality? It's good enough.

727
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:35,966
What's up with you?

728
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,332
That's not all.

729
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:40,732
As Chief Editor said, you own an apartment.

730
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,798
You're the perfect guy.

731
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,499
Who else has all of that in this day and age?

732
00:39:47,232 --> 00:39:49,066
- You really think so? 
 - Of course.

733
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:53,532
You'll meet a woman much better than Cutie Pie.

734
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:56,666
Have confidence. You can do it!

735
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,732
Come on. You can do it!

736
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,199
I... can do it.

737
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,390
Okay.

738
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:17,765
You didn't have to drive me home.

739
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:20,532
You must've waited for a long time.

740
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:23,898
Today's cover fell through, so I had to find a new item.

741
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,334
I heard about the interview.

742
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:30,432
How did you know that about them when you had just met them?

743
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:35,398
I don't even know the people I've worked with for a long time.

744
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,732
They say a home reflects its owner.

745
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:41,433
What?

746
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:45,200
If you see how a person lives at home,

747
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,020
you can tell what kind of person they are.

748
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,965
 Want to meet at the convenience store?

749
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,599
 Get a 1+1 item?

750
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,899
Is she busy?

751
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,280
She's not even checking her texts.

752
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:12,166
Hey.

753
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:16,898
I brought a cheat code that will help make her say yes to you.

754
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:17,800
Cheat code?

755
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes.

756
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,160
Here.

757
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,765
Why did you bring this?

758
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:28,198
You bought it for her anyway.

759
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:29,599
If you give it to her when you ask her out,

760
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,965
she'll know how long you've liked her

761
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:36,400
and how sincere your feelings are.

762
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,899
You're grateful, right?

763
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:43,000
Then go make instant noodles. I'm hungry.

764
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:49,499
Why I ought to...

765
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:50,965
I'm putting in kimchi.

766
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:52,766
Deal.

767
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:54,031
Let's go.

768
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:57,231
How can you not know you don't have

769
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,365
any instant noodles?

770
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:01,167
What about instant rice?

771
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:05,399
Oh, I forgot.

772
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:09,499
How can you buy instant noodles without instant rice?

773
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:10,665
Wait here.

774
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:13,170
Hurry up. It's cold.

775
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:25,200
Oh? Hyung?

776
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:30,332
What?

777
00:42:30,332 --> 00:42:32,360
Editor Na?

778
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,232
Let's go.

779
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:53,250
What are you doing?

780
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,932
Gye-Gyeom!

781
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:12,599
Hey.

782
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,898
Are you all right?

783
00:43:14,898 --> 00:43:16,931
How can you get so wasted on such little alcohol?

784
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:20,331
Don't worry about me and go.

785
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,900
What?

786
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:26,266
Are you okay?

787
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,066
Just leave now.

788
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,810
I'm fine.

789
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,267
Sure you're fine.

790
00:43:37,899 --> 00:43:40,866
How can I leave when you're like this?

791
00:43:40,866 --> 00:43:42,590
Look at me.

792
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,165
This won't do.

793
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:49,720
I'll go get some medicine. Wait here.

794
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,232
Take some.

795
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:16,299
Hey, Yeo Ui Joo.

796
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:17,099
What?

797
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,867
Why are you being so nice to me?

798
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:21,899
So you'll cheer up...

799
00:44:21,899 --> 00:44:23,232
Do you like me?

800
00:44:23,232 --> 00:44:26,033
I mean, did you decide to like me?

801
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:26,835
What?

802
00:44:26,835 --> 00:44:28,833
That's why you're being nice.

803
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:29,766
Right?

804
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:34,799
 I'll get back at him by dating a much better guy.

805
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,698
Isn't the much better guy

806
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:40,600
me?

807
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:41,566
What?

808
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:42,632
Are you mad?

809
00:44:42,632 --> 00:44:44,798
You said it.

810
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:46,565
 You really are a great guy.

811
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:47,732
 You own an apartment.

812
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:49,864
 You're the perfect guy who even works hard.

813
00:44:49,864 --> 00:44:52,799
Of course, I understand.

814
00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:56,631
You want to meet a guy with an apartment

815
00:44:56,631 --> 00:45:00,432
to tell your ex you're better off, that you're happy.

816
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,733
You want to get back at him.

817
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,831
But what did I do wrong?

818
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:06,966
What did my apartment do wrong?

819
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:07,899
Shut up.

820
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:09,599
How can I?

821
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,733
I'm sorry,

822
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:14,165
but I won't be used for your revenge.

823
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:15,798
Say one more word...

824
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:19,340
There's no way. Get real!

825
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,680
Seriously!

826
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,630
Give it here.

827
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:06,370
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

828
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,834
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

829
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:13,632
â™ª Happy birthday, dear CEO Yoo â™ª

830
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:20,790
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

831
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,032
Happy birthday!

832
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,066
Thank you.

833
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,598
You'll calmly buy dinner, right?

834
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:29,732
Let's go for drinks later...

835
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:30,999
I have other plans.

836
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:31,999
Then what about lunch?

837
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:34,133
I have a meeting.

838
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,933
I see.

839
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,366
That rude bastard.

840
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:40,998
We congratulate him, and he says, "I have other plans."

841
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,298
Good for you.

842
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:43,799
Like I don't have other plans.

843
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:44,999
We should've pretended not to know.

844
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:47,367
Who suggested we do the cake and song?

845
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:48,499
You did.

846
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:50,033
Darn it.

847
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,966
I should've bought #1, not #2.

848
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:55,250
Why did I buy the one that's more expensive?

849
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:01,499
I'm worried about CEO Yoo.

850
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:03,065
I don't think he'll ever date.

851
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:07,750
Who would like that selfish bastard?

852
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,031
 Thank you for congratulating me on my birthday.

853
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:32,331
 I can't eat with you because of other plans,

854
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:35,499
 but I'd like to thank you for your kindness.

855
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,698
 I thought you'd endure the inconveniences,

856
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:39,831
 thinking your apartment will be reconstructed.

857
00:47:39,831 --> 00:47:44,030
 So I hope you can live comfortably while you're there.

858
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,799
Crazy bastard. Crazy bastard.

859
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:56,900
I was delirious.

860
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:03,299
I must've been crazy.

861
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:04,566
What's this?

862
00:48:04,566 --> 00:48:07,265
A hotel room gift card...?

863
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:08,999
 I thought you'd want some time

864
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:12,930
 to yourself since you live with your parents.

865
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,133
 I thought you'd be most worried about security since you live by yourself.

866
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:28,165
 It must be hard living on your own.

867
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:31,590
 I hope this helps in buying daily necessities.

868
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:37,665
I'm not the only one who got a gift from CEO Yoo, right?

869
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,867
- Right. 
 - Right.

870
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:41,799
We gave him a puny cake,

871
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:43,833
but he gave so much in return.

872
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:44,534
I know.

873
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:47,132
He gave me exactly what I needed.

874
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,265
- You, too? 
 - Yes.

875
00:48:48,265 --> 00:48:49,399
Me, too.

876
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:51,566
- Me, too. 
 - Me, too.

877
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:54,632
I guess he secretly does care about us.

878
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:55,998
Yes.

879
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,065
I thought he was a selfish man,

880
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:02,370
but he really did care about us.

881
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,934
I got this.

882
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:07,432
Awesome. Hotel superior room.

883
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:08,567
I got interior design.

884
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:11,390
You must feel good.

885
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,999
Everyone's praising your boyfriend.

886
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:26,065
I told you.

887
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:28,431
He's not selfish.

888
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:29,200
You were right.

889
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,931
I didn't know he cared so much about others.

890
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:35,300
Right?

891
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,799
Are you that happy?

892
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:41,766
Actually, CEO Yoo must like you a lot.

893
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:43,733
He makes such an effort for you.

894
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:44,732
What?

895
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,366
Never mind.

896
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:48,800
Never mind.

897
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,760
What is it?

898
00:49:55,532 --> 00:49:57,966
What do you want to tell me?

899
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,566
What is it?

900
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:10,165
Happy birthday.

901
00:50:10,932 --> 00:50:14,031
Here's your gift.

902
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:17,032
Thank you.

903
00:50:17,032 --> 00:50:20,666
I can suggest a few homes that you might like, so let's go take a look together.

904
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,131
Right.

905
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:23,199
I'm sorry.

906
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:24,598
I changed my mind.

907
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:25,500
I'm not going to buy a place.

908
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,065
Why not?

909
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,899
You said there's a girl you want to invite.

910
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:30,960
You said you'll tell her how you feel.

911
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:34,000
I decided not to.

912
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,331
I'm going to stop liking her.

913
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:37,031
So suddenly? Why?

914
00:50:37,031 --> 00:50:39,899
I thought hard about it.

915
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:42,599
There's not enough time to take photos while camping.

916
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,600
I don't feel it's the right time to start dating.

917
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,799
So I'm going to stop liking her.

918
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:50,365
Was that the extent of your crush?

919
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:52,733
And you made such a fuss about it?

920
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:56,365
Then you didn't like her that much!

921
00:50:56,365 --> 00:50:58,333
I think so.

922
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,360

923
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,232
I guess Editor Na Zero Won has a work-related question.

924
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,132
Excuse me.

925
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,532
Sure.

926
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,534
Hello, Editor Na?

927
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,566
Yes.

928
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,533
Are you okay?

929
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:37,233
About what?

930
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:38,665
You're something else.

931
00:51:38,665 --> 00:51:41,198
How could you get him a birthday gift in this situation?

932
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,132
I would've hated his guts.

933
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:45,133
Forget it.

934
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:46,832
Are you really okay?

935
00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:48,632
I said I was.

936
00:51:48,632 --> 00:51:49,932
Don't worry about it.

937
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:52,365
Don't make a big deal out of it.

938
00:51:52,365 --> 00:51:54,000
All right.

939
00:51:55,965 --> 00:52:00,100
But are you really going to give up on her?

940
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:05,433
This is the first time I've seen Hyung

941
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:08,567
in love and happy.

942
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:10,799
I want to protect that.

943
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:24,498
 I'm sorry.

944
00:52:24,498 --> 00:52:27,198
 I'm heading out because I have urgent business.

945
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:29,700
 I think I'll be late.

946
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,033
 Really? How late?

947
00:52:36,734 --> 00:52:38,065
 I don't know.

948
00:52:38,065 --> 00:52:40,432
 I'll go home from there.

949
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:42,665
 Will you wait for me at home?

950
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:45,667
 I'm sorry to do this today.

951
00:52:46,299 --> 00:52:49,632
 It's okay. See you later.

952
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,666
It's my birthday.

953
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,766
Should I make someone else do the job?

954
00:52:55,766 --> 00:52:59,165
Stop. I'm being selfish again.

955
00:52:59,165 --> 00:53:00,266
Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung,

956
00:53:00,266 --> 00:53:03,390
you decided to care about others.

957
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,310
â™«  You make me  â™«

958
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,940
â™«  Much better when youâ€™re here  â™«

959
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,470
â™«  Iâ€™m lucky  â™«

960
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,070
 Ja-sung.

961
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:40,060
â™«  Every little move you do  â™«

962
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,100
 This is your gift. Surprise!

963
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,733
 I'll make this the happiest birthday you've had.

964
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:48,566
 Hope you're excited.

965
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:51,266
 Thank you for being born, Ja Sung.

966
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:53,050
 I love you.

967
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:57,330
â™«  If I could always be like...  â™«

968
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,400

969
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,765
When did you do all this?

970
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:19,390
Make a wish and blow out the candle.

971
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,266
Happy birthday!

972
00:54:43,266 --> 00:54:45,032
 What is specialty backwards?

973
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,466
 Admirable?

974
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:48,665
 It's admirable that you have a dream,

975
00:54:48,665 --> 00:54:53,733
 and that you're brave enough to follow it.

976
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:58,132
 Your drive to challenge yourself is fantastic.

977
00:54:58,132 --> 00:55:00,065
 Honestly, I'm kind of envious.

978
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,532
 I'm so grateful.

979
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,299
 Huh? What for?

980
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:06,767
 To have a partner like you.

981
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:10,300
 If I were alone, I'd have been lonely.

982
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,033
 You're great help.

983
00:55:14,867 --> 00:55:20,232
 So you want to be around them and see them all the time?

984
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:24,430
 Yeah, there is someone like that.

985
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:56,600
Everyone was so happy because

986
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,732
you gave them what they really needed.

987
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,998
I'm glad.

988
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:05,399
You said you didn't know the people you worked with,

989
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:07,831
but how did you get them those gifts?

990
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,066
They were things that showed you knew them.

991
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:13,332
It was all thanks to you.

992
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:14,733
What?

993
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:20,032
You told me that a home reflects its owner.

994
00:56:20,032 --> 00:56:21,966
Thank you.

995
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:25,565
No. Thank you.

996
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:28,065
Everyone complimented you.

997
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:30,966
I was so proud of you.

998
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:36,065
I'll become a boyfriend you can always be proud of.

999
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:39,450
I'm more than proud of you already.

1000
00:56:52,766 --> 00:56:54,632
What brings you here so late, Secretary Hwang?

1001
00:56:54,632 --> 00:56:57,232
 CEO Kim sent you a birthday gift.

1002
00:56:57,232 --> 00:56:58,399
 I'll bring it up to you.

1003
00:56:58,399 --> 00:56:59,799
-  If you'd open the doorâ€”  
 - Stop!

1004
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:02,280
I'll come down.

1005
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:06,998
Why did he have to come now?

1006
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:08,532
I'll be right back.

1007
00:57:08,532 --> 00:57:10,270
Okay.

1008
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:22,180
 A home reflects its owner.

1009
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,020

1010
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:34,790
â™«  Itâ€™s especially quiet in my room today  â™«

1011
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:41,670
â™«  Feels like itâ€™s embracing me  â™«

1012
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,830
â™«  Things didnâ€™t go  â™«

1013
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,332
 A person who lays their hope in the future instead of the present.

1014
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:47,399
 Sang Soon;

1015
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:49,132
 listen to your mother.

1016
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,799
 You must get married.

1017
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:55,199
 Beg for forgiveness and get her back.

1018
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,520

1019
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,200
â™«  When I try to act like Iâ€™m OK and smile  â™«

1020
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,250
 A person who can't really be themselves at home.

1021
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:10,560
â™«  Feels like tomorrow will be better  â™«

1022
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,150

1023
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:14,960
â™«  Just like  â™«

1024
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,150
Not bad.

1025
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,110
â™«  the many dreams  â™«

1026
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:27,230
 How about you buy a place? I'll pay for it.

1027
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:33,832
 Or a person who has a secret.

1028
00:58:33,832 --> 00:58:35,065
 Today,

1029
00:58:35,065 --> 00:58:38,750
 I was invited to the home of a warm-hearted person.

1030
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,630
â™«  For a tomorrow thatâ€™ll be different from today  â™«

1031
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,633
 The place is filled with his warmth

1032
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:49,899
 and I'm happy.

1033
00:58:49,899 --> 00:58:54,300
 I hope he was happy today more than any other day.

1034
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:59,610
 Because you deserve to be happy on your birthday.

1035
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:09,131
Hello, Chan.

1036
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:11,032
What's up?

1037
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:14,630
What?

1038
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:17,320

1039
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:25,300
What happened?

1040
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,332
Well...

1041
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:30,033
He drank alone, then got in an accident while crossing the street.

1042
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,166
What? Alone?

1043
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:35,034
He said he was okay.

1044
00:59:35,034 --> 00:59:37,532
But it must've been hard for him.

1045
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:41,600
What are you talking about?

1046
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,967
 Gyeom has liked Editor Na

1047
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,000
 for a long time.

1048
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,232
 I have a reason to be in Seoul a little longer.

1049
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,232
 There's someone that I like.

1050
01:00:04,232 --> 01:00:08,399
 I didn't know I'd like someone so much like this.

1051
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:10,365
 So I'm going to tell her.

1052
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:12,750
 This weekend.

1053
01:00:14,566 --> 01:00:18,766
 But last night, he found out

1054
01:00:18,766 --> 01:00:21,890
 that you like Editor Na, too.

1055
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:25,432
 I decided not to.

1056
01:00:25,432 --> 01:00:27,367
 I'm going to stop liking her.

1057
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:30,132
 Was that the extent of your crush?

1058
01:00:30,132 --> 01:00:32,532
 And you made such a fuss about it?

1059
01:00:32,532 --> 01:00:36,132
 Then you didn't like her that much!

1060
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,032
 I think so.

1061
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:00,432
 Thanks to your thoughtful gift,

1062
01:01:00,432 --> 01:01:02,532
 my home is filled with laughter.

1063
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:06,031
 I'm so touched by how much you care about me.

1064
01:01:06,031 --> 01:01:09,733
 I didn't know you cared about others this much.

1065
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:12,566
 You're a very good person, sir.

1066
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:15,730
 Totally agree. Thank you.

1067
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,260

1068
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,866
What's going on?

1069
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:36,620
Is his talk with Secretary Hwang getting longer?

1070
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:47,780
â™«  The fights and the scars repeat for the same reason  â™«

1071
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,780

1072
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:56,180
â™«  I was so afraid of saying goodbye  â™«

1073
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:01,440
â™«  That I acted like I was fine  â™«

1074
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:09,480
â™«  Iâ€™m so lonely and you were my only light  â™«

1075
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:17,190
â™«  But why arenâ€™t you next to me? 
 Why are you leaving me alone?  â™«

1076
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:24,370
â™«  Why are you relying on my deepened faith  â™«

1077
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:29,590
â™«  To give endless excuses?  â™«

1078
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:37,580
â™«  I want to leave everything behind and go next to you  â™«

1079
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:43,720
â™«  Because I think I can forget all the painful times  â™«

1080
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:51,390
â™«  Iâ€™m looking for you like this  â™«

1081
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,800

~ Preview ~

1082
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,433
 Let's break up.

1083
01:02:57,433 --> 01:03:00,266
 I no longer want to waste time and emotions.

1084
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:03,099
 That's the worst thing I've heard someone say in a break up.

1085
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:06,999
 Don't you go crying to him and being clingy.

1086
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:07,867
 Is it true?

1087
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,498
 That you dated and broke up with Editor Na?

1088
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:11,899
 If you were going to hurt her, why did you date her?

1089
01:03:11,899 --> 01:03:13,698
 Mi Ra, you win.

1090
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,099
 Let's officially go on a date.

1091
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:17,864
 Thank you for inviting me.

1092
01:03:17,864 --> 01:03:20,532
 They're doing their best to cheer me up.

1093
01:03:20,532 --> 01:03:22,199
 I should make an effort.

1094
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:24,410
 I can get over him.

1095
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:32,990
