1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,420

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,120

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,950

4
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,750

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,380

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,520

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,370

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,310

9
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,180

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,029

11
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:04,829

12
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,529

13
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:12,090
 For the past three years, the monthly average income increase of Korea's workers was

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,610
 ₩151,000 ($151).

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,630
 Then the price of the houses?

16
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,850

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,490

18
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,100

19
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,680
 No matter how hard you work,

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,800
 it will never trump capital gains on real estate.

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,690

22
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,040

23
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,950

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,530

25
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,449
Buy up all the unsold homes.

26
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:29,820
 To me, a house is something you buy low and sell high. In one word, house equals money.

27
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,679

28
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,200

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,940

30
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,819

31
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,691

32
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,971

33
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,760

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,889
Sir,

35
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:55,350
you already knew about the favorable factors, right?

36
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,620
The prices are up three-fold compared to when it was bought three years ago.

37
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,349
Yes?

38
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,090
What happened to the forcible execution?

39
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,990
Pardon?

40
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,189
 I can't leave! I won't vacate this house!

41
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,040
Ahjussi! It's still being discussed. 
  (T/N: Ahjussi - Sir, polite way of calling older man)

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,519
Stop touching things.

43
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,199
Excuse me! Ahjussi!

44
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,269
You can't do that!

45
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,200
You'll break that!

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,620
Hold on! Wait! Wait!

48
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,420
Oh, no, my bedding!

49
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,300
No! Get out!

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,570
Hey!

51
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,510
Ahjusshi!

52
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,050
I said I'm not leaving!

53
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,510
Why are you doing this?

54
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,729
Look. We already informed you we'd force you out if you didn't leave.

55
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,989
You never even answered your phone.

56
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,310
I told you I was on a business trip abroad!

57
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,229
I got robbed there,

58
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,040
so I lost my phone. I told you earlier!

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,150
Right, but that's your problem.

60
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,040
We're doing this legally.

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,950
Pleaes move.

62
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,739
What are you doing?

63
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,820
- Move. 
 - No, no, no!

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,320
Wait, wait, wait!

65
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,810
No, no, no!

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,330
Just wait. Don't go. Wait.

67
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,330
- Don't go. Don't go. 
 - What are you doing?

68
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,690
- I really have nowhere else to go! 
 - Stop!

69
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,250
- Over here. A plate of boiled pork slices too, please. 
 - Okay.

70
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,379
You don't have to.

71
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,919
You said you haven't eaten today.

72
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,749
Don't worry and eat.

73
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,200
Thank you.

74
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,889
Will you really postpone the execution?

75
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,669
Yes, well, after we trade opinions...

76
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,529
Thank you!

77
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,900
Thank you so much!

78
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,680
Why did you rent a house with a huge mortgage?

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,169
It can be auctioned off, like this.

80
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,630
I don't know much about real estate. I fell for the cheap rent.

81
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,070
Is there no way to get my deposit back?

82
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,950
The landlord has vanished, and I can't reach him.

83
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,520
Is that so?

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,030
On top of that, I lost my job.

85
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,909
I was working for a magazine.

86
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,590
Then I was told it would be discontinued when I got back from my business trip.

87
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,130
Oh, that's too bad.

88
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,699
This brings me to the next question.

89
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,870
Can you give me some time until I get a job and a new place?

90
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,229
I heard you also bought the building next to mine.

91
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,509
You must be very capable.

92
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,880
Couldn't you give me more time under the circumstances?

93
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,139
Your pork slices.

94
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,580
First, go ahead and eat.

95
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,340
Thank you.

96
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,590
Stop!

97
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,369
Let's get up.

98
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,360
Right now?

99
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,469
I knew you'd understand the moment I met you. You have that air about you.

100
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,709
Thank you.

101
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,780
Good work, everyone.

102
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,719
What? That's my stuff.

103
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:51,570
Why is it all out here...?

104
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,949
The eviction execution process is complete. Get in. 
  (T/N: Eviction execution - forced eviction of a tenant)

105
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,549
What? How can you do this?

106
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:00,929
You said you'd postpone it!

107
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,889
Me? No way.

108
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,080
I said we' would trade opinions.

109
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,269
Of course, my opinion was "no" from the start.

110
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:09,389
What?

111
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,470
And what you ate is what you'll get instead of moving costs.

112
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,439
Moving costs?

113
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,350
Then I'll get going.

114
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,030
Stop!

115
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,860
Stop right there, you bastard!

116
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,760
Hey!

117
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,470
- You! 
 - Stop!

118
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,390
Please stop!

119
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,920
You're horrible!

120
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,800
You blood-sucking dirtbag!

121
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,960
You're skinning a flea for its hide!

122
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,290
You should've told me from the start!

123
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,140
You bought me pork slices and pretended to be nice!

124
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,840
Excuse me! Where to?

125
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,950
Beats me.

126
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,160
Where should I go?

127
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,030
Where can I go?

128
00:08:51,030 --> 00:09:00,760

129
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,780
Come along. We're almost there.

130
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,410
You're tired, right? Come on.

131
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,570
Come inside.

132
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,170
Take a look around.

133
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,029
What do you think? Better than expected, right?

134
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,509
It's ₩200,000 ($200) with no security deposit.

135
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,369
There's no other place that's cheaper than the study dorms.

136
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,509
Hurry and unpack.

137
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,560
I'll be going now.

138
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,380
Hi, Mom.

139
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,119
How was your business trip?

140
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,710
Are you back?

141
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,740
Why didn't you call? I was worried.

142
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,410
Sorry.

143
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,249
I slept all day because of jet lag.

144
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,849
 I see.

145
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:13,440
How's business going? You said your knees hurt.

146
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,450
 Have you been to the hospital?

147
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,550
Don't worry about me and take care of yourself.

148
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,920
Come to think of it, you already look after yourself well,

149
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,610
so I have no worries.

150
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,020
Of course! You raised me well.

151
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,540
Okay.

152
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,940
I'll try to visit soon.

153
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,010
Bye.

154
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,920
That's right.

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,870
I can look after myself well.

156
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,890
Don't quit now, Na Young Won.

157
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,610
♫  I like the bright mornings. You like 
 the starry nights  ♫

158
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,390
♫  We’re so different  ♫

159
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,630
♫  Like putting one ice cube in an americano  ♫

160
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,680
♫  Our first encounter was lukewarm  ♫

161
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,220
♫  We’re so different. Let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

162
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,550
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

163
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,480
♫  You seem so uptight  ♫

164
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,039

165
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,070

166
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,480

167
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,400

168
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,990

169
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,750

170
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,720

171
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,869

172
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,380

173
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,990
Hello?

174
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,540
So, this is the place.

175
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,860

176
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,060
Hey, Young Won!

177
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,759
It's been so long!

178
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,209
I know!

179
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:25,440
Thank you for contacting me, Sunbae. 
  (T/N: Sunbae - informal way to call a senior)

180
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,279
I'm so nervous.

181
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,909
I hope I do well in the interview.

182
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,059
Don't worry.

183
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,249
You're fit for the job. That's why I recommended you.

184
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:35,220
What? Really?

185
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,930
This is my portfolio...

186
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,130
You're in!

187
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,520
You didn't even take a look...

188
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,250
I'm sure it's excellent. You have ten years of experience.

189
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,500
I trust you. The job's yours.

190
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,780
Really?

191
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,220
Congratulations.

192
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,940
Thank you.

193
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,230
You're grateful, right?

194
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,670
Yes.

195
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,839
Of course, you are. You should be grateful.

196
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,129
Since your magazine got discontinued,

197
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,040
and your life almost got discontinued too, but I saved you.

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,790
So buy me a drink.

199
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,839
What? Oh, okay, I'll buy you a drink.

200
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,559
Since you're one of us now, I can be more casual, right?

201
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,069
- Of course. 
 - Okay.

202
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:22,350
I'll introduce you to everyone.

203
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,085
Editor Yeo recommended you, so you probably know her already.

204
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:32,679
I'm going to write about Chamele-zone this time.

205
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,539

206
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:37,379

207
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,149
Oh! Chamele-zone!

208
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:41,519
That guy is Editor Nam Sang Soon.

209
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,520
Sounds great.

210
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,859

211
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:48,029

212
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,309
The house I'll cover is in Daechi-dong.

213
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:52,289
Since you mentioned Daechi-dong...

214
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:56,399
My cutie pie teaches at a sought-after private academy there.

215
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,069
Cutie pie this and cutie pie that! I'm sick of it!

216
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:04,069
Anyway, those two are assistants.

217
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,589

218
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:08,929

219
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,609
I'll reintroduce myself officially.

220
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:14,819
I'm the chief editor. My name is Choi Go. 
  (T/N: sounds like "the best")

221
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,149
My personality is also the best!

222
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,149

223
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:23,420

224
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,669
It's Day One. You're too relaxed.

225
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,720
I'm sorry, Sir.

226
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,410
I'm joking.

227
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,789
Here. This is your desk.

228
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:46,439
Thank you.

229
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,919
You can speak casually to me.

230
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,020
You were born in '86, and I was born in '94, so you're older than me.

231
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,699
How do you know her age?

232
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,590
I read it in her "Single Household Living" series.

233
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,739
Actually, I'm an avid fan of yours.

234
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:05,029
Really? Thank you so much.

235
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,599
Please speak casually to me.

236
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,740
Okay, then. I will.

237
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,710
Stop.

238
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,100
CEO Yoo! You're here.

239
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,299
- Why waste time on small talk during office hours? 
  - What? CEO?

240
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,139
It's not wasting time. We were getting acquainted.

241
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,839
This is the new editor I told you about. She passed the interview a moment ago.

242
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,610
Say hello. This is our CEO, Yoo Ja Sung.

243
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,420
Hello. I'm Na Young Won.

244
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,720
What? What did you say?

245
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,430
I guess she's nervous in front of you.

246
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,220
Her name is Na Young Won.

247
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,400
Na Young Won?

248
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,040
Yes.

249
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,280
She has ten years of experience, so she'll do great.

250
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,580
I'll have to see it to believe it.

251
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,290
Let's see if she does well or not.

252
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,070

253
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,499
I'm sure he's the bastard who kicked me out.

254
00:17:55,499 --> 00:18:00,550
If I had known, I wouldn't have thrown such a fit! Why does he have to be the CEO?

255
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,699
But why didn't he recognize me?

256
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,760
 Hey!

257
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,730
Right. How could he remember me with the way I looked that day?

258
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,039
It would be hard.

259
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,530
Young Won.

260
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,970
Thanks.

261
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,540
I heard you had a new CEO. That was him?

262
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,929
He looked young. How did he acquire the magazine?

263
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:29,609
He's the CEO of Jasung Real Estate Investment Company.

264
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,150
The real estate he has is worth tens of billions.

265
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,999
Tens of billions?

266
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,879
He must be from a rich family.

267
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,990
No, he made his own fortune.

268
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,000
I think he's a born money-maker.

269
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,379
Oh, right.

270
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:46,940
He also makes videos.

271
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,760
 Hello.

272
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,910
 I'm Gaeryong Yoo Ja Sung, CEO of Jasung Real Estate Investment Company.

273
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,309
You don't have to show me.

274
00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:00,220
Why did a CEO of a real estate investment company buy a magazine?

275
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,169
You'll find out soon enough.

276
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:02,849
What?

277
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,760
You're the CEO's exclusive editor.

278
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,459
Do you have eight townhouses here?

279
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:17,759
I'm going to sell them all and invest in something bigger.

280
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,479
I see.

281
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:22,059
So the purpose of your article is quite clear.

282
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,379
You have to make your readers want to buy this house.

283
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,039
An appealing article that makes you want to buy a house.

284
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,509
An article that makes money.

285
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,700
Cover the story with that in mind.

286
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:42,889
Wait.

287
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,299
Did he buy the magazine to sell houses?

288
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,820
And I'm writing the article?

289
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,629

290
00:19:55,629 --> 00:20:00,559
 Befitting the townhouse that pursues high yield, the floors are laid with the best marble from Italy.

291
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,380
 The windows, doors, and chandeliers

292
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:07,100
are European designer brands used in global hotel chains' penthouses.

293
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,500
I see.

294
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,300
Why aren't you writing this down?

295
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,100
Oh, right.

296
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 It's designed so the white tone and natural light match well.

297
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Awesome.

298
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
A movie theater at home?

299
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,200
A fully automatic system, the best audio equipment,

300
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,800
and perfect soundproofing.

301
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,800
It's comparable to a major movie theater.

302
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,000
Are you satisfied with this house?

303
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,700
Of course!

304
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,000
How did you find such a good house?

305
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I was doing a property survey nearby and stumbled upon this place.

306
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,100
Were you doing Kimjang near here? 
  (T/N: Kimjang means making kimchi)

307
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,300
Your mother's place must be nearby.

308
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,400
You are a very dutiful son.

309
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,900
It's great you came all the way here to do Kimjang.

310
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Not Kimjang. A property survey.

311
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,500

312
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,600
Oh! Property survey.

313
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,700
I'm sorry. I lack knowledge in real estate.

314
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,300
Include basic information in the article as well.

315
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,000
Lot area 600㎡. Convert it to "pyeong" and add that info.

316
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
Yes, Sir.

317
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,300

318
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,400
What have you been doing all these years at your age?

319
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
You don't even have basic knowledge of real estate.

320
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,900
Pardon?

321
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,000
Can't you convert ㎡ to "pyeong" instantly?

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,200
- You see— 
 - And Kimjang?

323
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,700
Why would I be talking about Kimjang?

324
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,100
I didn't have any interest in real estate, so...

325
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,300
I told you earlier, didn't I?

326
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,800
A captivating article that makes you want to buy a house.

327
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,400
You have to write an article that makes money! With your lack of knowledge,

328
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,500
how are you going to write such an article?!

329
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
I was thrown into this without time to prepare.

331
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,300
Study up on real estate and write the article well.

332
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,500
If it's bad, I'll fire you immediately.

333
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,000
Outrageous.

334
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm a magazine editor, not a real estate gossip editor.

335
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,800
How can I put my name on that kind of article?

336
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
That's why five people quit before you.

337
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,970
They couldn't work with the CEO.

338
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,541
What?

339
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,780
Word got around that he's a money-grubbing bastard,

340
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,310
so there aren't any editors willing to work with him anymore.

341
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,780
It got so bad, the chief editor said this.

342
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,110
 We don't need skills or character, but a hungry person.

343
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,790
 Someone so desperate for a job

344
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,020
 that they throw their pride as if it were garbage!

345
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,400
 Bring that person here.

346
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,800
 Now!

347
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,000
That's why he hired me without seeing my portfolio.

348
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,180
That's why I thought you were fit for the job.

349
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,580
You need money.

350
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,410
I'm not that desperate.

351
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,080
I have my pride as an editor.

352
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,620

353
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,850

354
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,360
I knew you'd still be sending money home.

355
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,200
How long has it been? It started with your first job.

356
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,500
Sunbae, you're really perceptive.

357
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,920
Throw their pride as if it were garbage...

358
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,180
That's me.

359
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,480
It's just a figure of speech...

360
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,420
Thanks for hooking me up.

361
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,700
That poor thing.

362
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,500

363
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,500

364
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,500

365
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,890
It's dropped a lot.

366
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,330
- Welcome, Sir. 
 - What is it?

367
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,800
What? All right.

368
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
Editor Na.

369
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,910
Yes?

370
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,011
Come with me.

371
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,510
Okay.

372
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,400
Wow, this is awesome.

373
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,930
What are you doing? Making another video?

374
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,730
Yeah. This is going to be great.

375
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,930
What? There's nothing hot here.

376
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,110
This is why you have less than ten subscribers.

377
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,780
I'm going to get a whole lot more with this one.

378
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,480
Whatever.

379
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,920
This is why I go camping.

380
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,700
What?

381
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,830
Ja Sung? How...

382
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,890
Did you call him?

383
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,260
Ready, action!

384
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,940
Stop right there, Shin Gyeom!

385
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,600
What's taking him so long?

386
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,050
How do you get a photographer here?

387
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,900
What did he say his name was?

388
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,600
Shin Gyeom?

389
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,200

390
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,840
 Super speedy!

391
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,410
Youngest to debut at the New York Studio.

392
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,470
He even won an award.

393
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,800
On the highway to success.

394
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,481
Seriously, Ja Sung!

395
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:50,850
So stop!

396
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,180
Guys, this is a real situation.

397
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,060
Sorry, sorry.

398
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,930
Hey!

399
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,330
What? I love this photo.

400
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
So he's the one who took this.

401
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,700
Editor Na! Editor Na!

402
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,750
- Get out of the way, please! 
 - Get him!

403
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,650
- I'm sorry. Please get out of the way. 
 - Get him!

404
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,940
- Out of my way, please. 
 - Get him!

405
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,300
- Move! 
- Stop!

406
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,840

407
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
Incredible.

408
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,210
A literal face stamp.

409
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,360
I didn't know that was possible.

410
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,100
Shut up.

411
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,180
Are you really okay?

412
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,780
Yes, I'm fine.

413
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Come on, Ja Sung.

414
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,630
Are you mad?

415
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,560
I was going to call you.

416
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,330
I got back early this morning, so I was a bit out of it.

417
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,670
You said you came back three days ago.

418
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,190
Shut up.

419
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,360
Stop.

420
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,140
You said you would work at the magazine the day you got back.

421
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,170
I know I said that,

422
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,010
but that pure white cloud led me here.

423
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,020
You said the GPS led you here.

424
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,340
I said shut up.

425
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Go on a photo shoot with Editor Na right now.

426
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,700
Goodbye, Sir!

427
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,560
Do you call yourself a friend? Huh?

428
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,960
Hey, hey.

429
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,370
Hey.

430
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,310
Wow.

431
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,610
You have great skills. No wonder you got recognition at an early age.

432
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,780
Oh, thank you.

433
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,580
Isn't your studio great?

434
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,490
It was gloomy, but Ja Sung fixed it up for you.

435
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,600
When did you hear that?

436
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,930
It must be good to have your friend as an assistant.

437
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,300
What's good about it? He's neither a friend nor an assistant.

438
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,970
He's Ja Sung's underling.

439
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,000
The photo selection is done, so I'll help you unpack.

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,150
♪ Floor area ratio, building-to-land ratio, 
 station district, security right ♪

441
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,150
♪ Appraised value, standard market price, 
 current price baseline... ♪

442
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,690
What kind of song is that?

443
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,200
Oh, it's something I have to memorize.

444
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,389
"What have you been doing all these years?"

445
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,300
"You don't even have basic knowledge of real estate."

446
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,870
Totally outrageous.

447
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,200
Ja Sung said that, right?

448
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,070
How did you know?

449
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,190
It's a pattern he uses when he nags. I know him well.

450
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,980
He was my tutor in high school.

451
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,060
Just like an older brother.

452
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:20,520
I see. An older brother... You won't tell him what I said, right?

453
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,330
Don't worry. I came here because of him, but I'd like a good rapport with the magazine staff.

454
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,059
They all seem really nice.

455
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,540
Yes. We're like a family that takes care of each other.

456
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,390

457
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,340
What are you doing?

458
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,399
What do you think? I can't write because of your typing!

459
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:45,210
What? Your clothes are more annoying.

460
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,650
Why do you wear long johns near every deadline?

461
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,290
They are not long johns but leggings pants. I'm wearing these to write comfortably. So what?

462
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,930
Is it all good if you're comfortable? What about my eyes?!

463
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm very uncomfortable!

464
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,570
Should I make you shut your uncomfortable eyes forever?

465
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,550
Are you done?!

466
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,990
Yes. I said what I wanted to say. Why? What?

467
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,350
You both, stop fighting. This is the office, not a fish market!

468
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,680
The deadline is just around the corner, and you're fighting?

469
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,149
Get back in your seats now!

470
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,390
Like a family that takes care of each other?

471
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,550
Before a deadline, it's like this everywhere.

472
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:32,030
What are you doing with Photographer Shin? Write!

473
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,230
I will. I will.

474
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,730
The archive is over there. Get what you need and go.

475
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,240
Seriously!

476
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,350
Prepare in advance!

477
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,850
Good job.

478
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,890
- Is it okay? 
 - Yes.

479
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,120
- It's good enough to post on your social media page. 
 - Pardon?

480
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,560
"It's a well-lit southward house anyone would want to live in."

481
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,959
No. That's not it.

482
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,610
The value is increasing, so it's a good house to invest in.

483
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,200
You need to emphasize that it's a house you want to buy, not live in!

484
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
Again.

485
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,100
It's near Shinbundang Subway Line, so the price will keep soaring.

486
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,400
Write something like that!

487
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,700
- Again! 
 - Yes, Sir.

488
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,200
Again! Again! Again!

489
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,000
Right, you do have skills.

490
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,100
- Skills to screw over your boss. 
 - Sir?

491
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,900
Is it so hard to emphasize it's a house you want to buy, not live in?

492
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,300
Did I give you an impossible mission?

493
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,400
No.

494
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,300
Stop wasting paper. Write something that makes money!

495
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,500
We made the deadline, but I feel so uneasy.

496
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah.

497
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,400
We're done, but what about Editor Na?

498
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,100
At this rate, she might quit, too.

499
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,400
Don't worry about that. She will never quit.

500
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,700
How do you know that?

501
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,200
Will you write what I dictate? Okay, let's see.

502
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,600
 It was when Young Won was an assistant.

503
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,700
 Wow!

504
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,200
 I'm going crazy.

505
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,300
 A model can't make it because she got in a car accident.

506
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,100
 What should we do?

507
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,500
 Oh, darn.

508
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,700
 The shape of your head is ridiculous.

509
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,600
 - You shouldn't cut your hair. 
 - Yes.

510
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 - Let's just use two models. 
 - Okay.

511
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,200
 Another day, there was a photoshoot on top of a mountain.

512
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,200
 - Okay? 
 - I'm okay. Don't worry...

513
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,900
 Not you! The scarf! It's quadruple your monthly salary!

514
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,400
 Oh, of course!

515
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,000
 Tada!

516
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,900
 I handled it more carefully than my own body.

517
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,600
 Since it's expensive.

518
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,300
 She put up with all that and became an editor.

519
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,200
 It wasn't easy, even after she became an editor.

520
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,500
 This is marble. It can't take the heat. It might crack.

521
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,400
 So don't ever put something hot on it.

522
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,400
 Hey, hey, hey!

523
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,100
 She did whatever it took to survive.

524
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,900
So she won't quit because of CEO Yoo's nagging.

525
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,100
Wow, that's incredible. How did she endure all that?

526
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,500
She's not hungry for nothing.

527
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,300
If my cutie pie worked like that,

528
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,200
- I'd make her quit... 
 - Yes, whatever.

529
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,400
Here she comes.

530
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,800

531
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,910
No wonder.

532
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,300
Of course, I'm using cuss words.

533
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,100
He threatens to fire me on my first day.

534
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,800
He makes me catch a guy.

535
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,600
He rejects my writing and throws a fit!

536
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,900
How can I not cuss him out?

537
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,200
- Are you still not done? 
 - I just have a little left.

538
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,600
It's a waste of time waiting any longer.

539
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,100
Wrap it up and leave it on my desk.

540
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,400
Okay. Sorry, Sir.

541
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,100
I want to leave a resignation letter instead.

542
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,000
He's gone, right?

543
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,400
Where's my wallet?

544
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,220
Why isn't it working?

545
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,610
What if he recognizes me?

546
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,800
What a waste of electricity!

547
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,689
What are you doing here?

548
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:12,029
I'm printing out my finished article.

549
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:13,829
Okay then. Let's take a look.

550
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:14,859
No, no.

551
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,569
Come to think of it, I need to make some changes.

552
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,300
I'll take a look and see where to change.

553
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,140
Time out.

554
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,539
I'll make the changes, then show it to you.

555
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,509
No, I'll see it first. Give it here.

556
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:28,709
I need to take a look at it first!

557
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,830
What are you...

558
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,690
What's with the get-up?

559
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,550
No way.

560
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,300
The pork slices?

561
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,080
No wonder your name sounded familiar.

562
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,410
You knew it was me but pretended not to know, right?

563
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,240
Because you were ashamed of throwing a fit that day?

564
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,350
Throwing a fit?

565
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,380
I'm sorry about that.

566
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,590
I was angry, thinking I got cheated.

567
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,629
Are you going to fire me?

568
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:20,040
I'm thinking about it.

569
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,349
Your knowledge of real estate is so pitiful

570
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:25,630
that it led you to lose your security deposit.

571
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,659
I'll study real estate really hard!

572
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,769
That's a given.

573
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:33,539
I heard no other editor will work with you, anyway.

574
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,600
Everyone knows your personality is trash, and...

575
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,620
On top of your money, you lost your mind, too!

576
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,029
Can you stop mentioning that?

577
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,860
No, I can't.

578
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,179
Change your name to Na Zero Won, why don't you?

579
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:54,529
Since you lost your security deposit and have no money.

580
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:56,319
Na Zero Won!

581
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:57,940
What? Na Zero Won?

582
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,939
He has no wit. What is that nickname?

583
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:03,040
Na Zero Won is so childish!

584
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,620
If I'm Na Zero Won, then Yoo Ja Sung, you're Yoo Jerksome.

585
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,309
 Have you found a place to stay, Editor Na Zero Won?

586
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:16,449
 Don't worry. I've found a much better place thanks to you.

587
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:19,990
 Okay then. Go to your spectacular home!

588
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,160
 I was going to.

589
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,420
 I revised the article, so take a look.

590
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,060
Did I go overboard?

591
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,100
What if I get fired?

592
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,873

593
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:36,330

594
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:39,910

595
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,410
I guess he's not going to fire me.

596
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,740
Delicious.

597
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,780
Now I can breathe.

598
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,810
Right.

599
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,110
A swimming pool doesn't make it a good house.

600
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,050
A movie theater doesn't make it a good house.

601
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,690
A good house is where you can relax and recharge.

602
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,610
What the hell?

603
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,780
Am I drunk?

604
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,550

605
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,690

606
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:31,750
Wow! Editor Na! You wrote what the CEO wanted!

607
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,840
Yes.

608
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,120
It's very blunt. I'd almost want to buy one if I had the money.

609
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,980
 Why? What's wrong?

610
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,830
Sunbae, want to go for a drink later?

611
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,410
Why? Do you need a drink?

612
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:54,299
You can't write what you want now, but it's fortunate you can work again.

613
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,639
It's degrading, but humor him and work hard.

614
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:00,980
Then you'll be able to write what you want one day.

615
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,180
Don't you think?

616
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,230
Okay.

617
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:12,050
Sir! This month's issue is out, so a company get-together would...

618
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,089
...be a waste of time, right?

619
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:16,070
No. Let's do it.

620
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,329
What's gotten into you?

621
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:23,699
You refused every time, saying it's a waste of time.

622
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,929
I refused, but you still bring it up. I'm sick of it.

623
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:29,589
Drinks because I joined.

624
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:30,999
Drinks because Editor Na joined.

625
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:32,439
Drinks because Photographer Shin joined.

626
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:36,680
I'm sick of you making excuses to go out for a drink.

627
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,410
I see.

628
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,519
After this, don't ever mention a get-together again. Understand?

629
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,979
Yes, Sir. I won't.

630
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:46,850
Since we won't have a get-together after today,

631
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,970
let's do everything and have fun!

632
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,559
You all heard him. I expect full attendance!

633
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,999
Hurry and get ready to leave.

634
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:59,170
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Yes, Sir.

635
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,740
Should we slip out?

636
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,660
No, it's okay.

637
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,809
Okay then. Where shall we go?

638
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:09,509
What do you want to eat, Sir?

639
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:11,479
Anything but pork slices.

640
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:13,149
What's wrong with pork slices?

641
00:45:13,149 --> 00:45:16,560
I'm gravely traumatized by pork slices.

642
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,419
We don't have to have pork slices.

643
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:21,220
Let's go.

644
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,600
So our CEO doesn't like pork slices...

645
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:32,069
I've never seen a Shabu-Shabu place where we each get a pot.

646
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:36,939
I know! That's why I'd like to bring my cutie pie here...

647
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:37,539
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,979
Whatever. Let's order.

649
00:45:39,979 --> 00:45:42,739
What should we get? Seafood Shabu?

650
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,140
- Korean beef Shabu? 
 - Stop!

651
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,280
Your limit is up to ₩30,000 ($30) per person.

652
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,319
Of course, including drinks.

653
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,889
Sir, one portion of Shabu is ₩25,000 ($25) here.

654
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:57,029
Then we can only have one bottle of beer or soju.

655
00:45:57,029 --> 00:46:02,099
Yes. I set the limit so you can have only one bottle.

656
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:02,970
Hyung! 
  (T/N: Hyung - how a male calls an older brother/close friend)

657
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,939
No one sets a limit at a get-together.

658
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:10,409
I do. Going over ₩30,000 ($30) is bingeing.

659
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:13,539
You might get a hangover, which will affect work tomorrow.

660
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:17,020
Considering work efficiency, ₩30,000 ($30) is adequate.

661
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,780
Going over that amount is not necessary.

662
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:26,740
Go ahead and order. The get-together will last for two hours as to not waste time.

663
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,189
Can we get some side dishes on the table?

664
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,390
Outrageous! I wanted to get wasted.

665
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,740
Seriously... Rich people are more stingy.

666
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,710
 No. Wait.

667
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,640
Yes.

668
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,410
Thanks to you, this month's issue came out well.

669
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,749
 It's degrading, but humor him and work hard.

670
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:58,089
 Then you'll be able to write what you want one day.

671
00:46:58,089 --> 00:46:59,370
 Don't you think?

672
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,990
Bye.

673
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,000
Sir!

674
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,829
You must've been talking to the homeowner we interviewed.

675
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:12,299
Did he like my article? I worked hard on it—

676
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:15,369
The article I dictated to you? He liked it a lot.

677
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,159
What?

678
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:19,909
If you had written what I had dictated, you wouldn't have been late.

679
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:24,529
Don't write what you want from now on. Do it the way I tell you.

680
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:27,620
That's why you're here.

681
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,030
The beef just melts away.

682
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,610
- No way. 
 - Oh, come on.

683
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,770
Why are you so selfish? Be kind.

684
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,430
 You should be considerate.

685
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,389
Excuse me! One more bottle of beer!

686
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:00,260
Okay.

687
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:08,320
What did I say earlier? Don't exceed ₩30,000.

688
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:13,010
I'll pay with my own money from here on. Happy?

689
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,530
Hangover.

690
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,869
Did you not understand me? Overdrinking affects work—

691
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:24,620
Come on! She'll keep it under control.

692
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,149
Alright. Do what you want, Editor Na Zero Won.

693
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:32,670
Na... Zero Won?

694
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:35,649
Oh, it's a nickname I gave her.

695
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:38,349
She has nothing, so Zero Won.

696
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:41,829
How did you know she's always hungry?

697
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:44,230
Did you tell him?

698
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:48,190
I didn't think you were like that, Sir.

699
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,970
But you're so witty!

700
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,730
Na Zero Won?

701
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,350
Na Zero Won!

702
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,710
That's hilarious!

703
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,240
Stop that!

704
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,159
Sir, don't you think Na Zero Won is going too far?

705
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,450
How is it going too far?

706
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:12,990
Is that what you think, Editor Na Zero Won?

707
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,059
Let's stop talking about it.

708
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:16,979
Why? Am I upsetting you?

709
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:22,070
Oh, you said you moved to a better place, so you have a house at least.

710
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,489
Did you move?

711
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:26,149
What? Yes.

712
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:27,319
How good is it?

713
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:29,539
Can you invite me one day?

714
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:31,899
Oh, after I've settled in...

715
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:34,180
Here you go.

716
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,750
Young Won! Hey!

717
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,119
I ate so little that there's nothing stuck between my teeth.

718
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,999
This is the first ₩30,000 per person get-together in my life.

719
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:01,079
And with a two-hour time limit.

720
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,400
It's really annoying.

721
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,430
It was like a karaoke bar.

722
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,370
At least karaoke gives you more time free of charge.

723
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,070
You're right.

724
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,160
Young Won, are you okay? Why did you drink so much?

725
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,869
See that, everyone?

726
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:19,279
Go over ₩30,000, and this is what you become.

727
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:22,060
This is why I said

728
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,240
it's the most efficient price.

729
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,609
You're quite right, Sir.

730
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:31,209
Since I didn't binge, my stomach feels so clean.

731
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:34,439
It's all thanks to you, Sir.

732
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:39,509
How can you say that when she's so wasted? Young Won! Pull yourself together! You need to go home.

733
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:41,149
You can drive her home, Ja Sung.

734
00:50:41,149 --> 00:50:43,879
Right! You're the only one who didn't drink because you said you're driving.

735
00:50:43,879 --> 00:50:45,509
Ridiculous. Why should I?

736
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,350
She's your employee. You need to take care of her.

737
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,629
For the sake of work efficiency.

738
00:50:50,629 --> 00:50:53,750
Then here you go, Sir.

739
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,350
Run!

740
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,090
Stop!

741
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,110
Editor Na Zero Won! Where do you live?

742
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:43,740
Stop calling me Na Zero Won.

743
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:49,630
Since you call me that, you get zero points.

744
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,409
She's out of her mind.

745
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:56,889
Just tell me your address.

746
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:58,790
No.

747
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,720
I, Na Zero Won, will take a taxi.

748
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,330
Bye.

749
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,120
But...

750
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,370
Goodbye, Sir!

751
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,590
Hello.

752
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:38,959
Sir, Heukma district office intersection, please.

753
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:42,959
Don't take a roundabout way because I'm drunk.

754
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,800
I'm not drunk at all.

755
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,070
I have my eyes on the meter.

756
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,090
Where should I go from here?

757
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,100
Hey, Editor Na Zero Won! Where should I go?

758
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,459
What? Why am I in your car?

759
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:30,899
Forget it.

760
00:53:30,899 --> 00:53:33,559
Where's this place that's better than before?

761
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:35,019
I'll drop you off at your doorstep.

762
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:36,320
What?

763
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,690
No, thank you. It's near here.

764
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,690
Thank you for the ride.

765
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,360
Goodbye, Sir!

766
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,080
Weird. Why's she in such a hurry?

767
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,020
How humiliating!

768
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,410
He's gone, right?

769
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,450
Be quiet.

770
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,360
What's going on?

771
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,360
Are you okay?

772
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,479
What? My son did what?

773
00:55:41,479 --> 00:55:43,619
She probably made a mistake!

774
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:46,359
It's not a mistake. He broke into my house.

775
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:48,549
He broke into your house?

776
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:51,829
On paper, that house is his!

777
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:56,009
Can't a landlord look into how a tenant is living?

778
00:55:56,009 --> 00:56:00,289
Going into a tenant's residence without notice is trespassing.

779
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:07,470
Also, why bring a knife if it's a friendly visit?

780
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,799
What rotten luck!

781
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,759
A bad tenant is causing such a mess!

782
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:13,919
Get out of my house immediately!

783
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:16,640
I'm leaving!

784
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,620
I have no intention of dealing with a landlord like you.

785
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,500
You're lucky I went back because you dropped this.

786
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,740
Thank you.

787
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,709
Get in.

788
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:00,789
No, it's okay.

789
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,269
You're shaking all over.

790
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:06,760
Just get in. I'll drive you.

791
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,340
Where?

792
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:15,530
She said to leave immediately. Where will you drive me?

793
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,669
Don't you have a place to stay temporarily?

794
00:57:17,669 --> 00:57:21,840
A friend's house or your parents' house?

795
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,430
And if I stay there temporarily?

796
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,210
Will I find a comfortable place of my own?

797
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,060
I worked like a dog to survive.

798
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:39,110
The last ten years were all work.

799
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,750
I just looked ahead and worked hard.

800
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,820
I wasn't greedy.

801
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,550
I just...

802
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:58,680
I lived each day as best as I could, diligently.

803
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,180
So I don't know why I'm still in this rut.

804
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,740
Look at all those houses.

805
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:28,260
But why is there no home for me that I have to be humiliated like this?

806
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,570
It's so degrading.

807
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,040
Thank you.

808
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,949
No need to thank me.

809
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:38,499
I get to collect monthly rent from a spare apartment.

810
00:59:38,499 --> 00:59:40,310
But...

811
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,350
You really don't need a security deposit?

812
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:46,119
Why? Do you want to pay?

813
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,620
Oh, of course not.

814
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,120
Just don't fall behind on the monthly rent.

815
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,160
Goodbye then.

816
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:55,740
Goodbye.

817
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,920
I thought he only cared about money.

818
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,960
I'll pour you a drink.

819
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,280
That's enough. Let's go now.

820
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,539
Nonsense. There's still food left. Don't be ridiculous.

821
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:22,619
You really know how to drag people along.

822
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,989
Then send them home, at least.

823
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,289
They both live near here.

824
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:28,909
You guys are okay, right?

825
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:31,800
No. I'm tired.

826
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,319
So chic.

827
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,940
Go home then. Coolly.

828
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,930
Bye.

829
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,110
Bye.

830
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:46,089
It would've been great if Editor Na were here.

831
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:48,279
She must be really stressed because of the CEO.

832
01:00:48,279 --> 01:00:50,620
She went overboard with the liquor.

833
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:54,149
I heard she went through a lot until now.

834
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:58,929
I guess she held on with the power of liquor.

835
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:00,890
If she had, she'd be dead by now.

836
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,330
I know how.

837
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:09,509
It's all in her "Single Household Living" series.

838
01:01:09,509 --> 01:01:14,620
She tells how she relieved stress and held on.

839
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,800
 Because I had a home,

840
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:25,290
 I could seek refuge after a hard day.

841
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:36,500
 Let's just use two models. You're okay with that, right?

842
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,350
 Yes! Of course.

843
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,310
♫  I know that  ♫

844
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:53,850
 You rabid bastards!

845
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:58,420
 The nerve!

846
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,719
 It was the only place I could let out what I really felt.

847
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:04,539
 Tada!

848
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:06,890
 Let's go. Come on, everyone.

849
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:13,890
♫  Here I am. My flame is alive in my heart  ♫

850
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:19,980
 It was a place that could comfort my weary body and soul.

851
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,150
 This is so good.

852
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:34,460
♫  Here I am. My flame is alive in my heart  ♫

853
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,690
 Although I didn't own it,

854
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:43,360
 thanks to a place where I could be myself,

855
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,830
 I was able to hold on until now.

856
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:50,570
♫  Here I am. My flame is alive in my heart  ♫

857
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:54,270
 Now, I'm at a new place.

858
01:02:54,270 --> 01:03:00,639
 Can it also become a refuge that will help me firmly withstand the world?

859
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,220
Of course, it can.

860
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,600
Having a place to live without a security deposit...

861
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,989
Anyway...

862
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:12,539
If he can offer a place like this

863
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:17,490
without demanding a security deposit, he must be really rich.

864
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,270
He must live in a great place with splendid decorations.

865
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:17,180
Homeownership plan...

866
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,329
 You have entered the wrong password.

867
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:24,060
Who is it?

868
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,110
 You have entered the wrong password.

869
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,120
 Jasung TV

870
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:07,530

871
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:17,760
♫  We’re so different, let me tell you, we’ll never get close  ♫

872
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,900
♫  That’ll never happen, I bet, you know  ♫

873
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,890

~ Preview ~

874
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:28,819
 Does she know what kind of place #707 is?

875
01:05:28,819 --> 01:05:30,379
 Watch what you say.

876
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:32,000
 I watched Jasung TV.

877
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,730
 If you want to save up money, the first step is to stop wasting it.

878
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,590
 Say the word "poor" backwards.

879
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,030
 Family in turmoil?

880
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,550
 Did you have to get the kimchi?

881
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,980
♫  I bet, you know. You seem so uptight  ♫

882
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,669
 What's the use of saving money on kimchi?

883
01:05:47,669 --> 01:05:49,949
 More money is leaking out because you did a bad job.

884
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:51,849
 First, do your main job well.

885
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:53,289
 What's the use of saving money?

886
01:05:53,289 --> 01:05:55,959
 I lost ₩5 mil. in a second.

887
01:05:55,959 --> 01:06:01,780
 I guess home ownership is unattainable for someone like me.

888
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:09,990
