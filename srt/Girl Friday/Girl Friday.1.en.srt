1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,068
Put some more grass over there.

2
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,262
Careful, careful!

3
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:09,170
Take care of the cows, okay?

4
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,762
Sure, boss. Leave it to me.

5
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,467
Take care.

6
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,832
Yes, boss. Thank you.

7
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,719
All right.

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,795
Go!

9
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:52,662
Come on. Hurry up.

10
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:01,974
Hey, boss!

11
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,365
Sir Mando!

12
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,084
Jojo!

13
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:23,928
What took you so long?

14
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:25,264
Sorry, sir Mando.

15
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,264
We ran into a problem at the ranch.

16
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:30,436
I had to fix it before I could leave.

17
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,121
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

18
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,151
Are those the cows?

19
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,084
Yeah, three of those are yours.

20
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,076
There.

21
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,528
They look a little hungry!

22
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:41,745
You're seeing things, sir Mando!

23
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,689
Look, they're sturdier than you are!

24
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,225
Fine. Load them onto the truck.

25
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:50,147
Where is your truck parked?

26
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:51,608
Over there!

27
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,803
Ah, okay.

28
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:56,037
Boys, sir Mando's truck is over there.

29
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:57,158
Load them up!

30
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,630
Three of them.

31
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,741
Double time!

32
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,195
By the way, sir Mando.

33
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,390
Three calves were born the other day.

34
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,248
Luckily, the new pens were finished.

35
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:09,709
There's so much space!

36
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:10,991
Until next time, okay?

37
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,352
Tell your boss I said hi.

38
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,819
Sure, I'll tell him.

39
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,084
Until next time!

40
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,139
Take them there! Hurry up!

41
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:21,724
- Jojo!
- Yes sir!

42
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:22,708
How much for a cow?

43
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:26,273
They're at 70 thousand right now.

44
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:28,535
Do you have any that's good for roast beef?

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,295
At the moment, no.

46
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,621
All these are for raising.

47
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,037
Okay, thank you.

48
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:34,608
Okay, next time!

49
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:35,900
Hey, Sir Pedro!

50
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:37,917
- Jojo!
- I haven't seen you lately!

51
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:39,670
You weren't here during the last sale!

52
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,511
Sorry about that, Jojo.

53
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,030
A storm wrecked the ranch.

54
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:47,514
I'm actually here to buy new cows.

55
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:48,623
Is that so?

56
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:50,738
Come here, let's talk.

57
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:52,979
How many do you need?

58
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:54,311
I was hoping to get two.

59
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,518
Two…

60
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,898
70 thousand each.

61
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,490
Isn't that higher than before?

62
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,422
That's the going price, sir Pedro.

63
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:08,881
Alright, well I'm going
to look around here.

64
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:10,787
Come on, sir Pedro.
Not so fast.

65
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:12,795
Let's talk it out.

66
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,598
Do you really need the cows for today?

67
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:18,155
My truck is already here!

68
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,438
Alright. 50 thousand.

69
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:26,006
That's already fair.

70
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,286
Come on, how about...

71
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:30,830
give it for 30 thousand,
so we'll be done here.

72
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:34,623
You're a tough one to crack.

73
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,872
But okay.

74
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:38,317
I'll give it for ₱30,000 each…

75
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:39,728
but you have to buy three.

76
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:40,938
Sure, sure!

77
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:41,605
Are we good?

78
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,331
Yeah.

79
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:43,065
But, is it okay if...

80
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,483
I bring them tomorrow instead?

81
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:47,686
Come on, Jojo.
Why wait until tomorrow?

82
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,055
Sir Pedro, don't worry about it!

83
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,592
Just have your driver hang out for a bit.

84
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,702
Tell him I'll meet him
up before it gets dark.

85
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,123
Okay, sure.

86
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,147
Sir Pedro, wait a sec.

87
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,068
What is it?

88
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:01,928
Is it okay if...

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,888
I get the downpayment?

90
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:09,498
Here.

91
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:11,240
Ten thousand.

92
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,847
I'll give the remaining balance

93
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:18,311
once you bring the cows
to Batangas, okay?

94
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,895
- I'll be waiting!
- Okay! You can count on me, Sir Pedro!

95
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,771
Alright!

96
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:23,936
Take care, sir!

97
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,408
Wait a minute,
where are you going?

98
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,936
To boss Antonio.

99
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,116
Why?

100
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:02,647
I'm handing over the money.

101
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:04,803
He's at the firing range.

102
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:06,917
Okay, boss.

103
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,256
Thank you!

104
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:13,715
Our buddy looks so young here!

105
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,678
He'll be raking votes
from the ladies for sure!

106
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,451
Too bad we can't publish this yet.

107
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:19,803
Why not?

108
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:22,250
After he files for candidacy, we can.

109
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,392
Perfect timing,

110
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,819
it's his last term as congressman!

111
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:26,873
Let's go sit down.

112
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:29,030
How are our businesses?

113
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:30,725
The recoil is strong!

114
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:35,137
Excuse me, boss Antonio.

115
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:36,373
Jojo!

116
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,045
Here's the money from the cows.

117
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:39,973
This is complete, right?

118
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:40,669
Yes, boss!

119
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:41,912
That's half a million.

120
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:42,704
Good.

121
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,645
Cousin!

122
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:46,415
This is what we earned from the cows.

123
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,357
- All of it?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,667
This is Jojo.

125
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,037
Hello, Congressman.

126
00:08:57,326 --> 00:08:58,552
Thank you, sir.

127
00:08:58,577 --> 00:08:59,754
- Boss!
- Karen,

128
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:00,988
Yes, sir?

129
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:03,432
Take care of this.

130
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:04,391
Okay, sir.

131
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,465
Go ahead.

132
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:09,563
Congressman.

133
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:10,272
Gentlemen.

134
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,357
- Hey!
- Oh, how are you!

135
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:13,720
General, mayor...

136
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:15,372
- How's it going, Cong.
- Everything's good.

137
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:16,737
Sorry, guys.

138
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,280
We're just helping somebody out.

139
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:19,389
You know how it is.

140
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:20,824
We know, we know.

141
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:22,887
Anyway, I have some news for you.

142
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:24,770
I heard...

143
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,057
They're passing the bill we've
established at the Bicameral Committee.

144
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,918
- The Ilaya International Freeport Zone!
- Oh, wow!

145
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,628
- That's great, right?
- Couldn't be better!

146
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:34,363
This is good news!

147
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,791
- Tonio!
- Yes, cousin?

148
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:38,001
I'm recommending you as chairman for that!

149
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:38,951
Thank you, cousin!

150
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,189
- Hey, congrats!
- Congrats, man!

151
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,746
- That's great!
- That's great!

152
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:50,354
You know I've got your back, cousin.

153
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,786
Thanks again!

154
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:53,440
You really are the best.

155
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:55,776
Hopefully the President can sign it

156
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,747
before congress goes to recess.

157
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,154
Congressman,

158
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:01,723
are we sure that the free port's boundary

159
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:03,974
will include the town of Santa Maria?

160
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:06,349
General,

161
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,450
I know what you're trying to say.

162
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,666
I know what you want.

163
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:11,792
Don't worry,

164
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:15,490
- I'll make sure you're included.
- Thank you so much, sir!

165
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,090
The freeport is such
great news, congressman!

166
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:20,716
Especially for the farmers in Santa Inez.

167
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,035
Mayor Bogs...

168
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,458
you're right.

169
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,138
You're absolutely right.

170
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,224
I'll tell you what,

171
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,833
there are plans to put up a food hub
inside the freeport zone.

172
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:30,981
So you may go

173
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:34,565
and brag about that
to your constituents!

174
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,775
Thanks so much, congressman!

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,635
Brag about it!

176
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:46,013
I just want to let you know that...

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,341
my vision for Ilaya will be impossible
to achieve if...

178
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:52,791
you guys wouldn't support me.

179
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:55,319
- Well of course!
- You have our full support!

180
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,379
- I'll hold you to that!
- Of course!

181
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:59,756
- You've nothing to worry about!
- We can't say no to you!

182
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:00,904
Alright,

183
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,719
Let's drink to that!
Let's drink to that!

184
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:05,470
Excuse me, there's an urgent matter.

185
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:06,880
I need to talk to Nicole.

186
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,916
Oh, sure.

187
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,888
Cousin?

188
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,372
- Yes?
- Can you go with Nicole?

189
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:14,605
Oh, okay!

190
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,208
Come with me, girls!

191
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,147
Come on.

192
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:24,083
Watch your steps.

193
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:27,310
Jojo!

194
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,832
Yes, boss! Come join us!

195
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,108
- Thank you.
- Good afternoon, boss.

196
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,859
Good afternoon.

197
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:33,668
Let's eat, sir.

198
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,122
Could you bring our
visitors to the rest house?

199
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,655
- Okay?
- Sure thing, sir!

200
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,177
Go on.

201
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:40,532
Come on, follow me.

202
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,474
Careful.

203
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,039
- Sir!
- Yes?

204
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,035
I wanted to ask a favor.

205
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,896
What is it?

206
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,026
Could I go home immediately after work?

207
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,594
Just need to settle something
with the wife.

208
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,224
Okay.

209
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,671
Go straight home
after bringing back the van.

210
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,233
- Yes, sir. Thank you!
- Here are the keys.

211
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:00,404
Take care!

212
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:02,184
Come on!

213
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,408
Alright!

214
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:08,845
Careful!

215
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,126
Are you excited?

216
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,480
A little.

217
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,998
I promise, you'll enjoy it here!

218
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,560
We're here, ladies.

219
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:27,589
We're here?

220
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,105
Yes, this is it!

221
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,526
This is our stop.

222
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:45,761
Thanks!

223
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,208
Thank you!

224
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,353
Enjoy!

225
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,520
Come with me.

226
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:53,027
I've got you!

227
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,066
It's beautiful here!

228
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,478
Here, this way.

229
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,365
- Well?
- Wow!

230
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,597
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

231
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:05,572
Yes!

232
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,535
Come on, let's go here.

233
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,472
Congressman's resthouse is so grand!

234
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,967
It's a big property.

235
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,212
I noticed.

236
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,131
So...

237
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:23,694
wanna go for a swim?

238
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,628
Yeah, the water looks so good!

239
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,198
Come on, let's get dressed!

240
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:27,932
Let's go!

241
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,455
The changing room's inside.

242
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,458
Good afternoon, sir!

243
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,965
Let's go.

244
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:38,784
You don't have to follow me.

245
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,146
Just park it somewhere properly.

246
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,184
Yes, sir.

247
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:50,198
Are you enjoying?

248
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,599
Yes, it's so fun!

249
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,247
I told you you'll have fun here.

250
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:54,419
Karen!

251
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,411
Yes, sir?

252
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,524
Have you been waiting long?

253
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,727
We just got here.

254
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:02,878
Where are your guests?

255
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:04,837
I left them with Antonio.

256
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,988
He'll take care of them.

257
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,990
It's not like they can do anything to you!

258
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:09,748
Let's go.

259
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:10,622
Let's go!

260
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,080
How are you?

261
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,039
How are you?

262
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,008
I'm good!

263
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,653
Alright.

264
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:10,262
We're here.

265
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,407
You drive fast, huh.

266
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,433
Here, take this.
Take care!

267
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,605
Thank you!

268
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,294
Hey!

269
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:29,924
Have a seat!

270
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,885
My wife's so pretty!

271
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,331
Carmela,

272
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,777
what's for dinner?

273
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:47,475
Oh, wait.

274
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:48,987
Let me prepare your dinner.

275
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,093
Your food's here.

276
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:09,166
Goddamn it, Carmela, this again?

277
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:12,133
You didn't give enough
money for the market.

278
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:15,253
And I had to pay for electricity…

279
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:16,972
Ouch!

280
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,363
Jojo, you're at it again!

281
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,167
Jojo!

282
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:24,161
- Jojo, please!
- That's what you want right?

283
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,146
This is what you're good at!

284
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,062
Jojo!

285
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,417
Do as I say!

286
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:31,562
It hurts!

287
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,167
Jojo, please stop!

288
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,324
Stop acting like you don't want it.

289
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,285
Jojo!

290
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,722
Stop, Jojo please!

291
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,224
Son of a bitch!

292
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,308
Stop fucking screaming.
You know you want it!

293
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,062
Jojo, stop it, please!

294
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,505
There, you like that? You like that!

295
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,841
Jojo!

296
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,275
It hurts!

297
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,010
Jojo!

298
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,141
Jojo!

299
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,893
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

300
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,619
Jojo!

301
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,313
Jojo, please stop it.

302
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,481
Jojo!

303
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,399
Jojo, that's enough!

304
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:11,580
Shut up, you whore!

305
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,028
Spread your legs!

306
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,199
It hurts! It hurts!

307
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,711
Fighting back
but you're gonna cum anyway!

308
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,152
Here!

309
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:33,181
Get dressed!

310
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:49,872
Hurry up, hurry up!

311
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,652
Quickly, quickly!

312
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,488
Hey! What's that!

313
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,452
You fuckers! Stop!

314
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:05,037
Fuck! Get down!

315
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,579
Sir, please.

316
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,623
- I have nothing to do with this.
- We'll see about that!

317
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:08,808
Get down!

318
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,143
Sir, I've got nothing to do with this!

319
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,853
- I'm just the driver!
- Shut up!

320
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,463
You sons of bitches.

321
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,881
- Please forgive me, sir!
- Forgive you?

322
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:17,775
How long have you been
doing this on the ranch?

323
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,426
- Just this once!
- You gonna to do this again?

324
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,412
- No, sir, no! No!
- You think you can go behind my back?

325
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:24,031
Get up! Get him up!

326
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,074
Take him.

327
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,184
That's an employee here!

328
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,917
They're stealing my cows!

329
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,505
Go!

330
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,417
Boss!

331
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:33,438
Boss, my ass!

332
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,667
Boss, please forgive me, boss!

333
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,196
Boss, please forgive me, boss!

334
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,535
After I trusted you?

335
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,133
I really needed the money, boss!

336
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,009
Get in!

337
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,120
Put him in jail!

338
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,495
Sir, thank you.

339
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,410
I catch you almost every day!

340
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,972
- Here's the payment, sir.
- Thank you.

341
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:08,909
- Sir,
- Yes, ma'am?

342
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,620
did you catch anyone
named Jojo Raymundo?

343
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:12,931
Yes, how are you related to him?

344
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,897
I'm his wife.

345
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,636
Your husband's jailed inside.

346
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,167
Just go up to the visiting area,

347
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,410
I'll bring your husband to you.

348
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,486
Okay, sir. Thank you.

349
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,589
Alright.

350
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:22,531
Raymundo!

351
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:23,991
- Sir!
- Jojo Raymundo!

352
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:24,658
What is it, sir?

353
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,350
Come here.

354
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:26,302
Yes?

355
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,661
You have a visitor.

356
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:28,753
Okay, sir.

357
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,002
Stand here.

358
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,738
Okay, sir, thank you.

359
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,798
Alright, come on.

360
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,051
Here, here.

361
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:42,926
Where to?

362
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,678
Come on.

363
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,870
Here.

364
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,956
Thank you, sir.

365
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,070
Carmela!

366
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,511
What happened?

367
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,488
Come on, Carmela.

368
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:07,343
I got caught, obviously!

369
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,628
I told you to stop with that.

370
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,605
You have to be more
careful about what you do!

371
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,999
Damn it, Carmela.

372
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,584
I'm already in here!

373
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,752
What am I supposed to do?

374
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,052
Carmela...

375
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,054
Carmela.

376
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:32,476
Maybe you can talk to boss Antonio?

377
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,392
Just ask him to get me out of here.

378
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:36,522
I'm having such a hard time.

379
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,328
Come on.

380
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,285
Fine. I'll find a way.

381
00:22:50,158 --> 00:22:53,536
Sir, please look after my husband well.

382
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:54,890
Sure thing, ma'am.

383
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,083
Nothing will happen to him here.

384
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,907
Take care of yourself here, Jojo.

385
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,681
Yes, Carmela. I love you!

386
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,782
I love you!

387
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,049
You too, take care out there!

388
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,187
How is it going over there?

389
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,106
All good.

390
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,639
My payment.

391
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,696
Thank you!

392
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,735
Sirs!

393
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:41,346
Could I please talk to boss Antonio?

394
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:42,330
Are you Jojo's wife?

395
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,063
Yes.

396
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:43,939
Get out of here.

397
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,841
It won't take long.
I just want to talk!

398
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:47,735
- You're not allowed here!
- Just for a bit, sir.

399
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,761
I just want to talk to him!

400
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:51,360
My husband is innocent!

401
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,685
Are you going to leave
or do I have to shoot you?

402
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,414
You fuckers! You're all heartless!

403
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,190
Whatever, leave!

404
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,779
Don't forget, Fredie Ibasco!

405
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,156
Alright, ma'am. Thank you!

406
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,603
Drop me off here, sir.

407
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,509
Here's my payment.

408
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,249
Boss Antonio! Boss Antonio!

409
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:21,538
Please have mercy on me!

410
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,420
Please forgive my husband!

411
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,773
Please, have mercy!

412
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,424
Let go of me! Get her!

413
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:28,737
Get her!

414
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:30,672
Let go of her!

415
00:24:31,024 --> 00:24:32,152
Madam!

416
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:33,238
Please help me,

417
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,224
please have mercy
on me and my husband!

418
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:37,800
Please calm down for now.

419
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,025
Give me a chair!

420
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:41,806
Hurry up!

421
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,407
Sit down for a bit, ma'am.

422
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,237
Give me some water.

423
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,955
I'm alright.

424
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,773
No, drink some water first.

425
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,289
Thank you, ma'am.

426
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,043
What's your name, dear?

427
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,907
Carmela Raymundo, ma'am.

428
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,731
She's the wife of Jojo,

429
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,657
the one who stole cows from our ranch.

430
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:10,915
He's living with her.

431
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,839
Both of you!

432
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:14,698
Out!

433
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,913
I will give you two five minutes

434
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,306
to get the fuck out of my resthouse!

435
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,500
If you don't,

436
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,962
I will have you dragged
all over Ilaya butt-naked!

437
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,800
Out!

438
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,011
You!

439
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,679
We need to talk!

440
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:49,253
What?

441
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:52,474
Happy now?

442
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,779
Are you proud of what you did?

443
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:56,782
What about you?

444
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,162
You're proud about what you're doing?

445
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,013
Just so you know,

446
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,751
I've been campaigning all day
in every grimy corner of Ilaya for you!

447
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,296
While you're just

448
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,757
here befouling our rest house?

449
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,751
Hey, hey!

450
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,717
Calm down!

451
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,306
Calm down?

452
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:20,405
You don't even know
our ranch is being robbed

453
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,765
and you're asking me to calm down?

454
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,071
What kind of leader are you?

455
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,815
And you think you can run for governor?

456
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,111
I talked to Antonio.

457
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:37,055
He knows what to do.
He can handle it.

458
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,991
Now, what's your problem?

459
00:27:42,264 --> 00:27:43,251
Fred.

460
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,858
I tolerate your womanizing in Manila.

461
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,259
All I ask

462
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:53,282
is that you stop it here in Ilaya.

463
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,258
Give me some respect!

464
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,887
If you can't respect me as a person,

465
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,295
at least respect our standing in society!

466
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:08,548
Listen.

467
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,828
I don't display my philandering in public.

468
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,571
I have maintained my image

469
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:19,267
as a loyal husband to you.

470
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,743
Now, if you can't stand my vices,

471
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:23,696
that's your problem.

472
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,571
I just want an open relationship.

473
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,353
While I'm stuck with you?

474
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,422
That's just your luck.

475
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,165
You married a politician.

476
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:48,755
Let's end this.

477
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,526
What's so funny?

478
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,452
Done.

479
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:06,723
Wish granted!

480
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:07,933
You're free.

481
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,250
You asshole.

482
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,961
Well, I'll be filing an annulment

483
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,196
after the election.

484
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:18,962
And don't worry.

485
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,510
I'll pay for the legal fees

486
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,220
to expedite the process.

487
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,222
You asshole!

488
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,103
Well, for now...

489
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:35,461
you're still Mrs. Ibasco.

490
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,026
Enjoy it.

491
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:12,119
President Manuel Sevilla has signed

492
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,604
the Republic Act 19123,

493
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,731
or the Ilaya Free Trade Act.

494
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,334
This aims to establish

495
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,945
a Free Port area in the province of Ilaya.

496
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:24,422
Present during the ceremony

497
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,908
were Senate President Pacquito Meneses,

498
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,119
House Speaker Amadeo Rodriguez

499
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,997
and the co-authors, Alexandro Marquez

500
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,793
and representative Fernando Ibasco
of the third district of Ilaya province.

501
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,868
Here, water.

502
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,491
Your cousin's a fucking asshole!

503
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,953
He can't even respect me!

504
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:13,914
Amor!

505
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:16,266
You were in Karen's position

506
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,665
when he separated with his first wife!

507
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:21,673
Just be thankful for where you are now.

508
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,103
Madam!

509
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,603
You can call me Mrs. Ibasco.

510
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:21,998
What are you doing here, Mrs. Ibasco?

511
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,108
Can I talk to you?

512
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,610
Sure! Come inside.

513
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,364
This way, ma'am.

514
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,505
Sorry about our house, ma'am.
Please have a seat!

515
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,649
Have some coffee first.

516
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:05,859
Thank you.

517
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,954
Are you alone with your husband here?

518
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:18,729
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:21,505
Where are your children?

520
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:24,751
Jojo is sterile.

521
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,464
It's good that you were able to accept it.

522
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:34,052
Being a mother isn't the only reason
why a woman wants to get married.

523
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,515
How romantic.

524
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,532
Mrs. Ibasco?

525
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,688
About my husband…

526
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,525
That's why I'm here.

527
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,362
What did Congressman say?

528
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,406
Is he going to set my husband free?

529
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,744
I appreciate your commitment
to your husband,

530
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,412
but unfortunately,

531
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,431
my husband did not consent.

532
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,916
Mrs. Ibasco…

533
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,293
maybe I could talk to him.

534
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,961
Please. I'm begging you.

535
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,298
Wish granted.

536
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,048
I can bring you closer to my husband,

537
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,512
but on one condition.

538
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,353
What condition?

539
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:20,880
Have sex with him.

540
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:22,310
What?

541
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,704
For your first payment.

542
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,455
I'll add more later.

543
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,259
And you can set your husband free.

544
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,657
Just make sure you make my husband happy.

545
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,552
You can leave.

546
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,471
Are you sure about this?

547
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,434
Do you want your husband
to rot in prison?

548
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,104
It's hard to be alone, Carmela.

549
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,606
No husband,

550
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,150
no child…

551
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,363
I have no time for your disgusting wiles.

552
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,203
My appointment with you is done.

553
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,665
You had your chance.

554
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,055
Thank you for the coffee.

555
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:54,639
Raymundo! Jojo Raymundo!

556
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,238
Hey, Raymundo!
They're looking for you!

557
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:58,319
What is it?

558
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,257
Get out of there!

559
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,116
Okay, sir!

560
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,075
Hurry, hurry!

561
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,078
I was sleeping!

562
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,456
Hurry!

563
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,583
Okay, okay sir, I'm coming!

564
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:09,584
Wait for me there.

565
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:10,376
Yes, sir.

566
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,271
Show me your hands.

567
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,218
Here.

568
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,382
Why are you putting handcuffs?

569
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,561
Where are you taking me?

570
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,219
Hey, Sir!

571
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:19,986
What is this?

572
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,904
No more talking!

573
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,721
Wait, what is this?

574
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,931
We're putting you in solitary!

575
00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:24,157
Sir, please!

576
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,257
Please don't do this to me! Sir!

577
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:27,772
Sir!

578
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:32,421
Here's my fare.

579
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,686
Thank you.

580
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:39,378
Wait, wait.

581
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,131
Sir?

582
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,741
You can't visit your husband today.

583
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,009
Why not?

584
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,328
That can't be, it's still visiting hours!

585
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:46,241
I'm telling you, no.

586
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,139
Why, sir?

587
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,666
Your husband's in solitary confinement.

588
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:51,439
What?

589
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,211
He was being a nuisance! Here.

590
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,022
What's this?

591
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,147
Call it. They might save your husband.

592
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:00,450
Go on.

593
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,699
You bitch!

594
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,535
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

595
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,996
What did you do to my husband?

596
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,748
I did nothing to your husband.

597
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,167
My husband is in solitary confinement!

598
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,086
Well...

599
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,547
It's his life.

600
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,008
He could've been a bad boy,

601
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,884
or perhaps someone else.

602
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,804
Alright, Mrs. Ibasco.

603
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,806
I'll do what you want,

604
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,433
but please leave
my husband and I alone.

605
00:37:57,704 --> 00:37:58,710
Yes, ma'am?

606
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,861
Hello, Colonel?

607
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,032
Please bring Jojo Raymundo
out of solitary confinement.

608
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:05,091
Okay, ma'am.

609
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:05,993
Thank you.

610
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:07,313
Wait!

611
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,495
Get him out of prison!

612
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,664
Not just out of solitary!

613
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,251
My husband can answer to that, not me.

614
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:16,923
Fine.

615
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,379
Let's get this over with.

616
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:21,187
Bring me to that damn congressman!

617
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,524
Get in the car.

618
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,139
Now.

619
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,518
Wait a second.

620
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,978
Why are we taking this route?

621
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,338
- Carmela, take it easy.
- This is wrong.

622
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:01,940
- This is the right way.
- Please stop the car!

623
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,691
Stop the car!

624
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,750
- Come on, please!
- Go on, stop the car.

625
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,646
Carmela!

626
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,352
Where the hell are we going?

627
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:20,617
To Manila.

628
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,336
You didn't even let me pack?

629
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,530
You don't have to!
I'll buy clothes for you!

630
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:28,406
Be honest with me, Mrs. Ibasco!

631
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:29,993
Are you crazy or something?

632
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:32,969
My husband is a sex addict.

633
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,330
And it just got worse

634
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,832
because of his damn secretary

635
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:37,758
who whores girls out to him.

636
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,670
And what do I have to do with that?

637
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:43,195
When I saw you,

638
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,008
I knew you would be my husband's type.

639
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,180
Is that why you're going
to whore me out to him?

640
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,725
If you want your husband freed,

641
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:57,258
you'll need to earn my husband's trust.

642
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,547
Why are you doing this?

643
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,900
Because I don't want to waste
everything I've worked for!

644
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,071
So you're competing
with your husband's secretary?

645
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,074
Is that why you're going
to whore me out to him, too?

646
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,247
Ten million pesos, cash.

647
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,916
Are you crazy?

648
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,899
You're disrespecting me, Mrs. Ibasco!

649
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,571
This isn't about
my husband's freedom anymore!

650
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,759
So what I want is ten million pesos

651
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,774
in exchange for my honor.

652
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,763
Do you want me
to have you killed instead?

653
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,932
You can't do it. You need me.

654
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,351
I could get someone else.

655
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,282
Well, I guess,

656
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm going back home to Ilaya.

657
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:41,594
Wait!

658
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,610
One million,
and I think that's enough.

659
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,528
Two million.

660
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:51,739
Fine.

661
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:52,899
Deal.

662
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,202
Get back inside.

663
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,580
Let's sit here.
Have a seat, guys.

664
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,916
Oh my god.

665
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:53,400
It's so early!
What's this meeting about?

666
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,513
Jake, this is Carmela.

667
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:57,398
- Oh, hi, Carmela.
- Hello.

668
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,219
My constituent in Ilaya.

669
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:01,577
Carmela, this is Jake Salazar,

670
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,970
- my personal shopper.
- Yes.

671
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,022
And what is this all about?

672
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,400
I want you to make her stunning!

673
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,026
Enhance her beauty.

674
00:42:09,386 --> 00:42:10,728
Sexy or classy?

675
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:12,400
- Both.
- Oh!

676
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:13,962
Why not?

677
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,826
Reservation for Congressman Ibasco?

678
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,953
Come with me, ma'am.
Here's your reserved table.

679
00:43:05,812 --> 00:43:07,710
If you need anything, just call me.

680
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,176
Where's my husband?

681
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,511
Unfortunately, he will never be here.

682
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,430
Please sit down, ma'am Amor.

683
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,311
He wants you to sign this.

684
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,536
But I want to talk to my husband.

685
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,817
I'm sorry, Amor.

686
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,445
Mrs. Ibasco.

687
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,823
Mrs. Ibasco.

688
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:43,990
What's the meaning of this?

689
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:45,881
As I said,

690
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:48,504
Congressman Ibasco wants you
to sign the document.

691
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,318
Tell your boss--

692
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:54,924
my husband--

693
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,134
that I'm not going
to be insulted this way!

694
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:02,137
Especially from some
glorified whore like you!

695
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,358
Excuse me.

696
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,075
Welcome, congressman!

697
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:06,328
I think we should listen
to what our congressman is going to say.

698
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:07,936
I think that's him.

699
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:08,664
Good afternoon.

700
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,415
Oh, good afternoon!

701
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,750
- Hi, good afternoon
- Congressman!

702
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,126
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I'm late.

703
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,502
- It's okay.
- It's okay, Congressman.

704
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,257
Guys, gentlemen,

705
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,925
this is where we're going to build

706
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,327
the free-port zone, as you can see.

707
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,306
This is our zoning,

708
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:26,687
our urban comprehensive,

709
00:45:26,712 --> 00:45:28,523
the aerial, the airport district,

710
00:45:28,663 --> 00:45:31,093
port business, and high-end manufacturing.

711
00:45:31,473 --> 00:45:32,804
- As you can see.
- That's good.

712
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,149
And here are our...

713
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:36,988
- investors.
- That's a lot!

714
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:38,055
All of them.

715
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,719
Okay, guys.

716
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,101
I'll explain it to you.

717
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,951
The Ilaya International Airport

718
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:49,100
is expected to bring

719
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,843
- 350,000 jobs
- Wow!

720
00:45:52,004 --> 00:45:54,288
in just three years.

721
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:57,134
Five million more jobs

722
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,874
in the next ten years.

723
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,301
Also,

724
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,636
it will elevate the province of Ilaya

725
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,515
from third to first class
industrialized province.

726
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,273
This will help our country.

727
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,436
In order for this vision to materialize,

728
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,313
I need your support

729
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,795
because my competition in politics

730
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,185
is using the Free Port
to tarnish my reputation.

731
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:25,800
Surely we're not willing to sacrifice
the welfare of the people,

732
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,619
just for someone's personal interests?

733
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:29,779
We agree.

734
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,664
Congressman Ibasco.

735
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,916
What do you really want from us?

736
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,422
Well, to tell you the truth,

737
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:42,708
I'm planning to file my candidacy

738
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:44,794
as governor of Ilaya.

739
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,221
So guys,

740
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:50,435
I need your financial support
to run a campaign.

741
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,060
What are we getting out of this?

742
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,966
That's a good question.

743
00:46:57,424 --> 00:47:00,896
Free access to the Free Port.

744
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:05,239
My cousin, Antonio Ibasco,

745
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,700
will be the chairman of IIFP.

746
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,786
And I'm sure he will be delighted
to work with you guys.

747
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,575
Antonio Ibasco?

748
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:15,791
Isn't he facing tax evasion charges?

749
00:47:19,054 --> 00:47:21,848
Those are allegations only.

750
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,592
But the lower court has already decided!

751
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,803
There's no finality on that yet.

752
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,141
Actually, he's still following up
with the Court of Tax Appeals.

753
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,060
Fredie, I hope you don't mind…

754
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,146
You have an impeccable
plan for your province.

755
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,856
You just need to bet on the right people.

756
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:41,653
Noted.

757
00:47:41,678 --> 00:47:44,107
Excuse me, sir.
Your wife is on the phone.

758
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,074
Gentlemen, guys,

759
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,701
excuse me for a bit.

760
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,203
I have important business to attend to.

761
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,495
Okay, Congressman.

762
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,388
What's the meaning of those
annulment papers you sent me?

763
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,286
That's it.

764
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:08,255
Our agreement was after the elections!

765
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,810
What do you mean after the elections?

766
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,169
I sent it to you now,
so you can sign them.

767
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,169
You fucking monster!

768
00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:17,801
You're that excited to split up with me?

769
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,942
Wait a minute, weren't you the one
who threatened me with separation?

770
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,456
This is what you wanted!

771
00:48:24,893 --> 00:48:25,900
Besides,

772
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,831
this relationship isn't going anywhere!

773
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:31,173
You're an asshole, Fredie!

774
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:32,261
Go to hell!

775
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,576
Go to hell!

776
00:49:10,768 --> 00:49:11,922
Where's my wife?

777
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:13,590
She made me come here.

778
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,683
Who are you?

779
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,980
Meet my friend, Mela.

780
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,167
Mela, my husband, Fredie.

781
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,378
Hello, sir.

782
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:34,844
Hello.

783
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:47,818
Let's go home?

784
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,363
Here's your coffee.

785
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:02,343
Thank you.

786
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,499
Good morning.

787
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,418
Good morning.

788
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,424
Come on,

789
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:21,675
join us.

790
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,469
Have you been together long?

791
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:34,563
Five years?

792
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,567
Please. Join us.

793
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,568
Thank you.

794
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,503
Do you have any children?

795
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,773
I don't have any, by choice.

796
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,760
But Fred's children are in the US

797
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,681
with his first wife.

798
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:13,671
How was your night?

799
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:16,730
I don't know.

800
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:18,231
I have no idea.

801
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,201
Have you been doing this for a while?

802
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:34,604
It's mine and Fred's first time
having a threesome.

803
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,668
Actually,

804
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,921
I didn’t expect that Amor was that wild.

805
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,173
Love, stop it!

806
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,134
You should go to the office.

807
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,470
Alright, love.

808
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,995
You need to return to Ilaya.

809
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:58,490
My presence needs to be felt there
before I file my candidacy for governor.

810
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,148
Sure.

811
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,484
Use my driver,

812
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,444
so you won't have a hard time driving.

813
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,196
- Alright? Okay.
- Thanks, love.

814
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:12,010
I need to go.

815
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:14,152
Nice meeting you, Mela.

816
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:15,666
Nice meeting you, too.

817
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:22,089
- Bye, love.
- Bye.

818
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,302
You can endure that?

819
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,848
I worked hard
to get to where I am today.

820
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:39,010
And I'm not going to let that whore
of a secretary to get what I have.

821
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,608
I did what you asked.

822
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,991
What about our deal?

823
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:49,614
Don't worry.

824
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,118
I'll send the two million
to your bank account.

825
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,787
That's not what we talked about.

826
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,789
My husband's freedom.

827
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,253
I'll tell Fred. That's going to be easy.

828
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,174
And it seems like he likes you.

829
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,305
Carmela?

830
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,893
Can I ask you something?

831
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:18,963
What is it?

832
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,773
I saw the bruises on your body.

833
00:57:28,588 --> 00:57:31,591
I got into an accident the other day.

834
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,742
Does your husband beat you?

835
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,287
That is none of your business, Mrs. Ibasco.

836
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,624
Amor. Call me Amor.

837
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,260
I'm a woman, too.

838
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,712
I know what you're going through.

839
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:50,926
Then you shouldn't be
dragging another woman

840
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,386
through this shitshow
for your personal gain!

841
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:03,651
Ma'am, wait a minute.

842
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,856
Wait, why?

843
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,025
Boss said you should stay here.

844
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:08,814
Huh?

845
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,530
We didn't agree on this!

846
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,240
Is this true?

847
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:14,177
Yes, ma'am!

848
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:15,134
Amor!

849
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:16,927
We didn't agree on this, what now?

850
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:17,869
Just a minute.

851
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,336
Cannot be reached.

852
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,755
Ma'am, you need to get going.

853
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,063
Amor!

854
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,550
I'm coming with you!

855
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:32,567
Just stay here.

856
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,718
I'm coming with you, Amor!

857
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,713
Just stay here.

858
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,196
I don't want to!

859
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,055
- Amor!
- Please.

860
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,804
Just stay here!

861
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:38,814
Amor!

862
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,310
Amor, don't leave me here!

863
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,604
Amor!

864
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,982
Amor, I'm coming with you!

865
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:13,717
Good evening, sir.

866
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:16,118
Good evening.

867
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:19,759
Park that.

868
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,654
Is that how you greet people?

869
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,501
To monsters?

870
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,704
Yeah.

871
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,819
Why did you imprison me here?

872
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,705
I didn't imprison you.

873
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,959
I just asked the security
to keep you here until I came back.

874
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,713
This is kidnapping, dipshit.

875
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,384
Let's say...

876
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,637
I just want to know you more.

877
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:00,931
Okay.

878
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,850
My name is Carmela Raymundo.

879
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:09,814
I'm the wife of the thief
who stole cows from your ranch.

880
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,401
Your crazy wife forced me

881
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,585
to have sex with you
in exchange for my husband's freedom.

882
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:18,983
Are we clear?

883
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,921
You know me now?

884
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,648
Please let me go, Congressman.

885
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,380
I love your honesty.

886
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,351
You and your wife are both crazy.

887
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,867
Is that all Amor offered you?

888
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,432
I'm sure there's more.

889
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,686
Two million pesos.

890
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,564
I can offer

891
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,358
five times that.

892
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,903
My husband's freedom is what I want.

893
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,154
Wish granted.

894
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,675
What do you mean?

895
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,820
Your husband is now free.

896
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:06,530
My job is done here.

897
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,043
I'll give you ten million.

898
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,630
Just stay with me, Mela.

899
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:22,429
Jojo Raymundo!

900
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,392
Yes, sir?

901
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,614
You're free!

902
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,223
I'm free?

903
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,141
Yeah, don't you want to?

904
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:27,015
I'm coming!

905
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:30,895
Alright!

906
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,998
Take care guys!

907
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,148
Hurry up!

908
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:35,333
I'm coming, sir!

909
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,257
Hurry!

910
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,403
Take care!

911
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:39,921
I will, I will!

912
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:40,714
Wait for me there.

913
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,164
Take care, you guys!

914
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,368
- Say hi to your wives for me!
- Over there.

915
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,484
Log out here.

916
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,044
I'll go ahead, sir, alright?

917
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:55,103
Yes, you're free now.

918
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,171
I'm not going to do that again.

919
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,213
Don't come back here alright?

920
01:01:57,238 --> 01:01:58,148
Never!

921
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,664
I'm going to eat something delicious.

922
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:13,460
Let's go, boss!

923
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,330
Right there, sir.

924
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,793
Here's my payment.
Thank you!

925
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,215
Carmela?

926
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:44,969
Carmela?

927
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,057
Carmela?

928
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,475
Jojo?

929
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,769
- Hey, miss Venus!
- You got out!

930
01:02:52,794 --> 01:02:53,728
Yeah!

931
01:02:53,753 --> 01:02:54,954
Where's Carmela?

932
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,148
Have you seen her?

933
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:58,383
She hasn't come home
for several days now.

934
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,390
Is that so?

935
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,446
Did she mention where she was going?

936
01:03:03,754 --> 01:03:04,672
Oh, no.

937
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,450
And it's been a while
since there was anyone in your house.

938
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,160
Okay, I'll go.

939
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,976
Thank you, miss Venus.

940
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,797
Carmela, where are you?

941
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,638
I wonder why the congressman called for us.

942
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:34,978
Good morning, sir.

943
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,271
Good morning to you all.

944
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:39,816
I'll make this quick.

945
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,444
As the 17th Congress draws to a close,

946
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,696
I want to announce

947
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,075
that I am laying off
some people in Congress,

948
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,076
including those in my own office.

949
01:03:50,816 --> 01:03:52,193
This means that

950
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,916
only the transitional team
will operate starting next week.

951
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,628
The person I'm appointing

952
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,090
as the interim Chief-of-Staff

953
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:07,010
is Miss Karen Mendiaje.

954
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:10,687
She'll be in charge of
the transitional team.

955
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,308
Don't worry!

956
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,604
I'll find a position in my campaign
for those who are laid-off.

957
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,217
Because next week,

958
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,209
I will file my candidacy for governor

959
01:04:24,248 --> 01:04:25,612
for the Province of Ilaya.

960
01:04:28,815 --> 01:04:29,916
So don't feel bad.

961
01:04:30,091 --> 01:04:32,260
I'd also like to introduce to you

962
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,873
my new personal assistant.

963
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:37,196
Carmela Raymundo.

964
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,962
You may return to your tasks.

965
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,818
Congressman, may I talk to you?

966
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:52,567
Sure.

967
01:04:53,032 --> 01:04:54,271
In private.

968
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,982
- Go inside the office.
- Sure.

969
01:05:08,478 --> 01:05:10,798
Who told you I wanted
to be the Chief of Staff

970
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,115
for the transitional team?

971
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,871
No one. I just said it.

972
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,678
You didn't even think
to ask me if I wanted the post?

973
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:25,568
Wait a damn minute.
Am I not in charge here?

974
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,259
Fredie, my position is coterminous!

975
01:05:29,284 --> 01:05:31,763
If you're no longer in the chamber,
I won't be there either!

976
01:05:32,574 --> 01:05:34,034
Are you trying to get rid of me?

977
01:05:34,943 --> 01:05:36,372
Is that what you're thinking?

978
01:05:36,397 --> 01:05:37,584
I think so!

979
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:41,364
Because you've found a
new personal assistant!

980
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,315
Wait, wait…

981
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:49,837
Shouldn't you just be grateful
that I gave you work?

982
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,170
A high position, at that!

983
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,992
I should hear nothing but thanks.

984
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:55,468
What about our relationship?

985
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,452
What relationship?

986
01:05:56,477 --> 01:05:57,896
Fuck, Fredie!

987
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,467
What are we?

988
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,422
You are one of my women.

989
01:06:08,558 --> 01:06:09,685
My whores.

990
01:06:10,544 --> 01:06:11,613
Relationship?

991
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,012
What relationship are you talking about?

992
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:15,804
There is nothing between us!

993
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,638
Now, if you don't want
the position I'm giving you,

994
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:24,286
you're free to go.

995
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:28,818
You son of a bitch!

996
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:08,166
My townspeople! My fellow Ilaoeños!

997
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:12,879
I want to introduce to you
the next governor of the province of Ilaya,

998
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,257
Governor Fredie Ibasco!

999
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,177
- Ibasco!
- Long live Governor Ibasco!

1000
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,345
Long live!

1001
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,513
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1002
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,349
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1003
01:07:26,685 --> 01:07:27,908
Gov, here.

1004
01:07:28,206 --> 01:07:29,207
Thank you.

1005
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,271
Long live the Ilaoeños!

1006
01:07:36,505 --> 01:07:38,883
This day was fated for me

1007
01:07:38,908 --> 01:07:42,826
to express my love to my hometown.

1008
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,523
I wish to share with you

1009
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:51,865
that I started here as barangay chairman,

1010
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,232
went on to be mayor,

1011
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:56,591
and now currently as congressman.

1012
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,079
I was fortunate to have been able to pass

1013
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,456
a very important law

1014
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:10,711
to help raise our poorest
from poverty here in Ilaya.

1015
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,510
This law will only gain importance

1016
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,304
if you elect me as your governor.

1017
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,229
Carmela!

1018
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,352
Next year will mark the enactment...

1019
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:27,120
Carmela!

1020
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,789
of Republic Act 19123,

1021
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:34,329
or the establishment of the
Ilaya International Free Port Zone!

1022
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:39,924
Just think of the thousands of jobs

1023
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,093
that this will provide for our citizens

1024
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,344
right here in Ilaya!

1025
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,173
You're not allowed here!
You're not allowed here!

1026
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:49,196
And I have more good news for you!

1027
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:54,469
I talked to someone with integrity

1028
01:08:54,643 --> 01:08:57,055
a brilliant man,

1029
01:08:57,294 --> 01:08:59,938
and I chose him

1030
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:04,490
to become the chairman
of Ilaya International Free Port Zone.

1031
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,950
And it is none other than...

1032
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,411
Mayor Gerry Olivar!

1033
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:11,758
Let's clap our hands
for Mayor Gerry Olivar!

1034
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,613
Gerry Olivar, ladies and gentlemen!

1035
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:21,430
Mayor!

1036
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,410
Until next time!

1037
01:09:25,258 --> 01:09:28,024
This is Fredie Ibasco, your governor!

1038
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,668
Ibasco! Ibasco!

1039
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,547
Ibasco! Ibasco!

1040
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,479
Fredie.

1041
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,692
Amor, have a seat.

1042
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,533
Amor...

1043
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:48,636
Antonio's eyes almost
fell out of his sockets

1044
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,665
when you announced that Olivar
would be the chairman for the Free Port.

1045
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,127
I had to do what I had to do.

1046
01:10:57,696 --> 01:10:59,719
The investors didn't like Antonio.

1047
01:11:01,055 --> 01:11:03,454
You could have at least
informed him in advance!

1048
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,221
It's the same, Amor!

1049
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:16,439
Remember?

1050
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:21,376
The document I was asking you to work on.

1051
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,279
That...

1052
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,365
needs your signature.

1053
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,696
But we're done with this, right?

1054
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:35,916
Did I say that?

1055
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,368
But...

1056
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,506
we've put this behind us, right?

1057
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:47,094
We're doing okay.

1058
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,139
You just need to sign!

1059
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,852
Fredie.

1060
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:58,411
Where is this coming from?

1061
01:12:04,799 --> 01:12:05,875
Amor.

1062
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,742
Weren't you the one

1063
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:12,524
who threatened me with separation?

1064
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,956
You made me realize
that I don't love you anymore.

1065
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,045
You monster!

1066
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,592
After everything that I've done
to make this marriage work!

1067
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,104
Let's not make this
difficult for either of us.

1068
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,298
I can blow your brains out right now.

1069
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:46,798
But I won't,

1070
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,448
out of respect for what we had together.

1071
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:51,784
So...

1072
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:53,661
choose.

1073
01:13:14,546 --> 01:13:15,524
Very good!

1074
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:23,207
You know this isn't legally binding

1075
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,055
because you had a gun on me.

1076
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,324
Take it to court.

1077
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,244
That's if you live long enough.

1078
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:40,704
Cheers!

1079
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,215
Sir, ma'am is here.

1080
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,424
- Thank you.
- Thank you sir!

1081
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:37,106
Good evening, Amor!

1082
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:38,679
Good evening, Antonio.

1083
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:42,937
Can I join you for a drink?

1084
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,317
Yeah. Sure!

1085
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,699
Help yourself.

1086
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:47,395
Thank you.

1087
01:15:00,585 --> 01:15:01,653
Look at us.

1088
01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:04,738
The loser's bench.

1089
01:15:08,878 --> 01:15:09,980
Antonio?

1090
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,009
How do you tolerate
Fredie's constant bullying?

1091
01:15:16,744 --> 01:15:17,847
And you, Amor?

1092
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,767
How much longer
can you endure his abuse?

1093
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,735
That demon will get what's coming to him.

1094
01:15:33,657 --> 01:15:35,450
I am a much worse demon, Amor.

1095
01:15:38,758 --> 01:15:39,964
What do you mean?

1096
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,738
When you're done moping,

1097
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:48,387
let's talk about how
to get back at Fredie.

1098
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,255
- Cheers.
- Cheers to that!

1099
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,776
For governor!

1100
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,069
- Ibasco!
- Ibasco!

1101
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,822
Vote! Vote for!

1102
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,074
Vote! Vote for!

1103
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,409
- Ibasco!
- Ibasco!

1104
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:06,495
Fredie Ibasco for governor!

1105
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,499
Not just for me but for the Ilaoeños,

1106
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:12,251
in the province of Ilaya!

1107
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,074
Carmela! Carmela!

1108
01:16:15,132 --> 01:16:17,903
- Vote for! Vote for!
- Carmela!

1109
01:16:17,928 --> 01:16:19,207
Carmela!

1110
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:21,677
- Vote! Vote for!
- Ibasco! Ibasco!

1111
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:22,870
- Carmela!
- Ibasco! Ibasco!

1112
01:16:22,895 --> 01:16:24,926
- Carmela!
- You're not allowed here!

1113
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,208
Carmela! Carmela!

1114
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:29,344
Carmela!

1115
01:16:29,942 --> 01:16:31,061
Carmela!

1116
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,645
Carmela! Carmela!

1117
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:36,050
Ibasco! Ibasco!

1118
01:16:36,075 --> 01:16:37,488
Fuck, that's my wife!

1119
01:16:38,371 --> 01:16:39,887
Carmela!

1120
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:56,573
Delicious!

1121
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,411
Hey, boss, what's going on?

1122
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:06,263
No more questions! Get him!

1123
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,442
Wait a minute!

1124
01:17:07,682 --> 01:17:08,432
- Get up!
- Get up!

1125
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,926
Enough with the questions, get him!

1126
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,801
- Boss!
- Just follow us!

1127
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:13,979
Boss my ass!

1128
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,022
What did I do?

1129
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,028
Put him inside!

1130
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:17,879
- Hurry!
- What is this? Boss!

1131
01:17:18,316 --> 01:17:19,588
Boss, please!

1132
01:17:20,582 --> 01:17:21,874
Boss, come on!

1133
01:17:25,105 --> 01:17:26,101
Go!

1134
01:17:26,831 --> 01:17:27,803
Boss!

1135
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,254
Boss!

1136
01:17:51,379 --> 01:17:52,738
What did I do, boss?

1137
01:17:52,763 --> 01:17:54,449
What have I done wrong?

1138
01:17:58,449 --> 01:18:00,068
Jojo Raymundo, right?

1139
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,981
You're the wife of
Congressman Ibasco, right?

1140
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,639
I'm going to cut to the chase.

1141
01:18:06,361 --> 01:18:08,707
Your wife and my
husband have a relationship.

1142
01:18:11,223 --> 01:18:12,409
I know.

1143
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,983
I saw them during the proclamation rally.

1144
01:18:16,847 --> 01:18:18,052
I had a hunch.

1145
01:18:20,317 --> 01:18:21,569
Mrs. Ibasco,

1146
01:18:21,734 --> 01:18:24,716
I tried to get to my wife,
but I couldn't!

1147
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,996
My wife seems like
a completely different person!

1148
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,042
You want to get your wife back?

1149
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:35,229
How?

1150
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:37,629
Give me the gun.

1151
01:18:50,298 --> 01:18:51,466
What am I going to do with this?

1152
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:55,316
Wait for him during his campaign.

1153
01:18:58,608 --> 01:18:59,751
Mrs. Ibasco!

1154
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,904
You want me to kill Congressman Ibasco?

1155
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,652
What if I don't want to?

1156
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,657
I've forgiven you once for your sins!

1157
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,848
I'm running out of patience with you!

1158
01:19:12,775 --> 01:19:13,870
This fucker!

1159
01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:15,667
What the hell, boss.

1160
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,194
This coming election,
don't forget to vote for--

1161
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:27,596
Ibasco! Ibasco!

1162
01:19:27,621 --> 01:19:30,708
Ibasco! Ibasco!

1163
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,097
Ibasco!

1164
01:19:33,443 --> 01:19:35,996
Vote for! Vote for!

1165
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:39,731
For the development
of the province of Ilaya!

1166
01:19:39,756 --> 01:19:42,317
- Ibasco!
- Ibasco!

1167
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,168
Vote for! Vote for!

1168
01:19:45,193 --> 01:19:47,699
Fredie Ibasco!

1169
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:56,183
Jojo! Jojo!

1170
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,476
Jojo!

1171
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,478
Jojo!

1172
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,687
Jojo!

1173
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,022
Jojo!

1174
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,316
Go to your husband
so it's not obvious!

1175
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,384
Fredie!

1176
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:07,121
Fredie, my husband!

1177
01:20:08,465 --> 01:20:09,958
Fredie!

1178
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,282
Fredie, my husband!

1179
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,118
Jojo!

1180
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,286
Wake up!

1181
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,396
Fredie!

1182
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:18,543
Fredie!

1183
01:20:19,793 --> 01:20:21,879
Fredie!

1184
01:20:47,215 --> 01:20:48,485
Good afternoon.

1185
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,949
Good afternoon.
Is Mrs. Raymundo there?

1186
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,603
Mela? There are police outside
asking for you.

1187
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:02,175
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1188
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:03,692
Good afternoon, sir.

1189
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:07,715
Could we get a statement from you?
It won't take long.

1190
01:21:08,157 --> 01:21:11,133
Ma'am, did you know anyone
who talked with your husband

1191
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,368
before he killed Congressman Ibasco?

1192
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:15,238
I don't know anything about that.

1193
01:21:15,589 --> 01:21:18,789
The last time I saw Jojo was in prison

1194
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,934
when he got caught for stealing cows.

1195
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,294
Are you sure, ma'am?

1196
01:21:22,406 --> 01:21:23,918
You haven't talked since then?

1197
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:25,121
Yes sir.

1198
01:21:25,383 --> 01:21:26,754
I'm very sure.

1199
01:21:26,779 --> 01:21:27,826
Okay, ma'am.

1200
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:31,945
My condolences, madam.

1201
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,639
I can't imagine what you're going through.

1202
01:21:33,664 --> 01:21:36,363
Thank you so much for coming.

1203
01:21:37,228 --> 01:21:40,754
- Help me find justice for my husband.
- Condolences.

1204
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:45,003
Mrs. Ibasco, we'd like
to offer our condolences.

1205
01:21:45,028 --> 01:21:46,153
Thank you.

1206
01:21:49,714 --> 01:21:51,205
Sir, ma'am is here.

1207
01:22:11,796 --> 01:22:13,598
My condolences, Amor.

1208
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,902
I decided not to bring
our children here anymore.

1209
01:22:18,049 --> 01:22:19,058
But…

1210
01:22:19,572 --> 01:22:22,167
we are truly mourning with your family.

1211
01:22:22,841 --> 01:22:24,863
Thank you so much, Minerva.

1212
01:22:25,956 --> 01:22:27,339
Do you want to see him?

1213
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,050
Yes, please.

1214
01:22:56,816 --> 01:23:01,153
I remember so many good things
in my relationship with Fredie.

1215
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:05,582
But most of all, he
brought out the best in me.

1216
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,942
The night before he filed for candidacy,

1217
01:23:10,179 --> 01:23:13,870
I remember telling him that I was nervous…

1218
01:23:14,932 --> 01:23:19,785
The same nerves I had
at the eve of our wedding.

1219
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,153
He even joked that

1220
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:27,488
maybe this was the sign that

1221
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,442
he should get married
to the townspeople of Ilaya.

1222
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,246
So I am wholeheartedly giving my thanks

1223
01:23:36,287 --> 01:23:41,012
for the unyielding support that you have
for Congressman Fredie Ibasco.

1224
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:47,097
With so many of you
who came to mourn with us,

1225
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,957
I know my husband's
death was not for naught.

1226
01:23:53,152 --> 01:23:58,504
So I shall make a promise
to the Lord and to him,

1227
01:23:58,752 --> 01:24:04,153
that I won't stop
until I get the justice he deserves.

1228
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:10,129
I will make sure that the person
responsible will be held accountable

1229
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:12,317
for my husband's death.

1230
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:16,621
Justice for Governor Ibasco!

1231
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,013
So I, Amor Ibasco,

1232
01:24:20,132 --> 01:24:24,918
declare that I will run as governor
for the Province of Ilaya.

1233
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:34,139
In place of my husband Congressman Ibasco.

1234
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,155
This is for you, my darling.

1235
01:24:37,802 --> 01:24:41,645
Justice for Congressman Ibasco!

1236
01:25:09,052 --> 01:25:10,737
Why did you bring me here?

1237
01:25:10,762 --> 01:25:12,879
Go on, get inside.
Ma'am is waiting for you.

1238
01:25:12,925 --> 01:25:13,973
Who?

1239
01:25:14,096 --> 01:25:15,817
Come with me.

1240
01:25:25,474 --> 01:25:26,566
Follow me.

1241
01:25:35,528 --> 01:25:37,957
Go on up.
She's been waiting for you.

1242
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:15,176
It's over, Carmela.

1243
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:17,387
Amor,

1244
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:18,903
I don't want this anymore.

1245
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:21,379
You've gotten everything you wanted.

1246
01:26:23,334 --> 01:26:24,293
Relax.

1247
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:27,958
I brought you here to help you.

1248
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:50,664
What's this for?

1249
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:55,410
We both suffered
at the hands of our husbands.

1250
01:26:55,732 --> 01:26:56,925
Now,

1251
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,988
we can get what we deserve.

1252
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:05,028
Are you asking me to leave?

1253
01:27:06,356 --> 01:27:08,503
I just want you to relax, Carmela.

1254
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,964
Until the election ends.

1255
01:27:12,706 --> 01:27:13,832
I'll take care of you.

1256
01:27:15,662 --> 01:27:18,035
You abandoned me once before...

1257
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,660
when you left me with Fredie.

1258
01:27:22,058 --> 01:27:23,967
How do you expect me to trust you?

1259
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,741
I couldn't do anything then.

1260
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:29,427
Like you,

1261
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:31,981
I was scared of what Fredie would do!

1262
01:27:33,802 --> 01:27:35,449
Before he died,

1263
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:40,442
he forced me to sign this.

1264
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:48,105
He pointed a gun at me.

1265
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:53,996
I'm still scared about what could happen.

1266
01:27:55,653 --> 01:27:58,082
Both of us are victims, Carmela.

1267
01:28:02,662 --> 01:28:04,121
Fredie is gone!

1268
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,426
So is your husband!

1269
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,606
We're free!

1270
01:28:17,846 --> 01:28:20,183
I will never abandon you.

1271
01:28:57,895 --> 01:29:01,102
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1272
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:04,940
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1273
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:11,655
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1274
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,273
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1275
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:21,456
Say it with me.

1276
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:22,750
- I,
- I,

1277
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:24,668
- Your name,
- Amor Ibasco,

1278
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,379
- do solemnly swear,
- do solemnly swear,

1279
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:30,590
that I will faithfully
and conscientiously fulfill

1280
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,368
that I will faithfully
and conscientiously fulfill

1281
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,745
my duties as governor of Ilaya.

1282
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:38,139
my duties as governor of Ilaya.

1283
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:41,501
That I will obey the laws
of the Republic of the Philippines,

1284
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:44,379
That I will obey the laws
of the Republic of the Philippines,

1285
01:29:44,404 --> 01:29:45,605
so help me God.

1286
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,726
so help me God.

1287
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:51,236
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1288
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:54,656
- Long live Governor Ibasco!
- Long live!

1289
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:57,851
- Long live!
- Long live!

1290
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,770
Thank you, each and everyone of you.

1291
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:05,608
I promise to become
an outstanding governor for Ilaya.

1292
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:16,511
So I'll make this quick.

1293
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,221
I would like you all to welcome

1294
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,764
My executive assistant,

1295
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,226
Carmela Raymundo.

1296
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:32,135
In the entire existence of our province,

1297
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,242
men have always taken the lead.

1298
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:36,948
It is only right that this time, us women,

1299
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:39,826
should care for our
town as a mother should.

1300
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,383
Long live!

1301
01:30:41,837 --> 01:30:43,570
Long live!

1302
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:45,562
Long live!

1303
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,914
Long live!
