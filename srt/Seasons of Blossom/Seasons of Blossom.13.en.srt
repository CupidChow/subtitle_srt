1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,710
Bo Mi.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,170
The wish we talked about before, can I use that now?

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
The ghost story that we heard today.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,100
If I say that's my older brother's story,

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,650
will you trust me?

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,950
Didn't you tell me that you were an only child?

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,510
Six years ago, on a rainy day,

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,630
the top student in the school committed suicide.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,670
That was my brother.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,570
The only difference was that it was at the apartment rooftop, not the school.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,430
Are you okay?

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,510
There are times like that.

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,360
Look at their incredible looks!

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,100
Don't they look like they jumped out of comic books?

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,390
Yes, I totally agree!

16
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,050
Someone you've never been interested in before,

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,940
Jin Young. I have a crush on Choi Jin Young.

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,910
...there are moments when you become conscious about them.

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,130
Jin Young, what do you think about Bo Mi?

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,580
Bo Mi's very pretty and kind.

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,740
- Isn't it a bit strange?
- What is?

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,580
That she doesn't even know me that well, but she says she has a crush on me.

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,970
I don't know why that's strange.

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,980
From today, I'll be taking care of the art classroom cleaning. Does any of you want to do it voluntarily?

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,830
I'll do it.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,920
Okay. Thank you, Bo Mi.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,410
So, Jin Young wanted to check.

28
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,100
We need one more person.

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,290
I'll do it.

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,060
Okay, Jin Young.

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,530
And when he checked that reason, he got disgruntled.

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,530
It's weird.

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,120
I thought you liked me.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,680
What's the real reason for you to date Yoon Bom?

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,280
He didn't want to see Bo Mi getting along with the person she liked.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,440
He got disgruntled like that.

37
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,430
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,930
We are on the same team.

39
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,000
Let me get through first.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,930
At first, it was only getting disgruntled.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,620
Done cleaning!

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:27,480
That disgruntled feeling changed into something else before he knew it.

43
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,930
I'm screwed.

44
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,130
[Episode 13: Things that I couldn't protect]

45
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,790
You told me that you want to see my brother's diary.

46
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,560
You'll realize it if you read it.

47
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,210
You'll know how much you meant to my brother

48
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,250
and how much he needed you.

49
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,330
Jae Min.

50
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,900
Why didn't you stay next to my brother until the very end?

51
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,790
You were the only place for him to go back to.

52
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,040
After my brother died,

53
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,850
my parents got divorced not that much later.

54
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,330
So it was more difficult to talk about my brother at home.

55
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,060
But then my mom got remarried, so I moved back to Seoul.

56
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,050
I thought if I came to the school where my brother went,

57
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,680
I would know something about him.

58
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:17,600
But then I happened to meet someone who knew about my brother.

59
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,680
Ha Min...

60
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,530
Then is your brother's name..?

61
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,370
That's right.

62
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,860
It's Lee Ha Min.

63
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,870
If I hadn't met you,

64
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:02,320

- He did it from the roof.
- Isn't that insane?

68
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,420
It was from the apartment rooftop.

73
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,940

Something has gone wrong.

78

I was fine with it before.

83

But now, I don't know how to endure without you.

84
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,580
Maybe just live like that, losing everything.

118

Probably, it's a lie.

Why did you break up with Bo Mi?

137
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,530
You two had a great relationship, so I don't understand why you broke up suddenly.

138
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,890
It's because I didn't want to be in the way.

139
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,420
What?

140

You like Yoon Bo Mi.

And she likes you as well.

142
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,920
I didn't want to be in the way of you two, so I backed out.

143
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,850
So why don't you two hit it off?

144
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,310
- Excuse me first.
- Okay, have a good evening.

I'm sorry to ask you to see me abruptly.

149
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,080
I only had time today because I have an early morning flight tomorrow.

150
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,800
How did you get my number?

151
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,720
It's not a great secret.

152
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,510
It comes out when you ask around our friends.

153
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,890
So why did you want to see me?

154
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,260
Even so, we went to school together. Why are you being so cold to me?

155
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:28,130
When I saw you on the street last time, I was reminded of Lee Ha Min.

156
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,110
I forgot about him for a while after we graduated from high school.

157
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:38,790
So I contacted my friends from that time, and they told me you are a trainee teacher in our school.

158
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,100
When I heard that, I thought I should see you at least once.

159
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,230
It's because of Lee Ha Min, isn't it?

160
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,450
What?

161
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,810
Actually, I knew everything already.

162
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,620
I knew about you and Lee Ha Min's relationship.

163
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,840
Can you come to that thing we planned with the other guys?

164
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,480
Why are you not saying anything? Can you come?

165
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,300
Lee Ha Min, are you listening to me?

166
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,370
I'm sorry. What were you talking about it?

167
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,670
You've been acting really strange lately.

168
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,070
What's going on?

169
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,830
It's nothing.

170
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,000
I guess I haven't adjusted back yet after the break.

171
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,400
I'm asking you this just in case.

172
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,740
Did you get a girlfriend?

173
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,920
Who is it?

174
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,790
Is it someone I know?

175
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,740
Who's the girl for you to have trouble telling me?

176
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,170
It's not that girl, is it?

177
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,750
- Ji Seon.
- It is her.

178
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,980
Why? Did that loser wiggle her tail, acting all pitiful?

179
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,040
Even so, it's not like a donation. Why would you date someone like her—

180
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,030
I'm sorry. But I don't want you to speak of her like that.

181
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,170
What?

182
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,740
I like So Mang a lot.

183
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,270
So I don't want you to speak carelessly of someone I like.

184
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,120
Also, don't bully her for no reason.

185
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,490
So then what?

186
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,680
Then what are you going to do?

187
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,020
I don't want to lose a friend.

188
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,240
I still consider you my good friend.

189
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,440
Looking at your face, I guess you had no idea about this.

190
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,280
Right, I thought Lee Ha Min would've not told you about it.

191
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,400
Why are you saying this to me?

192
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,680
Are you telling me this so that I can live in guilt for the rest of my life?

193
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,910
Honestly, it's none of my business for you to forget Lee Ha Min or not.

194
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,040
But I think at least he wouldn't want you to live like this.

195

196
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,990
By the way, Bo Mi, why did you break up with Jin Young?

197
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,340
Well, it's because...

198
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,870
Hey! Why are you asking something like that?

199
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,450
It's no use fixating on a relationship that's already over. Don't think about it.

200
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,840
It's strange. I thought Jin Young really liked Bo Mi a lot.

201
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,060
Hey, stop it. Let's go back to cleaning.

202
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,790
Yoon Bo Mi.

203
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:56,180
I thought you had a crush on me.

204
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,850
I got a little bit of selfish hope.

205
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:17,200
You, at the time, might have felt the same way as I do now.

206
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,540
I got that kind of hope.

207
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,750
Maltese Kang!

208
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,530
What are you doing here?

209
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,790
I'm going to get tteokbokki with Yoon Bom after.

210
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,880
Will it be okay to leave Bo Mi and Jin Young like that? I think it'll be awkward.

211
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,260
Leave them alone. That's all part of getting used to the breakup.

212
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,990
See you tomorrow!

213
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,330
Gyu Ri, mind your own business.

214
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,320
- Mind your own business!
- You, too!

215
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,290
Lee Jae Min, do you want to come with us?

216
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,590
Who do you eat lunch with these days?

217
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,950
I haven't seen you in the cafeteria.

218
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,910
It's the same as usual. I'm eating with Tae Jin and Ui Joon.

219
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,670
Also, I didn't eat lunch from school that much before.

220
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,140
I ate with you for the time being because I had to pretend to date you.

221
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,240
It felt strange not to be around you after always staying together.

222
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,780
Did you not feel that way, Jin Young?

223
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,240
Are you curious about what I've been up to?

224
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,320
Or do you have something else you want to say to me?

225
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:44,270
I know it'll sound weird to ask you now.

226
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,110
But why did you suggest that we start a relationship?

227
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,540
I thought about it and thought there was no reason for you to help me.

228
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,980
What was the reason for you to help me to such an extent?

229
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,080
It's because I was annoyed.

230
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,640
What?

231
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,300
Seeing you pretending to be nice in the name of doing it for your friend was annoying.

232
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,740
So I wanted to see how far you'd go.

233
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,670
But I didn't expect you to really pretend to have a relationship with me.

234
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:34,270
Even if Kang Seon Hee likes him, Lee Jae Min doesn't seem to care about her.

235
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,540
- Jin Young.
- Why don't you date Lee Jae Min now?

236
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,260
I think he still has feelings for you—

237
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,870
What a load of bullshit.

238
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,200
At that moment,

239
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,900
everything that Bo Mi wanted to protect...

240
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,890
went off track completely.
