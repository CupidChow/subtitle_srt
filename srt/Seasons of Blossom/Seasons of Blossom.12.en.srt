1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,640
You surprised me! Was it you who called me?

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,930
Please don't move. I'm recharging right now.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,140
What should I do now?

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,310
I don't know how to endure without you anymore.

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,380
Hello, there.

6
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,900
Weren't you just in the art classroom with Lee Ha Min?

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,810
I think you saw it wrong. I—

8
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,820
I saw you two hugging. What are you talking about?

9
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,510
What's going on, Seung Jae?

10
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,610
Look at you, Lee Ha Min.

11
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,510
You pretended to be so clean in the front but you did all kinds of dirty things in the back.

12
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,320
I don't know what you are talking about right now. Aren't you delusional?

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,300
Right, right. I knew you would come out like this.

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,990
There's no point in me arguing with you.

15
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,310
I'll go to the others and reveal your true selves.

16
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,210
Why don't you go first? I need to talk with him.

17
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,030
Hurry up.

18
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,140
- Where do you think you are going?
- Hey, you.

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,470
How can you do this to your classmates?

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,280
But apart from this, there's something I need to check.

21
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,060
There was a report that someone witnessed an inappropriate dating situation in the art classroom.

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,920
If those students are among you guys, it'll be better to tell me honestly now.

23
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,310
Sir, I told you that I saw it with my two eyes!

24
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,960
Be quiet!

25
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,770
So Mang, since you took the art classroom keys every lunch break, I'm asking you just to verify it.

26
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,390
It's true that I go to the art classroom often...

27
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,090
It's correct that the one who Seung Jae saw is me.

28
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,440
But she's not.

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,770
Ha Min.

30
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,750
She's just my classmate, and that's all. I don't even know her that well.

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,630
Then, how did you go into the art classroom?

32
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,270
I copied the keys.

33
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,400
Since it was a hassle to get them whenever I had to do an errand.

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,870
Give them to me.

35
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,370
Kids like you unexpectedly do make a big incident once in a while.

36
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,130
I know you have been stressed out lately.

37
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,580
I'm sorry, sir.

38
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,520
Ha Min and Seung Jae, you two should stay here until your parents arrive.

39
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,790
And So Mang, you may go now.

40
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,380
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,550
It felt like I was being a burden to you.

42
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,980
It made me feel like I was ruining you.

43
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,590
So it made me more and more anxious.

44
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,840
Wouldn't it be better to tell the truth about what happened in the art classroom?

45
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,640
It seems like you are getting misjudged.

46
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,730
Just leave it as it is.

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,600
It might make you have strange rumors, too.

48
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:47,370
Then, let me know immediately if something happens to you. Okay?

49
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,490
I will.

50
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,290
Let's not see each other for the time being.

51
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,760
When it all dies down, let's see each other then.

52
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,370
Okay, I get it.

53
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:13,080
By the way, can I ask you a favor?

54
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,700
Sure. What is it?

55
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,680
Han So Mang, come out here for a second.

56
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,380
I can't, Mom. I'm busy right now.

57
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,610
Why did you not tell me that your grades came out?

58
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,160
That's right...

59
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,930
I still regret that moment.

60
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,830
Huh?
[The message has been deleted.]

61
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,960
If I read your message at the time...

62
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,010
I'm sorry. My mom called me out. What was your text?

63
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,920
[Ha Min: The message has been deleted.]

64
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,770
[I'm sorry. My mom called me. What was your text?]

65
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,330
[Episode 12: A belated sincerity]

66
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,580
Would we have been any different?
[Episode 12: A belated sincerity]

67
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,280
Now that I think of it, there is not that much left.

68
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,110
Of what?

69
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,250
The time that we are dating.

70
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,080
So what do you want to do about it, Jin Young?

71
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,470
What do you want to do?

72
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,230
When your feelings grow bigger, the courage becomes smaller.

73
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:15,020
Then let's talk about it again in a week.

74
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,310
Okay, let's do that.

75
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,210
Is that okay with you?

76
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,940
What do you think about it, Jin Young?

77
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,330
I'm fine either way. What's important is your idea.

78
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,890
It makes you hide your expectations and pretends to be okay.

79
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,080
I'll think about it.

80
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,040
Thank you.

81
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:53,680
Liking someone is very difficult like that.

82
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,910
Jin Young, let's go to get lunch.

83
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,950
Jin Young's not eating with us now.

84
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh, I forgot about it. He's eating with Bo Mi now.

85
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,720
Let's go.

86
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,380
I'll eat lunch with the guys today.

87
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,350
Okay, I'll see you later.

88
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,240
- What's going on today?
- I know.

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,060
I'll ask him to help me with the game today. Let's go!

90
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,630
What's today's lunch menu?

91
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,260
Ithink it is pork cutlet.

92
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,540
Isn't it spicy pork?

93
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,120
Is something on your mind?

94
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,080
There has been for a while, but I'm giving up now.

95
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,720
Giving up?

96
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,060
"This is my reality, so let's not get too cocky." I was thinking something like that.

97
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,350
I know everything in my head, but it's hard to accept.

98
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,900
There are times like that. It's like when you know everything but can't do what you want.

99
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,870
Yes! I got the last piece!

100
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,910
By the way, Jae Min, why are you not telling me your wish?

101
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,540
You always listen to me only.

102
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,480
Don't worry about it. I'll tell you my wish soon.

103
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,940
- Let's go to the staircase.
- What?

104
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,800
Why suddenly?

105
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,690
What are you guys doing here?

106
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,600
Well, we are eating bread...

107
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,270
Oh, my! I bought a different one because that one was sold out, but I guess you guys bought them all.

108
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,100
Do you want me to exchange it with you..?

109
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,640
Thanks.

110
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,050
Are you stealing now?

111
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,980
Didn't you hear him suggest it first?

112
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,730
But why are you here?

113
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,050
The lunch menu wasn't great today.

114
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,240
Don't joke with me. You are avoiding Yoon Bom right now.

115
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,810
Don't leave Yoon Bom alone for too long.

116
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,050
Yoon Bom thinks too much. She's a person who digs tunnels down by herself.

117
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,180
So don't let her waste her time shoveling by herself.

118
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,580
Anyway, I heard that they were smooching and holding crazily.

119
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,570
Wow, Lee Ha Min is crazy. How did he think to do so in the art classroom?

120
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,420
Hey, do you think he would've done that only in the art classroom?

121
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,750
I'm sure he went to the storage, the gym, and the student council room.

122
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,850
Look at him! It's disgusting.

123
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,600
He's that guy in the rumor, right?

124
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,350
I really saw it!

125
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,530
- Hey, did you hear about him?
- Is he the one from the art classroom rumor?

126
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,610
It didn't take that long time for the rumor to spread.

127
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,810
But, Ji Seon, I guess you must feel terrible. Weren't you close with him?

128
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,700
When was I close with him? He chased after me on his own.

129
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,680
I never thought I was friends with him.

130
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,880
Ha Min, who everyone admired,

131
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,940
his fall was perfect for everyone to gossip about.

132
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,460
- Sir.
- Yes, Ha Min.

133
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,060
- This is everyone's performance assessment.
- Yes, thank you for bringing it.

134
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,020
It does make him look different now.

135
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,990
Why don't you go back to your work?

136
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,680
But do you know who the girl he was with was?

137
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,760
Isn't that her?

138
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,230
I heard she was with Lee Ha Min and Choi Seung Jae when they were getting scolded.

139
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,810
Really?

140
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,800
Even so, Lee Ha Min has his level. Why would he be with such a loser?

141
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,430
Yeah? I bet what Ji Seon said is correct.

142
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,220
- Let's go to the canteen.
- Okay.

143
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,930
As much as people loved Ha Min,

144
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,190
or actually more than that, people started to hate him.

145
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,270
- Do you know what today's lunch is?
- I have no idea.

146
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,470
Guys, why don't you go first? I forgot something in the classroom.

147
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,030
What's up with Lee Ha Min again?

148
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,340
I don't know. He's been acting weird lately.

149
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,220
Did you guys hear about Lee Ha Min?

150
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,880
Isn't it disturbing? I didn't think he would be that kind of person.

151
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,610
Well...

152
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,330
But aren't you close with Lee Ha Min, So Mang?

153
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,480
If I had a little distance from you...

154
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,110
I'm not that close to him.

155
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,430
...I thought everything would be okay soon.

156
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,040
I thought we could be together soon.

157
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,110
But our reunion...

158
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,460
was a year later.

So Mang!

160
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,600
It was one day in July, right before our second summer vacation.

161
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,300
These are the materials we'll use in your class. Can you bring these to the art classroom?

162
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,970
Yes, sir.

163
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,400
Wait, but it'll be hard for you to carry alone.

164
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,710
- Hey, boy!
- Yes?

165
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,820
Can you help here?

166
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,900
Thank you for doing this.

167
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,110
It's been a while.

168
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,290
Has it been a year?

169
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,850
Did you change your phone number?

170
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,490
No.

171
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,940
Then did you deactivate it?

172
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,500
No.

173
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Then you were just ignoring my calls.

174
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,740
Your hair grew a lot.

175
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,160
I was too lazy to cut it.

176
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,450
I liked it when it was shorter.

177
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,280
Is that all you have to say?

178
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,230
It's been a year since we talked face to face.

179
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,470
I had so many things to ask and say to you until now.

180
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,560
But how can you just say that...?

181
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,520
You said you didn't know how to endure without me.

182
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,330
You asked me to stay next to you.

183
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,710
But why are you pushing me away like this all of a sudden?

184
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,940
The more you do so,

185
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,830
it makes me feel like you have vanished completely from my life.

186
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:39,220
It felt like the time we spent together was all a dream. Do you know how scared I was?

187
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,580
Why didn't you just think that way?

188
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,540
It might be better if you think of it as a dream

189
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,590
and forget about everything.

190
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,820
Follow me.

191
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,080
I heard that you have been having a hard time lately.

192
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,370
You were the top student in the school, but your grades keep falling,

193
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,650
so I heard the teachers were all in emergency mode.

194
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,680
Everyone's so interested in other people's business.

195
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,790
That's why I am more worried.

196
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,120
I am worried that you might suffer by doing something you don't want to do.

197
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,070
I decided to prepare for the tests to go to art school.

198
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,500
So speaking of it, are you going to give up painting like this?

199
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,260
Why don't you persuade your parents and prepare for the test together—

200
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,720
I just liked to paint.

201
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm not interested in preparing for the art school tests.

202

- But...
- And also, you as well.

203
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,550
Preparing for the art school tests doesn't suit you.

204
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,740
What about you?

205
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,450
Do you think preparing for medical school suits you?

206
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:43,120
At least I found my way of protecting what I like.

207
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,400
But what did you do?

208
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,490
Did you do anything else besides running away and giving up?

209
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,200
Maybe just live like that, losing everything.

210

Both painting and me.

211

You are a coward.

212
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,030
I certainly didn't mean it.

I was just worried about you.

214

Why did I say something I'd regret for the rest of my life?

Yes.

232

Do you know that a ghost comes out in the school on rainy days?

233

- A ghost?
- It's raining outside.

But that ghost...

235

was actually a student of this school.

236

Is the ghost our alumni?

237
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:31,570
He was a top student in the school, handsome, and popular.

238
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,200
Why would that kind of person be a ghost?

239
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,180
