00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,430
I think she left.

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,740
Why don't you go out first?

3
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,840
You made a strange face sometimes.

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,970
You drew this, didn't you?

5
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,730
How did you know that?

6
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,330
It looks like it.

7
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,160
The painting...

8
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,270
looks just like the painter.

9
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,260
What? Are you here to make fun of me?

10
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,660
Whenever you talk about this painting studio, you look really happy.

11
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,910
It made me curious about this space, wondering what kind of place can make someone that happy.

12
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,450
I wondered if I could also be happy if I came here.

13
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,380
Why didn't I know that at the time?

14
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,470
That all of these were the signs that you had been sending me.

16
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,390
Where are we going?

17
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,320
I don't know as well.

18
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,010
Then, why did you bring me out?

19
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,510
We can't get interrogated for the rest of the night.

20
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,100
Where is this place?

21
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,910
I come here often with my younger siblings.

22
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,110
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,570
I'm sorry that I didn't know that you had siblings, nor that you didn't like chocolates.

24
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,780
Now that I think about it, I could've asked you all these.

25
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,680
I was not caring enough.

26
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,350
It's not a family survey. You don't have to know all that.

27
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,270
And if it were really important, I would've told you already.

28
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,930
Right.

29
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,160
Then, what's your favorite beverage?

30
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,040
Something not sweet. I usually drink Americano.

Wow, you sound like an adult.

32
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,760
What's your favorite food?

33
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,130
- Instant noodles.

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,370
What's your favorite movie?

35
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,900
I only watch action movies.

36
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,690
And... what's your MBTI?

37
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,190
Mine's ENFJ.

38
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,890
MBT?

39
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,910
What's that?

40
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,180
I think you are ISTJ.

41
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,970
What's that? It's something bad, isn't it?

42
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,750
I don't know.

Let's just play one more time. How can you never let me win?

51
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,480
- I don't want to play anymore.
- You don't..?

52

It's not fun since you are terrible at it.

Okay, everyone, focus!

54
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,120
The first semester's performance evaluation is badminton.

55
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,920
The ones who are good at it will be the class representatives in this upcoming sports competition. Okay?

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,170
- Yes, sir!
- Okay.

I'm glad you're my partner, Bo Mi.

59
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,790
I know, right?

60
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,330
This evaluation is ruined since I'm partnered with this short piece of shit.

61
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,670
Exactly. Does this short-legged squid know how to play badminton?

62
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,300
I was in the badminton club during elementary school!

63
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,910
Then you'll play it well since your height has never changed since.

64
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,990
What? You better watch your mouth!

65
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,720
Bo Mi, you are good at sports. Please take good care of me.

66
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,640
Same to you.

67
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,030
Shall we play a couple of times and get it checked by the teacher?

68
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,550
Sounds good!

69
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,200
How can it never go back and forth? Is it a one-way flight ticket?!

70

Jin Young was very manly that day.

71

I'm sorry we left early on that day.

- What kind of person is he?
- Jin Young?

73
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,630
He does things as he pleases.

74
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,730
I heard all of the girls in his class last year hated him.

75
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,050
It makes sense.

76
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,160
He's not interested in anyone and keeps getting people's names wrong.

77
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,720
But since he's not pretentious at all to that level, it's annoying but trustworthy.

78
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,920
Is that maybe why you like him?

79
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,980
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

80

- What about it?
- What?

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,130
- Is there something on my face?
- Yes.

85
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,570
Annoying.

86
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,790
- Bo Mi!
- Can we sit next to you?

87
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,410
- Okay, I'm sitting here.
- Hello!

88
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,830
You guys have never talked with Jin Young before, have you?

89
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,050
That's true, but none of the guys don't know about Jin Young.

90
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,050
Jin Young's the best game player in our school.

91
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,360
There's a rumor you got an offer to become a professional game player. Is that true?

92
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,870
It's true.

93
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,530
But why didn't you accept it?

94
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,270
It didn't look fun. Playing games is just a hobby for me.

95
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,440
Wow, it's awesome. I didn't know you were so talented!

Listen, not me, but Ho Jun's so terrible at playing games—

97

Yoon Bo Mi, I have to play a team game, so I'll get going first.

98
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,940
Okay, I'll see you later.

99
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,550
Bo Mi, do you guys call each other by full names? He just called you "Yoon Bo Mi."

100
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,720
Yes, we do.

101
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,940
That's a bit cold. You guys are dating.

102
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,820
Well, people have their own comfortable ways of addressing each other.

103
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,300
But where's Jae Min?

104
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,780
Lee Jae Min? I don't know. He just said he's not eating.

105

Why are you acting pitiful by yourself here?

106
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,650
Maltese Kang, why are you chasing me around lately?

107
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,760
Did something happen? You haven't eaten lunch with the other guys lately.

108
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,150
I'm on a diet.

109
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,650
Don't pull bullshit on me.

110
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,690
Let's get fried chicken this weekend. It's on me this time.

111
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,190
I have a plan for this weekend.

112
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,780
Again?

113
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,340
Is it the important plan you said before?

114
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,650
Yes, it's that important plan I told you about before.

115
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,560
Who on earth are you meeting up with?

116
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,840
You don't have to worry about it.

117
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,190
Maltese Kang.

118
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,340
What would you do if you were me?

119
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,260
If you finally met the person you resented for a long time.

120
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,820
What are you talking about it out of the blue?

121
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,940
I should ask them to take responsibility, right?

122
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,430
- Thank you for this.
- You're welcome.

123
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,960
Those are old drawings, so I'm a bit embarrassed to show you.

124
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,070
I guess you were in a deep relationship with my brother, seeing you still have all these.

125
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,480
There was a time I thought we were in a deep relationship.

126
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,830
But I think I wasn't qualified to be so.

127
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,950
There were so many things that I didn't know about Ha Min.

128
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,310
At that time, I thought I got pretty close to you.

129
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,520
But...

130
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,740
I couldn't guess the reason...

131
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,420
Did something happen?

132
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,150
...why you were so sad.

133
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,220
My brother was crying?

134
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,190
And then he didn't come to the art classroom for a while.

135
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,710
Even after time passed, he never told me what had happened at that time.

136
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,890
Was there something going on in your family at that time?

137
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,000
I was very young, so I don't remember it well.

138
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,250
That still bothers me.

139
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,510
I wonder why I didn't know how Ha Min felt and what made him suffer

140
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,890
when I was right next to him.

141
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,730
I know it's funny that I wonder about that now.

142
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,180
Excuse me for one second.

143
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,950
Yes, Joo Young. What is it?

144
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,730

147
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,080
What's going on? How much did you drink?

148
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,840
I just drank three bottles of soju.

149

Oh, my. I'll call you a cab. Let's get you home.

So Mang.

Modeling for your painting, can't I do that?

152
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,300
I can really do it well. I mean it.

153
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,400
Let's go home now. We have to work tomorrow.

154
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,170
Memories...

155
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,790
are just memories.

156
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,290
How long are you going to hang onto a dead person?

157

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,660
Gifted-children academy?

162
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,970
We have to do something before he falls further behind.

163
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,460
Jae Min's in elementary school right now. How much will he fall behind when he's only in 4th grade?

164
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,260
Isn't that just to fulfill your wish, Mom?

165
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,250
If we do it like now, he'll get pushed behind quickly when he goes to middle school. How am I supposed to watch that?

166
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,090
I hoped at least Jae Min wouldn't suffer like me.

167
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,210
You promised me to let Jae Min do whatever he wants to do.

168
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,570
I can't help it. This is the right thing to do as a parent.

169
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,460
Aren't you satisfied with just me?!

170
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,120
You ungrateful punk. We let you go to a regular high school because you didn't want to go to Science High.

171
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,360
You got all the expensive tutors that other people can't even pay for.

172
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,800
We even bribed the teachers for you to have a comfortable school life—!

173
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,630
What did we not do enough for you?

174
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,090
You sent Jae Min away to our grandmother's place when I was preparing to enter Science High.

175
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,870
Do you know how much he cried at that time?

176
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,020
Making your children unhappy because of your greed is what you call the right thing to do as parents, isn't it?

177
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,600
- Seriously, you punk!
- Honey!

178
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,290
Brother! Please don't fight with Dad.

179
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,060
I just wanted to protect you.

180
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,460
- Jae Min, go to your room.
- Brother!

181
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,430
- I told you to go to your room!
- Oh, no! Jae Min!

182
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,450
What are you doing right now?!

183
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,700
He's bleeding! Honey, bring the first-aid kit!

184
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,860
But I was the one who hurt Jae Min.

185
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,770
I do hate others' hypocrisy,

186
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:20,500
but the most hypocritical person was me.

187
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:32,770
At first, I thought you were a bit of an odd girl.

188
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,960
But strangely,

189
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,330
I could always be honest when I was with you.

190
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,730
Did something happen?

191
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,100
Like that, little by little,

192
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,450
I was getting dependent on you.

193
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,660
But if I started to depend on you,

194
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,870
I felt like I couldn't stand alone anymore.

195
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,430
So...

196
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,180
that's why I tried my best to endure it on my own.

197
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,300
Like I did until now.

198
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,690
[My parents said they'll send Jae Min to a gifted-kids academy. I hoped at least Jae Min wouldn't suffer like me. I just wanted to protect you...]

199
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,980
My friends made me drink so much yesterday, so I think I blacked out for a bit.

200
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,840
So what I told you yesterday was all a mistake.

201
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm sorry.

202
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,680
This rooftop was where Ha Min used to come often.

203
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,950
My memories with Ha Min are still left in every nook of this school.

204
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,800
And I'm working as a trainee teacher in this school.

205
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:51,080
To me, Ha Min is still present.

206
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,180
I can't make him a memory.

207
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,650
So I can't have anyone else in my mind.

208
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,300
Oh, Jae Min.

209
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,580
What brings you here?

210
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,430
There's a diary that my brother left.

211
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,970
I found this from it.

212
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,760
You drew this, didn't you?

213
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,120
I was holding up pretty well.

214
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,260
I don't know what happened to you, but stay strong.

215
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,320
You held an umbrella over me.

216
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,680
Why did you keep this?

217
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,820
It's nothing special.

218
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,980
- You all know tomorrow is the sports competition day, right?
- Yes!

219
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,670
Don't hurt yourself by getting overly excited, and listen to your class president.

220
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,980
Yes, sir!

221
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,600
I wanted to help you.

222
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,130
- Ha Min.
- Yes.

223
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,900
But there was nothing I could do besides watching you from a distance.

224
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:31,010
Guys, let's check the matches and club activities schedule well and not be late tomorrow.

225
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:38,540
Also, we need someone to help with the student council work tomorrow. Who doesn't have any roles?

226
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,750
I was a bit upset and tremendously sorry about it. But then...

227
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,610
Han So Mang.

228
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,480
Yes?

229
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,480
I think you have to help with the work.

230
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,500
Me?

231
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,720
You called my name at that time.

232
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,070
In front of everyone,

233
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,030
and for the first time.
