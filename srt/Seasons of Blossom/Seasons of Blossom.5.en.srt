1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,960
They are not overreacting.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,910
We are officially dating from today.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,760
What's going on? All of a sudden?

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,390
What? Are you two going out?

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,410
What kind of bullshit is this!

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,590
It happened that way.

7
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,800
What are you doing? Didn't you see my text?

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,340
I did see it. But what about it?

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,310
How can you say you are dating this kind of guy after seeing my text?

10
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,270
You already know that I have feelings for Jin Young.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,990
Do you know why I don't trust your words until now?

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,040
Because it doesn't have any context.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,900
I never saw you two hanging out together.

14
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,450
But really, how did you two decide to go out?

15
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,690
Right, Bo Mi. Tell us the whole story!

16
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,910
- Well, it's...
- I asked her out first.

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,700
I got feelings for her after cleaning together for a while.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,820
So I confessed my feelings to her first.

19
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,550
I think this is enough context.

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,080
No matter how much I think about it, it's strange.

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,750
- What's strange?
- Of course, I'm talking about Choi Jin Young dating Yoon Bo Mi.

22
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,290
On top of it, apparently, Choi Jin Young asked her out first. Do you think it's something possible?

23
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,630
Hey! Why are you talking bad when your friend got a girlfriend? You better congratulate him.

24
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,570
I mean, do you think his character suits romance?

25
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,420
Did you already forget about Choi Jin Young's nickname?

26
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,480
- Agape?
- Yes!
("Agape" from "Agari"(vulgar way to say mouth) and "Pae-da" (hitting, beating) combined.)

27
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,210
- What's this?
- It's chocolate.

28
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,970
Why are you giving this to me?

29
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,680
In fact, I...

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,020
I have feelings for you.

31
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,840
And?

32
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,130
So, why don't you...

33
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,790
Why don't you go out with me?!

34
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,990
Why do I have to?

35
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,460
What?

36
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,350
Hey! Do you think you can say anything because you are handsome?

37
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,820
When a cute girl like her asks you out first, then you should say, "Thank you."

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,060
"Shall we start our relationship from today?"

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,090
I never asked anyone to ask me out first.

40
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,200
- You don't have a girlfriend! Don't you want to date someone?
- Not really.

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,960
Oh, is that so? Then it doesn't work...

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,930
How can you ignore others' sincerity?

43
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,170
How can you say such things to someone who pulled an all-nighter to make the chocolate?

44
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,610
- I'm not a big fan of chocolate.
- Oh, really?

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,260
Why don't you guys eat this? Since you didn't sleep, you should gain some energy by eating it, at least.

46
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,930
What kind of crazy person is that?

47
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,070
You crazy punk beating people with your mouth!

48
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,180
But Choi Jin Young confessed his feelings to Yoon Bo Mi?

49
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,460
What kind of crazy absurdity is this?

50
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,670
So are you saying it makes sense, or it doesn't make sense?

51
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,130
How can you ask me that right now? Of course, I'm saying—!

52
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,080
It doesn't make any sense.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,490
No matter how much I think about it, it doesn't make sense.

54
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,940
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm talking about Yoon Bo Mi and that psychopath!

56
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,580
She must have completely lost her mind. What does she see in him to go out with him?

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,590
He's short and has a bad personality. And I'm not even sure if he's that good-looking.

58
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,520
Doesn't he just look like a lousy girly-looking guy?

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,440
I can't help it. Why don't you make some time this weekend?

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,600
- You and I should meet up with Yoon Bo Mi.
- I have a plan for this weekend.

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,820
A plan? With whom?

62
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,490
It's someone who you don't know.

63
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,280
- Is it something important?
- Yes, it is.

64
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,290
How important is it? Who are you meeting up with?

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,340
There's something like that.

66

Did she get hurt really badly? She seems to be in severe pain.

- Can you walk?
- No.

79

- Maybe the class president needs to bring her to the school nurse.
- Or call the teacher.

Get on my back. I'll take you to the school nurse.

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,610
Let me hold it for you.

159
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,370
Okay.

160
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,920
I keep seeing you in Jae Min.

161
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,220
- Here.
- Thank you, Jae Min.

162
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,790
You're welcome.

163
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,890
Is it my unnecessary worry?

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,020
So, did he decide to do the model in the end?

165
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,210
Yes, he's going to do it.

166
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,900
I'm still not sure if this is the right thing to do.

167
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,730
Han So Mang?

168
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,150
It's you, So Mang. Right?

169
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,710
It is you. You didn't change at all.

170
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,730
How have you been?

171
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,000
We are not in any relationship to say hello, are we?

172
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,880
Yes, Oppa! I'm on my way now.

173
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,630
What? Yes, really?

174
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,500
Have a seat there.

175
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,250
Okay.

176
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,660
Is it a bit awkward for you?

177
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,950
Yes. I never did something like this before.

178
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,110
You are different on that part from Ha Min.

179
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,960
Did my brother model for you?

180
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,830
Yes, but only whenever he felt like it.

181
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,030
My painting's model was mostly Ha Min.

182
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,670
Who are your closest friends in school, Jae Min?

183
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,280
Bo Mi, Sun Hee, Young Seob, and Ho Jun. That's about it.

184
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,460
All of them are in our class.

185
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,670
Then, do you share your worries with your friends as well?

186
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,570
I'm not sure. I don't really have any worries.

187
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,960
You endure it on your own.

188
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,600
Oh, I'm sorry. I asked you too many questions.

189
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,870
When you paint a portrait, it captures your perspective about the model.

190
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,080
So I thought about what perspective I should take to look at you.

191
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,910
In fact, I had never heard your name before.

192
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:54,960
After my brother died, my parents called all of his friends.

193
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,760
But your name wasn't in there.

194
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,710
I thought that was a bit strange.

195
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,760
Right. It's because...

196
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,440
Ha Min and I were secret friends.

197
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,660
- I feel better now.
- Are you not feeling well?

198
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,530
I was only seeing Choi Seung Jae's face, but it makes me feel like my eyesight is getting better after seeing your countenance.

199
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,370
You don't know what share means, but do you know the word countenance?

200
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,240
Hey, are you going to keep patronizing me?

201
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,820
No, it's not like that.

202
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,290
It's just because I feel overwhelmed by your comment.

203
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,270
Why? Are you sad you can't see my handsome face?

204
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:59,390
I'm the only one who knows his true face that nobody else knows.

205
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,860
What are you doing? Let's go.

206
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,050
What is it?

207
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,950
Why is it not growing?

208
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,790
Hey, my friend.

209
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,060
You laughed at me earlier, didn't you?

210
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,940
- What?
- You laughed at me.

211
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,820
- Look at her pretending not to know.
- Hey, answer her question.

212
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,040
- Oh, that was—
- Why did you laugh?

213
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,050
I'm asking you. Why did you laugh?

214
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,280
Why did you laugh at me?

215
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,270
You have funny-ass bangs. Why the heck were you laughing at me?

216
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,170
I don't know who cut your bangs, but let me cut the rest for you.

217
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,160
It's already ruined, so what would be different for me to cut it more?

218
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Stay right there.

219
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,180
I said, stay still!

220
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,250
What are you guys doing?

221
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,960
Ha Min! I was just talking with my friend.

222
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,550
Weren't you bullying her?

223
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:45,480
That makes me sad. Are you not believing my words and taking her side?

224
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,680
It's not like that, but I'm saying this on behalf of you. What if you get called in again?

225
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,190
Really? Are you sure you're saying it on my behalf?

226
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,500
Of course. I don't even know her.

227
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,280
Why don't we go to the canteen?

228
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Okay. Will you get me something delicious?

229
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,840
You better be careful.

230
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,570
Are you okay?

231
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,590
It was a misunderstandable situation.

232
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,230
I'm fine, so you don't have to worry about me.

233
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,450
You're not fine.

234
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,090
What?

235
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,520
But why are you acting okay?

236
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,520
I said I'm fine. But who are you to say—!

237
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,950
Ms. Han, was my brother just a friend to you?

238
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,950
No.

239
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,670
You got hurt.

240
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,110
Hands are very important to artists.

241
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,390
♫ For you ♫

242
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:43,080
♫ I'm sending it for you ♫

243
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,830
♫ Been sending, "It's been a while. It's been a while" ♫

244
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,490
Ha Min was...

245
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,510
my first love.
