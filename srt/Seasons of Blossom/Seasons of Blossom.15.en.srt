00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,860
she didn't have the right to love Jae Min.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,260
It's because...

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,450
she still regrets that day's moment.

Lee Jae Min, do you want to come and hang out at my house?
[6 years ago]

00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,650
I can't. My brother will come soon, so I have to go home.

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,220
- Do you have an older brother?
- Yes.

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,650
My brother needs me.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,940
I'm going home now. See you tomorrow, Kang Seon Hee.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,750
I have a cat in my house.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,050
- A cat?
- Yes.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,060
Then shall I hang out at your place for a little bit?

You've never wished that your brother didn't exist, have you?

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,590
Why do you ask about that?

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,230
Because I wish I didn't have my older brother.

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,650
He always says something weird.

[Episode 15: Pieces of memory]

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,440
So Mang, did you see this?

20
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,050
Are the trainee teacher and the male high school student dating?

21
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,330
Does anyone know who the boy is?

22
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,270
Who's that boy? It's too bad that his face is hard to see.

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,900
Hey, did you see this?

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,240
Isn't she the trainee teacher from Class 5 of the second year?

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,350
- Is that Ms. So Mang?
- Their identity will get exposed soon.

You never know, so I'm not going to take any sides.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,040
- Both of their school life is over now.
- What did they do at that hour?

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,910
It's insane. I didn't think that teacher would be someone like that.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
I definitely told you on the first day of your work.

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,450
That you shouldn't see students outside of school.

31
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,730
I'm sorry, sir.

32
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,780
A disciplinary committee will open soon.

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,630
In the worst-case scenario, you might have to quit.

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,970
This boy is Lee Jae Min, right?

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,700
The reason is obvious for you two to meet, so if you explain the situation well, you might not get disciplinary action.

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,450
Sir.

Han So Mang! Do you think this is not a big deal?

39

If you quit with this kind of scandal, you'll never be able to become a teacher!

I'll give you time until tomorrow, so think about how you'll explain this.

I heard that person in the photo is Ms. So Mang.

Since Kwon Ho Jun knows about it, I bet the entire school knows it now.

But seriously, the comments are horrifying.

48

Ms. So Mang is not that kind of person to do so!

49

Right, Ms. So Mang is not someone to do so.

It's terrible for her, too, but people are going crazy to figure out who the boy is.

You said Yoon Bo Mi is the type of person who digs a hole by herself.

You better apologize to Yoon Bo Mi for saying such harsh words.

They are both saying what they want to say individually.

It's like the saying, "A Buddhist monk can't shave his own head."

Why do you think that way?

90

It's because he was not on your level! You should date someone more suitable for you.

For example, someone like me?

Then I'll get going now.

She made that decision on her own.

It's just a lame story, but she pretended to be righteous alone.

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,400
Sit down!

161
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,660
I knew you would be here.

162
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,910
- Did you guys know about it?
- That Jae Min had an older brother?

163
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,720
Of course, I didn't know about it as well.

164
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,110
- You also didn't know? Did you make any mistakes?

165
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,570
I don't know. I'm not sure.

166
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,320
Did I make any mistakes to him?

167
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,350
How can short kids like me jump over if the gate is this tall?

168
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,860
Seon Hee.

169
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,940
Here's an approval paper to leave the school early.

170
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,380
You are always like this.

171
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,660
When did I ask you to do this for me?

172
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,060
Why do you keep doing things that I never asked for in the name of consideration and make me a fool?

173
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,210
Do I look like a kid who can't do anything without your help?

174
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,100
No.

175
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,660
I thought I was like a child who always got help from you.

176
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm hesitant, but unlike me, you always showed it with your actions.

177
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm jealous of that part of you,

178
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,100
and I'm thankful to you.

179
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,800
So if...

180
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,410
I drift apart from you, I'll be very sad.

181
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,730
Yoon Bo Mi, you are unnecessarily kind.

182
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,230
So you make it hard even to hate you.

183
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,420
Yoon Bom, did you...

184
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,800
did you ask for extra potato noodles?

185
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,340
Yes. And I also asked for extra cheese.

186
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,820
Will Lee Jae Min be okay?

187
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,840
He'll be all right.

188
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,360
Jae Min is a stronger person than we think.

189
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,400
That's his problem! He always puts up on his own.

190
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,470
Wouldn't it be better if he shared it with the people around him?

191
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,240
It's frustrating.

192
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,160
Seon Hee.

193
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,750
I thought it was all for you when I tried to give up Jae Min for you.

194
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,230
But I think I thought it wrong.

195
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,380
I just didn't have the confidence to love Jae Min as much as you did.

196
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,540
But Jin Young was different.

197
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,490
When I saw you and Jin Young together,

198
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,670
I got very jealous.

199
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,670
There's nothing to be jealous about him and me!

200
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,650
So are you saying you really do have feelings for Choi Jin Young?

201
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,550
Yes. I still have feelings for Jin Young.

202
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,940
I don't know how he feels about me.

203
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,070
Seriously, what are you guys doing?

204
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,160
Did you two decide to make me die from frustration?

205
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,060
Hey, Choi Jin Young.

206
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,300
What bastard did this?!

207
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,450
It wasn't a lie that you like Yoon Bo Mi. Right?

208
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,750
You're right.

209
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,240
When did I start...

210
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,310
to like Yoon Bo Mi this much?

211
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,130
It's frustrating.

212
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,280
You are usually so good at saying things, but why can't you say you have feelings for Yoon Bom?

213
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,290
It's because I don't have the right.

214
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,460
Yoon Bo Mi is in trouble because of me.

215
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,500
Yes! Tell that to her, not me.

216
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,270
Yoon Bom is the one to decide if you have the right or not.

217
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,750
If I look at things like that, you two look pretty good together.

218
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,650
You can eat now.

219
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,050
- Seon Hee, I—
- You can go.

220
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,200
I'll take care of this.

221
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,040
Hello?

222
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,880
Jin Young, where are you?

223
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,110
I have something to tell you.

224
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,490
Hello?

225
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,590
Why did you do that?

226
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,400
I had to say that at some point.

227
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,380
Actually, I feel better after saying it since it takes a load off my chest.

228
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:22,300
I knew that my brother could bear it, all thanks to you.

229
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,580
But...

230
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,090
I think I just wanted to look away from that fact.

231
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,400
If I admit that,

232
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,220
then I need to find another person to blame.

233
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,810
Jae Min.

234
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,970
I'm sorry, Ms. So Mang.

235
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,070
That day...

236
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,930
can you tell me...

237
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,300
what happened to Ha Min?

238
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:23,000
I remember it was raining on that day.

239
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,820
I promised my brother to come home right after my tutoring.

240
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,260
But my friend asked me to hang out at their place.

241
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,550
You've never wished that your brother didn't exist, have you?

242
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,690
Why do you ask about that?

243
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,420
Because I wish I didn't have my older brother.

244
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,640
He always says something weird.

245
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,590
I also...

246
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,240
I also wish my brother didn't exist sometimes.

247
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,370
Jae Min.

248
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,040
Jae Min, are you okay?

249
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,960
Seon Hee!

250
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,280
Do you remember the guy you saw on the day my brother died?

251
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,130
What?

252
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,000
Because of him, my mom and dad

253
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,580
don't have any expectations of me.

254
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,040
So it makes me a bit lonely.

255
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,960
The person you saw on that day...

256
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,660
I feel like it might have been my brother.

257
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,910
[Thank you to Jung Eun Pyo for making a special appearance.]
