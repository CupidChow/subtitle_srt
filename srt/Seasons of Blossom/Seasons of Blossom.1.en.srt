1
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,830
Summer in that year was extraordinarily long.

2
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,060
Han So Mang, how long do I have to stay like this?

3
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,360
Just a little bit more. I just need to draw a bit more.

4
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,090
You already said that more than ten times.

5
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,570
It's raining outside!

6
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,940
Do you like the rain?

7
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,700
Yes. It makes you feel like the real summer is here.

8
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,210
I wish the summer to be over soon.

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,440
On a rainy summer day, Ha Min left us.

10
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,810
Did you all fill up your glass?

11
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,140
Dunggiduk-koong-deoruruk !
(It's a Janggu, a traditional Korean drum-like instrument, sound.)

12
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,560
Cheers!

13
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,330
I guess I got old. I can't drink anymore.
[Episode 1: The summer when we reunited]

14
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,350
Wake up!

15
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,590
Today's the last day we'll be gathering!

16
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,780
She's right. Everyone will be busy when we all start our trainee teacher work.

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,290
Also, we have to get ready for the teachers' exam after the training.

18
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,840
I memorized where all of you guys are going to work.

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,350
He is going to Incheon, and Na Young will be going to Namyang.

20
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,770
And he will be going to... Samcheok.

21
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,310
It's Taebaek.

22
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,120
Also, what's with the food?

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,100
So Mang is the closest out of all.

24
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,000
The school with S in the name. Soyeon High School!

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,160
- It's Seoyeon High School.
- Right, Seoyeon High.

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,660
But isn't Go Joo Young also going to that school?

27
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,110
Yes, I'm going there as well.

28
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,550
You live in Uijeongbu. Why would you do your training at Seoyeon High, where it takes two hours to commute?

29
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,520
At this point, it's an ailment. An ailment that you'll die if you get away from Han So Mang.

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,380
What are you saying? Don't you know that Seoyeon High is the partnership school for the training?

31
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,690
- She's drunk. Make sure she doesn't drink too much.
- The beer is cold and nice, sweetie.

32
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,410
Where are you going?

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,010
I'm going out to get some ice cream. Do you want to come?

34
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,480
Yes.

35
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,900
I'm going to get some ice cream. I'll be back.

36
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,180
He better tell her how he feels. How many years has it been like that now?

37
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,520
Go Joo Young knows that So Mang doesn't have any interest in him.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,430
I feel bad for him.

39
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,440
Seoyeon High School.

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,020
You said you graduated there.

41
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,580
Have you ever gone back to school after you graduated?

42
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,780
No. I didn't go back, not even once.

43
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,210
It'll feel really strange for you when you start working there.

44
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:45,160
I went back to my high school on Teacher's Day or so, and it felt odd.

45
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,540
By the way...

46
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,580
I wanted to ask you this for a while.

47
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,640
Why are you not dating anyone?

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,960
What about you?

49
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,410
It's not like I'm not dating, but it's more like I can't date.

50
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,600
It's the same case for me, too.

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,360
Do you have someone you have a crush on or anything?

52
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,580
You guys are insane.

53
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,640
How can they drink into the night before training starts?

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,430
It's because everybody feels sad.

55
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,010
It won't be easy to see each other anymore when everyone gets busy.

56
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,890
You guys are not the Korean traditional instrument band club of Education College.

57
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,440
It's the Waste Bin Club since you guys are always wasted!

58
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,660
Is that so?

59
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,450
So, are you okay?
[Yoo Kyeong]

60
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,000
I didn't drink that much.

61
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,440
I'm asking if you will be okay when you go back to your high school.

Today's agenda is to decide on the Classroom Activity Department.

67
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,140
Let's start with the Environmental Division. Who wants to do it?

68
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,790
Ha Min, one of the divisions is missing.

69
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,160
What? Which one is missing?

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,340
There's something you do every day.

71
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,080
A Sight for Sore Eyes Division.

72
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,460
Please, stop it.

73

Okay, who wants to be in the Environmental Division?

I came back to this place where we were together.

Han So Mang!

79
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,200
I was dozing off and missed two stops.

So Mang, we'll be late. Let's hurry.

81

Yes.

- That teacher.
- You are only going to observe the class for the first two weeks.

- I heard he'll bully you until the end of the training period if you get out of his eyes.
- Ask Han So Mang about the school facility.

She's the only one in this group who graduated from this school.

This is the restroom.

Yes, sir.

93

But can you specify what we should be careful of?

94
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,030
Don't contact or meet students privately outside of the school because you got close to them.

95
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,180
If you get into rumors, it'll be a pain in the head. Understood?

96
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,710
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

Those bastards are driving me nuts.

159
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,850
Why are they acting like vermin? They better know when to stop.

160
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,000
It's disgusting to put up with their charade.

161
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,170
I'll hold it. Why don't you fasten it?

162
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,330
Yes, okay.

163
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,370
Thank you.

164
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,920
One second.

165
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,300
Wow, you are very good at painting.

166
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,370
But how did you come into this room?

167
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,920
Our homeroom teacher gave me the keys.

168
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:39,720
Is that so? Then, are you using this space on your own during lunchtime?

169
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,160
You're getting special treatment.

170
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,130
What?

171
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,330
You heard everything, didn't you?

172
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,940
When I was talking shit about the other kids.

173
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,400
If you talk about what you heard today to others,

174
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,290
you won't be able to use this space from now on.

175
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,000
That was the first time when we met each other.

176
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,850
Are you awake?

177
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,100
Why am I here?

178
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,950
You passed out in the art classroom.

179
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,220
I'll bring the teacher.

180
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,140
Okay. Thank you.

181
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,380
So Mang, are you okay?

182
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,570
Yes, she helped me.

183
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,530
Did you get hurt anywhere? Should we go to the emergency room?

184
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,940
I'm really fine.

185
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,040
By the way, you kept looking for someone since earlier.

186
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,600
Who?

187
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,990
She kept calling out someone's name called Ha Min.

188
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,000
Ha Min?

189
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,850
You guys saw the trainee teachers who came today, right?

190
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,780
One of them passed out suddenly.

191
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,140
Really? Did someone faint on their first day of work? How can that be true?

192
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,960
Yoon Bom! What happened to that teacher?

193
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,950
- Is she alive?
- Did you see her passing out?

194
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,730
- No, I didn't see that.
- I'm not asking you!

195
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,900
But, guys, did you all prepare for the quiz?

196
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,470
What quiz?

197
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,610
We have an English quiz in the next class.

198
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,500
- What about you, Jae Min?
- I'm already prepared for it.

199
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,900
Are you worried about me right now?

200
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,960
I don't know.

201
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,920
Oh, that's right. I'll be back from the teachers' room.

202
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,290
Do you want me to come? I'll help you.

203
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,540
It's okay. These are not that heavy.

204
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,090
Let me worry about you as well. Let's go.

205
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,060
Wow, those two are very sweet.

206
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,950
Why aren't they dating? What's taking so long?

207
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,330
Is there something going on between them? Since when?

208
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,030
Just focus on finding the vocabulary list.

209
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,720
Why did you give up painting?

210
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,190
It's because I couldn't draw anymore.

211
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,090
After that time.

212
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:13,780
Actually, I don't have any photos of Ha Min anymore.

213
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,920
Because I was always crying looking at his photos, my sister deleted all of them.

214
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,850
So that's why I came back to this school.

215
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,120
It's because I missed Ha Min so badly.

216
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,370
But, Teacher...

217
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,600
Do I deserve that?

218
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:00,000
The one who made Ha Min die is me.

219
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:12,970
For me as well, I was so glad to see you today,

220
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,310
but it reminded me of Ha Min a lot.

221
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:23,010
He was such a nice kid, so it's obvious for us to miss him.

222
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,350
But you don't have to continue your training if it's too hard for you.

223
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,610
This is not the only school.

224
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,650
Also, you can come back after you get over this.

225
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,310
So think about it.

Do you hate summer?

229
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,930
It's too humid in summer. It's suffocating.
