I also...

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,010
I also wish my brother didn't exist sometimes.

00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,300
Because of him, my mom and dad...

Jae Min, are you okay?

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,860
Ah, yes.

Do you remember the guy you saw on the day my brother died?

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,600
What?

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,690
The school uniform that person was wearing at that time.

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,960
Was it our school's uniform?

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,900
Why do you ask that suddenly?

16
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,650
The guy that you saw on that day...

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,000
I think he might have been my older brother.

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,730
It might have been our uniform.

19

- But it was such a long time ago, so—
- Please!

Can you please recall anything?

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,290
But that's just once in a while.

22
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,570
I'm happy that I have a brother.

23
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,060
My brother is a very good person.

24

Who was that person just now?

00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,140
What about it?

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,720
A guy in a school uniform was looking at us, crying.

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,400
Yes.

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,560

I was on my way to you.

I was also on my way to you.

I'm sorry I spoke to you harshly the other day.

35
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,760
I mistook you and Lee Jae Min's relationship.

36
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,860
You thought I had a crush on Jae Min.

37

I'm sorry that I hadn't explained it to you beforehand.

And I have one more thing that I want to tell you.

I think I can't say it any other time.

40
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,200
Our relationship started as a fake one with misunderstandings.

41

But now, the person I really have feelings for is...

Why don't you get on? It's the last bus.

All of my students are not listening to me.

I'm sorry, sir.

Don't be sorry to me, but be sorry to your future self.

You'll regret it when you struggle to get a job later.

Are you really okay not saying goodbye to the kids?

53
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,590

It's pretty nice.

I can sleep in in the morning and not have to worry about preparing for class.

59

That sounds pretty nice.

What is it? Did you already get your report cards?

Why are you all looking so depressed?

Excuse me, sir.

So Mang! I'll drive for you.

Hurry up and get in the car.

Yes, Director.

82
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,190
Maybe he's trying to follow his brother.

He pretended not to have an older brother and grew up as a loving only child.

86

He pretended all that, and now his true self got caught.

And it's because of his parents who pushed their wish to him.

It's because of his friends who only wanted to use him.

So didn't you date that loser to draw attention from Lee Jae Min?

Do you think people don't know you are doing this to play boss?

- People are not following you,

This is not an annual event, but how can we not pass a year without an issue?

168
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,230
It's all because I'm not good enough.

169
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,460
I need to retire soon or something.

170
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,030
Please don't say that, sir.

171
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,480
This is not your fault but ours.

172
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,970
Of course, it's your fault, not mine!

173
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,190
Anyway, you better be glad it ended here.

174

Yes, sir.

176
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,230
Can you see them?

177
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,930
I can't see anything.

How did it go?

181
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,110
Thanks to you guys, it was resolved well.

185
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,020
We are good at things like that.

186
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
Are you okay?

187
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,100
Yes, it's not a big deal.

188
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,770
I just need to put some ointment, that's all.

189
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,880
I like you.

190

What?

191
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,170
I also have feelings for you.

192
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,220

It's not like that.

I'm just very nervous right now.

Isn't it really hard to see Bo Mi's face after she got back together with Jin Young?

208
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,950
Leave her alone. When you get back together is the most passionate time.

209
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,700
What did I do when she had a relationship twice?

What?!

215
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,030
Since when? And how?

216
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,500
It all started because we cleaned the windowsill together.

217
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,400
Hey, don't slap me!

218
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,550
I can't believe it.

I came to our high school.

224
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,440
I'll call you again later.

Ms. So Mang!

- Hi, guys!
- Hello!

227
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,380
Ms. So Mang, your style changed a bit.

228
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,470
I decided to grow my hair out.

229
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,000
Bo Mi and Jin Young, how's the performance prep going?

230
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,360
Somebody was very uncooperative, so we couldn't practice that much.

231
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,930
Someone kept changing the choreography three times a day, so there was not enough time to practice.

232
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,280
Ms. Han, are there more angry things than good things if you are in a relationship?

233
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,780
Ms. Han, excuse me first.

234
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,720
She seems she'll explode again soon.

235

Let's go, guys.

236
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,050
See you later, Ms. Han!

237
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,430
I'm happy to see you two getting along well.

238
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:32,690
It was so sad that we couldn't properly say goodbye to you when you left.

239
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,460
Let's see each other properly next time.

240
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,160
How long are you going to avoid me?

241
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,470
If you want to stay friends with me because you feel bad, then go.

242
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,250
If that's the case, you are making me feel worse.

243
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,710
When I came back to this neighborhood,

244
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,480
I was so glad to see you again.

245

After my brother passed away,

246
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,330

247
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,470
But I was happy to see that you were the same as you were before.

248
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,830
I'm thankful to you because you are always consistent,

249
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,770
and I need you.

250
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,490
So please don't avoid me.

251
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,230
Okay.

252
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,590
I won't run away from you.

253
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,850
When we were in a fake relationship, there was nothing to be sad or mad about it.

254
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,700
But it feels like we are fighting all the time these days.

255
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,220
You said this to me before.

256
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:45,400
You told me that I'm an obnoxious person who says harsh words in the name of being realistic and reasonable.

257
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:54,570
I will probably keep saying what I want to say in the name of being reasonable.

258
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,280
And you'll be angry at me for doing so.

259
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,980
Then we'll fight again.

260
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,590
But we can work it out together, right?

261
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,690
I might be clumsy since it's my first relationship.

262
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,830
But I don't want to break up with you.

263
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,790
What's important to us right now is

264
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,780
that you like me,

265
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,330
and I like you.

266
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,490
But do you know?

267
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,280
What?

268
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,700
This is my first relationship, too.

269
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,640
But I thought so, too.

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,680
No, I just arrived as well.

Otherwise, I would've...

282
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,760
I would've thought I was alone.

283

Thank you for being next to my brother and me.

Oh, that's right. I also have something to give you.

I missed you, Han So Mang.

297
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,430
After I gave up painting, I studied really hard.

298
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,160
I needed to focus on something so that I could think of you less.

299

Because I missed you a lot.

00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,060
was incredibly beautiful.

If I go closer to the sky,

00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,650
It was so painful and hard...

329
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,610
that I wished I could forget about everything entirely.

330
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,520
But now...

331
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,550
I don't feel like that anymore.

332
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:56,160
I am who I am now because of the time I spent with you.

333
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,310
Thank you.

334
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,270
Thank you for making precious memories with me.

335
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,870
So please don't read that letter.

336
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,750
But it's the last letter that you sent to me.

337
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,830
Now you have to...

338
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,970
live your own time.

339
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,340
I want you...

340
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,600
to live your life to the fullest.

341
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,680
Okay.

342
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,870
I will.

343
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,830
♫ For you ♫

344
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:13,670
♫ I'm standing here for you ♫

345
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,760
♫ Been standing here. It's been a while. It's been a while ♫

352
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,760
♫ You're always in my head ♫

353
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,570
Before I knew it, the summer was almost over.

354
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,800
♫ Fall in love again ♫

355
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,000
Now I have to let you go.

356
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,360
Goodbye, summer.

♫ I'm standing here for you ♫
