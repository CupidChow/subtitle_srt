I thought about it and thought there was no reason for you to help me.

It all started because I didn't want to hurt Seon Hee.

But I think I hurt her more in the end.

You dated Jin Young for Seon Hee.

38

It was not for Seon Hee but for me.

39
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,640
It's because I was afraid to drift apart from Seon Hee.

40
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,980
So it was all my fault.

41

It would've been better if I had been honest with her from the beginning.

But I ruined everything.

163
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,250
[Lee Ha Min]

164
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

165
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,860
I'm sorry to come to see you when I've ruined everything.

166
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,100
I miss you so much.

167
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,660
- Sir.
- Yes?

168
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,750
Where's Ms. So Mang?

169
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,130
She took a day off today. Why?

170
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,730
I had something to say to her. I'll come back next time.

171
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,320
Sure.

172
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,790
You are Jae Min.

173
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,480
You do really look like him.

174
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,620
I heard it from So Mang.

175
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,840
You are Ha Min's younger brother.

176
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,690
Do you know my brother?

177
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,500
Yes, but not as much as So Mang.

178
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,890
When So Mang asked you to do the painting model,

179
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,950
I worried more about her than you.

180
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,440
It's because I didn't want to see her break down again when she finally got herself together a little bit.

181
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,150
I know you can't help but blame her from your perspective.

182
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:18,390
But please don't hate her too much.

183
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,750
I also know it's not Ms. Han's fault.

184
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:32,350
But whenever I see her, it makes me think of something like this.

185
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,170
Ms. Han could've stopped my brother's death.

186
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,410
Why didn't she stay next to him until the very end?

187
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,620
It makes me keep blaming her.

188
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,190
Do you know why So Mang gave up on art and got into education?

189
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,550
After Ha Min passed away like that,

190
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,610
she thought everything was her fault.

191
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,330
She thought it was her fault that she didn't know Ha Min was at the edge of the cliff and couldn't stop him.

192
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,340
So she wants to help kids like Ha Min from now on.

193
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,830
That's why she gave up painting that she loved and became a teacher.

194
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,590
So please understand So Mang a little bit.

195
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,720
She's the one who blames herself the most than anyone else.

196
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,800
Yes, Yoo Kyeong. What is it?

197
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,530
Mang Sso! Can a trainee teacher take time off like this?

198
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,530
I came to our school right now, but you are not here.

199
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:11,490
I had something to do today, so I took a day off.

200
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:17,010
I came all the way to the school to feed you a nice meal. I was going to get you a beef meal!

201
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,720
Will you wait for me for a little bit? I'll be there in a minute.

202
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,240
Okay, come quick. Our teacher keeps reprimanding me.

203
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,890
- When did I do that?
- Okay, I'll see you soon!

204
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,460
What kind of friend calls a person back to the workplace on a day off? What an evil person!

205
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,210
I also took a vacation day at work to come here!

206
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,610
- Ji Hye's here!
- Only two chocolate milks were left, so I bought one canned coffee.

207
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,570
I'll take this one.

208
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,610
Which one do you want, Bo Mi?

209
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,940
There's nothing to watch these days.

210
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,250
What do you mean there's nothing? There are so many fun shows!

211
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,640
This is my last warning.

212
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,050
Do not follow me.

213
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,870
- I think you are the one who's following us around.
- I'm going to the staircase to the roof, so don't follow me.

214
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,100
What's up with Seon Hee? Is she hanging out with Jin Young now?

215
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,210
Even if you guys had a fight, hanging out with her best friend's ex-boyfriend is crossing a line!

216
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,670
Huh?

217
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,610
What's this? Did you guys see this?

218
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,480
So Mang, did you see this?
[Go Joo Young]

219
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,980
[Seoyeon High's teacher and a student are dating! This is a hundred percent real.]

220
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,730
Are the trainee teacher and the male high school student dating?

221
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,170
Does anyone know who the boy is?

222
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,380
Who's that male student? It's too bad that his face is hard to see.

223
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,430
Hey, did you see this?

224
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,000
Isn't she the trainee teacher from Class 5 of the second year?

225
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,020
- Is that Ms. So Mang?
- Their identity will get exposed soon.

226
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,000
You never know, so I'm not going to take any sides.

227
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,940
- Both of their school life is over now.
- What did they do at that hour?

228
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,810
It's obvious. You can't back it out from this.

229
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,390
- It's insane. I didn't think that teacher would be someone like that.
- Did you take a screenshot of the photo?

230
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,100
Isn't she going to lose her position as a trainee teacher?

231
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,730
[Seasons of Blossom]

232
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,780
I still like Jin Young. But I don't know how he feels.

233
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,950
Choi Jin Young, you didn't lie about your feelings for Yoon Bo Mi. Right?

234
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,870
A disciplinary committee will open soon.

235
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,390
I don't want Jae Min to be involved in this.

236
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,460
Who will hire a teacher who had an affair with a student?

237
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,140
Ms. So Mang is not that kind of person!

238
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,980
The boy in that ghost story is my older brother, who committed suicide six years ago.

239
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,910
Where did Lee Jae Min go? Call him right now.

240
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,620
Ms. So Mang! Jae Min is...

241
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,580
I can't just watch it again this time,

242
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,140
a precious person leaving me.
