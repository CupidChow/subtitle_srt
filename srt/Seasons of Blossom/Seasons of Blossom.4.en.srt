1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,330
I'm just wondering...

2
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,880
Can you be my model?

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,730
Me?

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,010
I'm practicing body proportion, and I thought it would be helpful for me to look at a real model.

5
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,640
You can't move!

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,800
How long do I have to stay like this?

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,580
I'm almost done. Just a little bit more.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,430
Are you laughing at me?

9
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,430
No. It's just because your facial expression is very lively.

10
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,760
My face? You said you were only drawing the body.

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,150
Since you agreed to become a model, I should draw the whole thing. It's a shame, otherwise.

12
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,930
- I don't care. I'm not going to do it anymore.
- No!

13
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,120
Don't move.

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,580
Now you're giving me orders.

15
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,220
You agreed to do this.

16
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,550
Think of it as a part of social life and be patient.

17
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,920
Fighting!

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,560
Wow, look who's grown up so much.

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,180
Thank you.

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,330
You said you'd just draw a little bit!

21
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,470
Like our spring bloomed like that,

22
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,140
Bo Mi's spring was also starting little by little.

23
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,330
It's weird.

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,570
What? What's weird?

25
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,510
Yoon Bo Mi.

26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,800
I thought you had a crush on me.

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,870
Why do you have that idea?

28
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,610
You said so.

29
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,010
- Did I?
- You said so at the snack place.

30
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,120
Also, you said so on the staircase.

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,130
You said, "I have a crush on Choi Jin Young."

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,920
Oh, the thing is...

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,880
[Episode 4: Unexpected spring]

34
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,270
I'll become the model.

35
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,530
Instead, I'll do it under one condition.

36
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,780
Can you tell me about my brother?

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,350
I want to hear everything you know about him.

38
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,840
Hurry up! Hurry up!

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
It's Jae Min!

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,500
Hello, Ms. Han!

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,530
So, what do you want to say to me?

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,270
It's such nice weather today just to do the cleaning!

43
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,930
Oh, you guys were here.

44
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:38,090
Since everyone's here, shall we decide who will do what?

45
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,410
Sweeping, mopping, and wiping the window frames.

46
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,300
Let's divide it into three groups of two.

47
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,430
I'll wipe the windows with him.

48
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,460
- Okay.
- Why?

49
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,490
I wanted to become close with Young Seob from before! Right?

50
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,610
But I think a bit differently...

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,250
- I want to do it with him—
- Do it with me!

52
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,630
- You said let's do it together.
- Let's do it with me!

53
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,620
- I'll do it with her.
- Okay.

54
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,490
How should we divide it?

55
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,470
I'm okay with anything. I'll follow what you want to do, Bo Mi.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,640
I'll mop the floor with Jin Young.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,400
Bo Mi, since mopping the floor is the last thing to do, can you lock the door from now on as well?

58
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,350
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,990
Bo Mi, we'll head out first!

60
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,330
Jin Young.

61
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,870
So about what you heard—

62
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,800
I'll mop the front. You clean the back.

63
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,470
- I'm going home first.
- Hold on.

64
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,500
Are you leaving like this?

65
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,900
What about what we were talking about before?

66
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,450
Why? Do you have something more to say?

67
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,070
Technically, you started the conversation.

68
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:17,600
Also, we are cleaning together. Isn't it too harsh of you to go home first?

69
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,610
Do you want to walk home with me?

70
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,570
- No, why would I?
- That's what I'm saying.

71
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,190
Seriously, what's the deal with him?

72
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,080
Dong Chae.

73
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,460
- Isn't Kang Sun Hee super cute?
- Yes, she is.

74
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,050
What the heck are you blabbing?

75
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,250
What are you doing to my Dong Chae?

76
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,000
This bastard doesn't know how precious friends are.

77
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,330
Wow, Dong Chae! When did you become best friends with Park Chang Hyeon?

78
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,170
Wow, but seriously, she's gorgeous.

79
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,550
I mean, look at her! How am I not supposed to like her when she's this pretty?

80
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,360
The girl next to her is more my type.

81
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,900
Yoon Bo Mi? She has a boyfriend.

82
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,290
- Does Yoon Bo Mi have a boyfriend?
- What are you talking about? She's dating Lee Jae Min.

83
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,480
No, their thing ended a long time ago.

84
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,040
- Why suddenly?
- I don't know about that.

85
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,690
But it seems like it ended a while ago.

86
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,750
Really? What should we do with our poor Jae Min?

87
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,120
Don't you think so, Dong Chae?

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,480
Let's have a ten minutes break now, and we'll resume the class at 8.

89
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,630
Yes, ma'am!

90
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,840
Maltese Kang, do you agree that it looks like you?
[Lee Jae Min]

[Lee Jae Min]

93
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,270
Seon Hee sometimes thought about that.

94
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,390
He's so handsome! I think he's a transfer student.

95
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,990
I think he's definitely in our class. If he's not, lie down in the principal's office!

96
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,680
Kang Seon Hee?

97
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,820
After reuniting after 5 years, she was relieved that Jae Min was smiling.

98
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,310
- Lee Jae Min?
- It is Kang Seon Hee.

99
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,010
Has it been five years since we saw each other?

100
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,640
But you didn't change at all.

101
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,650
I think your height is the same as well.

102
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,340
- Do you want to die in my hands?
- Your temper seems to be the same, too.

103
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,240
But it's so good to see you again.

104
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,740
She thought it would be great if he could smile like this forever.

105
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,350
Seon Hee.

106
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,970
You didn't turn in the Korean history class assessment work.

107
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,500
Right, I came here to give you that.

108
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:20,860
And she wished him to be happy now next to the person he liked.

109
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,770
There's no history to it.

110
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,820
- Choi Jin Young, do you think this makes any sense?
- What about it?

111
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,570
You have been cleaning together with Yoon Bo Mi all the time lately!

112
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,390
- So what?
- Yoon Bo Mi said she has a crush on you.

113
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,410
But you are not a suitable person for a romance.

114
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:47,010
Why did you get involved in the story that was getting completed with female-lead Yoon Bo Mi and male-lead Lee Jae Min?

115
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,350
You're right. Why did you volunteer to do the art classroom cleaning?

116
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,560
I wanted to check.

117
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,060
Bo Mi.

118
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,900
No, never mind.

119
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,090
What is it?

120
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,330
The thing is...

121
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,050
I was wondering if this is the right way to get beta's value.

122
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:29,950
If you multiply this graph by A, then you get the graph with value A from minus A.

123
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,310
Seon Hee!

124
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,090
Do you want to go to the canteen with me? I'll get you something.

125
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,880
Why are you acting gross from the morning?

126
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,280
How can you say something hurtful from the morning?

127
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,930
Can you go away to your classroom?

128
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,350
You are totally my type. Do you know that you made me fall for you again just now?

129
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,450
What's going on? Didn't Yoon Bo Mi and Lee Jae Min break up?

130
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,950
Are you still sleeping? How can they break up when they never dated in the first place?

131
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,010
The entire school knows that they had a fling! And now, everyone knows their relationship is over.

132
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,130
You heard about it, too. Didn't you?

133
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,680
Am I the only one who heard about it?

134
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,810
Chang Hyeon.

135
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,740
Isn't it better to ask directly if you have any questions?

136
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,180
That's true.

137
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,370
Bo Mi, do you want to go on a blind date?

138
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,110
Why suddenly?

139
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,310
What do you mean why? There are tons of guys who have crushes on you.

140
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,070
There's my friend called Park Yoon Sung in Yeonri High. He's pretty good-looking and has a good personality—

141
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,930
Stop talking bullshit and come with me.

142
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,660
Let me know if you are interested!

143
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,610
But why are you grabbing my hand? You're making me nervous.

144
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,860
Bo Mi, can you continue to explain this to me?

145
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,190
Yes.

146
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,540
Jin Young,

147
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,260
can we talk?

148
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,510
It was an understandable situation for you to misunderstand.

149
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:23,190
But let me cut to the chase. I don't have any feelings for you.

150
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,050
I know that.

151
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,400
You know about it?

152
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,370
Then, why did you say that the other day?

153
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,070
It's because I was curious.

154
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,830
I wanted to know why you said you had a crush on me when everyone could tell that you had feelings for Lee Jae Min.

155
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,360
What are you doing here?

156
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,690
Kang Seon Hee, you don't give me a second to be alone.

157
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,180
Then you should've gone somewhere more innovative.

158
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,070
You should've confessed your feelings to her already!

159
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,550
That kind of rumor is going around because you guys are not officially dating.

160
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,090
Maltese Kang.

161
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,320
- I got rejected.
- What?

162
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,570
I kind of told my feelings to Bo Mi.

163
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,150
But she rejected me.

164
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,600
Why? What did Yoon Bo Mi say?

165
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,900
She said she has a crush on someone else.

166
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,990
Anyway, I'm fine. So you don't have to worry about me.

167
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,720
When did I worry about you?

168
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,280
It doesn't suit you to do so.

169
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:59,580
So you lied on impulse, but you are insisting that it's true because Lee Seon Hee does not believe you?

170
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,940
Her name is Kang Seon Hee not Lee Seon Hee.

171
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,920
But that's not what I want to know.

172
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,390
Then, what do you want to know?

173
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,480
So what you want is Kim Seon Hee dating Lee Jae Min?

174
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Not necessarily. But why do you keep saying her name wrong—?

175
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,880
If that's not the case, I don't understand why you need to lie that you don't like Lee Jae Min.

176
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,480
You can just be honest and tell him that you like him and date him.

177
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Would you be able to date someone your friend likes?

178
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,490
I don't want to hurt Seon Hee's feelings.

179
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,750
Anyway, that's what happened, and I don't want you to misinterpret anything further.

180
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,080
What are you going to do from now?

181
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,380
I'm going to insist until Seon Hee believes it.

182
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,960
That you like me?

183
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,750
That I don't have any feelings for Jae Min.

184
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,280
So I'm saying, if you want her to trust that, you are going to say that you like me.

185
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,430
Then I'll look for someone else to say instead of you.

186
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,350
Are you saying you want to go with a philanthropist concept that you like anyone?

187
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,060
What rights do you have to keep talking like that?

188
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,360
You're the one who brought me into this situation. Aren't you the one who gave me that right?

189
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,050
Do you want me to tell you the solution to this issue?

190
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,220
You can date me.

191
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,240
Do you think that makes any sense?

192
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,570
Or do you have any other ways to make your friend believe that you like me?

193
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,560
Even so, I'll never go out with a guy so full of himself like you!

194
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,010
Maltese Kang, what we talked about just now is a secret to Bo Mi.

195
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,280
Seon Hee didn't want her important people to get hurt.

196
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,170
But it was the same case for Bo Mi as well.

197
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,620
I'll tell the truth to Lee Jae Min, so go out with him again.

198
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,650
Wait!

199
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,170
That you said let's go out, is it still valid?

200
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,070
I'm saying this beforehand in case you might misinterpret it again, but I really don't like you.

201
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:58,760
It's really annoying that you keep talking rudely in the name of being cool and reasonable.

202
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,240
- But?
- But...

203
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,970
[Seon Hee]

204
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,250
But you are right.

205
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,940
I need you right now.

206
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:27,900
So can we date just for three months?

207
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,380
I don't want to.

208
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,060
What?

209
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,160
You said let's date first.

210
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,790
I just said that as a solution.

211
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,100
Then, are you not going to date me?

212
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,400
I don't have any reason to date you.

213
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,160
I'll mop the art classroom on my own from now on.

214
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,320
Also, I'll get you snacks every day.

215
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:27,250
So, can you... please go out with me?

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,660
But instead, you are the one who asked me out first, and you are the one who gets dumped at the end.

217
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,690
What's going on between you two? I guess you guys got close to each other after cleaning together for a few days.

218
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,960
I know. You guys make a pretty good couple!

219
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,730
What are you talking about? Aren't you two overreacting?

220
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:00,390
They are not overreacting at all.

221
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,950
We are officially dating from today.

222
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,750
What? Is that real?

223
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,980
What? Are you two going out?!

224
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,080
What kind of bullshit is this!

225
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,780
Nobody expected the future consequences of this choice now.

226
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:58,650
[Epilogue]

227
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,740
I came back here in the end.

228
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,320
To the place where we shined together.

229
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,390
[Han So Mang]

230
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,420
The memory with you is so vivid,

231
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,190
so I still live in that time.

232
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,570
You came in early.

233
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,390
Is there something on my face?

234
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,940
Why are you staring at me?

235
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,350
Ms. Han?

236
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,980
Yes, welcome.

237
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:19,320
So I'm going to draw you again.

238
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:27,220
[Seasons of Blossom]

239
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,570
Was my brother just a friend to you, Ms. Han?

240
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,490
I guess you feel comfortable around me now.

241
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,810
- What?
- Why are you not coming in on time?

242
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,800
Let's go somewhere together.

243
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,280
You also know that you and Yoon Bo Mi are not a good match.

244
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,070
But no matter how much I think about it, I don't get why you go along with her lie.

245
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,390
It's because I like her.

246
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,570
- Let's go.
- Were you two supposed to go somewhere?

247
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,990
We are going on a date.
