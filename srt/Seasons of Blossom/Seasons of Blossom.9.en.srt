Ah, yes.

6
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,060
It's not done yet. But I won't see you because of the summer vacation, so I'm giving this to you now.

7
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,570
So this is how I look to you.

8
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,130
How does it look?

9
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,840
It looks like I'm an awesome person who's handsome, smart, and caring.

Sure, sure.

You didn't have to agree with that enthusiastically.

But... it is true.

13
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,670
You're really driving me crazy! I had to draw that full-of-yourself face as well.

14
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,980
I would've done it if it wasn't for the summer vacation.

00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,990
What are you doing during the break?

16
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,610
I'll go to the painting studio like usual.

17
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,840
You can finish painting it then.

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,840
We'll see each other again at the painting studio.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,090
What?

20
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,550
That's how our first summer vacation started.

21
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,390
If I think about it now,

22
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,990
Hey!

23
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,340
the painting studio would've been a challenge to Ha Min that required a lot of courage.

24
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,280
Why are you laughing at me?

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,090
Are you nervous now that you are here?

26
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,450
Why would I get nervous?

27
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,430
Because it was his first time doing something that he wanted to do.

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,410
But you've come here before, so relax and take it easy.

29
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,960
What are you talking about it? This is my first time here today.

30
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,640
What?

31
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,830
Right, Ha Min! It's your first day here today!

32
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,080
You are Ha Min.

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,620
Hello.

34
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,150
- This is a gift for you.
- That's a lot!

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,650
Let's have fun together.

36
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,380
Yes.

- Director.
- Yes?

38
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,600
What did you make Ha Min draw?

39
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,440
It's the same thing that you did when you first came here.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,560
Do you mean drawing anything?

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,870
How can you say it's anything? I said draw what you want to draw.

42
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,960
That can be the easiest subject for someone, but it can be the hardest thing for others.

43
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,140
You got to focus.

44
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,670
It's a sketch, but it's very nice.

45
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,840
You are talented.

46
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,430
It felt weird.

47
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,900
Because the drawing resembled you,

48
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,590
and it looked somewhat lonely.

49
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,850
Didn't you say you never learned how to draw?

50
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,720
Why do you ask?

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,350
I'm asking because your drawing was so good.

52
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,830
Honestly, I was surprised and felt a bit jealous.

53
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,340
What did your parents say about you coming to the painting studio?

54
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,010
- They don't know about it.
- What?

55
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:47,060
My parents don't know because they'll never allow something like that.

56
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,480
What if you get caught?

57
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,480
You don't have to worry about that. That won't happen.

58
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
By the way, what are you drinking?

59
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,850
It's a mint chocolate chip flavor drink.

60
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,750
Yes, I know that. But I don't understand why anyone would like that.

61
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,960
Maybe I'm good at drawing because I like this flavor.

62
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,830
Why did you untie your hair?

63
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,860
What? Oh, it's because I don't look good with my hair tied.

64
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,430
You looked cute with the ponytail, too.

Are you guys really dating?

I accidentally overheard you guys are in a fake relationship while I was passing the art classroom.

- Well, it is—
- Don't worry.

I didn't bring this up to ask you about the details.

Also, I'm not planning to tell anyone.

I also didn't like it before.

But I got to enjoy it after I kept drinking it because of someone I liked.

Oh, because of someone you liked!

103
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,730
If you even got to like mint chocolate chip flavor, I guess you were madly in love with that person.

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,210
There wasn't much to it than I thought. It was pretty easy.

162
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,250
Stop joking around. I'm asking how you feel for real.

163
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:56,900
It just felt like I was breathing for the first time.

164
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,970
Huh? It's raining outside.

165
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,530
- Do you like when it rains?
- Yes.

166
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,310
It feels like the real summer is here.

167
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,690
I wish summer to be ended soon.

168
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,630
Do you hate summer?

169
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,040
Summer's too humid, so it's suffocating.

170
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,710
Sometimes, it really makes me feel like...

171
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,070
I can drown to death.

172
00:16:52,200 --> 00:17:00,490
♫ I'm sure that I'm never sure, what I feel for you ♫

173
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,090
♫ My heart is covered by the clouds ♫

174
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,710
♫ Lost within the rain ♫

175
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:23,280
♫ The sun begins to shine on me just like a joke I never understood ♫

176
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,180
I'll get going now.

177
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,790
You've never played in the rain when you were young, have you?

178
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,670
No, but why?

179
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:45,070
♫ If so, would you feel the same, or am I the only one? ♫

180
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,770
- Hey!
- I loved playing in the rain!

181
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,730
What are you doing? Come here.

182
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,940
♫ If so, would you think of me just like I think of you?  ♫

183
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,170
The memory of rain leaves a longer mark than you think.

184
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,920
Han So Mang, wait. Hey, Han So Mang!

185
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,530
♫ I feel like I've been lost; losing my mind ♫

186
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,080
So Mang, can you stop for a second?

187
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,220
I don't want to!

188
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,530
Seriously!

189
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,020
Why? Did something happen?

190
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,340
Let's go!

191
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,560
♫ I'm sending it for you ♫

192
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,690
♫ I've been sending it. It's been a while. It's been a while ♫

193
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,530
How is it?

194
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,790
I don't know now!

195
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,090
I don't know it as well now!

196
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,550
♫ I'm waiting here for you ♫

197
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:11,330
♫ I've been waiting here. It's been a while. It's been a while ♫

198
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:19,790
♫ I'll be here again with you, in time ♫

199
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,620
- You...
- You really--!

200
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,310
You really look funny right now.

201
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,140
Wear this.

202
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,340
I'm not cold.

203
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,690
You look see-through right now.

204
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,980
Oh...

205
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,820
I think there was a blanket somewhere.

206
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,520
Right, a blanket.

207
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,660
There was only one blanket.

208
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,780
I think you are really different from me.

209
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,860
Until now, I only thought of what I had to do.

210
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,140
I have to bring an umbrella when it rains,

211
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,370
and I have to study hard to go to medical school.

212
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,620
I thought that was the right thing to do and never questioned it.

213
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,390
But by seeing you, I realized it.

214
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:07,020
That if you do what you want to do, you can be that happy.

215
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,590
It made me feel stupid.

216
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,670
So did you not like it?

217
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,900
So I liked you even more.

218
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,970
Thanks to you, I figured there's a different way.

219
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,860
Thank you.

220
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,250
Let me know if you don't like it.

221
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,750
I don't mind it.

222
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,960
♫ This is it, again ♫

223
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,920
♫ In Heaven, together ♫

224
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,080
♫ This is it, again ♫

225
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,030
♫ In Heaven, together ♫

226
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,790
The memory of rain...

227
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,090
also remained within me for a long time...

228
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,200
and kept piercing me.

229
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,220
My precious memory...

230
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,930
that's been hurting me.
