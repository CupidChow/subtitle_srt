1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,980
You got hurt.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,680
Hands are very important to artists.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,990
Are you giving me a children's one because I'm small?

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,980
I just brought what my brother was using.

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,210
Oh...

6
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,570
But this suits you better anyway.

7
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,630
[Animal Friend "Butterfly" Band-aid]

8
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,700
Why are you not coming on time?

9
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,910
I waited for you so long.

10
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,210
How did you get in here?

11
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,600
I have the keys.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,800
You still have that band-aid on.

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,000
Our spring was slowly getting colored.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,130
But why did you wait for me?

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,960
What are you doing after school?

16
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,710
Let's go somewhere together.

17
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,790
And we were facing a new change.
[Episode 6: The reason why we meet]

18
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,210
Here, it's what I promised you.

19
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,270
What's wrong with her?

20
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,580
It's because she still doesn't believe that you and I are dating.

21
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,800
I just can't understand.

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,480
Why are you friends with someone with a sick personality?

23
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,730
When I was in 9th grade, my mom told me to get into a foreign language high school.

24
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,200
But Seon Hee asked me if I really wanted to go to that high school.

25
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,220
So what did you do?

26
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,150
I didn't go on the interview day.

27
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,060
Seon Hee's that kind of friend.

28
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,460
The way she's acting right now is all for me.

29
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,200
So it makes me feel even sorry to her.

30
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,580
Bo Mi!

31
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,370
Let's go home together.

32
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,540
It's been a while for the three of us to go home together. Isn't it?

33
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,250
It's because somebody ditched their friends because of their new relationship.

34
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,450
Tell her like that.

35
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,590
I never ditched anyone.

36
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,850
She's the one who ignored me after getting sulky by herself.

37
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,050
Who avoids crap because they are scared?

38
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,650
I wasn't pouting. I didn't want to see her.

39
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,540
Tell her like that.

40
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,340
Are you guys going to keep acting like this?

41
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm going to get you guys on-the-spot tteokbokki with udon noodle added.

42
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,720
Are you guys coming or not? Tell me right now.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,410
It's hot these days, so why would you go for an on-the-spot tteokbokki?

44
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,920
Hong-tteok is popular these days.

45
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,870
Also, it's better to put potato noodles than udon.

46
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,290
So? Are you guys coming or not?

47
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,850
I don't really want to go. But if you want me to come, I'll go.

48
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,840
- Tell her like that.
- My god, Maltese Kang! Cut it out now.

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,710
Lee Jae Min, do you want to die in my hands?! Hey, let me go!

50
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,120
So Mang...

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,170
You were really good at the class demonstration.

52
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,560
Thank goodness.

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,320
I was very nervous since mine was a morning class.

54
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,310
What about you? How's the festival prep going?

55
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,780
I prepared something incredible.

56
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,190
You'll see it later. You can look forward to it.

57
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,170
Okay.

58
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,760
How are you these days?

59
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,270
The younger brother you told me about. Was his name Jae Min?

60
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,370
Yes. He's my painting model these days.

61
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,870
What? Do you paint?

62
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,510
I did it a bit when I was in high school.

63
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,710
I didn't paint for about six years.

64
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,620
Why didn't you tell me before?

65
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,360
I could've been your model.

66
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,460
Ha Min told me before

67
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,050
that he wanted to be a shield for his brother.

68
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,160
So I'm trying my best with what I can do.

69
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,050
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

70
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,270
Seon Hee, what are you up to?

71
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,650
How did someone busy dating come all the way here?

72
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,260
I thought we made up when we ate tteokbokki.

73
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,090
I went with you guys because Lee Jae Min begged.

74
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,260
Don't try to get away with it.

75
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,530
I still don't believe you like him.

76
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,480
- I like that.
- You're so cute!

77
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,840
Jin Young, what if we make it more clear that we are dating?

78
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,300
Since Seon Hee's still not believing it, I want us to look more like a real couple.

79
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,840
But don't you still have a crush on Lee Jae Min?

80
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,540
Are you going to be okay if Lee Jae Min dates Choi Seon Hee?

81
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,750
As you said, it's true that I still have feelings for Jae Min.

82
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,430
But as much as I have feelings for Jae Min,

83
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,490
actually, even more than that, Seon Hee's an important friend to me.

84
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,360
And what I wish is for all three of us to stay close like now.

85
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,480
So what should I do first?

86
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,660
First, let's target the public.

87
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,280
The public?

88
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,030
We should show that we are dating to the public as much as possible.

89
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,450
- Two people, please.
- You got on board.

90
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,740
I guess they are dating!

91
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,780
So that everybody can trust that we are in a relationship.

92
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,190
And? What's next?

93
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,310
My uniform got ripped again!

94
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,550
I told you to switch to Elite already.

95
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,820
Why are you still not wearing it when it's this comfy?

96
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,930
We'll target the people around Seon Hee.

97
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,360
- Bo Mi, good morning!
- Hi, Min Seo!

98
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,420
The first targets are Young Seob and Ho Jun.

99
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,700
- Bo Mi, hi!
- Hello, Ho Jun.

100
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,230
- Bo Mi!
- Good morning!

101
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,700
And after that are Gyu Ri and Ji Hye.

102
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,320
What are these amazing sights of you two?

103
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,450
What? Are you two sitting together already?

104
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,790
Yes, we decided to do so.

105
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,030
Right. You have to keep a face like that next to you and continuously look at it.

106
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,960
Otherwise—

107
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,490
Can you give us some space?

108
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,940
Isn't the soup too salty today?

109
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,550
Can I sit here?

110
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,800
Of course, we have to target your friends, too.

111
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,780
S-Sure...

112
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,760
It's so good to see you.

113
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,410
I've heard a lot about you from Jin Young.

114
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,270
What did you say to her about us?

115
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,030
I didn't say anything.

116
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,690
Now that I think about it, it's the first time talking with you, Ui Joon.

117
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,170
- Ui Joon.
- Yes?

118
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,220
Are you not feeling well?

119
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,400
Are you okay? Drink some water.

120
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,840
The way for you to help them is not to talk to them.

121
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,290
Shall we play soccer later? Let's play with Class 8.

122
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,420
I don't want to get sweaty.

123
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,190
- Shall we bet on ice cream?
- Sounds good!

124
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,820
How can you still eat?

125
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,690
What about it?

126
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,030
Nothing. Eat as much as you want.

127
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,460
Okay.

128
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,730
But what if your friend still doesn't trust it after doing all that?

129
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,040
- So, speaking of it...
- Physical affection?!

130
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,210
That way, we'll look like a real couple to Seon Hee. Don't you think so?

131
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,320
You haven't dated anyone, have you?

132
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,430
That's true, but aren't you the same as well?

133
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,950
A guy like you had a girlfriend before?!

134
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,850
Who was it?

135
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,050
Aren't you trying to get what you want in the name of a fake relationship?

136
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,680
How can you say that to me?

137
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,060
I never dated anyone before, but I was very popular.

138
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,680
I didn't date anyone, but it's not like I couldn't date anyone!

139
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,770
Do you know how many people have asked me out until now?

140
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,640
Jae Hyeon, Jeong Woo, Jeong Han, Soo Bin, Min Hyeok, and Jae Min...

141
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,190
Are you two having a fight?

142
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,520
Why would we?

143
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,390
Do you have time this weekend?

144
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,630
It's been a while, so let's hang out.

145
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,790
Okay.

146
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,770
- Then bring him with you.
- What?

147
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,940
I should properly meet him since he's now your boyfriend.

148
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,880
Jin Young, do you have time this weekend?

149
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,330
Shall we go?

150
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,750
Thank you for coming today. I'll see you in school.

151
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,910
Okay.

152
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,770
Huh? Ms. Han?

153
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,200
Bo Mi.

154
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,040
Why are you two here together?

155
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,260
We ran into each other. What about you two?

156
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,150
- We are—
- We are on a date.

157
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,080
We are going to see Seon Hee and Jin Young as well.

158
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,910
Oh, you two are in a relationship!

159
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,600
You guys make a cute couple.

160
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,110
Bo Mi, can I come with you?

161
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,580
What?

162
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,260
Ms. Han, we'll go first.

163
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,680
Okay. Have fun, guys.

164
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,990
Bye.

165
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,310
Han So Mang!

166
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,890
What takes so long?

167
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,250
I'm coming.

168
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,910
But what if we run into other people on the street?

169
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,520
Why do you think I pretend I don't know you in front of others?

170
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,700
Is it because I look like a loser?

171
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,680
You know it very well.

172
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,470
Come in.

173
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,790
[No admittance to outsiders. Immediate punishment if caught!!!]

174
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,800
Immediate punishment? Why is it so scary?

175
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,190
Some older girls kept bringing their boyfriends here, and something happened that our director got so mad.

176
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,420
So after that, that sign got made.

177
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,640
Why? What did they do after bringing their boyfriends here?

178
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,280
Did they paint together?

179
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,580
I have no idea! Anyway, that's why that sign exists.

180
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,750
It's surreal to see it in person after only hearing about it.

181
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,280
But why did you want to come here?

182
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,120
I just wanted to see you outside of the school.

183
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,380
- You have to hide now!
- Why?

184
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,560
It's the director! We'll get kicked out if we get caught! What should we do?

185
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,250
- Where should I hide?
- Shall we go outside?!

186
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,040
But the director is coming from outside!

187
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,580
- Should I hide here?
- No, no.

188
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,030
What should we do?

189
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,000
Wait, the bag! I'm taking the key, too.

190
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,350
Is someone here?

191
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,860
Did I not turn off the lights?

192
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,070
So you bumped into Jin Young in the hallway, right?

193
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,340
It was because someone was blocking the road.

194
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,030
I thought you were just short, but I guess you also have bad vision.

195
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,950
There was plenty of room.

196
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,960
What? You are a short bag of shit!

197
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,240
If I'm a short bag of shit, then are you non-existence?

198
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,170
Maltese Kang! Did you want to see us on the weekend to pick a fight?

199
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,310
I mean, it's bizarre that they are dating now when they didn't even know each other's names.

200
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:11,290
Also, what's wrong with me wanting to see my best friend's boyfriend?

201
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,000
What I told you before is all.

202
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,520
- I developed feelings for him while cleaning together—
- There's no detail to the story.

203
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,150
If you date just because you are cleaning together, then everyone who's cleaning together should be dating.

204
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,350
- Isn't there an answer you want to hear?
- That's right.

205
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,810
I just don't know why Yoon Bo Mi would like you.

206
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,280
Wouldn't there be something that we don't know?

207
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,820
What's that?

208
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,950
Lee Jae Min!

209
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,290
I heard that you are very good at games, Jin Young. Do you have a secret method for it?

210
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,580
Not really. I just play until I figure out the tactics.

211
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,970
Then, do you play games a lot in your spare time?

212
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,300
I can't play it at home because of my younger siblings.

213
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,400
Do you have siblings?

214
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,250
Yes, I have two. One is ten years old, and the other is seven.

215
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,700
I'm hungry. Hey, let's go get some cakes.

216
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,810
One chocolate cake and one tiramisu, please.

217
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,540
I don't eat chocolate.

218
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,810
- I'll still take those two.
- Okay.

219
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,290
If you were going to pick what you like, why did you want me to come with you?

220
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,170
You also know you and Yoon Bo Mi are not a good match, don't you?

221
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,580
- I'm going first if you are going to pick a fight.
- Yoon Bom.

222
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,180
If you get to know her, she's only book-smart.

223
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,760
She puts others first and hurts herself often.

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,010
But no matter how much I think about it, I don't know why you are playing along with her.

225
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,480
What's your real reason for dating Yoon Bo Mi?

226
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,930
It's because I like her.

227
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,630
Jin Young looks reliable, somehow.

228
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,840
Maybe it's because he has younger siblings?

229
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,980
I remember you are an only child, right?

230
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,920
Yes, I am.

231
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,560
Jae Min.

232
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,510
Earlier today, did you really just run into Ms. So Mang?

233
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,120
In fact, I have something I want to tell you about.

234
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,240
It's that...

235
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,500
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to say it.

236
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,900
It's not like that. But the situation is a bit complicated.

237
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,100
But when it gets sorted out, I'll tell you first.

238
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,390
- Let's go.
- Excuse me?

239
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,780
Were you two supposed to go somewhere?

240
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,660
We were supposed to go on a date.

241
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,250
What? Are you two leaving? What about the cakes?

242
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,730
I told you that I don't like chocolate.

243
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,550
[Seasons of Blossom]

244
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:00,770
If you finally meet someone you blamed for a long time, you have to ask them to take responsibility. Right?

245
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,070
I think every guy will know Jin Young.

246
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,900
- What kind of person is Jin Young?
- He just does things as he pleases.

247
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,790
As long as we are happy with each other, that's all it takes. Isn't it?

248
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,480
I don't like him, but he's trustworthy.

249
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,540
Bo Mi, maybe that's why you like Jin Young.

250
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,290
- Did my brother cry?
- Did something happen in your family at that time?

251
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,430
There's a diary my brother wrote.

252
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,620
Ms. Han, you drew this, didn't you?
