Thank you.

Thank you for bringing me into the rain.

3
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,450
Thanks to you, I think I can like summer now.

4
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,980
Just to let you know, it was my first time.

5
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,910
That's a lie.

6
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,790
Really?

7
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,380
Well, what do you think?

8
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,250
That's crazy.

9
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,990
Then, are you now dating that guy?

10
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,730
No.

11
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,090
Are you guys Americans? How can you kiss but not date?

12
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,240
Also, you said it was your first kiss!

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,700
That's true.

14
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,440
Is he handsome?

15
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,710
Yes.

16
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,000
Is he popular?

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,430
Yes.

18
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,010
Now I get it. Guys like him have a million girls.

19
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,030
Like one at a painting studio, one at school, and one at the after-school class!

20
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,600
You are so naive.

21

No, he won't be! I doubt it.

22
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,910
It's not the time for you to let your guard down.

23
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,700
You might become one of the passing girls. Oh, seriously!

24
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,150
Is today a special day?

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,740
What? No, all of my clothes are in the laundry.

26
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,590
So there was nothing else I could wear besides this.

27
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,330
You look pretty.

28
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,610
Ha Min.

29
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,950
Yes?

30
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,790
Well, you and I...

31
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,870
It's very hot today! Do you want to go get something to drink with me?

32
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,720
Sounds good. What do you want to get?

33
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,670
You said your parents didn't know that you were coming to the studio. What are you telling them?

34
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,910
They think I'm going to an essay writing lecture.

35
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,800
I refunded that and registered the painting studio instead.

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,390
Is that okay to do so?

37
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,160
As long as my grades stay the same, it'll be okay.

38
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,900
Also, it's way more fun to go to the painting studio than to an essay lecture.

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,880
You're always drinking that. I still don't understand why you like that.

40
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,330
Do you want to try it? You'll get addicted soon, too.

41
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,550
Just drink with the straw. We even kissed.

42
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,870
At that moment, everything became weird.

43
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,490
Isn't it good?

44
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,390
How can you be so relaxed?

45
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,620
When I feel like my entire body is malfunctioning.

46
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,480
I'll work on this part.

47
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,270
Let's do it together.

48
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,380
It's so much fun.

49
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,640
I'll paint that part with you.

50
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,620
- Am I doing it right?
- What?

51
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,110
Are you not feeling well or something?

52
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,720
No, I'm fine.

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,930
Can you do it on your own for a bit? I'll go get something.

54

Excuse me.

55
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,410
I definitely saw it before.

56
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,190
It's here.

57
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,680
There were not enough pastels. Can I use this?

58
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,560
I wonder what you are thinking right now.

Then, shall we try it?

I go to the right, and you go to the left side.

62
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,550
Is it your left or my left?

63
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,770
Left from my point of view.

You said you go to the right side.

65

Shall we take a break for a bit and try it again?

69

It's the denial-that-you-fell-for-them phase.

Denial phase? What's that?

71
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,100
Your state right now. You think about them when you are in class or even eating meals.

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,260
It pops up in your head, especially before bed. Right?

Don't deny it and just accept it.

- It's not like that!
- It's not like that.

- It's easier if you accept it.
- I would never like something like this!

That was a pretty impressive first meeting.

It was pretty intense.

I also don't know how I feel.

So it's very frustrating.

99

It would've been better if someone could tell me my feelings.

But you're the only person who knows how you feel.

Nobody can tell it for you.

Even if you have to suffer more, you don't want to hurt others.

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,310
Get home safe, Unni. When you get home, call me.

163
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,950
Choi Jin Ah!

164
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,880
Why? I said what you'd say for you.

165
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,120
Get home safe, Bo Mi.

166
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,270
Unni, bye!

167
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,340
Inside of my head got complicated.

168
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,900
I couldn't figure out how to deal with you.

169
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,880
Let's do it together.

170
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,350
This is almost done.

171
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,060
I'll clean this one first.

172
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,950
Han So Mang.

173
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
Why are you avoiding me?

174
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,250
When I see you, my heart trembles.

175
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,330
What are you talking about it out of the blue?

176
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,810
When I'm with you, I can't do anything because my heart pounds.

177
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,860
And when I'm not with you, I wonder what you are doing.

178
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,310
It means I like you.

179
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,350
But I can't tell how you feel about me.

180
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,400
Am I really...

181
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,260
one of the girls passing?

182
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,120
I like you.

183
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,990
I told you this before.

184
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,310
That I figured there's a new way, all thanks to you.

185
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Everything I'm doing with you is all the first time for me.

186
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,430
So it's exciting...

187
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,800
and scary at the same time.

188
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,030
Why are you scared when I'm right next to you?

189
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:55,690
You are brightening the way next to me, but what if you disappear suddenly?

190
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,870
I'm not going anywhere.

191
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,220
So don't worry.

192
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,120
Our beaming first summer vacation...

193
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,530
ended like that.

194
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,320
Have you been well?

195
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,700
Yes.

196
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,540
I have no face to see you.

197
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,180
After what happened to your brother, I lost myself, so I couldn't take good care of you.

198
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,510
I'm fine.

199
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,620
My heart still breaks if I think about your brother.

200
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,810
I feel remorseful thinking about how I let that good boy go.

201
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,740
I also miss my brother.

202
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,020
So I've been reading his diary every day.

203
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,310
Did Ha Min have a diary?

204
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,500
And I found a name called Han So Mang in it.

205
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:35,210
At first, I thought my brother had died because of that person.

206
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:41,640
But the more I know, I realized I was wrong.

207
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,780
My brother could've at least held out because of her.

208
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,370
Because she was the only hope when my brother didn't have any hopes in his life.

209
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,340
But, Mom...

210
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,780
You crushed it all.

211
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:21,210
The vacation is over now, but is it okay for you to keep coming to the painting studio?

212
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,560
Why? Should I stop coming?

213
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,610
No, I'm saying it because I wonder if it might disturb your studies.

214
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,730
Do you know why I study hard?

215
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,610
My mom...

216
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,190
gave up on her dream because she got pregnant with me.

217
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,370
So to her,

218
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,740
I'm the only hope to make her unfulfilled dreams come true.

219
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,110
And that's why she wants me to go to medical school, no matter what.

220
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,360
But I don't think it's right for you to also give up on your dreams because of it.

221
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,120
So...

222
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,670
I feel pity for my mom.

223
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,110
Painting studio?

224
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,480
[Receipt for Painting Studio Registration]

225
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,610
It's because my mom will realize it someday as well.

226
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,360
That everything was only her greed.

227
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,510
But it's all fine.

228
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,420
Because now I have you next to me.

229
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,470
[Seasons of Blossom]

230
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,310
Then, do you trust me now that we are dating?

231
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,230
Sort of. At least, it's sure that Choi Jin Young likes you.

232
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,880
- Now that I think of it, there's not much left.
- Of what?

233
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,380
The time of us dating.

234
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,250
Lee Ha Min's insane.

235
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,260
Did you hear about Lee Ha Min? Isn't that a deal-breaker?

236
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,680
Did he tell us wrong on purpose or what?

237
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,190
Now I don't know how to endure without you.

238
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm sorry, Mom. I really miss my brother.
