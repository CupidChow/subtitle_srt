1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,990
Jin Young.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,380
I have a crush on Choi Jin Young.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,140
A simple word without much thought

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,900
sometimes causes a small ripple in daily life.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,770
Look at how scary Maltese Kang is from early in the morning!

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,070
What's wrong with that? It's energetic and nice.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,920
I got to walk behind Bo Mi.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,320
Doesn't those two make such a nice couple?

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,700
A good-looking popular boy, who's a bit bad boy.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,990
And a dainty, pretty girl who's also smart and good at studying.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,360
Isn't this a perfect combo; a winning stock?

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,930
Do they know that you are fanboying about them?

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,400
Of course not.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,760
I bet they'll start going out soon. Or they might be already, and I'll bet my entire fortune to it.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,490
I don't know about stock or whatever, but I know Jin Young is the best.

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,780
Here you go.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,290
Jin Young, I'll bet my entire money on you!

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,740
But still, he's basically playing the game for you.

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,110
That ripple becomes bigger little by little

20
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:12,360
and eventually shakes another's daily life as well.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,720
Wait. Does this make any sense?

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,560
Then, what about my stock? My Bo Mi-Jae Min stocks!

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,200
You should've not been so fanatic about them.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,030
Why did you bet everything on someone who you don't know?

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,900
Hey! You also ask how the people you don't know are doing!
[Episode 3: Butterfly effect]

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,500
A drawing model?

27
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,940
Here.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,480
It's the painting studio I used to go to.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,030
Ha Min also painted there for a while.

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,440
Then think about it and let me know.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,340
Bo Mi.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Are you not feeling well? Do you want me to bring you to the school nurse?

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,390
What is it? What's on your mind?

34
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,730
That's not true. Young Seob was the tallest in our school.

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,270
- When we were in 10th grade.
- No! He was small whenever I saw him.

36
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,460
Look. You are one, two, three, four-hand span. And he's six-hand span.

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,340
Are you not feeling well?

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,170
No, I'm fine.

39
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,580
Let's talk outside.

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,470
If you are keeping a distance from Lee Jae Min for me, you better stop that now.

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,040
Seon Hee, I know what you are saying, but it's not like that.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,960
Then, how will you explain your nonsense about having a crush on Choi Jin Young?

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,750
I told you that it's true that I have feelings for Jin Young.

44
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,630
Do you think I don't know you?

45
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,050
You always say things you don't mean for other people's sake.

46
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,410
But you want me to believe that?

47
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,760
If you don't believe me, what are you going to do? I'm saying that's how I feel.

48
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,610
It has to make sense for me to believe it!

49
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,510
Why would you like him for what?

50
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,610
I like him because he's honest.

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,790
What?

52
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,500
As you said, I can't even say what I want to say, but Jin Young's the opposite.

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,600
Yoon Bo Mi, why are you insisting until the end...

54
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,830
The class bell is ringing. Let's go back in.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,910
Is this real?

56
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,090
Does this emotional progression make any sense?

57
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,370
What about Bo Mi and Jae Min's connection?

58
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,100
So, I'm telling you, you have to face reality.

59
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,120
Hey, your hair on top is way more unrealistic.

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,290
Ms. So Mang! Hello!

61
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,280
Young Seob and Ho Joon, how are you?

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,730
- Hello.
- Hi, Jae Min.

63
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm exhausted already from fighting with my brother in the morning.

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,930
I had a huge fight with my sister, too.

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,400
I think being an only child like Lee Jae Min is better.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,860
- Do you think so?
- What are you talking about it?

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,250
- Wow, the color is amazing!
- Isn't it pretty?

68
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,060
I'll be the queen of the cafeteria from today!

69
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,880
Let's go, girls.

70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,620
Look, I could've won if I got two more!

71
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,600
We got to hurry to eat lunch. Let's go.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,510
Jin Young.

73
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday in the hallway. I felt like I didn't apologize well.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,040
- It's fine.
- What?

75
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,060
It's not you, but your friend is the one who needs to apologize.

76
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,000
Seon Hee also didn't mean bad—

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,040
She looked like she had a bad intention.

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,280
- That's because Seon Hee's—
- So you don't have to say something that you don't mean it.

79
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,180
So full of himself.

80
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,930
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say that.

81
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,240
Oh, Bo Mi.

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,210
A strong first impression will make a mark in people's memories for a long time.

83
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,410
In my memory, you were like a small island.

84
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,740
For nobody to come close to you,

85
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:53,890
you locked yourself on a cozy and lonely island.

86
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,000
Like that, we spent separate times together.

87
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,880
And then, one day.

88
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,770
Why do you paint?

89
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,760
I'm just painting because it's fun.

90
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,170
But still, you'll have a goal.

91
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,990
Is it for college? Do you want to go to an art school?

92
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,060
I didn't really think about it.

93
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,980
I'm just drawing every day because it's fun and makes me happy while doing it.

94
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,490
Do I need to have another reason?

95
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,220
Good for you that you are worry-free.

96
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,050
I'm jealous. I don't have any choice but to go to medical school.

97
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,810
Do you have anything that you like?

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,860
I don't need something like that.

99
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,960
I have to study hard, so at least my mom will leave Jae Min alone.

100
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,440
At that time, I didn't understand what he meant.

101
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,930
What's this?

102
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,770
A girl in our next class gave it to me.

103
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,320
There are so many dung flies coming to you!

104
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,440
I told you not to use the word dung fly.

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,640
- Are you going to eat this?
- Of course. I got it as a gift.

106
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,120
Why don't you come to the canteen with me instead?

107
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,810
What kind of taste is this?

108
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,090
Do you want to try it? You can taste the natural flavor of the flour.

109
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,460
No, I'm good.

110
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,860
Why is it so extreme? What is this?

111
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,400
Is this a cursing doll?

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,070
Wait! There was a letter in it.

113
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,640
I know. It's obvious what's written in it without seeing it.

114
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,810
I fell in love with you at first sight. I've been looking at you for a long time at a distance.

115
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,370
Essay questions are more creative than that.

116
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,000
Then why did you receive it in the first place? You could've said no at the moment.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
It's called social life.

118
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,190
If I don't receive it on the spot, people will talk bad behind me, like,

119
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,700
"I didn't know Lee Ha Min was such a shitty person."

120
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,050
So if I receive what people give me and stay quiet, things will resolve on their own.

121
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,380
It's because they are also embarrassed that they got rejected.

122
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,910
Do your friends know that you are thinking like this?

123
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,340
Friends? I don't have any friends.

124
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,090
- What? You don't?
- I told you. It's all just for social life.

125
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,590
Also, don't pretend you know me outside of this room.

126
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,250
It's unnecessary to get involved. And we might get caught using this space.

127
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,440
Sure.

128
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,970
Maltese Kang!

129
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,060
This is pretty! Where did you get it? I want to buy the same one.

130
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,580
Me, too!

131
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,220
I'm never going to let you know.

132
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,940
Why not? Then help me choose clothes when I go shopping.

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Jae Min, can we talk for a bit?

134
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,630
I'll go first. See you tomorrow!

135
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,240
- What? It started to rain!
- Do you have an umbrella?

136
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,110
- So Mang!
- Oh, Joo Young.

137
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,760
- It's raining heavily.
- I know. Why is it raining so much suddenly?

138
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,680
Jae Min, how are you? I want to see you with my husband.
[Mom]

139
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,700
Call me when you have time.

140
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,040
You got it wrong again! How many times is this?

141
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,850
Your older brother did this when he was way younger than you.

142
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,930
Do it again, now!

143
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,770
Do it again from here. Oh, Ha Min.

144
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,640
This is the result of the recent test.

145
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,730
[March 2015 Mock test for the College entrance test]

146
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,120
You promised me to leave Jae Min alone.

147
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,400
He should do the basics.

148
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,260
What do you think the basics are?

149
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,750
We agreed that I'd do the studying and everything.

150
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,530
So let Jae Min do whatever he wants to do.

151
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,510
You don't have to do this. Do you want to play a computer game with me? Let's go.

152
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,570
You wanted to protect your younger brother from your parents' expectations.

153
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,870
Are you out of your mind?!

154
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:32,560
But when it came to you, you didn't know how to protect yourself.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,530
How's school these days?

156
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,820
It's the same.

157
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,490
Are you getting along with your friends?

158
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,150
Yes.

159
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,070
That's good to hear.

160
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,750
I met someone who knows my older brother.

161
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,880
Maybe I might figure something out about his death.

162
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,570
- Jae Min.
- Dad, aren't you curious about it as well?

163
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,860
I contacted everybody.

164
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,230
I talked to every one of Ha Min's friends.

165
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:35,120
But nobody seems to really know Ha Min.

166
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,590
So you should stop it as well.

167
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,190
Are you really okay with drinking? You fainted today.

168
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,370
I'm totally fine.

169
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,030
Can I ask you just one thing?

170
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,680
Who's Ha Min?

171
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,760
My first love.

172
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,040
He died six years ago.

173
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,690
I'm sorry. I should've not asked you about it.

174
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,800
But Ha Min's brother is in my class.

175
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,660
So I'm going to do my best for the training.

176
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,570
So I won't be embarrassed to Ha Min anymore.

177
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,810
So that I don't regret it anymore.

178
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,700
Let me know whenever you are having trouble.

179
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,360
I'll help you with anything.

180
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,820
Thank you for saying that.

182
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,960
- Oh, Jae Min!
- Yes, hi.

183
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,450
The midterm is in three weeks, so you guys should start studying now.

184
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,680
Yes, sir.

185
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,270
Also, Ms. Han has something to inform you, so please listen carefully.

186
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,600
- Ms. Han.
- Yes.

187
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,560
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Ms. Han.

188
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,640
I will be supervising art classroom cleaning from today.

189
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,570
So we need to pick new people to take the duty. Does anyone want to do it voluntarily?

190
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,930
We need six people.

191
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,880
I'll do it.

192
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,210
The class president is the best. Thank you, Bo Mi.

193
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,010
- I'll do it, too.
- Okay, Jae Min.

194
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,070
- I'll do it as well!
- Okay, Young Seob.

195
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,150
We'll do it, too.

196
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,180
Okay, Gyu Ri and Ji Hye.

197
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,170
It's five people now. Who wants to take the last spot?

198
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,920
- I'll do it.
- Okay, Jin Young.

199
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,150
Then these six, let's meet at cleaning time.

200
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,590
Bo Mi.

201
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,950
I'm sorry. I made you feel uncomfortable until now.

202
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:22,030
Can we stay the same as before?

203
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,720
Let's go back to comfortable friends.

204
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,570
I'd like to do that.

205
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,790
You guys came early.

206
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,550
I'll go inside first.

207
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:07,300
This art classroom is where Ha Min and I met for the first time.

208
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,360
A lot of things happened here.

209
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,360
What did my brother do here?

210
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,760
He spent his alone time here avoiding other people.

211
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,210
Ha Min and I both didn't have that many friends.

212
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,140
You asked me to become a drawing model.

213
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,020
At first, I was very surprised. I wondered why you asked me such a thing.

214
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,810
I'm sorry. If it's too much to ask, you can forget about it—

215
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,040
I'll become the model.

216
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,840
Instead, I'll do it under one condition.

217
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,730
It's weird.

218
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,100
What? What's weird?

219
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,530
Yoon Bo Mi, I thought you had a crush on me.

220
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,610
What did you say?

221
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:43,190
Bo Mi's small flap of wings became a big wave,

222
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,340
causing a stir in everyone's time as eighteen.
