1
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,210
I'm just wondering.

2
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,400
But are you coming here to monitor me?

3
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,440
What?

4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,660
If that's the case, you don't have to worry about anything.

5
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,020
As you already know, I don't really have friends. So I don't have any place to tell what I heard.

6
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,430
Why would I surveil you? Who do you think you are?

7
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,870
Then, why do you come here?

8
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,890
Using this space is actually special treatment.

9
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,130
Having a personal hideout in this crowded school is an amazing deal.

10
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,300
That is because—

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,730
So I'm going to use this space with you.

12
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,140
What?

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,450
I'm going to do so, just so you know.

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,090
Right, what is our next class?

17
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,390
I think it's math class.

18
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,360
How can you not know for sure when you are the class president?

19
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,820
Ha Min...

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,410
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,240
I confused you with someone I know.

22
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,810
Jae Min, are you okay?

23
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,350
Yes.

24
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,710
Ha Min's younger brother?

25
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,010
Yes, he's Lee Jae Min.

26
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,810
He transferred to this school last year.

27
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,930
After what happened to Ha Min, he moved to a rural area with his mother.

28
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,440
But then his mother got remarried, so he moved back to his father's side.

29
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,930
Have you made up your mind?

30
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,090
As I told you earlier, if it's too hard for you—

31
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,170
- I'll do it.
- What?

32
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,320
I want to try it.

33
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,310
I want to do it.

34
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,120
Teacher.

35
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,570
- I brought everyone's homework.
- Thank you.

36
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,410
Why don't you say hello since you are here? She's the trainee teacher in our class.

37
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,450
Hello.

38
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,180
We meet again.

39
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,090
She's our class president.

40
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,860
I'm Yoon Bo Mi.

41
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,220
Nice to meet you, Bo Mi.

42
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,320
There are days like that sometimes.
[Episode 2: That day's choice]

43
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,920
A day where everything seems to go perfectly.

44
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,940
You look like you are in a good mood. Is there something good that happened?

45
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,100
Nothing. It's just because the sky is pretty today.

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,090
I don't think that's the case. I think something happened.

47
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,170
Why are you being so nosy?

48
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,970
Do not press my head.

49
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,800
Why? Are you worried that you might get shorter?

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,250
I doubt that you'll get shorter than now.

51
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,160
Do you want to get beaten up first thing in the morning?

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,490
Look at how scary Maltese Kang is from early in the morning.

53
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,380
What's wrong with that? It's energetic and nice.

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,420
I got to walk behind Bo Mi.

55
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,700
It was a day like that to Bo Mi.

56
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,780
[ 2-5 Class]

57
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,200
You have to calculate the slope first to get the maximum value.

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,790
Then cosine x minus...

59
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,820
Wow, it's the best sight to look at.

60
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,450
I still can't believe that I'm in the same class as those two.

61
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,160
Look at their unrealistic looks!

62
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,180
What's good to be in the same class with Jae Min when we are not close to him at all?

63
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,860
Why are you saying it like that?

64
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,990
You can be friends with Bo Mi first. She's very nice, so I think it won't be hard to get close to her.

65
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,100
Popular kids like Bo Mi won't worry about things like this, right?

66
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,870
A squared plus B squared is 29.

67
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,400
Is this correct?

68
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,720
Yes, that's correct.

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,290
Bo Mi, you should become a teacher. You are really good at explaining things simply.

70
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,570
Don't overreact. I'm not that good.

71
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,630
Did you think about what I asked you before?

72
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,680
Yoon Bom.

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,600
Let's go to the canteen. I'll get something for you.

74
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,230
Sounds good.

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,160
Get me a melon ice cream and chocolate bread!

76
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,580
Yeah, screw you!

77
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,910
Something really happened to you, didn't it?

78
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,300
Why are you keep asking that? I told you, nothing happened.

79
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,630
Hey, you can't lie to me.

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,010
Your cheeks look like they are about to burst from smiling.

81
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,840
There's no way it would be like that.

82
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,090
There's definitely something going on.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,200
Are you really not going to tell me?

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,050
I'll tell you when things get a bit more sure.

85
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,920
Bo Mi, there are two ways to make a person mad—

86
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,420
Bo Mi!

87
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,730
What are you going to do at lunchtime? Do you want to come with us to eat tteokbokki?

88
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,220
Right! A new place opened across the street, and they are really good.

89
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,740
Bo Mi was particularly bad at turning down people's requests.

90
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,990
I already made a plan to eat lunch with Seon Hee.

91
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,760
Can't you eat with us just once today?

92
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,830
Right. I really wanted to be friends with you, Bo Mi.

93
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,730
It's because someone will get hurt.

94
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,860
Then let's all go, four of us, including Seon Hee.

95
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,740
- Oh, Seon Hee, too?
- Yes.

96
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,490
Seon Hee loves tteokbokki as well.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,790
Yes! That's a great idea.

98
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,890
Okay. Then see you later!

99
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,810
Let's go.

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,980
I knew you'd do that, Yoon Bo Mi.

101
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,160
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,820
I'm talking about what just happened. You couldn't reject their request and said yes.

103
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,950
It's not a favor. They just want to eat lunch together.

104
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:03,540
Do you think they are asking that for nothing? There are reasons and schemes behind it.

105
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,090
I think they just want to become friends.

106
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,120
You are making your life hard. Aren't you tired of pleasing others all the time?

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,810
Are you okay?

108
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,280
What's going on? Should I call 911? Is she dead?!

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,880
Seon Hee, can you go and bring our teacher?

110
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,130
Y-Yes, I will. She's alive, right?

111
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,080
Ha Min...

112
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,430
Ha Min...

113
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,050
I'm sorry. I confused you with someone I know.

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,630
Jae Min, are you okay?

115
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,040
Yes.

116
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,560
Who's Ha Min?

117
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,160
It was from that moment.

118
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm not sure. I also don't know.

119
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,350
Here, why don't you go inside?

120
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,570
Bo Mi's perfect day started to get ruined little by little.

121
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,760
What? That trainee teacher who fainted is in our class?

122
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,260
Yes.

123
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,560
What kind of coincidence is that?

124
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,730
So, why did she pass out?

125
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,720
I don't know. I haven't heard about the reason.

126
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,300
I want to tell this to Lee Jae Min, but he left the school early today.

127
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,700
Jae Min left the school already?

128
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,080
Yes. He left after the fourth class.

129
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,110
Only two people left. Do a bit more! One more to go!

130
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,610
Oh, no! I'm sorry.

131
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,600
- My chicken...
- Did it die?

132
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,470
It died...

133
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,580
It's my bad. I'm really sorry.

134
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,280
It's not mine. So apologize to him.

135
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,790
You should've not spent so much money on the game!

136
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,920
I spent it with my mom's credit card. What should I do?

137
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,120
How long are you going to say sorry to them?

138
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,030
Seon Hee! I think something terrible happened because of me.

139
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,820
What can we do for them when they are tiny as ant's ass so that we can't see them?

140
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,800
Hey, you!

141
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,760
Chihuahua over there.

142
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,200
What? Chihuahua?

143
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,700
If you are going to apologize, do it right.

144
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,640
She just apologized. Didn't you hear it?

145
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,640
You have to apologize until the person accepts it.

146
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,020
How can you call that an apology if you just leave after saying what you want?

147
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,560
I think that's called informing.

148
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,010
You look like a Chihuahua.

149
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,490
And you speak like a dog, too.

150
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,940
The more I think about it, the more it makes me infuriated.

151
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,110
This place is absolutely delicious, isn't it?

152
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,530
Yes, it's so good.

153
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,160
Are you eating? Eat as much as you want.

154
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,050
I heard that you fought with Choi Jin Young.

155
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't get bothered by him so much. He's that kind of person.

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
Yes, he's pretty good-looking but has a terrible personality.

157
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,520
He kept getting in fights with classmates last year as well.

158
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,870
Yes, so he's nickname is Agape.

159
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,120
Agape?

160
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,250
It means he's beating people with his mouth all the time.
T/N: "Agari" is a vulgar way to say mouth, and "Pae-da" means beating in Korean.

161
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,000
You gave him that nickname!

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,980
Really?

163
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,390
Should I just rip his freaking mouth off?

164
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,400
It's the first time for us to eat lunch together, isn't it?

165
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,790
- I think it's the first time eating with the four of us.
- Yes, right.

166
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,630
By the way, do you have a crush on anyone, Bo Mi?

167
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,310
Me?

168
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,110
I like you.

169
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,510
I like you, Bo Mi.

170
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,940
So I want to ask you.

171
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,930
What do you think about me?

172
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,600
You don't have to give me the answer now.

173
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,130
Think about it, and tell me later.

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,300
Instead, will you go out for dinner with me tonight?

175
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,170
I'd like to do that.

176
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,610
Let's hurry up and go. Maltese Kang will be waiting for us.

177
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,160
- I do have someone in mind—
- Is that person...

178
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,710
Is that person Jae Min?

179
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,630
What?

180
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,470
In fact, she has a huge crush on Jae Min.

181
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, stop it!

182
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,410
But I know that I don't have any chance, so I don't expect to date him.

183
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,170
I just want to be friends with him.

184
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,230
Will you not be happy with it if I ask you to help me out?

185
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,540
I'm not happy with that request.

186
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,340
You take care of your own business. Why are you asking that to Yoon Bom?

187
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,020
Seon Hee, why are you saying it like that? I'm talking to Bo Mi right now.

188
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,360
It's because I have feelings for him, too.

189
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,590
I like Lee Jae Min as well. So I don't like your request.

190
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,940
But doesn't Bo Mi also have feelings for Jae Min?

191
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,900
How can best friends have a crush on the same person?

192
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,150
At that moment, Bo Mi was at the crossroad of choice.

193
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,490
Guys, I think there's a misunderstanding.

194
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,170
I don't have any feelings for Jae Min.

195
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,150
Lee Ha Min's younger brother?

196
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,920
Yes.

197
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,000
He looks exactly like Ha Min.

198
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,340
Are you really going to be okay doing your training over there?

199
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,530
Han So Mang, enduring when you are not okay is also just a lingering feeling.

200
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,370
What will change for you to do so?

201
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:58,790
Yoo Kyeong, I met Ha Min's brother in the school after returning there after six years.

202
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,800
Also, he's in my class.

203
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,360
Do you think this is all just coincidence?

204
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,950
If it's not, then what is it?

205
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:15,360
I think I can do something for that kid...

206
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,960
No, I feel like I have to do something for him.

207
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,210
- So Mang.
- It might be Ha Min's wish.

208
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm going to do my training until the end.

209
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't feel well suddenly.

210
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,420
Do you have time tonight?

211
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,890
- Jae Min.
- Yes?

212
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,270
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,010
But let's just stay as friends.

214
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,480
Don't be sorry. It's not like you don't want to see me ever again.

215
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,510
But can I ask you the reason?

216
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,200
The thing is...

217
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,600
I have feelings for someone else.

218
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,660
[Han So Mang]

219
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,570
This is the trainee teacher who will do the training in our class for this semester.

220
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,950
Hello, I'm Han So Mang.

221
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,110
My subject to teach is Korean, and I look forward to the time to spend together.

222
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,170
Also, Ms. Han is an alumnus of this school!

223
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,480
- Senior!
- Can you tell us your first love story?

224
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,850
- Why are you so pretty, Ms. Han?
- Do you have a boyfriend?

225
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,580
I'll come later after talking to the students.

226
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,210
Okay.

227
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,710
Jae Min.

228
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,980
Can I talk to you for a second?

229
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,830
Yes.

230
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,900
- Where are you going?
- What's going on?

231
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,960
Yoon Bom, we need to talk.

232
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,160
What happened yesterday, don't put that on your mind.

233
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,450
I just said that because I didn't like seeing Jo Gyu Ri acting out. I didn't mean what I said.

234
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,140
So you should also stop saying what you don't mean.

235
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,590
Guys, I think there's a misunderstanding.

236
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,490
I don't have any feelings for Jae Min.

237
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,800
What?

238
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,230
Bo Mi felt more comfortable putting someone else first than herself.

239
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,600
Then?

240
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,320
I have a crush on someone else.

241
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,230
It's because that's for everybody.

242
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,680
What the heck are you doing—?

243
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,190
Then who is your crush, Bo Mi?

244
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,280
Well, that is...

245
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,730
What Bo Mi needed at that moment was a person who was the most irrelevant to her.

246
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,950
She needed a person who she could say her mind changed because of time passed.

247
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,030
It's Jin Young.

248
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,720
I have feelings for Choi Jin Young.

249
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,170
- Agape?
- Yes, Agape.

250
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,450
Agape?

251
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,310
I heard it from your homeroom teacher.

252
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,590
That you are Ha Min's brother.

253
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,320
Yes.

254
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,280
I'm sorry about yesterday.

255
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,480
You looked so much like Ha Min, so I made a mistake.

256
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,150
How do you know my brother?

257
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,540
We were friends.

258
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,710
Then, I'll get going now.

259
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,450
Wait, Jae Min.

260
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,950
I'm just wondering...

261
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,910
Will you be a model for a drawing?

262
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,710
I decided to believe it.

263
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,440
That this must be your wish.

264
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,480
Please watch me.

265
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,250
I'll protect you, no matter what this time.

266
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,980
It's Jin Young.
[Epilogue]

267
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,400
I have feelings for Choi Jin Young.

269
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,700
[Seasons of Blossom]

270
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,950
Do your friends know that you are thinking about this stuff?

271
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,090
I don't have any friends. Don't pretend you know me outside of this room.

272
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,200
How will you explain that nonsense that you have feelings for Choi Jin Young?

273
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,190
What are you going to do if you don't believe it?

274
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm saying that's how I feel.

275
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,300
I met someone who knows about my older brother. I might figure out about his death.

276
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,290
It's weird. I thought you had feelings for me.

277
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,620
What?
