So the most suitable explanation for the A and B is the number 2, using the present tense.

You said something very unexpected.

160
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,450
I heard that you said I'm cool.

161
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,240
Did she only tell you that? There is a lot more.

162
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,110
What did you say about me besides that?

163
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,350
I can't tell you that. It's a secret between siblings.

164
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,790
Now that I think of it, there is not that much left.

165
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,720
Of what?

166
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,800
The time that we have dating.

167
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,830
So what do you want to do about it, Jin Young?

168
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,550
What do you want to do?

169
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,390
Hello, Jae Min's mother. I'm Han So Mang, a trainee teacher at Seoyeon High school.

170
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,220
I'm contacting you because I have something to tell you about Jae Min.

171
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,240
Oh?
[Ha Min]

172
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,330
Did you get your phone back?

173
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,960
No, I'm using it in secret right now.

174
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,000
Is that so?

175
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,430
My friend came into the art classroom earlier, so I couldn't talk with you.

176
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,950
It's okay. I can see you next time.

177
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,230
Then when should we see each other?

178
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,880
Well, I'm not sure.

179
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,010
I think we can see each other soon. See you soon.

180
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,780
Okay, see you soon.

181
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,340
Like that, we had to be in our own world...

182
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,470
and spend separate time alone.

183
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,680
Why do we have to do this when it's a perfect time to be sleepy?

184
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,730
In a distance that's reachable but not reachable,

185
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,160
- we spent lonely and empty time.
- Lee Joon, is it you again? Let's wear a tie and vest.

186
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,900
Hey, guys! Why don't we ask Ha Min to read out his answers?

187
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,560
He'll get a perfect score anyway.

188
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,220
Ha Min, can you share your answers?

189
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,550
The first question is the fourth one, the second question is the fifth one,

190
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,620
the third question is the second one, the fourth question is the third one.

191
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,610
The fifth is the third one.

192
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,220
- And the sixth question—
- Ha Min.

193
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,620
Isn't the correct answer to the fifth question the second one?

194
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,080
What?

195
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,610
- Right, I marked the second one as well.
- I got the second one, too.

196
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,800
Guys! The answers to the math test came out!

197
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,470
The first question is the fourth one, the second is the fifth one,

198
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,000
the third is the first one, and the fourth is the second one...

199
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,680
- I guessed this one, but I got it right.
- Did he purposely tell us the wrong answers?

200
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,710
Why are you saying it like that? Ha Min must be embarrassed already.

201
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,680
But it feels like it.

202
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,390
I'll read out the rest.

203
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,120
The sixth question is the fourth one.

204
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,660
The seventh question is the fourth one.

205
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,110
- I'm hungry.
- Let's go eat something.

206
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,780
- What should we eat? Shall we go for tteokbokki?
- Deal.

207
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,240
So Mang, let's get some tteokbokki. How does that sound?

208
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,700
Who's Han So Mang in this class?

209
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,410
Yes?

210
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,260
The art teacher wants you to come to the art classroom.

211
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,880
Okay.

212
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,240
Do you want me to come with you?

213
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,590
It's okay. I can go on my own.

214
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,800
Sir? What?

215
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,660
You surprised me! Was it you who called me?

216
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,830
Please don't move. I'm recharging right now.

217
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,140
Why? Is it because of what happened earlier?

218
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,050
What should I do now?

219
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,440
I don't know how to endure without you anymore.

220
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,080
What makes you suffer so much?

221
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,750
Forcing myself to do something that I don't like.

222
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,120
Before, I was okay with it.

223
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,830
But now, I can't do anything without you.

224
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,580
I just wanted to comfort you.

225
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,970
But I didn't know my consolation

226
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,540
could hurt you.

227
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,700
[Epilogue]

228
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,340
I heard about it from Jae Min.

229
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,040
That you'd been a great support to Ha Min.

230
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,870
The reason why I asked you to see me today is because of Jae Min.

231
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,110
It seems like Jae Min is having a tough time.

232
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:22,950
In fact, there was a reason why Jae Min moved back to Seoul.

233
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,450
A reason?

234
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
Jae Min.

235
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,760
Please don't move and stay right there.

236
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,690
I'll come over to you.

237
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,610
Jae Min, you were just pranking me. Right?

238
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,210
You didn't think of something horrible, did you?

239
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,250
I'm sorry, Mom. But I...

240
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,490
I really miss my brother.

241
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh, no! Please don't do this to me.

242
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:22,110
That's why we brought him back to the old house and the school where his brother used to go.

243
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,320
Do you think my Jae Min will be okay?

244
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,650
Jae Min's mother...

245
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,040
Ms. Han, please help my Jae Min.

246
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,160
Please help my Jae Min.

247
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,020
Please take care of my Jae Min.
