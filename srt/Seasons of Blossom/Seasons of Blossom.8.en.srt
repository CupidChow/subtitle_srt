I'm pretty good at sports.

3

But you were really bad at it.

4

People can't be good at everything, right?

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,390
That's good. You were terrible at playing Gomoku, so I was worried you'd also be bad at badminton.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,630
Are you keep going to mock me that I'm not good with Gomoku?

7

When did I mock you? I'm just stating a fact.

I know it's a fake relationship, but aren't you speaking too harshly to your girlfriend?

I guess people still don't know that I'm dating Jin Young.

25
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,850
No, it's more like you can still make a goal when there's a goalkeeper, kind of thing.

26
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,930
Isn't Jin Young trusting his face too much and not doing anything?

Of course, it's Dong Seok.

You are not acting enough like her boyfriend, so people are giving flowers to her!

Exactly. Also, you always call her "Yoon Bo Mi." You better treat her better!

- How is it?
- It's so pretty!

160
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,720
So Mang, are you going to go to art school? Which academy are you going to?

161
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,160
I don't go to any academies, but I go to an art studio.

162
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,820
Then, are you not going to take tests for art colleges?

163
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,680
I'm not sure yet. I just love painting.

164
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,150
I understand that feeling 200%. I'm always getting criticized as a detailed depiction pervert in my academy.

165
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,950
But if you change your mind, let me know. I have the entire list for these academies.

166
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,130
I will!

167
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,970
So Mang, can you draw something on my face, too? Right here.

168
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,380
What about a tulip? Or do you want a bunny like this?

169

Han So Mang, let's go.

170

171
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,810
Yes, why do you ask?

172
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,020
Then I'll bring her with me. Other places need help.

173

Look over there. Don't you see that they are busy?

183

Everyone's busy working, but you were leisurely chatting. Don't you think you lack responsibility?

184
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,090
That was the brief moment I took a break!

185
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,940
Anyway, just get to the delivery.

186

Huh? Hurry up.

- All of these need to go, right?
- Yes.

189

I have to go take down the equipment. I'll call more people to help you.

Where did you lose your conscience? Forget about that, and let's go to the Illustration fair.

- You are Choi Jin Young, right?
- Yes, I am. So what?

No, I can't see that.

You are Yoon Bo Mi's boyfriend, right?

200
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,670
Yoon Bo Mi doesn't have a good eye for men.

201
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:11,230
Hey, you better break up with her when I'm talking to you nicely.

202

What will you do if I don't break up with her?

203
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,460
Then you'll get beaten up by this big brother! Do you want to crawl back home?

204
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,050
Do you think Yoon Bo Mi will date someone like you if I break up with her?

What's wrong with me?

You'll be the one who hit her boyfriend.

Even so! I'm still way better than you.

Why is she dating a guy like him?

Isn't it simple?

210
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,090
It's because she likes me.

211
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,960
Also, more importantly, I have no intention of breaking up with her.

What are you going to make me do now?

Why do you think I've pretended not to know you until now?

238
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,410
Wasn't it because you were embarrassed?

I wanted to be the only one who knew you.

If so, everybody will fall for you.
