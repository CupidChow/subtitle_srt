Jiulong Group.

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,500
(Jiulong Group)

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,740
(Jiulong Group)

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,340
Jiulong Group is
actually Jiang Enterprises.

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,460
What?

38
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,460
Yuan's family went bankrupt
because of Jiang Enterprises.

39
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,340
(Xinran)

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,460
Hey.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,500
Yuan.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,660
I have something to tell you.

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,340
But please don't get upset.

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,460
Xinran.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,460
What is it? Why so mysterious?

46
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,140
Jiulong Group is Jiang Enterprises.

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,740
What's wrong, darling? You look upset.

48
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,380
Come in.

49
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,180
Did you already know?

50
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,420
Know what?

51
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,340
I'm asking if you knew from the start.

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,460
You knew from the very beginning

53
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,100
that my dad and mom

54
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,620
were driven to their deaths
by Jiang Enterprises.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,660
Who told you that?

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,260
So you did know.

57
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,940
Then why didn't you tell me?

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,900
Why let me hear it from someone else?

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,340
So,

60
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,340
Jiulong Group

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,140
was the one that suddenly
pulled their investment back,

62
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,420
leaving my parents' company

63
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,140
to fail on its own.

64
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,740
Is that right?

65
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,660
You all knew

66
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,500
my parents were scrambling,

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,100
trying to secure

68
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,300
your investment,

69
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
and our staff were fully committed

70
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,100
to supporting the company.

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,300
But you just

72
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
suddenly withdrew the money

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,420
and broke your promise.

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,260
Every phase, the company

75
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,140
has a different operational strategy.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
We feel really sorry

77
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
about what happened.

78
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,020
Sorry?

79
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,220
You really should be sorry.

80
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,060
You seem pretty relaxed,

81
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,340
but for those who

82
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,420
gave their all,

83
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
who fought desperately for this,

84
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,900
that meant everything.

85
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,900
Does Anlan know?

86
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,020
Does Anlan know

87
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,340
about this?

88
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,300
Does he know

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,180
I'm that little girl
from the Yao family?

90
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,260
Actually, from the moment
I started chasing you,

91
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,940
I already knew all this.

92
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,420
So from the start,

93
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,020
you never let me know the truth.

94
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,060
But since you met me,

95
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,300
you've had so many chances

96
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,540
to be honest with me.

97
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,900
But you chose to lie instead.

98
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,740
Is that right?

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,500
There were many times

100
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,740
I really wanted to tell you,

101
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,180
but I was too afraid of losing you.

102
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,300
Let's break up.

103
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,810
Darling,

104
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,100
what are you saying?

105
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,620
Don't say that.

106
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,470
I'll tell you

107
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,500
whatever you want to know.

108
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,260
We can't break up.

109
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,740
You shouldn't have

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,300
let me fall in love with you

111
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,420
without knowing the truth.

112
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,620
How could you treat me like this?

113
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,020
Now I'm completely dependent on you,

114
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,500
but you let me find out the truth.

115
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
What do you want me to do?

116
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,460
Then don't leave.

117
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,220
Didn't we agree we'd always be together?

118
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,700
Aren't we getting married?

119
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,700
I...

120
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,300
Actually, when I
first found out about this,

121
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
I went to find you,

122
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,700
trying to make it up.

123
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,020
But you'd already moved

124
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,940
and gone to another school.

125
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,540
I thought this would

126
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,220
just be the end for us.

127
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,340
But then, by chance,

128
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,260
I ran into you again.

129
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,340
I thought none of this

130
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,420
would ever come between us,

131
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,740
so I kept it from you.

132
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,380
Everything I've done

133
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,780
is for your sake.

134
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,420
You thought?

135
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,260
You just assume everything.

136
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,140
Have you ever thought about how I feel?

137
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,420
What do you think I'll do if I find out?

138
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
I...

139
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,980
Enough, it's too late now.

140
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,820
It's just too late.

143
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,180

Xinran.

161
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,580
From the day he met me,

162
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,380
he knew everything.

163
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,420
The moment he saw me, he already knew.

164
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,740
Why didn't he tell me?

165
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,100
He didn't say a word to me.

166
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
Xinran.

167
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,460
Tell me.

168
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,300
Do you think he felt sorry for me?

169
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,980
He definitely didn't feel sorry for you.

170
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,580
If he did feel sorry,

171
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,420
wouldn't he have just
given you some money?

172
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,020
Then why doesn't he think about me?

173
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,300
Why doesn't he consider
what will happen to us?

174
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,380
Alright, stop crying now.

175
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,860
Let's not think about anything.

176
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,620
But right now,

177
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
my heart really hurts.

178
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,660
It... it hurts so much.

179

181
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,860
Calm down a little.

182
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,020
Let's not think about anything for now.

183
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,460
Go get some sleep first.

184
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,220
When you wake up,
everything will be fine.

185
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,180
- Okay?
- Xinran.

186
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,020
I... I...

187
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,100
I don't want to break up with him.

188
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,700
I don't want us to separate.

189
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,340

I don't want to be apart from him.

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,780
I like him so, so much.

193
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,860
Alright, stop crying.

194
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,180
But I can't be with him.

195
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,180
I really like him, you know.

196
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,140
There, don't cry anymore.

197
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,020
What am I supposed to do?

198
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,740
Don't cry, tomorrow
everything will be fine.

199
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,140
Don't cry, be good.

200
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,500
Boss, are you okay?

201
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,820
Yeah, what exactly happened?

202
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,580
Xinran called, and
accused me on the phone,

203
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,140
asking if I was helping you
hide things from Yuan.

204
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,980
I was completely stunned.

205
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,140
I had no idea there was any

206
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,420
connection between your families.

207
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,420
How is Yao Yuan doing?

208
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,980
Xinran said she cried herself to sleep.

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,540
It's all my fault.

210
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,340
I thought as long as Yao Yuan and I
loved each other firmly,

211
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,980
nothing would stand in our way.

212
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,780
I was so foolish.

213
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,220
This has nothing to do with you.

214
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,500
Don't blame yourself.

215
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,180
I had already been looking
for a chance to tell her.

216
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,620
I just didn't have the courage.

217
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,220
It was all written down in the plan.

218
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,660
But I still couldn't say it out.

219
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,700
You guys should go.

220
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,380
I want some time alone.

221
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,300
If you need any help, just say the word.

222
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,340
We're all here for you.

223
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,820
Don't worry about Anlan.

224
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,600
There's no challenge he can't handle.

225
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,300
I've known Boss for years.

226
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,140
He's never worried about anything.

227
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,340
Only around Yuan,

228
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
he feels hurt,

229
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,380
gets upset,

230
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,620
and acts like a kid.

231
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,700
He pays extra attention

232
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,260
whenever it involves her.

233
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,900
They can't reconcile now,

234
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,260
but it doesn't mean
they won't make peace in the future.

235
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,420
From what I know about Anlan,

236
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,780
he won't give up so easily.

237
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,740
If Yuan doesn't forgive him,

238
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,220
he'll never find peace.

239
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,740
I think none of us

240
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,820
will have an easy time.

241
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,540
I've been thinking,

242
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,820
and I feel Jiang Ancheng
has another agenda.

243
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,780
What do you mean?

244
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,110
First, it was Yuan's uncle,

245
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,060
then he told Li Xiaoya about

246
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,940
Boss's plan to pursue Yuan.

247
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,820
That indirectly let Yuan find out

248
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,620
and made them have a huge fight.

249
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,140
And now,

250
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,500
he told Yuan Jiulong is

251
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,300
the same company that caused
her family to go bankrupt.

252
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,380
Isn't he just making things
harder for Boss?

253
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,180
But the Jiang family's
on board with them dating.

254
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,380
Why would he do this?

255
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,900
I can't figure it out.

256
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,980
Now, I just hope Anlan
can pull himself together quickly.

257
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,780
Yuan.

258
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,740
Yuan, come on, eat something.

259
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,380
If you still don't eat or drink anything,

260
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,660
your health will break down.

261
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,260
Anlan has called me several times.

262
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,260
He's also asked Wen Cheng
to check on you.

263
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,260
Why not talk to him?

264
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,300
Yuan.

265
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,860
Do you still love him?

266
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,540
Actually,

267
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,660
I understand why
Anlan kept things from you.

268
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,900
I get why he did what he did.

269
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,380
If it were me,

270
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,460
I'd probably do the same.

271
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,500
Xinran.

272
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,460
I really can't accept this.

273
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,940
He should have

274
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,180
been honest with me

275
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,660
from the very start.

276
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,780
Think about it,

277
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,860
what if I had no idea at all?

278
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,020
I could've ended up marrying him.

279
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,060
How could I face my parents then?

280
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,180
You're right.

281
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,820
In the end, he was just selfish.

282
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,140
But

283
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,020
who isn't selfish when it comes to love?

284
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,460
But I don't want it to be like this.

285
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,300
I just

286
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,210
can't get past this.

287
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,060
But

288
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,020
I can't sleep at all.

289
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,300
Right now,

290
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,820
he's all I can think about.

291
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,380
When I open my eyes, it's him.

292
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,660
When I close them, it's still him.

293
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,340
No matter what I do,

294
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,580
he's always right there, in front of me.

295
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,140
I just can't stop thinking about him.

296
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,100
What do I do,

297
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,940
Xinran?

298
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,070
Okay, Yuan,

299
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,690
let's not think about anything for now.

300
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,220
Just clear your mind, alright?

301
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,820
I've already prepared your breakfast.

302
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,940
Eat some in a little while.

303
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
I won't bother you anymore.

304
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,500
Take some time
to calm down and think, okay?

305
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,300
How did it go?

306
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,580
- Did Yao answer?
- Sorry.

307
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,730
The number you dialed is currently busy.

308
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,580
She's not answering
to calls or messages.

309
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,080
That's strange.

310
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,020
Yao is never late.

311
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,510
Could something have happened?

312
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,500
Stop overthinking.

313
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,100
Maybe she'd come with Master.

314
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,500
Anlan.

315
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,380
Hey, Master.

316
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,540
Hey, Master.

317
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,100
Master looks really upset.

318
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,580
Did they have a fight?

319
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,020
They must have fallen out

320
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,260
over Ancheng's acquisition
of Yao's uncle's restaurant.

321
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,900
Yao hasn't even shown up for her shift.

322
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,740
It must be serious.

323
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,060
Yeah.

324
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,660
The inspection report is out.

325
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,260
Leave me, please.

326
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,540
(Sample Material Inspection Report)

327
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,380
(Inspection Result: Failed)

328
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,340
When did you find out?

329
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,500
I didn't have any impression
of Yao Yuan.

330
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,500
Chen and Uncle remembered her
and told me.

331
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,660
When Yao Yuan came looking for you,

332
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,650
why didn't you tell me?

333
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,920
If I did, would it have helped?

334
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,810
At least I wouldn't
have been caught off guard

335
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,680
and be helpless to respond
to Yao Yuan's questions.

336
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,380
Why?

337
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,390
It wasn't in the plan,

338
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,880
so it surprised you?

339
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,660
Ancheng,

340
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,460
why?

341
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,780
Are you, like Aunt,
against us being together?

342
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,500
Who you're with isn't my concern.

343
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,820
I know.

344
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,340
You've always treated that as a stain,

345
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
and for a long time,

346
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,940
you refused to forgive us.

347
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,940
But don't forget,

348
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,940
you're part of the Jiang family.

349
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,580
If that was a mistake,

350
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,020
you're part of that mistake as well.

351
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,220
So you told Yao Yuan all this

352
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,740
before we got married.

353
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,620
Was that your way

354
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,020
of warning me about my mistake?

355
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,040
Don't put this all on me.

356
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,980
You should've told Yao Yuan

357
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,940
yourself from the start.

358
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,900
Were you planning to hide it
until after the wedding,

359
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,260
so she'd find out herself?

360
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,020
I have my own approach.

361
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,300
She has the right to know.

362
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,100
Anlan,

363
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,620
I really want to ask you.

364
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,180
Knowing who Yao Yuan is,

365
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,020
why did you still pursue her?

366
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,420
Was it just out of pity,

367
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,300
to make up for her?

368
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,580
I fell in love with her a long time ago,

369
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,260
but I never imagined my family

370
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,810
would cause such destruction to her.

371
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,140
I thought

372
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,300
you were confused by your own sympathy.

373
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,260
What do you mean?

374
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,260
Maybe you don't realize it,

375
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,740
but you've always
been better than others.

376
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,340
At some point,

377
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,460
you started seeing

378
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,500
helping others as a way
to show off your compassion.

379
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,580
You keep telling our parents
how much you admire me.

380
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,300
When you left Jiulong Group,

381
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,620
you thought you were helping me.

382
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,460
Anlan,

383
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,620
feeling sorry for someone

384
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,860
means you already think
you're better than them.

385
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,260
Honestly,

386
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,860
I really don't like you pitying me.

387
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,460
So that's how you see it.

388
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,700
Alright, now I get it.

389
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,580
You just want to see me suffer.

390
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,940
Ancheng.

391
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,100
I don't want to say it again.

392
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,860
You're my brother.

393
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,750
I've never once felt sorry for you.

394
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,950
I respect you. I even like you.

395
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,220
I left Jiulong purely because

396
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,580
I didn't want to witness what happened

397
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,610
to Yao Yuan's parents again.

398
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,560
I thought my silent protest

399
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,610
could change something.

400
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,260
But your actions

401
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,060
have already made you someone

402
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,300
people feel sorry for.

403
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,340
With your ability,
you shouldn't be like this.

404
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,980
I'm leaving, Ancheng.

Alright.

419
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,100
But are you really going to quit?

420
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Why so sudden?

421
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,180
Yeah, exactly.

422
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,900
Oh, I get it now.

423
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,170
You're preparing for the wedding.

424
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,680
Anlan, you're here.

425
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,900
Master, what's going on?
Yuan is quitting.

426
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,300
Take care.

427
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,500
You too.

428
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,540
I will, thank you.

429
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,380
Boss.

430
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,100
Take a few days off.

431
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,900
Come back when you're ready.

432
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,820
No need.

433
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,900
You know what it is.

434
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
I've made up my mind.

435
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,180
Hey, Yao.

436
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,860
I heard breakups
peak right before weddings.

437
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,740
Li Ao, what's really going on?

438
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,020
Are you really leaving?

439
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,980
Don't waste any more time on me.

440
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,940
Focus your energy

441
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,020
on things that really matter.

442
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,140
You are what matters most.

443
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,660
I know you're mad at me and my family.

444
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,540
But the best way to get back at them

445
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,740
is to be with me.

446
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,060
Just be with me and treat me...

447
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,220
I won't get back at them.

448
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,140
I don't have that kind of power.

449
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,700
And I would never drag you
into it or blame you.

450
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,260
It's just that

451
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,660
I really don't know

452
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,100
how I'm supposed to be with you.

453
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,500
I know you can't forgive me

454
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,340
for hiding things from you.

455
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
I did make mistakes.

456
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,140
But my feelings for you

457
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,380
were never anything but real.

458
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,380
I don't want to think about this now.

459
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,620
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

460
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,260
Tell me you don't love me.

461
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,340
I fought so hard

462
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,540
just to be with you.

463
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,340
No matter what happens,

464
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,820
I won't let you go easily.

465
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,540
I'll wait for you

466
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,740
until the day you accept me.

467
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,860
But I...

468
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,980
Every time I see you now,

469
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,660
I can't help but think of my parents.

470
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,140
What am I supposed to do?

471
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,740
Boss.

472
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,060
Boss.

473
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
Are you okay?

474
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,820
Should I cancel the meeting?

475
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,580
No need.

476
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,860
Give me the files.

477
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,180
(Company Employee Rewards
Yao Yuan, Fang Jianing)

478
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,020
This month's expenses

479
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,740
include some from the Xiduomeng Project.

480
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,580
Also, next month's financial plan

481
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,420
needs your review.

482
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,420

483
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,220
Boss.

484
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,820
Ah?

485
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,940
Don't push yourself.

486
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,980
I'll cancel the meeting for you.

487
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,740
Okay.

488
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,900
Ziyun Mountain got its name

489
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,740
because it's purple.

490
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,260
And Picasso believed that

491
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,380
blue is special.

492
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,580
In ancient Egypt's tradition,

493
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
it symbolizes hell

494
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,780
and stands for death.

495
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
The appearance of blue

496
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,860
means a path to death

497
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,260
is unfolding.

498
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,340
Ziyun Mountain is painted with blue,

499
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,140
turning from a dating spot

500
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,380
into a place for breakups.

501
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,140
But

502
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,460
since you painted Ziyun Mountain,

503
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,020
it shows you still care.

504
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,260
Yao Yuan,

505
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,780
can you really bury this relationship?

506
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,900
No matter what,

507
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,980
what's meant to end

508
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,900
will end sooner or later.

509
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,140
Now's not the time to force yourself.

510
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,700
That only makes it hurt more.

511
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,020
No matter what happens,

512
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,060
we've always been here.

513
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,300
There's no room for weakness.

514
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,460
You were never truly alone.

(Hurun Report)

516
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,500
Dad, Mom made you ginseng tea.

517
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,940
Just leave it there.

518
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,180
Ancheng.

519
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,300
How's Anlan doing lately?

520
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,700
I haven't seen him for days.

521
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,980
Weren't you two working
on the project together?

522
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,380
Seems it's because of Miss Yao.

523
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,500
Anlan doesn't seem focused.

524
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,260
Did something happen between them?

525
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,380
Looks like they broke up.

526
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,940
Anlan must be feeling terrible.

527
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,590
Right.

528
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,020
Now, Li Ao is managing the company.

529
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,620
Go to your grandma's
and clear your mind.

530
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,060
I'll come find you later.

531
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,500
Got it. Don't worry about me.

532
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,620
I'll take good care of myself.

533
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,740
Remember to call me when you arrive.

534
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,260
Alright, I'm off. Bye.

535
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,380
Okay, bye.

536
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,940
Why are you here?

537
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,860
Just trying my luck,

538
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,820
seeing if I have a chance

539
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,700
to be your knight.

540
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,580
Didn't expect to wait only four days

541
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,420
to see you.

542
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,900
Am I really that lucky?

543
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,580
Thank you.

544
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,610
But lately, I might not...

545
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,760
You believe whatever others say?

546
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,500
I didn't wait just four days.

547
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,020
Xinran told Wen Cheng
you'd go find your grandma,

548
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,380
so he asked me to come over

549
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,340
to look after you for Anlan.

550
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,820
If you still consider me a friend,

551
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,660
don't shut me out.

552
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,060
Alright?

553
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,660
Let's go.

554
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,660
Just treat me like I'm invisible
on this trip.

555
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,710
Pretend I'm not here.

556
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,000
Let's get going.

557
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,100
How's Yuan doing today?

558
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,020
Shouldn't you be calling to check on me?

559
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,460
Who are you inquiring for?

560
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,280
Jiang Anlan.

561
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,320
Don't worry, she's already at Grandma's.

562
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,380
I'm wondering

563
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,300
when will those two finally make up.

564
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,060
How long do we have to
keep passing messages?

565
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,820
Even if it takes ten years,
we have to help.

566
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,900
Don't forget,

567
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,940
they put in a lot of effort

568
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,180
to help us get together.

569
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,660
Yeah,

570
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,740
I know that.

571
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,260
But I hope they make up quickly.

572
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,220
I hope the Tianxia Gang won't fall apart
because of this.

573
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,300
Let's hope so.

574
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
Alright, you better get back to work.

575
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,140
Yeah, bye.

576
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,180
Have some dim sum.

577
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,580
I just made them this morning.

578
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,740
Take a sip of tea,
have a bite of dim sum.

579
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,900
That's the best flavor.

580
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,060
Go ahead, try it.

581
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,100
Grandma, I swear,

582
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,140
this is the best dim sum

583
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,300
I've ever had.

584
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,180
Oh, look at you, kid,

585
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,390
you're quite the charmer.

586
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,540
Yuan.

587
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,700
Yuan.

588
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,860
Have some dim sum.

589
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,420
See if you like it.

590
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,340
Mmm, it's good.

591
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,620
So delicious.

592
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,620
Oh, look at you.

593
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,220
Be careful.

594
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,620
You're almost getting married,

595
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,060
but you still eat like a kid.

596
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,180
So careless.

597
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,860
Grandma, how do you make this dim sum?

598
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,180
I want to learn.

599
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,020
You want to learn?

600
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,620

00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,540
Then why did you ask me?

673
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,220
I just wanted to know

674
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,340
whether Yao and Anlan

675
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,460
broke up because of him.

676
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,140

00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,340
actually had a big fight

680
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,300
Is Ancheng

681
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,660
alright?

682
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,860

683
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,340
What about you?

684
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,940
If you cared whether Ancheng was okay,

685
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,220
would you ask him directly?

686
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,220
So you feel the same as me,

687
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,580
worried that checking on him now

688
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,780
might feel like a betrayal to Yao Yuan?

689
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,820
I'm really mad at him,

690
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,660

691
