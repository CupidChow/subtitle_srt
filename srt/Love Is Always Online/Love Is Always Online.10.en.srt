1
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,201
I'll leave the evaluation to you.

2
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,161
But you need to watch the timing.

3
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:39,601
No problem.

4
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:41,081
Alright, thanks.

5
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:44,601
Xiaoya.

6
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:47,641
What's wrong?

7
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,361
Are you crying?

8
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,681
Didn't you see a movie with Wen Cheng yesterday?

9
00:01:58,721 --> 00:01:59,481
Did he bully you?

10
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:01,801
It's nothing.

11
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,281
What did he do to you?

12
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:05,001
Tell me.

13
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,881
Darn it, I'll go settle this with him.

14
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:07,841
I said it's nothing.

15
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,081
Can you stop asking, please?

16
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,681
That damn Wen Cheng.

17
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:24,601
Why are you in such a rush to find me?

18
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:26,881
What did you do to Xiaoya?

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,640
Why is she crying?

20
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
How do you know?

21
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:30,921
Go ask her yourself.

22
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,521
She won't tell me, that's why I'm asking you.

23
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,441
How am I supposed to explain this?

24
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,761
I wanted popcorn too.

25
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:46,761
Ah.

26
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:02,721
So scary.

27
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,400
You...

28
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:11,601
What are you doing?

29
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,480
Sorry.

30
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,561
My ears are really sensitive.

31
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:15,081
Let me help you up.

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
Sorry, sorry.

33
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:21,681
Are you okay?

34
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,401
Sorry about that.

35
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,161
What do you expect me to do?

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm really sensitive here.

37
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,121
It's like a knee-jerk reaction.

38
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:34,441
I really can't help it.

39
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:38,841
I swear I didn't mean it.

40
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,121
I love popcorn so much.

41
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,241
Why would I spill it on purpose?

42
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,201
Even now...

43
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,241
You're still worried about popcorn?

44
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,001
That misunderstanding is cleared up.

45
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,241
Then I'll head out.

46
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,121
Hey, wait.

47
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:54,721
Since you're here,

48
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,201
do you want to be a guest on my show?

49
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:57,441
We're short on people right now.

50
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,561
They're inside the studio

51
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,361
rounding up staff.

52
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,201
No, I don't want to be on camera.

53
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,281
You really think all celebrities look good?

54
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,001
Some of them off camera

55
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,401
look like monsters and freaks.

56
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,601
It's all makeup and lighting.

57
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:11,481
What do you mean?

58
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,001
Are you saying I look like a freak?

59
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,041
Are you asking for trouble?

60
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,721
I meant you're the "wise one" part.

61
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,361
Like a wise one.

62
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:17,801
Come on, let's go.

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,160
Filming is really fun.

64
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,881
Just give it a try, really.

65
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,241
You might end up liking it, right?

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,680
Why are you like this?

67
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,441
Trust me, it's fun.

68
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:27,481
Today,

69
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,361
I'm teaching art theory.

70
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,601
Su Wen, go ahead.

71
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:53,721
I'm just auditing.

72
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:55,841
Why are you here?

73
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,201
For class.

74
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,321
Looks like Instructor Su is really famous.

75
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,720
Even Boss Jiang made time to come.

76
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,281
A class by such a great artist from our company—

77
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,601
How could I miss it?

78
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,761
Instructor Su, please continue.

79
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:16,841
Architecture

80
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:19,561
is also a form of artistic expression.

81
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,121
It reflects people's lifestyles

82
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,241
and ways of thinking.

83
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,841
These are the three Greek orders.

84
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:28,961
Can any student tell me

85
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:31,321
what these three orders mean?

86
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,161
I've heard Boss Jiang is very knowledgeable

87
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,081
and has his own views on art.

88
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,281
Let's have Boss Jiang explain to everyone

89
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,841
what these three orders represent.

90
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,681
Is that alright?

91
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,201
Alright.

92
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:01,761
The first one

93
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,360
is called the Doric order.

94
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:04,961
Hey, Jiang Anlan.

95
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:06,601
You're such a big boss,

96
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:07,961
why are you stirring things up in my class?

97
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,561
Who's stirring things up?

98
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,081
You're the one who caused the commotion.

99
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,121
Before you came, I was seriously

100
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,561
teaching and answering questions.

101
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,921
So after seeing me,

102
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,441
you lost your composure.

103
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,481
Since when did you care about my opinion?

104
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:24,201
I care about Yao Yuan's opinion.

105
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:28,561
You don't need to care too much about others' opinions.

106
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:29,441
If you were like me,

107
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:30,281
you'd decide to be with Yao Yuan

108
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,681
and stay together for a lifetime.

109
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,041
No need to care about what others think.

110
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,601
A lifetime?

111
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,321
Do you even know what you'll have for lunch later?

112
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,081
I'm just a practical person.

113
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,041
Ten years.

114
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:41,361
I can make Yao Yuan happy for ten years.

115
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,401
What about after ten years?

116
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,521
If she isn't happy after ten years,

117
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:47,241
I'll let her go find her happiness.

118
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:48,921
So you don't have

119
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:51,361
the resolve to make her happy for a lifetime.

120
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,081
Alright, I—

121
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:54,641
Stop arguing.

122
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:56,441
And you,

123
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:57,601
you can attend the class,

124
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,961
but don't disrupt the order.

125
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:00,601
Okay.

126
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:02,681
Instructor Su.

127
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,841
During class, don't talk about

128
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,281
things unrelated to the lesson.

129
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,160
The students are here to learn,

130
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:08,721
not to hear you two argue.

131
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:10,001
Yes.

132
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:11,601
Boss.

133
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,961
Finally found you.

134
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:16,001
Come back with me now.

135
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,041
There are many things at the company waiting for your decision.

136
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,521
You skipped work to come here.

137
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:22,481
Hurry and take him away for me.

138
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:24,441
Don't let him affect my class here.

139
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:28,201
You went to Su Wen's class?

140
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,561
What do you mean by that?

141
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:32,241
My class

142
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:33,561
actually has real content.

143
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:34,481
Join us for the next class.

144
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,561
Who wants to attend your class?

145
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,641
Let's go, let's go.

146
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,441
You come back with me too.

147
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:41,801
I really enjoy your class.

148
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,721
I want to make up the classes I missed before.

149
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:45,081
I'm not leaving.

150
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,121
I'm your boss.

151
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,001
Planner Yao.

152
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,881
See you next week.

153
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,121
See you tonight.

154
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:57,881
Let's go, let's go.

155
00:07:58,121 --> 00:07:59,761
Sister-in-law, I'm taking both of them now.

156
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:00,681
Taking them both, huh?

157
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,401
Go, go, go.

158
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:10,321
If I had to choose, I'd pick Su Wen.

159
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:12,681
Funny guys are always more likable.

160
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:15,121
If Jiang Anlan hadn't spotted his talent,

161
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,681
you wouldn't see Su Wen's humor.

162
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:17,001
Hey.

163
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:18,921
I agree with Xiao Hui on that.

164
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:20,601
You're the one who knows how to cozy up to the Guild Leader.

165
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:22,401
Hey, he's my Guild Leader.

166
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,441
If I don't cozy up to him, should I cozy up to you?

167
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:24,841
Boring.

168
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,920
Who's that girl?

169
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,921
Must be another of Master Wen's

170
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,321
fools he tricked from somewhere.

171
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,521
That's just pitiful.

172
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,800
That female writer last time

173
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,761
went on his show for free because she liked him.

174
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,880
After being tricked into bed,

175
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,081
he dumped her.

176
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:57,601
His mouth,

177
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,361
can really play people for fools.

178
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,881
Inviting people on the show is just a tactic.

179
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:02,401
Miss Yao.

180
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,521
Hey, miss, your clothes—

181
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,441
Why aren't you done changing yet?

182
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:11,761
Xinran, where are you going?

183
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm not filming anymore.

184
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:15,761
What's wrong?

185
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,881
You invite guests with ulterior motives.

186
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,281
Did our staff say something inappropriate again?

187
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,520
You should reflect on yourself.

188
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,400
There's no smoke without fire.

189
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,681
What did I do now?

190
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:32,241
Explain yourself.

191
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:42,961
I'm really curious—

192
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,201
how can you say "a lifetime" so calmly

193
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,921
without blushing or missing a beat?

194
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,521
I don't get it either.

195
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:50,361
A man who's dated so many women

196
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,441
that a whole sheet of paper isn't enough to list them,

197
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:53,681
how can he shamelessly

198
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:54,681
say things like that?

199
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,640
The wilder someone plays,

200
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,721
the more loyal they are when they're serious, you know?

201
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,160
A dog can't change its ways.

202
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,521
People like you who only talk about loyalty

203
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,760
are the most dangerous.

204
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,481
Only someone with my experience

205
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,761
knows what's truly suitable.

206
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,401
Have you heard of

207
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,281
Absolute Ought and Relative Ought?

208
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:16,641
Yao Yuan is absolute love to me.

209
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,001
No doubt about it.

210
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:19,441
You're so good with words,

211
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:21,601
why not join your brother's show?

212
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:22,401
Oh, wait—

213
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,321
you should be the host.

214
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:39,521
Planner Yao.

215
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:42,121
I have something to tell you.

216
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:43,281
We all heard

217
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,961
Wu Daba scolded you in public.

218
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:46,921
It's not that serious.

219
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,601
I did disrupt the lecture.

220
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,161
Even if I was wrong, he should've said it privately.

221
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,921
He shouldn't have scolded you in front of everyone.

222
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,041
If he bullies you again, let me know.

223
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:00,001
Alright.

224
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,041
Let's just do our own jobs and mind our duties.

225
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:03,561
Stay out of each other's way.

226
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,361
Hey, what do you mean "stay out"?

227
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,360
We all got invited to dinner.

228
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,961
It's fine if we don't go, right?

229
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:17,841
Just treat it as a work dinner.

230
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,481
If a meal can make things peaceful,

231
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:21,961
that's not a bad thing.

232
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,881
Let's show up for a bit

233
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:24,921
and then sneak out.

234
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:28,841
Let's go.

235
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,521
I heard Wu Daba bothered you today.

236
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:44,961
Yao Yuan,

237
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:47,321
let's get married soon.

238
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,561
There are so many monsters out there.

239
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:51,241
I really can't help but worry.

240
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:52,561
What do you think?

241
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:02,481
What's wrong?

242
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:04,761
Anlan.

243
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,081
Honestly, I don't like troubling others.

244
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,161
I have my own interests and dreams.

245
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:14,201
I want to achieve them through my own ability.

246
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:15,761
Not by relying on others.

247
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,561
Or depending on someone else's help.

248
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:21,361
Even if we get married,

249
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,200
my views still won't change.

250
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,041
I'm not someone else.

251
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,080
I know. I just want you to understand.

252
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:31,801
Me.

253
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:32,441
Don't worry.

254
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:34,241
I understand.

255
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,721
But having you by my side tonight

256
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,041
makes me feel truly at ease.

257
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,081
The first time I met you,

258
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,161
I already felt that sense of comfort.

259
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,321
You really don't remember saving me?

260
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,761
Not even a little?

261
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,760
Look, this is my high school photo. Ring a bell?

262
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,640
Take a good look.

263
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,081
That day I fainted, collapsed by the roadside.

264
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,641
You were the one who called the ambulance for me.

265
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:43,881
And to thank you,

266
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:45,041
I even treated you to a meal.

267
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:47,201
I don't remember.

268
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,360
Ah.

269
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,361
I remember now.

270
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,961
You, back then—

271
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,481
You were quiet, barely spoke.

272
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,681
And your health wasn't great.

273
00:13:58,721 --> 00:13:59,881
That kid was you?

274
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:00,641
Yeah.

275
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,761
When you said I saved you,

276
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,921
I thought you were joking. Turns out it was true.

277
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:07,961
I honestly didn't remember.

278
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:10,241
Would I joke with you about that?

279
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,761
We really are a perfect match.

280
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:17,881
Oh, right.

281
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,161
I heard from Li Ao you lost control before.

282
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:21,801
What was the reason?

283
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:23,481
Hmm.

284
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,401
I was venting for someone else.

285
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:29,881
Brother Chen.

286
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:30,681
Why did we

287
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:31,801
suddenly pull investment from the Yao family?

288
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:32,801
Anlan.

289
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,441
That company—

290
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:35,801
We've assessed it many times.

291
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:37,401
It just didn't meet the standards.

292
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,641
Pulling out was inevitable.

293
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:40,641
And—

294
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:41,361
And what?

295
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,281
All you see are numbers, right?

296
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:48,441
Investment is all about returns.

297
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,241
We're not a charity.

298
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,281
But their kindness—

299
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:53,761
Who evaluates their hard work?

300
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:54,921
We gave them

301
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,121
an unrealistic dream,

302
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,321
then crushed it, is that it?

303
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,401
Hey, the assessment is just numbers.

304
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:00,801
Frankly speaking,

305
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:02,761
this project of ours—

306
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,281
Why did you get involved?

307
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:05,681
What does it have to do with you?

308
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:07,401
You're still an intern, right?

309
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,121
Do you really know the situation?

310
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:10,041
To get things done, you need—

311
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:10,801
You're talking nonsense.

312
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,521
Get up!

313
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,041
Let me tell you—

314
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:17,201
Even so,

315
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,521
we can't go back on our word.

316
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:19,121
Break our promise.

317
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:20,041
Anlan.

318
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:21,401
What are you doing?

319
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:24,441
Dad let you intern here

320
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,041
so you'd listen and observe more,

321
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:27,881
not act on impulse like this.

322
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:29,721
Brother Chen is your supervisor.

323
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:31,521
He's been with us for years.

324
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:32,961
When it comes to investment,

325
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:35,121
is your judgment as sharp as his?

326
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:41,881
Go out and cool off first.

327
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:52,321
Thinking back now,

328
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,121
maybe I was wrong then too.

329
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:56,921
Anyway, it's all in the past.

330
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,401
From now on, whatever happens,

331
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:03,561
don't be so impulsive, okay?

332
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:05,841
Mm.

333
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:14,521
The most beautiful cloud on my horizon.

334
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:18,441
Yao Yuan is flawless from every angle.

335
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,121
Not worthy of that arrogant Jiang Anlan.

336
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:24,521
Talking about "forever" and all that.

337
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,881
Let me keep you with all my heart.

338
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,241
Stay.

339
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:39,801
Is love eternal?

340
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,801
If love were eternal,

341
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:46,321
no one would ever get divorced.

342
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:50,681
Is it the affair or yourself that ruins marriage?

343
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:52,041
You're writing about yourself, aren't you?

344
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:54,081
Such a pointless article.

345
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,641
Love is like the moon—

346
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:04,081
sometimes full, sometimes missing.

347
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,681
Quoting lyrics now, bro?

348
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:12,241
Can guys and girls really be just friends?

349
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:16,121
Physically, no.

350
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,681
Maybe mentally.

351
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,481
That kind of makes sense.

352
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:22,561
What am I even doing?

353
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,281
Why did I suddenly

354
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,481
start checking this person's social media?

355
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:33,881
Do you know if you care about him?

356
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,721
Caring about someone—

357
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:40,241
the simplest way to tell is

358
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:43,081
feeling unwilling to let go of them.

359
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,201
Feeling jealous.

360
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:51,041
Jealousy.

361
00:17:58,881 --> 00:17:59,401
What are you doing?

362
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:01,241
What do you mean?

363
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,721
Aren't you just imagining me?

364
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,561
Listen, when you care about someone,

365
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,401
you'll feel hostile toward the men around her.

366
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:11,761
That's true.

367
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,961
But not always, right?

368
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,761
It's a male instinct.

369
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:17,481
To carry on the family line.

370
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:18,361
Full of competitiveness.

371
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:21,321
Oh.

372
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,361
No wonder Jiang Anlan gets so worked up.

373
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,121
I'm telling you, teasing him

374
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:26,361
is so much fun.

375
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,720
What about you?

376
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:31,801
Me.

377
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,720
I get that you like stirring things up.

378
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:36,881
But aren't you afraid you'll care more and more about Yao Yuan?

379
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,721
You challenge Jiang Anlan, tease him,

380
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,321
but if it gets serious, can you beat him?

381
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:45,241
Can you be honest with yourself?

382
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,601
You're Jiang Anlan's friend.

383
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,441
Of course you'd help him.

384
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:53,281
Really?

385
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:54,321
Me.

386
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:00,161
Jealous.

387
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,000
Not back yet?

388
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,241
Oh, what do you know?

389
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:12,881
They're totally in love.

390
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,201
No way they'd come back this early.

391
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,081
Bet they're still reluctant to part.

392
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,041
Oh, wait, that's not right.

393
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,400
My lady, are you alright?

394
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:22,561
Wise one, I'm so scared.

395
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,201
My lady, don't worry, I'm here.

396
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:28,641
Are you done acting?

397
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,561
Snacks are on the table, help yourself.

398
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,321
I'm heading back to my room.

399
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,041
Today at the studio...

400
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:46,761
What's really going on with you?

401
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,441
All that stuff about being hurt—

402
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,281
I don't get any of it.

403
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,920
I sincerely wanted to invite you.

404
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,001
Hey, why are you checking my messages?

405
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:14,681
Why are you so nervous?

406
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,601
What did Wen Cheng mean by that?

407
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:21,361
You went to see him?

408
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:23,961
I went to talk things out with him today.

409
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,680
Then he insisted I join his show.

410
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:27,321
So I went.

411
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:28,361
I left right after recording.

412
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,201
Anyway, it's not what you think.

413
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,721
What do you mean, "not what I think"?

414
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:35,441
You know I like him.

415
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,161
So you should've kept your distance.

416
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:39,241
Why are you helping me?

417
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,241
Are you just trying to make fun of me?

418
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,081
I don't like him.

419
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,081
Isn't that true?

420
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,680
I mean, you talk to Wen Cheng—

421
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:49,881
You sound more and more like him.

422
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,801
Turns out you always find excuses to hang out.

423
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,521
Who's hanging out with him?

424
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:54,921
I only did it because you were upset.

425
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,041
I went to settle things with him.

426
00:20:58,161 --> 00:20:59,561
You said it yourself back then—

427
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:00,921
You wanted some passionate romance.

428
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:01,601
Insisted on tagging along.

429
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:03,121
Now you just look hurt.

430
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,721
You got rejected, is it really that bad?

431
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,361
Say something, will you?

432
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:29,601
Why are you so quiet?

433
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:40,241
Can you calm down?

434
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,361
Stop making things harder for me.

435
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,401
Su Wen.

436
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,281
You don't even know what love is.

437
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:21,601
Treating me like this—

438
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,721
You'll never have a good relationship.

439
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,521
One, two, three, four.

440
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:57,801
Hey, dummy, how's the game today?

441
00:22:58,241 --> 00:22:59,721
Who's a dummy? I won a card from you.

442
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,121
You haven't even seen mine.

443
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:02,401
All you care about is beating me.

444
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:03,721
I win a card from you every day.

445
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:04,601
I don't believe it.

446
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:05,801
Hey.

447
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,960
Everyone, come take a look!

448
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,081
Master photographer Su Wen's work!

449
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,000
Two yuan, two yuan!

450
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,081
All for two yuan!

451
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:12,601
Everything's two yuan now!

452
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,801
Master photographer Su Wen's work!

453
00:23:15,241 --> 00:23:16,201
Two yuan per photo!

454
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,361
Two yuan per photo!

455
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:18,761
Two yuan, two yuan!

456
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,241
Hello, big brother.

457
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:25,361
Little sis, want to buy a postcard?

458
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:29,001
Hey, little girl, what do you think?

459
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:29,801
Pretty nice, right?

460
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,681
Sis, don't listen to that lady.

461
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,241
Mine's even better, isn't it?

462
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:36,001
What lady? I'm your big sister!

463
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:37,401
Buy mine!

464
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:39,561
Ignore that old lady.

465
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,920
Check out mine.

466
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,681
Who's an old lady?

467
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:44,721
You're the one who said you don't mind age gaps.

468
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,801
See how mean he is? Buy from me.

469
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,321
Mm-hmm.

470
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:52,161
I just wanted to borrow a tissue.

471
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,721
Hey, where did you go?

472
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,841
Ta-da! Your favorite.

473
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,721
No money for food, but you buy this?

474
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:29,801
Dummy.

475
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:32,561
As long as you're happy.

476
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:34,161
When I have money—

477
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:35,081
I'll buy you a whole cabinet.

478
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:49,841
Such girly stuff—

479
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:52,281
I'm a grown man, it's not right for me.

480
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:58,801
Ah.

481
00:25:58,561 --> 00:25:59,001
What's wrong?

482
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,681
Why do you look so troubled today?

483
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:05,041
No, not really.

484
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:07,161
Just thinking about some things.

485
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,320
Come on, I'll take you somewhere nice.

486
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:25,201
Hey.

487
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:26,441
You know what?

488
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,601
The seesaw in this park—

489
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:29,641
It's the most romantic spot.

490
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:31,881
Why?

491
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,281
Because—

492
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,921
It takes two of us to play together.

493
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:35,881
Isn't that romantic?

494
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:54,841
Just say what's on your mind, don't hold it in.

495
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:56,401
That's not like you at all.

496
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:02,641
I'm just thinking—

497
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:04,961
If someday,

498
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,921
only one of us can reach our dream,

499
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
what happens to the other?

500
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,400
So—

501
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:15,481
If you make it, you marry me.

502
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,721
If I make it, I'll marry you.

503
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:20,601
If we both make it—

504
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,761
then there's no problem at all.

505
00:27:58,881 --> 00:27:59,681
Can you not leave?

506
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:06,961
Could you please stay?

507
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,201
Even if you work at Weijin Shijie,

508
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,560
you could still stay here.

509
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,281
I have to focus with no distractions.

510
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,281
That's the only way to meet their standards.

511
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:21,001
Do you get it?

512
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:25,521
Even living together—

513
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:26,881
we can still work hard on our own.

514
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:33,641
This is a rare opportunity.

515
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:35,041
I can't afford any mistakes.

516
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:38,321
I don't want to be thinking of you

517
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,080
while I'm taking photos.

518
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:48,401
Don't go.

519
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:49,921
Please?

520
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:04,041
Su Wen.

521
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,641
You're someone who values feelings over reason.

522
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:12,361
But I'm not.

523
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,281
I hope you understand what I mean.

524
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:24,001
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:34,681
Let's break up.

526
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:54,721
Promise me—

527
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,441
No matter what happens,

528
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:58,561
never give up on photography.

529
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:54,081
Why is it you?

530
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:54,921
Why are you here?

531
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,241
Tell me.

532
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:57,241
What are you really angry about?

533
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:00,241
Who said I was angry?

534
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,641
I just don't want to record the show.

535
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,561
If you don't tell me what's going on,

536
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:04,401
I'm not leaving today.

537
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:08,201
How can you act like this?

538
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,841
Don't you know what you've done?

539
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,041
All those "good deeds" you did

540
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:12,401
have already spread in the studio.

541
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:14,521
Good deeds? I've done plenty of those.

542
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:15,361
Which one are you talking about?

543
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:16,721
Your staff all said

544
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:18,001
you only invite women on the show

545
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,201
to play with their feelings.

546
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:21,641
You believe baseless rumors like that?

547
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:22,641
Mm.

548
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:27,521
Fine, let me tell you.

549
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:28,721
First,

550
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,241
I know we haven't known each other long,

551
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,041
but you don't know them at all.

552
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:33,841
You trust them instead of me.

553
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,441
Second, as a charming expert,

554
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:38,041
being misunderstood is my daily routine.

555
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:39,801
Last time you came to me about that girl,

556
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:40,881
wasn't that a misunderstanding too?

557
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:45,561
Third, when I pursue women,

558
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,281
I always use sincerity, never deception.

559
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:53,081
Why explain all this to me?

560
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,241
Why have you misunderstood me for so long?

561
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:10,521
Why is he here?

562
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,201
My TV broke, so I came to watch yours.

563
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:15,641
No, no, he came to drink with me.

564
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:17,121
Yeah, yeah, drinking, drinking.

565
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:17,921
Come on, have another drink.

566
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:23,121
Truth or dare, let's start.

567
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:29,681
Who do you hate the most?

568
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:30,361
You.

569
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:32,361
I don't like you either.

570
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:33,241
Next question.

571
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:42,961
When did you cry the hardest?

572
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,081
When I was born.

573
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:52,281
I'll go.

574
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:04,441
Okay.

575
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:08,241
Who's the worst at skills in Tianxia Bang?

576
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,561
Zhang He, I guess.

577
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:12,081
Always impulsive, childish.

578
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,841
Yao Yuan, your questions are too soft.

579
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:15,761
Give us a tougher one.

580
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:16,841
No, no.

581
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:17,481
I think

582
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,521
speaking honestly in front of everyone

583
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:20,761
is really awkward.

584
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:22,561
Then I'll ask a tough one.

585
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:24,921
Who was your last kiss?

586
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:38,921
I'll join you.

587
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:40,641
Hey.

588
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:43,841
You guys play, I'm going to rest.

589
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:45,361
Hey.

590
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,481
Come on, walk slowly, I'll take you home.

591
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,441
Careful, there's stairs here.

592
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:05,401
Your legs are so long,

593
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,481
how do you walk so crooked?

594
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:08,761
Walk properly.

595
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,120
Hey, hey, wait.

596
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:17,001
Come on, I'll walk you home.

597
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:08,841
I

598
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,201
am heading back first.

599
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:11,641
Good night.

600
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:29,441
Yao Xinran.

601
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:32,041
Let's break up.

602
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:33,961
I've fallen for someone else.

603
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:42,721
A man like this—

604
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,161
is he really right for me?

605
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,441
Ah, I'm so tired.

606
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:55,521
I'll sleep here tonight.

607
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,921
No, no, that's not okay.

608
00:35:57,801 --> 00:35:58,601
Why not?

609
00:35:58,761 --> 00:35:59,641
This isn't okay.

610
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:01,281
You... you should go home.

611
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:03,761
Without you, I don't want to go anywhere.

612
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:07,601
It really can't happen.

613
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:08,441
You need to leave now.

614
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:18,761
Enough, okay?

615
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,321
Just go, please.

616
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:20,401
Fine.

617
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:21,921
Now I can't sleep.

618
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:24,041
Get up.

619
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,041
Ouch.

620
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:26,681
Get up.

621
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:28,401
Hurry up and go.

622
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,401
My lady, you really want me out of the house?

623
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,241
Just go already.

624
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:42,641
Alright then.

625
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:02,161
Good night.

626
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,281
If something's wrong, just say it.

627
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:19,081
We'll all help you figure it out.

628
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:24,161
Let me ask you all—

629
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,001
If you hit a crisis at your peak,

630
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:27,761
what do you do?

631
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,161
I've never had a "peak" in life.

632
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:32,961
It's always been like this.

633
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:34,921
He has a peak,

634
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,001
so I guess I do too.

635
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,601
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

636
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:38,761
Be serious.

637
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:41,161
The producer found a female host to pair with me.

638
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,361
Isn't that a good thing?

639
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:46,201
Usually in this situation,

640
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:48,081
either they never trusted you,

641
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:49,641
or they're testing you.

642
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:51,161
What?

643
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,841
Has the ratings dropped lately?

644
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,681
Maybe they're looking to replace me.

645
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:58,721
Who could be better than you?

646
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,360
Change? Why not change?

647
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:13,721
Hey.

648
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:15,841
I support your producer.

649
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:18,201
With your mouth,

650
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,640
you'll never starve anywhere.

651
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:22,961
I called you here to vent,

652
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:24,321
not to rub salt in my wounds.

653
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:25,841
Don't be like that.

654
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:27,841
If you don't host,

655
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:28,841
you could be a writer.

656
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,841
Didn't a publisher

657
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:32,321
ask you to write a book on relationships?

658
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:35,121
But I don't understand love right now.

659
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:36,641
I can't write a single word.

660
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,641
So that's what's bothering you.

661
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,721
I get love.

662
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:43,201
Ask me, I'll answer.

663
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:45,361
You're the kind who breaks the rules from birth.

664
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:46,641
Don't make it worse.

665
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:48,401
Look at you—

666
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:49,681
showing off now that you have Yao Yuan.

667
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,681
I won't deny it.

668
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,640
Hey, what about Yao Xinran?

669
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:57,201
Weren't you two going strong?

670
00:38:57,681 --> 00:38:58,601
She's the one I can't figure out.

671
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,800
It's so frustrating.

672
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:01,801
Right now,

673
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:04,121
I've lost in both love and career.

674
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,201
Photography

675
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,201
It's definitely not just theory.

676
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:17,801
You need hands-on practice

677
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,081
to truly grasp its essence.

678
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:20,801
Starting from this class,

679
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,321
I and Assistant Planner Yao

680
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,681
will teach you photography together.

681
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,000
If you all do well,

682
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:26,761
my boss, Boss Jiang,

683
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:28,001
will organize an exhibition for you.

684
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:34,041
Master Su

685
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,081
Can we shoot anything we want?

686
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:38,121
An exhibition under my name—

687
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:39,241
What do you think?

688
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,481
The theme of this exhibition

689
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:46,561
will be "Lover."

690
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,481
I'll also take a series of photos

691
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,321
to join the exhibition.

692
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,601
I believe everyone has a lover in their heart.

693
00:39:53,401 --> 00:39:54,561
I want you to use your camera

694
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,641
to capture their every smile and frown.

695
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,081
I believe

696
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,841
these will be your most precious images.

697
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,160
Master Su

698
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,241
But not everyone

699
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,481
has a lover, right?

700
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:07,521
Why do you have so many questions, kid?

701
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:09,601
"Lover"

702
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,281
doesn't just mean romantic love.

703
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:12,961
It includes family and friendship.

704
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:14,361
Like you,

705
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:15,921
the little love for friends,

706
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,721
and the great love for all beings.

707
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:20,921
When I put it this way,

708
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,241
do you all understand?

709
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:24,201
We understand.

710
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,321
Why do you keep staring at me?

711
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:30,881
You're the one I love most.

712
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:33,601
Didn't I just say,

713
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:35,401
there are many kinds of love?

714
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:37,281
My love

715
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:38,401
is just one kind.

716
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:40,281
Just one person.

717
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:44,081
Planner Yao

718
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:45,761
Could you come over for a moment?

719
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:00,641
Classmates,

720
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,280
the subject I'll shoot this time

721
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:04,401
will be Planner Yao.

722
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:28,321
Classmates,

723
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,521
I won't just teach you photography skills.

724
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:34,241
I'll also show you how photographers and models

725
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:37,841
can spark creativity together.

726
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,081
Let's find time for a shoot together.

727
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:51,241
Take some photos of each other.

728
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:53,161
What are you now?

729
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,721
Who says auditors can't join in?

730
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,641
Who cares if you shoot or not?

731
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,001
Those truly tragic photos—

732
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,001
What I care about

733
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:01,201
is what Yao Yuan will shoot.

734
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:02,681
Is she going to shoot you?

735
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,601
Why are you speaking for her?

736
00:42:05,161 --> 00:42:06,321
Then ask her yourself.

737
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,801
Why don't you ask? You don't dare.

738
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:08,641
I'm not you.

739
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,681
You're already a step behind me.

740
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:13,561
Alright, alright, you two, stop arguing.

741
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:15,681
Neither of you are who I want to shoot.

742
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,040
Yao Yuan

743
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:22,601
You don't have someone else, do you?

744
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:23,921
Who is it?

745
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,401
Your understanding of "lover"

746
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:30,001
is really quite shallow.
