33
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,140
Here, Ancheng.

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,180
- Eat this.
- Thanks, Dad.

35
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,060
After you went to bed last night,

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,100
Anlan came back.

37
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,100
He wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,900
My birthday was almost over,
and he got back.

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,660
What does he mean?

40
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,900
What does he take me for?

41
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,060
Dad, please don't be mad.

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,780
Anlan just isn't into socializing.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,300
Are you saying

44
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,240
he didn't want to waste time

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,180
on meaningless gatherings,

46
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,820
so he'd rather miss my birthday party,

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,860
- right?
- Of course not.

48
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,140
Yesterday, Yao Yuan had a fever.

49
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,440
Anlan stayed to take care of her,
so he couldn't make it.

50
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,460
He actually called

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,500
before the party started.

52
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,140
There were too many people at that time.

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,100
I forgot to tell you.

54
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,060
A fever?

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Is that a big deal?

56
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,980
Just an excuse.

57
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,220
Let's eat.

58
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,220
Eat.

59
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,980
Go to finance to check the bill.

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,900
I'll check it soon.

61
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,060
Dad.

62
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,610
Ancheng.

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,540
Morning.

64
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,880
Ancheng, wait a moment.

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,940
You come in.

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,540
Dad.

67
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,420
Sorry.

68
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,300
Happy birthday.

69
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,980
I know the reason now.

70
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,220
Yao Yuan is more important than I am.

71
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't see it that way.

72
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,100
I just felt that Yao Yuan
needed me more.

73
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,700
So, you'd give up your future for her?

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,220
I don't think you two are a good match.

75
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,500
What does that have to do
with my future?

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,520
Let me put it this way.

77
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,020
Though yesterday was my birthday,

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,580
I invited you so you'd meet
the key elders

79
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,260
with great influence

80
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,140
in the business community.

81
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,740
If the party was just for socializing,

82
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,660
Yao Yuan and I
shouldn't have been invited at all.

83
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,980
Are you saying

84
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,220
my good intentions toward you

85
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,980
don't matter to you at all?

86
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,140
That's not what I meant.

87
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,220
I just think we should keep it simple

88
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,740
when celebrating birthdays.

89
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,620
Why drag my brother's
and my futures into it?

90
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,300
I invited both of you
to my birthday party

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,220
because I wanted
to introduce you and Ancheng.

92
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,380
I'm thinking about your future.

93
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,140
You haven't changed at all.

94
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,580
Never grateful.

95
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,140
Always arguing against everyone.

96
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,300
Is it that if I don't agree with you,

97
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,900
you see it as going against you?

98
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,990
I'm different from you.

99
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,860
I don't just chase after my career.

100
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,660
I have bigger goals in life.

101
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,140
Step back.

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,420
Step back.

103
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,220
Look at yourself now.

104
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,500
Look.

105
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,380
So careless.

106
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,180
Fine, tell me.

107
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,580
What are you after?

108
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,980
Okay.

109
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,340
I'll tell you what I want now.

110
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,140
I want normal, genuine feelings.

111
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,480
I'm not like you, who only think

112
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,900
about numbers, not warmth!

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,820
Get lost.

114
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,740
Why should I leave?

115
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,580
Get lost.

116
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,220
Get lost.

117
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,380
Anlan.

118
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,860
You fought again?

119
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,020
I can't communicate with him.

120
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,460
You two are just too alike.

121
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,820
It's nothing serious.

122
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,640
But neither of you will back down.

123
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,900
Dad wants us to succeed.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
He just has a different approach.

125
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,410
So, leaving the company
was the right choice.

126
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,960
At least we can avoid constant fights.

127
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,300
Here.

128
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,780
Have some tea.

129
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,020
Thanks.

130
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,540
Jiang.

131
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,680
What are you doing here?

132
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,460
Only Jiang can make you look.

133
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,100
You should look at me once in a while.

134
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,180
Why are you so boring?

135
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,780
Try a sip.

136
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,660
It's pretty good.

137
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
I know you have a cold.

138
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,020
I made this especially for you.

139
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,640
It helps clear heat and detoxify.

140
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,660
So,

141
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
that makes you a warm guy, too.

142
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,020
What do you mean by "too"?

143
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,380
I've always been a warm guy.

144
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,100
Besides, your cold

145
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,980
was kind of my fault, wasn't it?

146
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,300
I took you out for that shoot.

147
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,420
How about this?

148
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,360
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
Consider it my way of making up.

150
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,780
But don't try anything with Yuan.

151
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,140
There's surveillance everywhere.

152
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,580
Where's the surveillance?

153
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,940
Mr. Su.

154
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,420
So, this is how your game works.

155
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,540
First, you send flower tea.

156
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,100
Then you check in on her.

157
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,960
Finally, you ask her out to dinner.

158
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,740
Kid,

159
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,940
do I need to beat around the bush
when asking girls out?

160
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,420
Usually, it's the girls

161
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,620
who get close to me.

162
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,020
Got it?

163
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,940
Besides photography,

164
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,620
you're also best

165
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,820
at being shameless.

166
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,620
It's confidence.

167
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,300
It's the courage of a man.

168
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,820
Girls like that.

169
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,660
Right, Yao Yuan?

170
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,900
Fine, I won't say more to you guys.

171
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,860
I've noticed you're being flirtatious

172
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,060
toward Yao.

173
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm going to tell the master.

174
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,220
Don't make things worse.

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,740
I heard Anlan

176
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,220
is arguing with his dad now.

177
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,580
Arguing?

178
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,660
Why?

179
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,500
I bet it's because you two

180
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,540
missed the birthday party.

181
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,260
Everyone's saying

182
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,140
he loves beauty more than power,

183
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,100
and he doesn't even care
about his dad anymore.

184
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,380
It's all my fault.

185
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,820
Hey, Yao Yuan.

186
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,500
Don't worry; it's not your fault.

187
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
In families like mine,

188
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm always arguing with my dad,

189
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,020
let alone a big family like theirs.

190
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,100
The boss and his dad are both stubborn.

191
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,900
They won't let this get to them.

192
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,820
They'll forget it.

193
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,740
Hello?

194
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Hi, hello.

195
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,540
Is this Yao Yuan?

196
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,460
Yes, I am.

197
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,060
I'm Anlan's mom.

198
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,300
I'd like to meet you in person.

199
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,780
Okay.

200
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,340
I wanted to see you today

201
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,220
to give you a gift.

202
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,460
I can't accept it.

203
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,300
Why not?

204
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,660
It's just a silk scarf.

205
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,220
You're with Anlan now,

206
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,540
so you'll attend some events.

207
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Your outfit should be more polished.

208
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,180
A little accessory always helps.

209
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,220
I'm saying

210
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,420
that from now on,

211
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,980
you need to start getting used to it.

212
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,540
Alright.

213
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,380
Thanks, Mrs. Jiang.

214
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,580
I'll accept it then.

215
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,380
I was planning to talk with Anlan

216
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,820
and have him buy a birthday gift
for his dad.

217
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,820
Anlan is a good kid.

218
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,100
He doesn't have many flaws.

219
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,820
But he's not very thoughtful.

220
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,380
If I ask him to go shopping,
he'll surely say he's busy

221
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,780
and won't come with me.

222
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,100
Why not go

223
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,620
instead of Anlan

224
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,180
and choose a birthday gift for his dad?

225
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,380
Sure.

226
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,420
I actually had a gift ready
for Mr. Jiang,

227
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,140
but I never got the chance to give it.

228
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,900
If that's the case, that'd be perfect.

229
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,740
Alright, let's go now.

230
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,060
The bill.

231
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,460
I got this.

232
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,860
Hello, Boss.

233
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,180
The meeting at 2 pm has been canceled.

234
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,580
Also, Mr. Wang just called,

235
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
asking if dinner tomorrow
could be moved earlier.

236
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,460
Where's Yao Yuan?

237
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,140
Your mom just called

238
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,460
and asked her out.

239
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,220
Anlan,

240
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,660
your mom is meeting your girlfriend.

241
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,760
What's there to worry about?

242
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm not worried at all.

243
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,740
It's all written across your face.

244
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,260
If Yao and Mrs. Jiang

245
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,620
don't get along,

246
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,020
it's better

247
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,980
to find out early.

248
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,540
Or their relationship
after your marriage

249
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,140
will give you a lot of headaches.

250
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,140
What a surprise that you can say

251
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,320
something so wise at your age.

252
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,260
Of course.

253
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,660
I totally get how to get along

254
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,900
with your boyfriend's mom.

255
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,700
That's why I often chat with Mrs. Jiang.

256
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,340
This gift from Anlan

257
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,880
will surely please his dad.

258
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,140
Anlan is actually

259
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
a very kind person.

260
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,700
But the way he shows kindness

261
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,940
is different from most people.

262
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,980
This kid

263
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,640
has a very unique style.

264
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,980
I know

265
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,700
he is quite thoughtful.

266
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,860
But

267
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,500
you never hear nice words

268
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,260
from him.

269
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,340
Every time he came back from abroad,

270
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,180
he never brought us any gifts,

271
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,840
saying

272
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,980
we already had everything,

273
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,520
and there was no need to buy anything.

274
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,900
Actually,

275
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,820
it's not about the gifts at all.

276
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,900
What really mattered to us was

277
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,820
that when he was abroad,

278
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,460
he still thought about us.

279
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,900
I believe he did care deep down.

280
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,820
But with his personality,

281
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,660
he probably

282
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,340
feared buying the wrong thing,

283
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,420
and you wouldn't like it.

284
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,020
If you were with him,

285
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,660
he'd definitely buy everything

286
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,820
you like.

287
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,820
Looks like

288
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,820
you know Anlan well.

289
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,740
Honestly, I haven't known Anlan long,

290
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,860
but when I'm with him,

291
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,580
I just feel completely at ease.

292
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,540
I don't have to guess
what he's thinking.

293
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,060
He always manages

294
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,440
to handle everything so thoroughly.

295
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,820
Anlan's dad

296
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,780
has been strict with him
since he was a kid.

297
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,620
He always taught him to think carefully

298
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,780
and to hold himself to higher standards.

299
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,300
So,

300
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,420
Anlan worked harder
than anyone could imagine.

301
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,900
Only then could he become

302
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,020
the favorite and the most valued

303
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,380
of his father and even the elders

304
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,900
of the entire family.

305
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,780
Yao Yuan,

306
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,620
being with Anlan
must be stressful for you.

307
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,300
But I want to tell you:

308
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,300
If you want to marry him,

309
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,140
the pressure you'll face
will be even greater.

310
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,400
Have you thought about that?

311
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,660
If you keep it going with Anlan,

312
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,660
can you handle it?

313
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,780
(Lord of All)

314
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,620
The driver should be here for me.

315
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,580
I'll leave then.

316
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,020
Goodbye, Mrs. Jiang.

317
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,860
Goodbye.

318
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,740
Hey, Anlan.

319
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,780
Where did you go with my mom today?

320
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,140
We went for coffee

321
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,960
and picked out a gift for your dad.

322
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,700
Your mom even gave me a silk scarf.

323
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,740
I didn't expect

324
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,140
you'd hit it off so fast.

325
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,540
Jianing told me

326
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,700
you had a fight with your dad.

327
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,140
Should I go apologize?

328
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,020
Apologize for what?

329
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,980
It's not your fault.

330
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,740
If you weren't taking care of me,

331
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,940
you wouldn't have missed
your dad's birthday party,

332
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,540
and you wouldn't have argued.

333
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,700
I do have some conflicts with my dad,

334
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,300
but it's not because of you.

335
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,820
Since I was a kid,

336
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,780
I've always worked hard to complete

337
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,260
all the tasks he gave me.

338
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,820
Our conversations always revolved

339
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,660
around how to set goals

340
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,980
and how to reach them.

341
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,860
After growing up,

342
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,260
except for work,

343
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,740
I don't know how

344
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,060
to get closer to him.

345
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,020
But your dad still loves you;

346
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,100
otherwise, he wouldn't care

347
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,220
whether you were there.

348
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,580
I just wanted to simply send

349
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,300
a birthday wish,

350
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,200
not to play the role of a good son

351
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,420
in front of everyone.

352
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
But you are your dad's good son.

353
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,820
I honestly envy you

354
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,900
for having a dad
who nurtures you so well.

355
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,100
He plans everything for you,

356
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,420
sending you to do so many things.

357
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,680
He just wants the best for you.

358
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,500
If you didn't have such a great dad,

359
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,300
I wouldn't have such a good boyfriend.

360
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,660
I wish I could be as comfortable

361
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,260
with my family as with you.

362
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,620
If you spent more time and effort

363
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,080
on your mom and dad,

364
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,180
you'd feel just as at ease.

365
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,700
Alright then.

366
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,100
(Can I really go on with Anlan?)

367
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,100
(No.)

368
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,260
(I can't become a burden to Anlan.)

369
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,060
(Mrs. Jiang)

370
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,340
Hi, Mrs. Jiang. This is Yao Yuan.

371
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,820
This is Yao Yuan.

372
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,260
I want to ask you for a favor.

373
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,900
Xinran.

374
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,300
Please forgive me.

375
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,740
What is there to forgive?

376
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,460
She made the move.

377
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,020
I'm talking about Yuting.

378
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,980
She took the initiative.

379
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,700
But I've made it clear to her.

380
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,960
Really.

381
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,620
I mean, I firmly

382
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,990
and clearly rejected her.

383
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,580
I'll prevent this from happening again.

384
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,220
What's it to me?

385
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,980
All along, I haven't been honest enough.

386
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,380
I've been avoiding

387
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,260
the shadow left by my parents' divorce.

388
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,980
I tried to find faults in others

389
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,980
to cover up my own insecurity.

390
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,660
I've finally figured out my own issues.

391
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Only then did I realize

392
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,780
you're just afraid of getting hurt
by love again.

393
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,540
That's why you've been avoiding me.

394
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,720
I don't blame you for that.

395
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,840
I know you're just trying
to protect yourself.

396
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,500
But in truth,

397
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,900
you care about me deep down.

398
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,460
So,

399
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,380
are you willing to be with me?

400
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,820
If you really

401
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,900
have no feelings for me, then I...

402
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,540
What about Zhou?

403
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,740
Aren't you two...

404
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,020
You should ask Xiaoya.

405
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,480
She'd be happy to tell you.

406
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,660
Li Ao...

407
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,620
♪Because you've completely won me over♪

408
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,820
♪A little stubbornness, a few flaws♪

409
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,060
♪You can always heal me♪

410
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,440
♪You're the one sent by destiny♪

411
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,080
♪It's you I love♪

412
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,060
You must be Yao Yuan, right?

413
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,860
Did you call me here today

414
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,980
just to invite me for a coffee?

415
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,260
Mr. Jiang,

416
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
actually,

417
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,700
I wanted to apologize to you.

418
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,260
On your birthday,

419
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,820
Anlan wasn't there.

420
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
It's not her fault.

421
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,600
I was sick.

422
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,780
He wanted to take care of me,

423
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,620
so...

424
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,100
This is the birthday gift
I prepared for you.

425
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,740
I hope you like it.

426
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,180
Actually,

427
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,700
Anlan cares about you a lot.

428
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,260
Maybe

429
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,660
he just doesn't know how to express

430
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,460
what's on his mind.

431
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,340
Got it.

432
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,860
You came today

433
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,900
to plead with me on Anlan's behalf.

434
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,740
Anlan is my son.

435
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,660
I know him better than you do.

436
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,540
Honestly speaking,

437
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,340
I'm against you two being together.

438
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,460
I admire your courage,

439
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,700
but it doesn't change anything.

440
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,900
If you have nothing else to say,

441
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,460
I have to go back to my office.

442
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,540
Mr. Jiang,

443
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,220
I won't give up on Anlan.

444
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm surely the one

445
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,900
he can rely on and trust.

446
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,260
You really sound like Anlan.

447
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,900
Do you really think you're a good match?

448
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,700
No one is born having it all.

449
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,740
Anlan earned his success

450
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,220
through his own hard work.

451
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,800
I believe I can do the same.

452
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,980
If this were a job interview,

453
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,420
I might consider giving you a chance.

454
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,580
But since this is about Anlan,

455
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,380
your family background alone

456
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,940
disqualifies you.

457
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Thanks for the coffee.

458
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,700
I've paid for it.

459
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,220
I'm still waiting for the chairman.

460
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,940
Right.

461
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,740
I'll tell him once he gets in the car.

462
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,040
Looks like he's coming out.

463
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,260
Okay, that's it.

464
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,100
Mr. Jiang.

465
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,300
Your gift.

466
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,540
You didn't take it.

467
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
I know

468
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,380
you can't accept me yet,

469
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,460
but I believe

470
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,780
you will accept me one day.

471
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,300
I won't keep the gift.

472
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,340
I hope you'll reconsider

473
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,860
your relationship with Anlan.

474
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,380
Goodbye.

475
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
(That girl)

476
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,260
(looks so familiar.)

477
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,860
(But I just can't remember)

478
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,940
(who she is.)

479
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,940
Let's conduct a review

480
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,780
of the last M&A case.

481
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,720
We all agree that Ancheng's acquisition

482
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,860
of four companies in three months

483
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,220
does meet the set KPI targets
in terms of numbers.

484
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,820
I have a question.

485
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,940
According to the finance report,

486
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,980
last quarter's budget
was more than enough.

487
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,380
What I don't get is

488
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,700
why the group, with enough strength,

489
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,140
could've acquired over six companies

490
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,380
within three months,

491
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,940
but you stopped after only four.

492
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,740
You're right.

493
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,180
We could've exceeded our KPI targets.

494
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,100
I did consider two other companies

495
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,580
as potential M&A targets.

496
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,620
Why did you let

497
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,540
the opportunity slip away?

498
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,020
After a thorough evaluation,

499
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,340
I found
their current systems to be weak.

500
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
If we rushed

501
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,740
the acquisition,

502
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,140
the restructuring costs later on

503
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,500
would far exceed our budget.

504
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,620
That's why I paused the acquisition.

505
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,860
Ancheng's foresight

506
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,340
was indeed thorough.

507
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,500
His decision actually helped us

508
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,860
avoid financial risks in the merger.

509
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,940
But we've been aiming
to expand market share.

510
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,580
Their market share
and distribution channels

511
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,900
are exactly what we need.

512
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,300
Calling off the merger now
would be like giving up.

513
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,940
That'd be a shame.

514
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,500
We didn't give up.

515
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,420
I've reached an agreement with them.

516
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,700
We'll start by cooperating
through a strategic alliance.

517
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,460
For these two companies
in urgent need of capital,

518
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,680
our capital investment,

519
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,020
collaborations on new technology,

520
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,660
and new product development

521
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,220
will be exchanged

522
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,540
for their distribution channels,

523
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,580
giving us access
to a larger potential client base.

524
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,900
Exactly. The relevant contracts

525
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,800
are being handled
by the legal department.

526
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,540
The strategic alliance
will be launched soon.

527
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,740
Like father,

528
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,220
like son.

529
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,500
Let's wrap up today's meeting.

530
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,340
Thanks for your time.

531
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,500
You're celebrating too soon.

532
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,820
Some people might only offer
surface-level support.

533
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,700
You did well this time.

534
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,180
But next time, don't rush

535
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,580
to lay all your cards on the table.

536
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,820
First, assess the situation.

537
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,700
Then wait for the right moment.

538
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,420
I understand.

539
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,300
Hey, Mr. Jiang.

540
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,860
Why are you alone here?

541
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,740
Well.

542
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,180
You didn't bring a date?

543
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,360
Something must be on your mind.

544
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,380
Ancheng,

545
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,720
when you become
Jiulong's general manager,

546
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,220
don't forget about us.

547
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,200
Between you two brothers,

548
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,620
one takes over the family business;

549
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,980
the other starts his own venture.

550
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,960
It's a perfect balance.

551
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,380
No competition.

552
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm different.

553
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
I have an older brother

554
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,460
and a younger brother.

555
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,300
I'm caught between them.

556
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,820
I barely get a chance to show up.

557
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,340
Things like this

558
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,600
aren't something we can decide.

559
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,100
Just focus on doing your best.

560
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,420
Hey.

561
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,420
Yu.

562
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,380
- Overly friendly.
- What a coincidence.

563
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,220
Here we go again.

564
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,300
Xuan.

565
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,140
You're here too?

566
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,660
I knew you guys would be here.

567
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,780
Bro.

568
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,300
Look at you, so full of yourself.

569
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,220
Who's this girl beside you?

570
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,100
Introduce her.

571
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,060
Xiaoya.

572
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,260
An old classmate.

573
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,580
Hello, everyone.

574
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,220
Hi.

575
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,700
Xuan.

576
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,940
Come on.

577
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,980
Let's continue.

578
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,300
How's your stock trading going?

579
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,660
Don't even mention it.

580
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,300
Just thinking about it
gives me a headache.

581
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,780
What about Mr. Jiang?

582
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,260
Still into stock trading these days?

583
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,340
I heard you've been collecting watches.

584
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,900
I just bought a new one.

585
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,300
And it got lost.

586
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,620
Ow, my stomach hurts.

587
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,560
I'll step out for a bit.

588
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,920
I heard you switched
from cars to watches.

589
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,460
Stay here.

590
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,640
Which model caught your eye?

591
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,940
Ma'am.

592
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,140
Here's your bill for tonight.

593
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,580
That gentleman earlier didn't pay.

594
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,340
A meal for two costs so much?

595
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,340
I didn't bring enough money.

596
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,940
Zhou's family

597
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,420
went bankrupt ages ago.

598
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,620
Only you

599
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,780
are naively waiting here

600
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,780
and even

601
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,820
paying his bill.

602
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,400
Has he borrowed money from you?

603
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,060
Alright, enough.

604
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,460
Put this bill on my tab.

605
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,400
You can settle it later.

606
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,700
Okay.

607
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,540
Well.

608
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,570
Thanks.

609
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,980
No big deal.

610
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,450
Take a look. Here's an IOU.

611
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,360
I promise I'll pay you back.

612
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,460
But I don't know your name.

613
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,820
So, please fill it in.

614
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,100
So, you're also
into exhibition planning.

615
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,350
Yeah.

616
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,780
The company has a flexible schedule.

617
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,180
When I'm free, I usually like

618
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,100
to play games to pass the time.

619
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,540
My brother's also into gaming.

620
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
He even started

621
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,860
some kind of group.

622
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,700
Tianxia Gang.

623
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,020
Tianxia Gang?

624
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,620
Are you

625
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,500
Jiang Anlan's brother?

626
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
Do you know Anlan?

627
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,300
I'm a friend of Yao Yuan.

628
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,740
This world is way too small.

629
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,020
We often run into each other
in Shengshi.

630
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,660
I even helped Yao Yuan
marry Jiang Anlan.

631
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,100
She's the master's wife now.

632
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,600
When did they get married?

633
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,980
How come I didn't know about this?

634
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,820
No, that's not it.

635
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,380
It's just a virtual marriage.

636
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,940
It's in the game, not real.

637
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,940
Sorry, I need to take this call.

638
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,820
(Chen)

639
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,780
Ancheng,

640
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,100
your dad seems to want Anlan

641
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,260
to come back to the group.

642
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,620
Looks like you'll have to try harder.

643
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,180
(1967 Music Coffee Bar)

644
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,700
Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

645
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,260
Thanks for today.

646
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,420
Or I wouldn't know what to do.

647
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,660
Don't take it to heart.

648
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,380
But you gotta watch out

649
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,320
for someone like Zhou.

650
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,500
It's his problem,

651
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,340
not yours.

652
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,540
I'll leave now.

653
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,240
I'll call another day to pay you back.

654
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,580
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

655
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,900
Are you drunk?

656
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,900
- No.
- Let me pour you some tea.

657
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,620
Let me.

658
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,340
You had a fight with Anlan?

659
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,380
Ancheng told me about it.

660
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,420
Don't get upset over this.

661
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,220
Anlan needs to think it through.

662
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,900
He's made things so tense.

663
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,220
What if he has to go back
to Jiulong later?

664
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,940
He's still angry.

665
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,980
Don't even bring it up.

666
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,740
Am I angry?

667
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,460
I'm just waiting to see

668
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,860
how he treats that girl next.

669
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,260
That'll show whether he's still doing

670
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,400
whatever he wants.

671
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,340
Alright.

672
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,420
It's getting late.

673
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,700
You should get some rest early.

674
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,780
Look.

675
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,260
He hasn't married her,

676
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,420
and it's already like this.

677
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,930
What's going to happen in the future?

678
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,780
Mrs. Jiang,

679
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,580
I don't know what you're thinking,

680
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,660
but I don't welcome her into our family.

681
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,900
Mrs. Jiang,

682
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,740
don't worry.

683
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,980
I have a plan.

684
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,820
Wenqian,

685
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,020
don't come up with any bad ideas.

686
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,900
Mrs. Jiang, rest assured.

687
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,860
You bought so much.

688
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,300
What exactly did you get?

689
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,500
You'll see when you look.

690
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,340
Management Stories and Philosophy.

691
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,140
Business Secret.

692
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,600
When did you start getting interested
in these books?

693
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,780
After I got involved

694
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,420
with Anlan's family,

695
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,460
I realized something.

696
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,580
If I want to be with him,

697
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,980
I have to work harder.

698
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,580
Only then can you deserve Anlan?

699
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,060
Love isn't about that.

700
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,180
I used to think that too.

701
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,860
No need to compare in a relationship.

702
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,880
To be together, the most important thing

703
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,660
is love.

704
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,500
Right?

705
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,300
But when I'm in a relationship,

706
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,940
I think effort really matters.

707
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,340
Besides,

708
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,260
Anlan is so outstanding.

709
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,340
Yuan,

710
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,860
I know Anlan is amazing,

711
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,620
but you're more impressive.

712
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,660
You're not only beautiful

713
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,740
but also smart.

714
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,140
Their family is truly lucky

715
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,700
to have a daughter-in-law like you.

716
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,140
You can become even better,

717
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,060
but

718
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,340
don't underestimate yourself.

719
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,060
Xinran, I'm not underestimating myself.

720
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,660
I really feel like

721
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,220
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang

722
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,900
have pointed out something
I hadn't considered before.

723
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,720
I think what they said makes sense.

724
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,460
And when I see Anlan at the company,

725
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,980
he's truly outstanding.

726
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,820
I want to work harder, really.

727
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,220
You've grown up.

728
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
But if anyone ever treats you badly,

729
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,980
you must tell me.

730
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,180
Okay.

731
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,460
Yuan.

732
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,650
Hey.

733
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,580
Where are you?

734
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,620
I'm right here.

735
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,260
Yuan, you're going to university soon.

736
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,300
We have a gift for you.

737
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,420
A gift?

738
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,340
What is it?

739
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,680
You'll see once you check it out.

740
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,100
What gift is it?

741
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
You'll find out very soon.

742
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,740
It's so pretty.

743
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,580
Right?

744
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,800
This is a gift from us
for you getting into university.

745
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,220
We originally wanted to get you a car,

746
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,380
but you know how things are at home now.

747
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,300
So, here's a bicycle for you.

748
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,700
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

749
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,980
Perfect. Riding's healthy.

750
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I can lose some weight.

751
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,260
I like it. Thanks, Mom, Dad.

752
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,020
After you start university,

753
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,900
a lot of guys will want
to chase after you.

754
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,020
But don't rush

755
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,460
to earn the dating credit.

756
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,380
You're worrying way too early.

757
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,060
No, you don't get it.

758
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,940
These days, once young people

759
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,140
get into university, especially guys,

760
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,500
they're in a hurry to start dating.

761
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,620
Look.

762
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,860
My daughter is so outstanding.

763
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,340
Surely, many guys will be after her.

764
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,180
If you like someone,

765
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,220
you must bring them home to meet us.

766
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,940
- Enough.
- Only if I approve

767
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,020
can things move forward.

768
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,340
Okay, okay.

769
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,740
You gave her a bicycle

770
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,340
with a whole speech attached.

771
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,060
Dad, I get it.

772
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,260
I'll be busy with my studies.

773
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,020
I have to work and study.

774
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,300
I won't have time for dating.

775
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,140
Don't worry.

776
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,500
Ding, ding.

777
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,260
Look here.

778
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,940
You're such a jealous, strict dad.

779
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,540
If Yuan can't find someone,

780
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,420
it'll be your fault.

781
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,820
Our daughter has such great qualities.

782
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,980
She'll surely find someone.

783
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,420
She just needs to be picky.

784
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
I'm taking off now.

785
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,020
- Be careful.
- I'm starting now.

786
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,460
- Slow down.
- Watch out.

787
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Dad.

788
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,660
Mom.

789
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,060
Don't worry.

790
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,620
I'll take care of myself.

791
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,020
Is Mrs. Jiang's hand getting better?

792
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,540
Don't. We're not in-laws.

793
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,300
(Check, Shi Zhengyi, 200,000)

794
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,980
What's this?

795
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,300
This money can let you relax

796
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,740
for a while without worries.

797
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,940
Why are you giving me money?

798
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,460
It's to have you persuade
Yao Yuan to back off.

799
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,900
What?

800
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,660
I won't do that.

801
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,160
I'm the one who burned Mrs. Jiang.

802
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,460
Yuan has nothing to do with it.

803
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,500
Don't drag her into this.

804
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,180
Please

805
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,340
take this money back.

806
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,180
From the burn incident alone,

807
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,980
you can see the gap
between our two families.

808
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,860
Our family is wealthy.

809
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,420
Plus,

810
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,860
Anlan is both subjectively

811
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,260
and objectively outstanding.

812
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,980
Yuan's qualities aren't bad either.

813
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,860
Anlan is so outstanding.

814
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,580
The girl he likes must be good.

815
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,460
But there's still a gap between them.

816
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,180
Will their values be the same?

817
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,140
Values aren't something we can decide.

818
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,220
As long as they get along well,

819
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,460
that's what truly matters.

820
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,380
I'm really wasting my breath here.

821
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,620
Listen,

822
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,660
based on my concerns as Anlan's elder,

823
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,740
I won't let Yao Yuan marry him.

824
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,820
Then I have nothing more to say.

825
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,080
I'll pay for the coffee myself.

826
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,940
Stop right there.

827
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
Don't tell me you think
the money's too little.

828
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,080
How much exactly would it take

829
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,220
for you to stop Yao Yuan?

830
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,820
Do you think spending money

831
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,500
can buy our feelings?

832
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,980
I'm telling you.

833
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,620
It's impossible.

834
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,980
Yuan has been through so much.

835
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,060
She finally found a good match.

836
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,620
I should be the one giving my blessings.

837
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,040
How could I ever ruin that?

838
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,600
No amount of money could make me do it.

839
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,220
Besides,

840
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,220
their relationship
is between them alone.

841
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,780
I advise you not to get involved.

842
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,220
I'm only trying
to look out for Yao Yuan.

843
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,160
You just don't get it.

844
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,780
What's this?

845
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,540
All the money I have in my account.

846
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
Even the IOU is in there.

847
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,120
Thanks for lending me the money,

848
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,460
but I don't want things to come up short

849
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,300
in front of your family

850
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,770
or affect

851
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,060
Yuan's place in your heart.

852
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,570
Why do you say that?

853
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,060
I won't let Yao Yuan suffer
any unfair treatment.

854
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,180
Your aunt came to me with money,

855
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,620
asking me to convince Yuan to leave you.

856
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,740
I didn't know about this,

857
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,020
but if it made you uncomfortable,

858
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,500
I apologize on behalf of my aunt.

859
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,700
No, no.

860
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,860
I once made a mistake,

861
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,340
so your family would get this chance.

862
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,260
Anlan,

863
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,300
what worries me now is

864
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,940
that if you two stay together,

865
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,940
will you treat her well?

866
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,540
I know it's not your fault,

867
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,980
but I hope you tell your family

868
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,740
not to pressure Yuan.

869
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,420
Yuan is

870
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,260
a stubborn kid.

871
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,140
Once she makes up her mind,

872
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,460
she won't change it.

873
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,980
I'll handle this.

874
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,540
Don't worry.

875
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,060
When she marries me,

876
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,940
I won't let her get hurt,
not even a bit.

877
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,660
Wenqian.

878
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,580
Come on.

879
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
How could you do something like this?

880
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,900
What do you mean?

881
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,500
As Anlan's aunt, am I wrong

882
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,620
to worry about Anlan?

883
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,880
It's okay to worry about him,

884
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,500
but

885
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,180
you can't use money to keep them apart.

886
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,780
Isn't her uncle only after money?

887
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,100
Besides, he's Yao Yuan's relative.

888
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,940
He can appeal to her feelings.
