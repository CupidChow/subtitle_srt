=Episode 35=

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,660
I heard Mr. Jiang

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,880
has been hospitalized recently.

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,520
At first, we thought

36
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,000
this was your trick
to dodge responsibility.

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,280
But to our surprise,

38
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,880
you reached out to meet us
as soon as you got out.

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,960
That shows real sincerity.

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,400
Now, back to reality.

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,820
Mr. Jiang,

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,600
how will you help us
recover our unpaid wages?

43
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,080
I'll do my best

44
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,440
to arrange the funds

45
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,440
and seek compensation
from those responsible.

46
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,550
Please give me some time.

47
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,020
Alright,

48
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,320
since Mr. Jiang said that,

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,380
we will

50
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,760
give you half a month.

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,520
Please don't let us down.

52
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,720
Definitely.

53
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,640
Boss,

54
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,200
after refunding the deposit
and compensation,

55
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,520
Ruishi won't have much funding left.

56
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,280
Don't worry.

57
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,680
I'll figure something out.

58
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,560
Li Ao already told me
about Anlan's situation.

59
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,640
I want to help somehow.

60
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,900
But

61
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm no good with money matters myself.

62
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,200
And I don't understand legal cases.

63
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,780
So I want to ask you,

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,880
what can we do?

65
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,580
Just relax.

66
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,940
Having you by Jiang's side,

67
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,220
giving him moral support,

68
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,640
is the best help he can get.

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,640
But I don't want to just
support him emotionally.

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,380
I want to take real action

71
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,720
to actually help in some way.

72
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,860
Then just cook for him

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,660
and wash the dishes.

74
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,680
Or you can have his baby.

75
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,240
Since the problem lies with the patent,

76
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,280
let's start by focusing on the patent.

77
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,320
If we begin by doing our own R&D...

78
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,280
It might take too long.

79
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,080
So, why don't we just

80
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,520
go after the patent holder directly?

81
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,740
As for the patent holder,

82
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,400
we could first try
to appeal to their emotions.

83
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,800
Or,

84
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,840
if the patent holder
likes attractive people,

85
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,440
we could play the beauty card.

86
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,560
That sounds way too unreliable.

87
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,800
It's not like it's me.

88
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,220
(Patent)

89
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,180
Hey, got it.

90
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,240
Come take a look.

91
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,080
Come on over.

92
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,680
I looked into
the eco-friendly plastic patents.

93
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,320
It turns out scientists
and researchers worldwide

94
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,040
all have different formulas.

95
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,040
The difference lies in whether

96
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,200
their formulas meet

97
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,840
national environmental standards

98
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,280
and patent approval.

99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,540
So, we need to find a new patent holder

100
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,480
and apply for authorization.

101
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,600
Bingo!

102
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,320
But

103
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,640
what if their company
has already thought of this?

104
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,940
Let's try to contact them first.

105
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,880
Let's go.

106
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,000
Is there a new funding gap again?

107
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,080
Why didn't you tell me?

108
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,440
I can handle it myself.

109
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,000
Sometimes I wonder,

110
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,520
who did you get your temper from?

111
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,680
Remember this.

112
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,480
As long as you're willing
to help at the company,

113
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,400
Jiulong Group will always be
your strong support.

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,160
Dad,

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,080
Ruishi is a company I built myself.

116
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,890
All its successes and failures

117
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,720
are my own responsibility.

118
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,960
I can handle it, so don't worry.

119
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,200
You're a bit like me back in the day.

120
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,240
Alright,

121
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,560
then I won't interfere.

122
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,880
Do whatever you think is best.

123
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,000
Also,

124
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,040
make time for a trip home.

125
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,360
Your mom is worried about you.

126
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,720
On the one hand,

127
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,940
she's concerned about how

128
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,360
you're handling the company's affairs.

129
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,480
On the other hand,

130
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,380
she's worried about whether

131
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,560
you and Yao Yuan can still be together.

132
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,800
It's only been a few days, but

133
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,920
your mom's already
got several more gray hairs.

134
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,720
Is she still upset with Yao Yuan?

135
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,960
More than just upset.

136
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,840
She actually went to see Yao Yuan.

137
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,280
She told her herself

138
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,600
to break up with you.

139
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,440
You better be mentally prepared for it.

140
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,200
How could she do that
without telling me?

141
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,320
You know her temper all too well.

142
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,680
In that way, you're just like her.

143
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,880
Okay,

144
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,000
let's not talk about this.

145
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,400
I'll say it again.

146
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,280
If there's ever an issue
with the funding,

147
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm the first person

148
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,440
who should know.

149
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,040
Okay.

150
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,680
Darling,

151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,960
why didn't you tell me
my mom came to you?

152
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,520
I don't want to put you in a tough spot.

153
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,760
Besides, she was only
sharing some of her concerns.

154
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,660
I think she made some good points.

155
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
I understand her.

156
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,020
Even though it doesn't bother us,

157
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,200
there could still be gossip.

158
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,720
She's worried you might
dwell on this and

159
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,640
end up leaving me one day.

160
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,320
Anlan,

161
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,480
this time,

162
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,400
I promise I won't leave you again.

163
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,360
Really?

164
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,480
Really.

165
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,160
I have something
more important to tell you.

166
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,240
What is it?

167
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,160
I found a new patent holder.

168
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,180
We found Professor Liu from a university

169
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,240
who developed a bio-based plastic.

170
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,640
It's of the same quality,
but breaks down ten times faster.

171
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,080
We've talked with
a lot of patent holders too.

172
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,280
But because of this incident,

173
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,240
they're hesitating about our project.

174
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,900
Don't worry.

175
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,340
His wife is a painter.

176
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,940
I once invited her to our institute

177
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,300
for some exchange
and learning sessions.

178
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,840
I'm sure she'll help us.

179
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,040
Good.

180
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,680
Then I'll have Li Ao assist you.

181
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,880
If they can reach an agreement,

182
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,680
the case can be restarted.

183
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,160
You really are my best partner.

184
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,250
Vice President.

185
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,240
Come in.

186
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,320
Ruishi just sent word.

187
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,180
They've found another

188
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,440
eco-friendly plastic patent holder.

189
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,700
They're making contact now.

190
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,160
This one looks promising.

191
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,520
Looks like fate
is still on Anlan's side.

192
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,180
Go ahead.

193
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,020
Okay.

194
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,720
Are you busy?

195
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm downstairs at your company.

196
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,000
Ancheng.

197
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,680
This is for you.

198
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,600
Do you like it?

199
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,520
I've never received

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,000
flowers before.

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Really?

202
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,200
Then,

203
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,530
I'm glad to be the first
to give you flowers.

204
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,640
But getting flowers from a girl

205
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,240
feels kind of awkward.

206
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,560
Why would it?

207
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,100
Shouldn't you

208
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,240
feel honored?

209
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,540
Besides, giving roses

210
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,520
is not just meaningful,

211
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,840
it's practical too.

212
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,860
Besides looking nice,

213
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,180
you could use it
for a rose petal bath, or...

214
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,120
Xiaoya,

215
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,880
thank you for being so kind.

216
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,940
But...

217
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,880
I know,

218
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,600
you like Fang Jianing.

219
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,760
I see you as a good friend,

220
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,720
just not in a romantic way.

221
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't want to

222
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,400
give you the wrong idea.

223
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,040
You and Fang Jianing
aren't officially together yet,

225
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,240
so please don't reject me outright.

226
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,440
Since we're friends,

227
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,080
there's a chance
to get to know each other better.

228
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,640
Xiaoya.

229
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,640
I have something to do. I'll go first.

230
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,960
Darling,

231
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,480
married life is starting
to feel more real every day.

232
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,400
I was worried about
how to make your mom like me.

233
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,320
Aren't you worried at all?

234
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,880
No need to worry.

235
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,280
At worst, I'll just give up everything,

236
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,480
and leave with you.

237
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,500
As long as you're by my side,

238
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

239
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,200
Do you want to leave Ruishi behind?

240
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,780
I don't want to.

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,230
But with Li Ao here,

242
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,340
I feel at ease.

243
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,600
I don't care about anything else.

244
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,520
You know, if you gave up before,
you'd be a lost cause.

245
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,480
Darling,

246
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,800
if things don't get resolved in the end,

247
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,840
and all my hard work goes to waste,

248
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,720
would you still love me?

249
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,600
No.

250
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,500
Then what would you do?

251
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,440
Can I return you?

252
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,660
No way.

253
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,480
All sales are final, no returns.

254
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,020
Don't worry.

255
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,620
Everything will go smoothly.

256
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,600
No need to stress.

257
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,680
Boss,

258
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,220
Professor Liu has already

259
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,160
licensed the patent

260
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,720
to a owner of a well-known hotel.

261
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,280
I wonder what Ancheng is up to.

262
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,500
(Ancheng)

263
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,200
There's no news from him all day.

264
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,160
Come on, don't be down.

265
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,260
Today, you got heartbroken.

266
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,180
You're the boss today.

267
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,500
I'll drink with you.

268
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,020
Drink as much as you want.

269
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,220
Here, have a seat.

270
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,440
Who said I'm heartbroken?

271
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,900
I am just

272
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,840
in a bad mood.

273
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,500
Okay, in a bad mood.

274
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,040
What do you want to drink? Just say it.

275
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,240
Whisky.

276
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,900
Another glass.

277
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,820
You should drink less.

278
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,980
Why are you drinking so much?

279
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,540
It's fine, let me drink.

280
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,560
You'll feel worse like this,
your body can't take it.

281
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,120
Go easy on it.

282
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,960
Wen Cheng is right.

283
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,080
Ancheng just doesn't like me that much.

284
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,640
It's me being too thick-skinned.

285
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,360
I was the one clinging to him all along.

286
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,000
I even thought,

287
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,960
this time, maybe my turn
for happiness had come.

288
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,560
Tell me,

289
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,010
why?

290
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,100
What do you mean why?

291
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,940
You've drunk too much.

292
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,840
Don't drink anymore.

293
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,920
Those men kept saying,

294
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,780
I have great qualities,

295
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm really beautiful.

296
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,540
But,

297
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,360
they just don't like me.

298
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,960
Tell me,

299
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,320
why is that?

300
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,420
I don't know either.

301
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm not a man, after all.

302
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,600
Alright, alright,

303
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,920
stop crying.

304
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,800
This time,

305
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,960
it's different from before.

306
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,680
In the past, when I was heartbroken,

307
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,280
I got over it quickly.

308
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,880
But now,

309
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,400
it really hurts.

310
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,280
Xiaoya, listen to me,

311
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,220
there are plenty of good men out there.

312
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,840
Why hold on to just one person?

313
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,420
With so many men around,

314
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,200
why tie your heart to a single one?

315
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,940
Someone as great as you

316
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,400
will definitely find someone better.

317
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,640
But I just can't seem to find anyone.

318
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,020
- You guys
- Keep it down.

319
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,240
are all liars!

320
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,680
Why did I say I like him?

321
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,660
- Who even likes him?
- Fine, fine.

322
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,200
I don't care about you anymore.

323
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,920
If you don't like me, then forget it.

324
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,240
Hey, where are you?

325
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,520
Xiaoya's had too much.
I can't handle her alone.

326
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,800
Yeah, the bar from earlier.

327
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,760
Okay.

328
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,480
Where is she?

329
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,480
- Are you okay?
- Sorry.

330
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,410
Fang...

331
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,920
Fang Jianing.

332
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,920
What are you doing here?

333
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,120
Huh?

334
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,420
You shouldn't be here.

335
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,240
You need to go back and be with Ancheng.

336
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,720
What's wrong with Ancheng?

337
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,880
Ancheng said...

338
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,680
He told me

339
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,840
that we're just friends.

340
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,520
Because

341
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,960
he likes you.

342
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,240
I don't get it.

343
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,320
How can he be

344
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,920
as clueless in love as I am?

345
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,600
He knows you don't like him.

346
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,160
No matter

347
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,420
how much he gives to you,

348
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,320
you just don't feel the same.

349
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,240
But still,

350
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,360
he won't give up on you.

351
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,880
Who says I don't like him?

352
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,720
You like him?

353
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,480
Then why don't you tell him?

354
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,960
I don't even know myself.

355
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,260
Lately, with Ancheng,

356
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,760
things just feel a bit different.

357
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
But,

358
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,880
I can't really explain it.

359
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,800
You...

360
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,380
You should

361
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,720
be honest with him about how you feel.

362
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,000
If you like him, just say it.

363
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,080
If not, then just say no.

364
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,480
You keep making him wait.

365
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,520
How can that be fair?

366
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,020
You're blocking his chance, you know?

367
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,680
He can't move forward like this.

368
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,120
I just don't get it.

369
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,480
What's so great about you anyway?

370
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,040
Huh?

371
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,620
You are

372
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,580
so stubborn

373
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,720
and spoiled too.

374
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,800
You don't know how to do anything.

375
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,440
- Why does Ancheng like you?
- Xiaoya.

376
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,280
Why not me?

377
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,420
- Xiaoya.
- What do you have that I don't?

378
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,840
Tell me.

379
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,130
Can we just go home?

380
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,260
No, I'm not going home.

381
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,020
Come on, let's go home
and keep drinking, okay?

382
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,340
Wen Cheng and Li Ao are waiting for us.

383
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
Come on, be good.

384
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,500
I won't.

385
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,100
Let's go home and have a drink, come on.

386
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,500
I still want to drink more.

387
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,360
Let's go home and drink.

388
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,340
Drink as late as you like.

389
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,940
I'll stay with you, okay?

390
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm definitely drinking tonight.

391
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,420
No one's stopping me.

392
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,300
Alright, alright.

393
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,000
Drink as much as you want.

394
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,540
(Serve the Party and the People)

395
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,300
This is the guy who
attacked you in the parking lot?

396
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,900
Yes, it's definitely him.

397
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,740
Are you sure?

398
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm sure.

399
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,440
Sorry, I need to take this call.

400
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,960
Hello.

401
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,400
Jianing.

402
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, Wang Xing has been caught.

403
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,380
Okay.

404
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,320
Come over now.

405
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,000
Even if you want to get drunk,
don't drink this much.

406
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,320
You're only hurting yourself.

407
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,960
Here, get up and drink some water.

408
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,940
Why put yourself through this?

409
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,920
You know Ancheng likes Jianing.

410
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,980
I thought you were ready

411
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,920
for a long game.

412
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,320
I used to think the same way.

413
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,480
But as soon as I gave him the roses,

414
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,640
my illusions about him were shattered.

415
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,070
Xinran.

416
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,940
Huh?

417
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,880
Tell me,

418
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,040
am I really that foolish?

419
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,340
Yes.

420
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,300
You're so naive and innocent,

421
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,480
and honestly, pretty adorable.

422
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm not adorable.

423
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
If I were truly adorable,

424
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,080
why does no one ever want me?

425
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,520
Am I really that unworthy of love?

426
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,480
Of course you deserve to be loved.

427
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,380
It's just that

428
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,120
the right person hasn't come along yet.

429
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,400
Alright, no more tears.

430
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,500
Here, take a look.

431
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,840
Sign here if there's no problem.

432
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,920
I just don't get it.

433
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,680
How can he be
as clueless in love as I am?

434
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,280
Jianing.

435
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,940
It should be almost done.

436
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,880
Wait for me a bit.

437
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,220
(Police)

438
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,760
Well,

439
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,200
it's finally resolved.

440
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Are you hungry?

441
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,840
Want to eat something?

442
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,680
You really turned down a girl for me?

443
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,160
Why ask that all of a sudden?

444
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,840
I just ran into Li Xiaoya.

445
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,280
What did she say?

446
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,360
Nothing important. Let's go eat.

447
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,400
Knowing he likes someone else,

448
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
yet she still finds the courage
to chase after him.

449
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,040
That takes real guts for a girl.

450
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,980
Yeah.

451
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,480
Honestly, I really admire her.

452
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,680
At least she's honest with herself.

453
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,900
Since she thinks you're great,

454
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,200
and you like her too,

455
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,640
why not just give it a shot together?

456
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,240
Maybe there will be sparks.

457
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,900
Like I said,

458
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,160
I already like someone else.

459
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,320
I know.

460
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,900
But I've never met her

461
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,040
or even seen her photo.

462
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,760
So mysterious. Who could it be?

463
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,680
But,

464
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,970
there's someone else

465
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,160
maybe we could consider
introducing to Xiaoya.

466
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,080
Who?

467
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,680
Su Wen.

468
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,660
Isn't he nursing a broken heart?

469
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,960
Maybe they'd hit it off.

470
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,680
Just mind your own business.

471
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,520
Now you're a relationship expert
and a matchmaker too?

472
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,200
Speaking of Su Wen,

473
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,080
why has he been so quiet lately?

474
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,520
I heard he's been spending
a lot of time in Shengshi.

475
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,000
Shengshi?

476
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,440
How is it?

477
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,480
Pretty impressive, huh?

478
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,440
You just chased off
a few weak kidnappers.

479
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,520
What's there to brag about?

480
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,160
Hey.

481
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,640
Why haven't I met my For Thy Sake yet?

482
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,920
Dawn and Dusk?

483
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,540
Dawn and Dusk, right?

484
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,680
I'm Admiration.

485
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,560
Your name feels familiar to me.

486
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,960
So that means...

487
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,360
We're meant to be?

488
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,760
Is that so?

489
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,620
The bad press around Ruishi and Anlan

490
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,020
just won't die down.

491
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,000
And it keeps getting worse.

492
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,480
I think

493
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,840
there's no need to wait for Ancheng
to handle the plastic incident.

494
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,880
He should be appointed
General Manager now.

495
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,080
I agree.

496
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,140
Although Ruishi and Jiulong

497
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,720
are two independent,
unrelated companies,

498
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,280
this directly affects
the shareholders' perception.

499
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,840
At a time like this,

500
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,220
we can't consider Anlan

501
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,480
as a candidate.

502
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,120
I completely understand your concerns.

503
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,080
The new general manager
will be announced soon.

504
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm here not because Dad told me to be.

505
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,200
I want to congratulate you in person.

506
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,960
You've finally reached
your goal step by step.

507
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,920
I want to earn the board's approval
through merit,

508
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,840
not be appointed

509
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,120
under these circumstances.

510
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,360
Ancheng,

511
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,480
there are many ways
life presents opportunities.

512
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,000
It all depends on
how you handle it yourself.

513
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,720
I just feel that

514
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,600
the closer I get to that position,

515
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,240
the more uncertain

516
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,480
the future feels.

517
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,700
Actually, many things

518
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,160
are never 100% certain.

519
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,400
You'll figure out the path ahead

520
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,800
only after you're on it.

521
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,960
Jiang,

522
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,500
our top priority is for Jiulong

523
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,880
to address external concerns,

524
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,560
so shareholders and the public
know clearly

525
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,680
that Anlan isn't the best candidate
for General Manager.

526
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,580
It seems you all share the same

527
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,800
view and decision.

528
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,920
I hereby announce,

529
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,920
as of today,

530
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,600
Jiang Ancheng

531
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,260
will assume

532
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,000
the role of General Manager
at Jiulong Group.

533
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,340
Mom.

534
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,960
You should get out more often.

535
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,320
Yes.

536
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,640
It feels much better
to get some fresh air.

537
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,080
These past few days,

538
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,200
I've been quite worried.

539
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,680
Whenever I think about your company,

540
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,520
and then about...

541
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,240
Mom, don't worry.

542
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,420
Yao Yuan has found
a new patent holder for me.

543
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,540
Once we get the authorization,

544
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,400
Ruishi will definitely
get through this crisis.

545
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,760
Anlan,

546
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,120
can you stop defending Yao Yuan?

547
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,660
Listen to me,

548
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,960
and break up with Yao Yuan
as soon as you can.

549
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,520
I was wrong about her.

550
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,680
Actually,

551
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,880
you and Yao Yuan just
aren't right for each other.

552
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,220
Besides,

553
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,920
she's even less suited
to be part of the Jiang family.

554
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,380
Mom,

555
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,080
that is between the two of us.

556
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,320
No matter what, I won't give up on her.

557
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,340
I know you were upset
when she broke up with me

558
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,280
and made me sick.

559
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,760
But it wasn't her fault.

560
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,860
Her parents went through that,

561
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,560
and she still accepted me.
I'm already grateful for that.

562
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
Anyway,

563
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,480
I don't want to lose her again.

564
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,680
So, for her, you'd be willing
to lose your own mother?

565
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,560
Of course not, Mom.

566
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,520
Then tell me,

567
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,040
if both she and I fell into the water,
who would you save?

568
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,360
I'd save you, Mom.

569
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,880
Really?

570
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,960
Really.

571
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,280
I'll take Yao Yuan to learn swimming.

572
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,400
You're just trying to drive me crazy.

573
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,970
Let's go, Mom.

574
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,000
What kind of person

575
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,640
do you think is this hotel owner?

576
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,760
According to Li Ao's research,

577
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,640
Zhang Qing is fifty years old.

578
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,820
She started the Yueyi Hotel

579
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,560
when she was thirty.

580
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,640
It began as a small inn
with only 16 people

581
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,820
and then grew into

582
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,040
a big hotel with 20,000 employees.

583
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,700
Her business style is very strong.

584
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,580
Recently, she stepped back
from the spotlight,

585
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,880
handing management to her only son.

586
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,960
But she still holds
great influence in the industry.

587
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,640
People call her the Empress Dowager
of the hotel world.

588
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,140
(Jiulong Group)

589
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,520
The Empress Dowager?

590
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah.

591
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,920
What if she doesn't accept us?

592
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,800
Or she might demand
an outrageously high price.

593
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,600
What could we do?

594
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,000
Just stay calm and face it.

595
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,440
We meet again.

596
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,780
Aren't you the lady

597
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,000
who used to work at the hotel?

598
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,960
Yes, you saw right.

599
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,900
- During downtime,
- Don't overwork yourself.

600
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,020
I do enjoy digging around

601
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,240
and planting flowers in my hotel.

602
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,120
I like the feeling of hard work.

603
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,440
I also enjoy being with you young folks.

604
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,480
It helps me understand your work better.

605
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,680
Actually, Ms. Zhang is our CEO.

606
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,900
She only shows up

607
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,960
when the company faces

608
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,360
major issues.

609
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,200
Sorry to trouble you

610
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,840
with a special visit.

611
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,640
No trouble at all.

612
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,760
It's true, people like me
are pretty rare.

613
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,900
Let's not waste any more time.

614
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,820
Get to the meeting.

615
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,760
This way, please.

616
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,600
Alright.

617
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,360
Jiang Wenhua.

618
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,040
Long time no see.

619
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,160
You're still alive, huh?

620
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,840
Not just alive,

621
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,680
I'm doing better than ever.

622
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,440
After all these years,

623
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,880
could you change your way of greeting?

624
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,160
Please, have a seat.

625
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,400
Your father knows her?

626
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,080
Amid her busy schedule,

627
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,480
Ms. Zhang agreed to our invitation

628
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,160
for matters related

629
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,160
to the eco-friendly plastics.

630
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,560
Thank you for that.

631
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,680
I came especially to see you.

632
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,560
I want you to apologize
for what happened back then.

633
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,360
Apologize for what?

634
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,040
We invested together
in the eco-friendly hotel.

635
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,600
In less than two years,

636
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,340
you bailed out at the last minute

637
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,280
and pulled out the funding,

638
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,340
leaving me to struggle on my own.

639
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,960
Don't you think you owe me an apology?

640
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,560
At the start,

641
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,860
the eco-friendly hotel

642
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,440
did stir up quite a bit of buzz.

643
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,820
But it hadn't found its footing,

644
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,520
and you insisted on
pouring in more funding.

645
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,840
Isn't that right?

646
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,840
Looking at the reports,

647
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,960
there was no way
to break even within five years.

648
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,120
Did you think I'd stick around?

649
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,500
This time,

650
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,360
Jiulong acquired
the eco-friendly plastic patent.

651
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,120
I thought you'd changed

652
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,720
and started to evaluate
long-term project investments.

653
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,920
Isn't it still the same?

654
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,920
You haven't progressed at all.

655
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,160
Ms. Zhang's hotel

656
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,840
got through the tough times.

657
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,400
Media flocked to cover it,

658
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,960
and rooms were in high demand.

659
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,820
Exactly.

660
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,000
Though I worked there for a short time,

661
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,580
I could clearly see

662
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,720
how attentive and caring
the hotel was toward its staff.

663
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,920
That's because I found
investors with vision.

664
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,880
Environmental awareness

665
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,000
was always meant to rise.

666
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,640
But you were just

667
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,040
short-sighted for quick gains.

668
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,580
The luxury hotel

669
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,520
you invested in

670
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,440
ended up losing money anyway.

671
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,520
Dad, when did you ever
invest in a luxury hotel?

672
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,560
On paper,

673
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,200
I haven't lost a single cent.

674
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,020
I can honestly tell you,

675
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,960
between you and me,

676
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,480
there's no winning or losing.

677
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,680
At most, it's a draw.

678
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,960
How could it be a draw?

679
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,840
Got it.

680
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,800
So you came here today

681
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,400
just to argue about this,

682
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,520
not to help my son, right?

683
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,320
Your son?

684
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,320
It seems you don't really know

685
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,480
how much I've changed.

686
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,550
Alright,

687
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,240
let me formally introduce

688
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,020
the two greatest

689
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,600
achievements of my life.

690
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,600
The eldest son, Jiang Ancheng,

691
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,080
and the second son,

692
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,120
Jiang Anlan.

693
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,440
You're his son?

694
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,920
Then do you

695
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,960
agree with your father's
business philosophy?

696
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
This project

697
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,240
is one we all support.

698
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,560
But there have been
some issues along the way.

699
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,060
So we're hoping

700
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,040
your patent rights
can help us through this.

701
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,000
You're quite different.

702
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,160
You used to be so uncertain.

703
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,840
Now,

704
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,680
you're so determined.

705
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,600
And now you're defending your boyfriend.

706
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,040
Based on

707
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,360
your father's cherished

708
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,040
data management approach,

709
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,360
helping you with the project

710
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,760
yields zero gain for me.

711
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,280
Chairman Jiang

712
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,760
will definitely agree with what I say.

713
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,140
Ms. Zhang,

714
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,940
I've watched many of your interviews.

715
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,060
And I agree with you that

716
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,020
companies must put people first,

717
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,160
so they can pass on and grow stronger.

718
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,380
We decided to launch
an environmental protection project,

719
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,580
hoping to extend
our company's influence,

720
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,640
and promote certain values.

721
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,760
You all talk about business,

722
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,280
about ideals,

723
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,800
but this project directly
affects ordinary people.

724
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,120
What about you? What's your take?

725
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,960
My thoughts are simpler.

726
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,520
I just hope that

727
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,560
my partner and child

728
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,020
can live in a

729
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,280
healthy and safe environment.

730
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,800
That's great.

731
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,800
I believed in you all from the start.

732
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,840
Your future

733
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,600
will be full of love and support.

734
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,520
Anlan,

735
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,080
because you stood up
for the factory workers,

736
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,160
and took responsibility bravely,

737
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,520
I will grant you

738
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,560
the patent license.

739
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,260
However,

740
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,240
I have one condition.

741
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,840
You must let me
invest in this project too

742
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,600
to cover Ruishi's funding gap,

743
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,400
so it has the strength to keep going.

744
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,080
Thank you.

745
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,840
Ms. Zhang,

746
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,480
I sincerely appreciate it.

747
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,320
Thank you for putting the past aside,

748
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,680
and choosing to help Anlan.

749
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,280
No need to thank me.

750
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,800
I'm only helping

751
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,640
because Anlan truly stands out.

752
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,280
He has your iron-willed style,

753
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,560
and approaches things
from a human perspective.

754
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,760
He's unlike you,

755
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,920
who can be so unfeeling.

756
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,920
I like how you say that about me.

757
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,000
Thanks for the compliment.

758
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,280
Luck surely has favored you

759
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,400
by giving you such an outstanding son.

760
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,120
Not like me.

761
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,600
My son insisted on going to Africa
to practice medicine.

762
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,640
It's a good thing, of course,

763
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,680
but it's really hard
for us to see each other.

764
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,040
Just on that point alone,

765
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,280
you beat me.

766
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,360
Ms. Zhang,

767
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,240
you

768
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,560
and me

769
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,120
are both getting old.

770
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,120
From now on,

771
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,180
this world belongs to the young.

772
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,120
Between us,

773
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,480
there's no need to keep score.

774
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,320
What?

775
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,440
You're admitting defeat?

776
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm not.

777
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,520
Anyway,

778
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,880
we'll settle our accounts

779
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,640
some other time.

780
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,960
Some other time.

781
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,440
This tastes great. Have one.

782
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,680
Sorry.

783
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,920
Sorry, I'm late.

784
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,240
Hey,

785
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,600
let's have a drink.

786
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,020
Come on.

787
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,400
Cheers!

788
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,340
Things are resolved.

789
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,240
Here's to everyone's happiness.

790
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,400
Don't look so down in the future.

791
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,800
Who likes being down
in the dumps anyway?

792
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,160
Stop arguing with me.

793
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,100
Hey.

794
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,020
We're here to celebrate Jiang

795
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,500
getting through the business crisis,

796
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,240
and the smooth sailing of his love life,

797
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,680
not to listen to you two bickering.

798
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,640
He's blaming you.

799
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,080
Jiang,

800
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,400
when are you

801
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,480
holding the wedding?

802
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,480
Darling,

803
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,840
when do you want to hold it?

804
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,440
Wait until you finish the project.

805
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,080
Project is project.

806
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
Now that the patent rights
and funding are secured,

807
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,360
I'm not worried.

808
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,680
The urgent thing now is to marry you.

809
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,860
Ah, our master

810
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,840
is finally back.

811
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,960
Kid, you're absolutely right.

812
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,400
He's just as cheesy as always.

813
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,960
Right? He always
makes people feel awkward.

814
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,400
What's there to be embarrassed about?

815
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,300
Didn't you say yesterday
that you love me more and more?

816
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,840
Why say that in front of others?

817
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

818
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,800
It's rare to see Wen Cheng
blushing and shy like this.

819
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,160
Yeah, it really is.

820
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,860
I gotta capture this on my phone.

821
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,800
Yeah, yeah, take the shot.

822
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,590
Hey, Yao Yuan.

823
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,100
Since you two have made up,

824
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,240
when will you go back to Shengshi?

825
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,680
Everyone at Baihua Hall
is talking about it.

826
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,640
But I've already sold my account.

827
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,440
If I go back, I'll have to start over.

828
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,600
No one would dare buy
your account without my consent.

829
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,080
Then, who did I sell my account to?

830
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,240
So you've gone through so much lately.

831
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,840
Need any help from me?

832
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,720
There's actually have something
that needs your help.

833
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,000
Go ahead.

834
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,640
I heard you've been playing Shengshi.

835
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,880
You play it too?

836
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,200
So it was you who had someone
buy my account.

837
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,680
The Ace really is prophetic.

838
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,060
Master, I honestly admire you.

839
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,380
When will you teach me

840
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,640
so I can get out of the single life?

841
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,880
Hey, Jiang, look who's here.

842
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,620
Hey.

843
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,940
How come you showed up together?

844
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,880
Did you guys make a deal?

845
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,700
A cup of warm water, please.

846
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,640
Sure, one moment.

847
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,360
See if it suits your taste.

848
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
I've got things to do.

849
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,860
I'm heading out now.

850
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,800
Enjoy yourselves.

851
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,760
Excuse me for a bit.

852
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,720
Xiaoya.

853
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,120
Is there really something

854
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,720
or are you avoiding me?

855
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,880
I just envy my best friend,

856
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,400
and Fang Jianing too.

857
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,000
She has someone as great as you
who treats her well,

858
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,720
and always cares about her.

859
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,680
Actually,

860
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,640
you've rejected me
so many times already.

861
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,520
I should've given up long ago.

862
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,360
Yeah,

863
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,720
someone as perfect as you

864
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,440
could never like me.

865
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,400
But still,

866
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,280
thank you

867
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,560
for helping me see the reality.

868
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,280
I was going to say sorry to you,

869
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,800
but I realized in relationships,

870
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,280
there's no need for thanks

871
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,720
or apologies.

872
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,440
I really don't want to see you upset.

873
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,640
To me, you're

874
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,560
a friend who lets me be myself

875
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,560
and speak my mind.

876
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,160
If...

877
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,400
I mean, if,

878
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,440
you had met me first,

879
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,480
would you have liked me?

880
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,000
Maybe.

881
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,120
But who knows about things

882
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,680
that haven't happened?

883
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,640
I've always believed

884
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,760
everyone will find their destined love.

885
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,800
Wait,

886
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,800
don't tell me

887
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,560
I'll definitely meet

888
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,800
someone better,

889
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,160
because

890
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,640
I know I will.

891
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,990
