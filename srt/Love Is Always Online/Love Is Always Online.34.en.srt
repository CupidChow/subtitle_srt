33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,520
Before you become the successor,

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,840
there are many areas
where you need to improve.

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,640
But,

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,440
something like this

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,120
isn't where you need to improve.

38
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,800
Exactly.

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,200
Look at the children
of the Huangfu family.

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,320
They've been studying abroad,

41
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,240
and now they've earned another degree
in business management.

42
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,480
That's really impressive.

43
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,080
But how many people

44
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,000
actually understand this wine?

45
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,280
Studying business is the path to success

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,720
and financial prosperity.

47
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,940
But Ancheng wants to do
something he likes.

48
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,040
Making money isn't
the only thing that matters.

49
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,060
Grandpa,

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,100
Dad,

51
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,060
Aunt and Uncle,

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,000
you're right.

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,440
I get it.

54
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,420
Ancheng.

55
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,600
We just want the best for you.

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,960
We hope you don't waste your time

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,160
and focus on your studies.

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,520
I do believe in you.

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,800
Keep it up.

60
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,620
Alright, enough talk. Let's eat.

61
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,070
Come on, come on.

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,230
Here, have a drink.

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,440
Ancheng.

64
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,840
I've always wanted to ask you,

65
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,880
why did you stop chasing your dream?

66
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,160
Actually, many times,

67
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,320
I wanted to drop everything
and go to France.

68
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,520
But what if I failed?

69
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,220
Grandpa was right.

70
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,550
I should manage the family business.

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,020
The Jiang family's years of hard work

72
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,200
can't be ruined on our watch.

73
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,160
That's why I envy you.

74
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,800
You can chase your dreams
without holding back.

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,740
Staying home probably
takes even more courage.

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,230
So many eyes are watching.

77
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,720
If you do well, it's expected.
If not, you get criticized.

78
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,450
So I finally understood.

79
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,580
I can't choose where I was born,

80
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,820
but at least I have the right

81
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,940
to decide my own path.

82
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,880
Unlike me, worrying too much,

83
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,750
and ending up doing nothing well.

84
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,740
Why don't you trust yourself, Ancheng?

85
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,420
Actually,

86
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,780
when I learned about
Yao Yuan's background,

87
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,500
I wanted to tell you.

88
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,790
It was me who recommended
to pull funding

89
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,660
from Yao Yuan's parents.

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,700
I just never expected that

91
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,220
would've gotten them killed.

92
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,580
Actually, back at Jiulong,

93
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,580
after I clashed with Chen,

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,900
I indirectly figured out it was you.

95
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,380
Then why aren't you mad at me?

96
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,660
I was mad,

97
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,420
so mad I wanted to come find you.

98
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,060
But...

99
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Hey,

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Jiang Ancheng was pretty smug
in the meeting today.

101
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,140
You know,

102
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,140
if he weren't Chairman Jiang's kid,

103
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,180
would he sway investment that much?

104
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,700
Don't worry.

105
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,940
This world is brutally practical.

106
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,980
No strength means you're out.

107
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,500
With that project,

108
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,340
just the personnel costs
have already gone over budget.

109
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,260
Just wait and watch the show.

110
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,430
He's poison, we're the sugar.

111
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,580
Take him down...

112
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,820
So Jiulong has two rotten apples.

113
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,980
Keep talking.

114
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,900
Why are you suddenly quiet?

115
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,420
We were just joking around.

116
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,140
Talking behind backs
but chickening out face to face.

117
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,740
Just joking?

118
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,120
Should I get my brother

119
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,220
to come over

120
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,900
and joke with you?

121
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,740
Well,

122
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,780
that's not necessary.

123
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,700
Take back everything

124
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,980
you said earlier.

125
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
If I hear even a whisper again,

126
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,900
just try me.

127
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,240
Yes, yes.

128
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,500
Why didn't you tell me?

129
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
I just realized how much pressure
you were under.

130
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,900
I really felt sorry for you.

131
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,300
You didn't do anything wrong.

132
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,140
Based on the data,
that was the right decision.

133
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,260
But I never believed
numbers tell the whole story.

134
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,390
I trust more in the power of people.

135
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,210
Everyone makes mistakes.

136
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,160
But fixing them the right way

137
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,780
is what counts.

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,420
Now I finally get

139
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,260
why Dad always liked you.

140
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,980
This position really belongs to you.

141
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,980
Ancheng,

142
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,900
don't say that.

143
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,780
I'm not making excuses
or trying to please you.

144
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,100
First,

145
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,180
no one knows Jiulong's affairs

146
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,620
better than you,

147
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,060
be it big or small.

148
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,420
Second,

149
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,020
Dad always said Jiulong needs change,

150
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,020
but he didn't see you were
already making it happen.

151
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,020
You may focus on results,

152
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,780
but you truly understand
every single employee.

153
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,420
A good leader

154
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,660
should know how to bring out

155
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,900
the team's greatest strengths.

156
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,780
But Dad doesn't see it that way.

157
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,220
He just hasn't noticed yet.

158
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,500
Time will prove everything.

159
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,740
No one is better suited
for this position than you.

160
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,940
Anlan.

161
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,460
Thanks.

162
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,340
What are you thanking me for?

163
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,860
Vice President,

164
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,940
the meeting is about to start.

165
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,180
I still have a meeting to attend.
Gotta go.

166
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,020
Get some rest.

167
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,300
Okay.

168
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,140
Ancheng,

169
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,540
Wang Xing has made many calls,

170
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,340
demanding the lawsuit be dropped.

171
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,460
Just ignore him.

172
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,460
I think in situations like this,

173
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,940
it's best to let things blow over.

174
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,260
Look,

175
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,780
if you insist on taking legal action,

176
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,260
it'll only bring more trouble
for you and the company.

177
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,500
I say we just drop it.

178
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,660
If we let Wang Xing slide this time,

179
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,300
he'll just push his luck further.

180
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,780
This matter

181
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,340
is non-negotiable.

182
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
I'm here.

183
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,700
What food did you bring today?

184
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,940
You'll know once you try it.

185
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,940
Feeling better?

186
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,860
Much better.

187
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,900
Such a hassle.

188
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,300
So, how is it?

189
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,580
Does it taste bad?

190
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,820
I didn't expect Mrs. Jiang to be

191
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,100
such a great cook.

192
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,060
I've been practicing at home these days.

193
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,540
I've failed so many times.

194
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,140
I had Xinran and Wen Cheng
try my dishes.

195
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,580
They both ended up gaining weight.

196
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,740
You even added goji berries.

197
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,180
Pretty tasty, right?

198
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,700
Next time, don't bother cooking.

199
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,780
I'll take you to eat out.

200
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,900
That won't work.

201
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,020
You're not fully recovered.

202
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Food outside is too greasy.
You shouldn't eat it now.

203
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,180
Seeing you makes me feel better already.

204
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,460
The doctor said I can be discharged.

205
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,940
Then eat a little more.

206
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,300
Don't make me carry you home.

207
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,420
Mm.

208
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,980
I should've never come.

209
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,220
You win.

210
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,380
Giving up so soon?

211
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,580
How did your skills get so much worse?

212
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,860
Why take a simple game so seriously?

213
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,700
I've been busy lately
with the gym expansion.

214
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,140
When would I have time for this?

215
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,420
Since you're the gym's boss,

216
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,480
shouldn't you be training more?

217
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,860
Come on, I'm the boss,
not the coach, okay?

218
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,780
Oh, right,

219
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
your company is reviewing my project.

220
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,540
Isn't this taking a bit too long?

221
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,460
That's just the standard process.

222
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,220
But aren't those rules made by people?

223
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,020
Chen said,

224
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,420
since we're friends,

225
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,260
he'd help me

226
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,700
and make it pass soon.

227
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,300
What does that mean?

228
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,620
It's so hot.

229
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,140
Allen,

230
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,660
Jiulong has connections
with many partners.

231
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,060
Mixing personal and work matters

232
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,460
makes it hard to get things right.

233
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,180
I know.

234
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,620
I know you've always

235
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,780
handled things fairly.

236
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,700
But,

237
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,420
Chen just helped out a little,
it's no big deal.

238
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,740
Do you want me to ask him directly?

239
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,620
Alright, alright, I'll just tell you.

240
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,020
We just slightly enhanced

241
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,820
the expected performance of the project.

242
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,380
It's not like

243
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,820
it won't be met.

244
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,820
Maggie,

245
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,580
give me the approval form
and documents for Yuanfang Resort.

246
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,300
Vice President.

247
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,020
Yuanfang Resort is
a major investment case

248
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,940
for Fang Corporation.

249
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,180
Is this all we have?

250
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,060
Yes.

251
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,980
That's all.

252
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
This resort

253
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,660
has a big gap from
the expected return on investment.

254
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,260
Although you later caught up
on the payback period,

255
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,380
your initial assessment

256
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,380
was way off, why is that?

257
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,020
Because

258
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,140
at the time,

259
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,500
Chen specifically instructed me

260
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,060
that Mr. Fang and Chairman Jiang

261
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,580
have a very close relationship,

262
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,740
and you're also close with Miss Fang.

263
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,660
So he handed this case over to him.

264
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,740
After that, I did

265
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,820
the risk assessment based on the data
and financial reports

266
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,100
Chen provided me.

267
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,420
Got it.

268
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,340
You can go now.

269
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,860
You're so weak right now.

270
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,060
Get better soon,

271
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,660
or we'd have to take care of you.

272
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,740
It's really good to be home.

273
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,340
You know what?

274
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,460
I wasn't just missing you
while I was there.

275
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,260
I was missing my king-size bed too.

276
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,540
But now it's all good.

277
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,340
The bed's here, and so are you.

278
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm about to get better in no time.

279
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,780
I'll take you to

280
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
your king-size bed now.

281
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,700
Let's go.

282
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,220
Feeling dizzy.

283
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,660
Take it slow.

284
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,060
I'll get you water.

285
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,220
Dear.

286
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,460
Sometimes I wonder,

287
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,620
if I had confessed to you
back in college,

288
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,700
what would things be like?

289
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,140
College?

290
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,660
Ever since I first
saw you in high school.

291
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,420
I started to like you.

292
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,140
But at that time,

293
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,700
I didn't have the courage
to talk to you.

294
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,660
When I got to college,

295
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,900
I finally worked up

296
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,180
the nerve to confess to you,

297
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,140
but I overheard you telling Xinran

298
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
you didn't want a boyfriend.

299
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,780
That felt like
an indirect rejection to me.

300
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,500
Sorry, I don't want to date these years.

301
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,860
Besides studying,

302
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,900
I want to focus on other things.

303
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,380
I remember seeing a guy's back then,

304
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,500
and it turned out to be you.

305
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,060
Yeah.

306
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,660
Later,

307
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,740
when I heard our company

308
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,540
withdrew the investment
from your parents,

309
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,740
I got really angry at them.

310
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,660
Because I just couldn't accept

311
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,340
using data to decide a project.

312
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,020
So this is the thing Li Ao meant

313
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,220
that got out of your control.

314
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,080
Yeah.

315
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,930
With my abilities back then,

316
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,860
I couldn't change anything.

317
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,780
All I wanted was
to apologize at your place.

318
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,580
When I went to your grandma's place,

319
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,180
she told me you needed peace,

320
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,380
that you wanted to be alone

321
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,140
and I shouldn't come looking for you.

322
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,820
So I went abroad to study.

323
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,060
My grandma told me.

324
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,940
So how did you finally find me?

325
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,540
It wasn't until later

326
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,940
that I met you at the art gallery.

327
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,740
Seeing you there,

328
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,220
all those feelings came rushing back.

329
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,340
Besides owing you an apology,

330
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,860
I never wanted to lose you again.

331
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,260
So I tried every way
I could to find you.

332
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Eventually, I found out

333
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,220
you were in Shengshi.

334
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,060
I wondered why when you saw me,

335
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,460
you looked like

336
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,780
you'd known me for a long time.

337
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,420
That's why I picked up my pace,

338
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,780
trying to make up for lost time.

339
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,260
What about you?

340
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,100
Why did you let me kiss you

341
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,060
at the offline meetup?

342
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,580
Actually,

343
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,220
the first time I saw you,

344
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,820
I didn't know why,

345
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,980
but I felt

346
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,740
very familiar with you.

347
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,180
Even though I didn't know you,

348
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,220
it was like

349
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,380
whatever happened next

350
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,980
would just flow naturally.

351
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,340
It's really quite interesting.

352
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,260
So it turns out

353
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,260
that the two of us

354
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,220
were already in love

355
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,060
before knowing that.

356
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,900
After I met you,

357
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,100
I finally understood what fate is.

358
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,620
Since then,

359
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,300
you've always been

360
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,500
the most special person to me.

361
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,420
Hearing you say that,

362
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,460
I regret being your girlfriend
even more.

363
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,220
Why?

364
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,660
Because

365
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,940
I want to be Mrs. Jiang.

366
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,820
You're probably the only one

367
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,660
who can make me this nervous.

368
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,780
I used to think
I'd never find happiness again.

369
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
But after I met you,

370
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,260
I don't cry myself to sleep anymore.

371
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,620
Now I feel especially warm.

372
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,820
It's because I'm with you,
because I love you.

373
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,940
I've come to love myself
more deeply too.

374
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,580
Thank you

375
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,020
for coming into my life.

376
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,460
You've made my life whole.

377
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,020
Are you willing to wear it again?

Mrs. Jiang.

396
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,260
What are you doing here?

397
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,420
I'll be straightforward.

398
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,300
I want you to leave Anlan.

399
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,180
Whatever conditions you set, I'll agree.

400
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,700
I used to think,

401
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,100
though you didn't grow up like Anlan,

402
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,500
you were well-mannered,

403
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,660
and most importantly, kind-hearted.

404
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,940
I never expected

405
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,180
that I was wrong.

406
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,380
Because of you,

407
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,780
Anlan

408
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,860
even doesn't care about his own life.

409
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,100
Because of you,

410
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,300
Anlan lost all sense of control,

411
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,940
and even

412
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,140
forgot to take good care of himself.

413
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,380
Wenqian was right.

414
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,540
You two

415
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,140
just aren't right for each other.

416
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,380
Mrs. Jiang,

417
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,980
when I

418
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
told Anlan I wanted to break up,

419
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,500
it was wrong of me to hurt him.

420
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,820
But because of that,
we realized even more

421
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,140
that we really can't live
without each other.

422
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,380
As a mother,

423
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,420
I can't leave Anlan.

424
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,500
From the moment Anlan was born,
the doctors told us

425
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,380
if he ever has an episode,

426
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,260
he might never wake up again.

427
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,940
That's why we've been
so protective of him,

428
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,980
you know?

429
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,060
My only wish

430
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,900
is to see Anlan

431
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,740
be healthy,

432
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,900
and happy.

433
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,100
So

434
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,940
anyone who could hurt him

435
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,620
isn't allowed to be near him.

436
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,180
Mrs. Jiang, I understand
how you feel, but...

437
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,100
You don't really understand.

438
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,620
If you did,

439
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,460
would you let something
like this happen to Anlan?

440
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,940
Would you let him love you so painfully,

441
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,180
waiting for you desperately in the rain?

442
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,700
In short,

443
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,860
I've made my decision.

444
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,620
As long as I live in this world,

445
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,380
I'll never let you step foot
in our home.

446
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,340
I've said everything

447
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,940
I needed to say.

448
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,300
I hope that in this lifetime,

449
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,820
we never cross paths again.

450
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,020
May I help you both with anything?

451
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,220
Chocolate ice cream.

452
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,020
Yogurt taro ice cream.

453
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,980
Okay, please wait.

454
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,700
It's been like this since I was a kid.

455
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,660
As long as I get better,

456
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,340
you'll take me
for ice cream as a reward.

457
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,140
Actually,

458
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,740
I just want to eat it myself.

459
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,700
I thought so too.

460
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,620
By the way,

461
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,820
I have something
work-related to ask you.

462
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,740
For real?

463
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,140
My brother actually has
work questions for me?

464
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,380
Go ahead, I'll be your strategist.

465
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,980
What would you do

466
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,220
if someone cuts corners
or plays favorites on the project?

467
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,300
That's definitely not okay.

468
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,660
I'd confront them directly

469
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,180
and make sure it never happens again.

470
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,860
What if that person

471
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,660
is a close friend of ours?

472
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,980
Always bringing up personal connections

473
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,580
feels like emotional blackmail.

474
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,100
Let's go by your logic.

475
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,940
If we don't follow the rules,

476
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,900
how can we keep things fair?

477
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,220
It's like a white lie.

478
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,940
Even if it's with good intentions,

479
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,660
it's still lying at its core.

480
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,760
If this thing

481
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,420
really bothers you,

482
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,820
just be honest with him.

483
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,900
Maybe he's been waiting
for you to say that.

484
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,300
Enough about that.

485
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,420
You just recovered.
What do you want to eat?

486
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,220
I don't feel like eating anything.

487
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,100
Just a few more ice creams, maybe.

488
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,180
Who is it?

489
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,740
Mr. Fang.

490
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,540
Ancheng, come on in.

491
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,700
Come, have a seat.

492
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,100
It's been a long time
since I last saw you.

493
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,980
Ancheng.

494
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,900
Have you eaten yet?

495
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,180
I'll ask the housekeeper

496
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,500
to prepare some appetizers.

497
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,380
How about we have a drink together?

498
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,740
No need to trouble, Mr. Fang.

499
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,260
I'm here to ask you about

500
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,740
the Yuanfang Resort project.

501
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Why did you suddenly

502
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,220
bring up this project?

503
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,700
This project was

504
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,380
the first cooperation
between you and Jiulong.

505
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,380
I heard my dad mention it.

506
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,740
Back then, your company was facing
business transformation,

507
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,980
which took you a lot of effort.

508
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,380
I knew you'd eventually ask about this.

509
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,300
At that time, my company was doing

510
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,900
more than just transforming.

511
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,060
That was

512
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,660
a battle for survival.

513
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,780
I didn't tell your dad about this.

514
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,940
Our losses

515
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,100
were severe in the States.

516
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,420
The only hope

517
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,900
was this resort.

518
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,660
Since there were difficulties,

519
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,260
why not tell my dad?

520
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,620
I wanted to ask your father for help,

521
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,420
but

522
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,140
Chen said...

523
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,460
Mr. Fang,

524
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,180
the return rate for your resort

525
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,780
does take a while.

526
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,620
The project is still under review,

527
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,540
but from my experience,

528
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,820
the chances of success aren't high.

529
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,540
That's not true.

530
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,300
Wenhua and I have been
friends for years.

531
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,580
He will help.

532
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
But you know,

533
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,700
Chairman Jiang

534
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,420
values data-driven proof above all else.

535
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,780
Even if you're close friends,

536
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,600
if the project doesn't hold up,

537
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
he won't invest.

538
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,300
So, what do we do?

539
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,620
How about

540
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,740
I talk to him directly?

541
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,300
That won't work.

542
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,260
You only get one chance.

543
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,940
But what if he refuses?

544
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,540
You'll need to find other funding,

545
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,940
right?

546
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
How about...

547
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,780
Here's another idea.

548
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,300
We both agree
this project is profitable.

549
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,980
If we inflate the rate of return

550
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,020
a bit

551
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,500
on the financial statements,

552
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
it'll be more attractive.

553
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,820
I'll try my best

554
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,820
to help you get it done.

555
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
You mean,

556
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,980
faking the numbers?

557
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,980
Don't say it like that.

558
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,220
We're just

559
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,420
optimizing these figures

560
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
a little bit.

561
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,820
We're not faking anything.

562
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,500
Think about it.

563
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,180
If you succeed,

564
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,620
who would check on you?

565
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,140
Right?

566
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,740
So, how

567
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,860
are you planning to do it?

568
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,500
Well,

569
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,780
don't worry.

570
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,180
Leave it to me.

571
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,540
I don't have any other requests.

572
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,420
If your project

573
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,340
gets approved successfully,

574
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,300
then,

575
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,340
could I possibly

576
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,260
get a little cut?

577
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,540
Is that okay?

578
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,420
Alright then.

579
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,460
Afterwards,

580
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,540
I gave it my all.

581
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,020
The resort project succeeded,

582
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,420
and we got the bank loan
to overcome the crisis.

583
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,820
But this matter

584
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,340
has weighed on me for a long time.

585
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,700
Your dad

586
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
treated me like a friend,

587
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,380
yet I went against his principles.

588
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,500
Mr. Fang,

589
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,140
what about the other projects?

590
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,940
The other projects were definitely

591
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,220
done according to the rules.

592
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,300
But what confuses me is,

593
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,860
ever since that time,

594
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,140
Chen

595
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,860
asked for commission

596
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,140
on every project,

597
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,500
and even threatened me,

598
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,700
saying he'd tell your father.

599
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,900
I've always trusted Chen.

600
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,020
Never expected he was like this.

601
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,460
I never thought

602
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,020
you'd uncover this old issue.

603
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,940
Now that I've told you,
I feel a bit relieved.

604
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,740
Ancheng,

605
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,980
what are you planning to do?

606
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,060
I don't know yet.

607
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,860
I'll have to

608
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,580
rely on you to handle it carefully.

609
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,910
Ancheng,

610
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,180
please

611
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,460
don't tell your father

612
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,260
and don't tell Jianing either.

613
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,580
Jianing

614
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,580
has always been my greatest treasure.

615
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,980
Since she was little,

616
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,340
I've taught her to be honest,

617
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,380
and never to take shortcuts.

618
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,500
But I myself hid fake numbers

619
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,060
from my own friend.

620
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
If she found out,

621
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,260
how would she see me?

622
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,700
Don't worry, Mr. Fang.

623
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,220
I don't want Jianing to be upset either.

624
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,700
I won't tell her.

625
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,340
Good.

626
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,500
Thank you.

627
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,620
If Jianing's future partner

628
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,980
can be

629
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,540
as trustworthy as you, I'd feel at ease.

630
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,620
Actually,

631
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,020
you grew up together.

632
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,140
I know

633
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,860
you do have

634
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,180
feelings for Jianing.

635
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,420
Yes, I do like Jianing.

636
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,300
But feelings

637
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,220
can't be forced.

638
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,460
Jianing.

639
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,380
Ancheng.

640
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,580
What brings you here?

641
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,940
I came to ask your dad something.

642
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,660
Jianing.

643
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,940
I've talked things over with Ancheng.

644
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,420
Why not go out with Ancheng for a bit?

645
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,860
Anything you wanna eat

646
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,780
is on me.

647
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
That's great.

648
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,940
Let's go.

649
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Okay.

650
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,540
Mr. Fang, I'll be going now.

651
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,540
Have fun, Jianing.

652
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,460
Okay.

653
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,660
Take a break for a bit.

654
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,980
I made you some coffee
to help you stay alert.

655
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,300
And some snacks

656
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,540
to help fill you up.

657
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,780
Thanks.

658
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,220
Ancheng.

659
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,100
What did you say?

660
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,380
I said take a breath
and relax for a moment.

661
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,420
Sorry about that.

662
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,020
Eat now, I'll organize it for you.

663
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
Are you hungry?

664
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,020
Want to get some takeout?

665
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,380
No need, I'm not hungry.

666
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,420
You know, once you get into work,

667
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,180
nothing else seems
to catch your attention.

668
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,700
Both of us brothers are like that.

669
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,580
We've got that work-loving gene.

670
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,340
You're just workaholics
who enjoy the grind.

671
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
You made it sound so nice.

672
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,580
Go ahead and eat.

673
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,340
I think it'll take quite a while.

674
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,540
Ancheng.

675
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Go on with your work.

676
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,660
I'm heading out first.

677
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,580
You're just in time.

678
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,220
I have something to tell you.

679
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,100
You two can talk.

680
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,020
I'm stepping out first.

681
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,620
Have a seat.

682
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,260
Ancheng.

683
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,860
About the top-tier

684
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,740
beauty and wellness project I mentioned,

685
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,700
have you thought it over?

686
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,620
Can it get approved?

687
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,860
That project

688
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,780
has already been rejected.

689
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,460
Why?

690
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,420
What went wrong?

691
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,460
Nowadays, it's all
about female consumers.

692
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,900
And this project's financial report

693
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,860
is very impressive.

694
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,420
Membership numbers
are the key to success.

695
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,260
But when comparing investment costs

696
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,780
and the competitors' market share,

697
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,780
don't you think the member count

698
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,220
is a bit unrealistically high?

699
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,900
You didn't even notice that?

700
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,220
Either your skills are rusty,

701
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,700
or the other side is your friend,

702
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,860
and you helped out?

703
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,300
Ancheng, listen to me explain.

704
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,460
Maybe my team

705
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,100
didn't evaluate it strictly enough.

706
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,540
I thought inflating numbers

707
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,060
was your usual way

708
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,100
of cutting corners.

709
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,380
You...

710
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,460
You found out?

711
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,620
How much longer
do you plan to hide it?

712
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,340
Do you really think no one will know?

713
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,700
Ancheng, listen to me.

714
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,860
Most of my projects
are handled properly.

715
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,820
It's just that I can't

716
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,380
say no to those friends.

717
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,340
Like

718
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,540
the Fang family.

719
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,380
You understand, right?

720
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,300
I don't.

721
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,300
I don't know how Dad would react.

722
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,620
No, no, no.

723
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,500
Ancheng, please don't tell Chairman.

724
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,940
Just give me one chance.

725
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,540
I swear, I won't interfere anymore.

726
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,060
Look, I...

727
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,420
I've been with you for so long.

728
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,820
And I've taught you quite a bit.

729
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,780
Please, just help me this once.

730
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,700
Ancheng.

731
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,700
Forget it.

732
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,900
For old times' sake,

733
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,540
I'll give you a chance this time.

734
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,540
Please help me

735
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,540
and don't tell Chairman.
I don't want to end up in jail.

736
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,180
I won't tell Chairman for now.

737
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,020
You've worked with him for many years.

738
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,660
But,

739
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,540
you must return

740
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,260
all the commission you've taken.

741
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,460
Once you do what I said,

742
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,780
I'll decide based on your actions.

743
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,620
Okay, okay, I'll return everything.

744
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,380
I promise.

745
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,620
I'll handle this right away.

746
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,180
Ancheng,

747
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,900
you've been working so hard lately.

748
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,820
Take care of yourself.

749
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,900
Don't worry, I'm fine.

750
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,180
What do you want to eat?

751
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,540
Let's go eat Japanese cuisine.

752
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,670
Okay.

753
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,940
Jianing.

754
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,060
Don't come any closer.

755
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,220
Ancheng.

756
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,540
Wang Xing.

757
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,060
Put the knife down first.

758
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,580
We can talk this through calmly.

759
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,340
I only want you to drop the lawsuit.

760
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,420
You don't answer my calls

761
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,540
and ignore my emails too.

762
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,300
Do I really have to go this far

763
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,380
to get to see you?

764
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,140
Take it out on me.

765
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,460
But don't hurt Jianing.

766
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,420
You forced me into this.

767
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,540
Today, you have to answer me.

768
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,060
Will you withdraw or not?

769
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,980
Will you?

770
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,300
Jianing, call the police now.

771
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,140
Ancheng.

772
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,660
Ancheng.

773
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
Ancheng.

774
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,020
Ancheng, you can't die.

775
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,940
Ancheng.

776
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,100
Ancheng.

777
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,180
I'm calling an ambulance for you.

778
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,660
I'm calling an ambulance.

779
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,380
Jianing.

780
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,420
I'm okay.

781
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,540
No way.

782
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,220
This blocked it.

783
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,260
What about you?

784
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,540
Were you scared?

785
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,220
I honestly thought...

786
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,660
You scared me.

787
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,580
It's fine.

788
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,900
Good thing you didn't accept it.

789
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,500
Otherwise,

790
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,180
I wouldn't be this lucky.

791
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,380
Let's go to the police.

792
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,220
Jianing already told me about it.

793
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,980
Such a big deal happened,
why didn't you tell me?

794
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,860
I'm fine.

795
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,020
You just got out of the hospital.

796
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
I didn't want you to worry.

797
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,460
What do you mean? You're my brother.

798
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,060
We have to face this together.

799
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,980
Don't handle it on your own.

800
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,900
Anlan.

801
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,140
Keep your voice down.

802
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,380
I don't want Mom and Dad to know it.

803
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,380
How are you?

804
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,300
Are you okay?

805
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,580
I don't have any wounds.

806
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,900
It's just that I feel like

807
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,500
I brushed right past death.

808
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,180
I might never forget

809
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,660
this feeling for the rest of my life.

810
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,580
It's like you know

811
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,660
what will happen,

812
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,460
you just can't control it.

813
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,060
For the first time, I felt

814
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,140
life's ending

815
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,420
isn't something we can predict.

816
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,990
Well,

817
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,900
Ancheng,

818
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,980
I'll give you some pepper spray.

819
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,060
Next time you meet a bad guy,
spray his eyes.

820
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,060
I'm not a girl.

821
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,260
Why do I need pepper spray?

822
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,140
It's not just girls who need it.

823
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,380
How about you get a whistle instead?

824
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,740
Better learn some moves first.

825
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,060
Next time you face them,

826
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,700
you can react with your body

827
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,500
and strike their weak spots.

828
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,570
- Anlan.
- Hey, stop.

829
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,700
Just focus on running more.

830
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,820
You can run faster than they do.

831
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,700
Then you'll be safe.

832
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,620
Jiang Anlan.

833
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,180
If you ever get into trouble,

834
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,100
this is how you react?

835
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,420
You really should hire some bodyguards.

836
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,260
Why would I need bodyguards?

837
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,420
I've got Li Ao and Zhang He
as human shields.

838
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Could you help me find a few like that?

839
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,180
No problem.

840
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,300
Ancheng, you really need to be careful.

841
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,580
You're my only brother,

842
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,700
and I still have to hide it
from Mom and Dad for you.

843
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,740
Got it.

844
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,420
Anlan's mom even came to you?

845
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,980
Yeah.

846
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,220
You just respond with "yeah"
to something this serious?

847
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,100
Maybe we should talk to Anlan,

848
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,300
have him try to convince his mom.

849
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,660
You don't want to add to his burden?

850
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,140
His company's problems
still aren't solved.

851
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,940
If I tell him about this,

852
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,060
he'll be completely overwhelmed.

853
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,100
So, what should I do?

854
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,780
I've been wondering what I'd do myself.

855
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,780
Would I waver?

856
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,540
But I realized deep down,

857
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,900
I don't feel swayed at all.

858
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,340
Just thinking about

859
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
losing Anlan breaks my heart.

860
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,300
I really can't bear it.

861
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,300
And besides,

862
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,580
if I break up with him again,

863
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,460
how devastated would he be?

864
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,940
I don't want him
to suffer like that anymore.

865
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,740
Looks like you're ready to face

866
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,380
this whole storm head-on.

867
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,140
No matter how long it takes,

868
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,220
I will keep fighting

869
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,580
until his family accepts me.

870
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,380
It's all for Anlan's sake.

871
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,460
This time, we have to stand our ground.

872
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,380
We can't waver.

873
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Yao Yuan

874
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,620
just isn't right for him.

875
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,860
Like this weed,

876
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,460
trying to steal the thunder.

877
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,780
It just doesn't deserve the rose.

878
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,700
Mrs. Jiang.

879
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Jianing's here.

880
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,260
Wow.

881
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,700
The flower arrangement you made

882
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,860
is absolutely stunning.

883
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,900
It's practically masterpiece level.

884
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,860
This kid

885
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,100
is always so sweet-talking.

886
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,820
Mrs. Jiang, is Ancheng here?

887
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,100
He went to the equestrian club.

888
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,380
Why don't you go find him there?

889
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,100
Okay, I'm off then.

890
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,700
Jianing and Ancheng
have always been close.

891
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,260
It wouldn't be bad if those two
ended up together.

892
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,100
They're both childhood sweethearts
and well-matched.

893
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,980
Just let things happen naturally.

894
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,060
Right now,

895
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,260
I'm most worried about Anlan.

896
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,300
What if he's stubborn,

897
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,860
and insists on being with Yao Yuan?

898
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,220
Then what are we supposed to do?

899
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,660
I just can't believe it.

900
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,020
Could Anlan really choose Yao Yuan

901
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,540
over you, his own mom?

902
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Tell me,

903
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,900
if a guy never replies to your messages,

904
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,220
what does that mean?

905
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,500
There could be many reasons.

906
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,800
First,

907
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,260
he might not be that into you.

908
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,740
And what's next?

909
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,580
Second,

910
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,500
he could just be busy.

911
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,700
And he just isn't into you.

912
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,320
Third,

913
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,230
he doesn't know what to say to you.

914
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,780
Because he

915
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,700
isn't into you.

916
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,380
Aside from him

917
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,820
not liking me that much,

918
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,500
aren't there any other reasons?

919
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,260
There's one more possibility.

920
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
He likes someone else.

921
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,620
Looks like

922
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,620
I really don't stand a chance.

923
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,100
Can't you see she's really upset?

924
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,700
Holding onto hope is just cruel to her.

925
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,380
You often don't reply to my messages.

926
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,780
Maybe you don't like me
that much either?

927
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,100
I was live streaming.

928
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,740
I replied immediately after it ended.

929
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,660
How would I know?

930
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,940
Xiaoya, don't listen
to Wen Cheng's nonsense.

931
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,980
There are so many men out there.

932
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,140
Every man has his own way of thinking.

933
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,940
Maybe Ancheng is just busy right now.

934
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,940
It's not like he's ignoring
your messages on purpose.

935
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,460
Yeah.

936
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,380
You're right.

937
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,180
He must be swamped
with work at the moment.

938
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,180
It's totally normal for him
not to have time to reply.

939
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,980
I shouldn't be bothering him now.

940
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,740
I should...

941
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,740
I should...

942
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,620
I should be by his side, supporting him.

943
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,740
Even if

944
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,820
Jiang Ancheng doesn't
like me that much now,

945
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
that

946
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,980
doesn't mean I'll never have a chance.

947
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,020
They say

948
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,780
girls win guys over easily.

949
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,580
I just don't believe
that if I give it my all,

950
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,780
I can't win him over.

951
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,140
Xiaoya, you have my support.

952
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,980
Chase after your own happiness

953
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,140
and go for it.

954
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,820
I'll do my best.

955
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,900
Boss,

956
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,580
they are the factory's representatives.

957
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,340
I'm the person in charge.

958
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,500
Regarding this investment project,

959
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,780
I apologize for any trouble

960
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,340
it's caused.

961
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
I heard Mr. Jiang

962
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,900
has been hospitalized recently.

963
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,540
At first, we thought

964
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
this was your trick
to dodge responsibility.

965
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,300
But to our surprise,

966
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,900
you reached out to meet us
as soon as you got out.

967
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,980
That shows real sincerity.

968
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,420
Now, back to reality.

969
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,860
Mr. Jiang,

970
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,620
how will you help us
recover our unpaid wages?

971
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,100
I'll do my best

972
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,460
to arrange the funds

973
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,460
and seek compensation
from those responsible.

974
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,510
Please give me some time.
