34
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Yeah.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,040
Jianing and I ran into her
while having a meal.

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,720
Did she give you a hard time?

37
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,040
No, she even paid for the meal.

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,250
That's good to hear.

39
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,700
You shouldn't drink too much coffee.

40
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,800
Two cups max.

41
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm watching you all the while.

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,420
You're a big boss.

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,080
Why keep an eye on your staff?

44
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,520
Dear, you're wronging me.

45
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,160
I'm only watching you, not anyone else.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,970
I'm off now.

47
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,830
Bye.

48
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,760
Turn the data inside into files.

49
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,120
Get it to me in two hours.

50
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,000
Two hours?

51
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,000
That's too much to be done in two hours.

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,420
To work at Ruishi,

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,280
you need to be good at multitasking.

54
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,060
The boss values you,

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,640
but it doesn't mean you can slack off.

56
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,680
Everyone here works hard.

57
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,600
Don't you have an assistant?

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,880
No problem.
I'll give it to you in two hours.

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,480
Alright.

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,720
Yao.

61
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,400
I'll tell the master about this later.

62
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,440
I don't want others to think

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,140
I'm getting special treatment.

64
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,080
That's actually the unfair treatment.

65
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,640
I'll talk to Anlan...

66
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,200
Just focus on your work.

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,840
I'll handle it.

68
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,560
Did you hear?

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,220
Ms. Wang went after Yao Yuan.

70
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,340
- Really?
- Yeah.

71
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,580
She's so close to the boss.

72
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,920
Surely, she should be targeted.

73
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,520
What if she is indeed dating the boss?

74
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,940
That's impossible.

75
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,960
She's so skinny and plain.

76
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,380
Maybe the boss just

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,800
likes her vulnerable, helpless look.

78
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,800
Yao Yuan,

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,880
have you noticed that the boss

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,500
often stares at you?

81
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,220
Really?

82
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,380
I've never felt that.

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,340
It happens all the time.

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,060
Even the others have noticed.

85
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,640
Maybe you just haven't realized it.

86
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,300
Or is this your way

87
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,700
to move around to catch

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,840
the boss's eye?

89
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,160
We're really curious.

90
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,280
How did you and the boss meet?

91
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,460
He made coffee for you

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,040
and told you not to overwork yourself.

93
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,560
Why not teach us a few tricks?

94
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,800
I never asked the boss to look after me.

95
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,520
Nor did I expect any extra attention
from him.

96
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,100
If all your energy goes into that,

97
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,160
I'd say you might as well

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,860
focus more on your work.

99
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,380
Mrs. Jiang's side is coming out.

100
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,660
Your true colors are showing.

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,040
I didn't mean it like that.

102
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,360
What's all the noise about?

103
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,680
Even making coffee turns into a fuss?

104
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,240
Are you done yet?

105
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,520
I've sent it to your email.

106
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,720
Alright then.

107
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,400
Get ten picture frames
from the warehouse.

108
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,120
Deliver them to this address.

109
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,520
I hope you'll deliver them yourself.

110
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,480
Taxi fare will be reimbursed.

111
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,880
The easel is right up there.

112
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,320
Okay, thanks.

113
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,280
Are you okay?

114
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,960
Why would the company send a woman

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,660
for such heavy work? Let me help you.

116
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,640
It's fine; I got this.

117
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,600
Thank you.

118
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,980
Here, got it.

119
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,920
Thanks.

(Ruishi Investment Advisory)

121
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,880
Where are you...?

122
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm heading to the 24th floor, too.

123
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,700
Do you work at Ruishi?

124
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,640
Yes.

125
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,300
Ruishi is a great company.

126
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,840
My son works there, too.

127
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm here to bring him some snacks.

128
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,960
What's wrong with the light?

129
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,800
Could the elevator be broken?

130
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,940
Maybe not.

131
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,440
It's probably just a light that's out.

132
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,500
The elevator really broke down.

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,680
What should we do now?

134
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,520
Please don't panic.

135
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,020
Hello, the elevator is malfunctioning.

136
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,800
Is there anyone who can fix it?

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,740
There was a power outage.

138
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,660
We've contacted the maintenance center.

139
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,900
They'll handle it asap.

140
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,120
Please be patient and try to stay calm.

141
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,900
This elevator's like an empty box
hanging in midair.

142
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,640
If it breaks, it's really dangerous.

143
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,680
Don't panic.

144
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,960
They've gone to check it out.

145
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,380
It should be fixed soon.

146
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,540
Let's not scare ourselves.

147
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,480
- Stay calm.
- Okay.

148
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,920
What should we do now?

149
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,800
Ma'am, give me your hand.

150
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,160
Let's lean against the wall.

151
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,600
Bend your knees slightly.

152
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,560
Thank you.

153
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,040
Luckily, you're here.

154
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,160
There is no signal.

155
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,560
Do you want to call the hospital?

156
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,120
No, I want to call my boyfriend.

157
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,120
Hearing his voice
will help me stay calm.

158
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,690
You do love your boyfriend a lot.

159
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,200
Thank goodness.

160
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,200
It's okay now.

Amitabha.

162
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,280
Thank you.

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,780
No problem. I'll leave you to it then.

164
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,360
I'll get back to work.

165
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,920
How nice for Anlan to have
such a great employee.

166
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,200
Mom.

167
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,000
Why are you here?

168
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,580
I just heard someone got stuck
in the elevator.

169
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,620
Are you okay?

170
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,470
Look.

171
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm fine.

172
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,880
I brought the snacks you like.

173
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,920
I heard from your aunt

174
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,760
that she saw Jianing with her friend.

175
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,600
Is that girl your girlfriend?

176
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,800
Mom,

177
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,120
did you come just for that?

178
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,840
Of course.

179
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,880
Why didn't you tell me
about your girlfriend?

180
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,840
You didn't even bring her to meet me.

181
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,000
Which lady is she?

182
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,060
I was planning

183
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,400
to introduce her to you properly.

184
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,320
We're family,
no need for that formality.

185
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,200
Alright.

186
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,760
Yao Yuan.

187
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,560
Come to my office.

188
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,260
Mom, you can see for yourself.

189
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,250
Why keep it all so secretive?

190
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,400
It's you.

191
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,400
Ma'am.

192
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,520
You know each other?

193
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,220
We were stuck together

194
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,880
in the elevator just now.

195
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,800
You were stuck in the elevator?

196
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,460
Let me see if you're hurt.

197
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,180
- I'm fine.
- Let me check.

198
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,200
It's nothing.

199
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,200
What happened to your hand?

200
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,320
It's nothing.

201
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Mom.

202
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,020
This is Yao Yuan, my boyfriend.

203
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh, you're Anlan's mom.

204
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,800
Hello, I'm Yao Yuan.

205
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,640
Thanks to Miss Yao just now.

206
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,480
If I got stuck

207
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,960
in the elevator alone,

208
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,200
I didn't know...

209
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,380
Thank you.

210
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,400
No problem, it's okay.

211
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,120
Well, you two get back to work.

212
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,340
Anlan, come home for dinner tonight.

213
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,680
Your dad will be home.

214
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,760
Your grandparents miss you a lot.

215
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,200
Okay.

216
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,680
I'll head out first.

217
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,260
Bye, Mom.

218
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,200
Bye.

219
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,580
Not bad.

220
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,000
I was so scared.

221
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,920
Impressive.

222
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm dressed like this.

223
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,240
How did you get hurt?

224
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,120
I hurt myself moving some things.

225
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,800
Who told you to move stuff?

226
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,160
Other people can do that.

227
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,480
I wanted to help out myself.

228
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,060
You know how I am.

229
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,640
I don't want to rely on others.

230
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,420
It's just a scratch.
Don't worry about it.

231
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,480
Don't bother with it.

232
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,320
Promise me

233
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,880
to take care of yourself.

234
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,640
Don't get hurt, okay?

235
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,440
I know.

236
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm sorry.

237
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,640
I can't take you home

238
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,760
today.

239
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,280
It's okay.

240
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,020
Spending time with family is important.

241
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,320
I'll find a time soon

242
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,800
to formally introduce you to my family.

243
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,560
Sure.

244
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,760
Does it still hurt?

245
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,440
Yeah, it does.

246
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,740
Anlan.

247
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,680
Grandma.

248
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,700
Have a seat.

249
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,200
What brought you back this time?

250
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,320
Home is where you always belong.

251
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,900
You should come back more often.

252
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,440
Okay, Grandpa.

253
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,360
Dad.

254
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,440
Dad.

255
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,520
Mom.

256
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,840
Have a seat.

257
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,600
Sit down.

258
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,880
Come on.

259
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,360
Everyone, dig in.

260
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,220
Anlan.

261
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,020
There are lots of dishes you like today.

262
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,160
Eat more.

263
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,720
Thanks, Mom. You eat more, too.

264
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,660
Anlan,

265
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,080
what have you been busy with lately?

266
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,580
We only get to see you

267
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,640
at family gatherings.

268
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,360
Are you busy spending time
with your girlfriend?

269
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,360
Do you have a girlfriend now?

270
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,300
Why haven't you brought her back?

271
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,080
What reservations do you have
about introducing her?

272
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,080
I'll find some time

273
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,840
to bring her back
and formally introduce her to everyone.

274
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,300
The kid's grown up now

275
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,880
and has his own opinions.

276
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,860
But in matters like this,

277
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,600
he has to make the final call himself.

278
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,920
Then let's do it on my birthday.

279
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,240
Anlan,

280
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,520
bring your girlfriend over that day,

281
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,180
so your grandparents can meet her.

282
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,760
Alright.

283
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,160
Dad,

284
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,160
there's a project budget...

285
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,200
It's rare for us
to have dinner together.

286
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,880
No business talk at the table.

287
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,960
We just focus on Anlan's love life.

288
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,240
What about Ancheng?

289
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,080
Have you taken a liking to anyone?

290
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,040
Everyone knows Ancheng likes Jianing.

291
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,960
But Jianing likes Anlan.

292
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,080
Wenqian.

293
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,860
Dad.

294
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,740
Mom.

295
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,590
Time to eat.

296
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,480
Let's eat.

297
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,920
- Come on.
- Here.

298
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,140
Come on, Dad.

299
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,080
Okay.

300
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,960
You must be Wen Cheng, right?

301
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,400
Yeah. Do I know you?

302
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
That's not important.

303
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,480
Let me ask you: Do you like Yuting?

304
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,600
She's just my colleague.
I don't really like her.

305
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,920
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

306
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,880
You won't admit it?

307
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,680
She said you like her.

308
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,220
Nonsense.

309
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,640
I'm not interested in her at all.

310
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,300
Who are you? What's this about?

311
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,620
How could you say that?

312
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,700
Yuting likes you.

313
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,740
She treats you so well.

314
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,840
But you always keep her on edge.

315
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
You're a love expert,

316
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,700
but it doesn't mean you can toy
with her feelings.

317
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,120
Who gave you the right to say that?

318
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm her friend.

319
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,540
I don't want her to get hurt by anyone.

320
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,520
You can mess with anyone, just not her.

321
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,260
Another self-righteous knight.

322
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,460
You're taking it out on me
because you can't get her.

323
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,400
A typical loser
in a one-way relationship.

324
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,760
What did you just say?

325
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,100
Don't you dare touch me again.

326
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,400
Say that one again.

327
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,320
- What are you doing?
- Am I wrong?

328
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,840
Stop. What's going on here?

329
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,800
What are you doing?

330
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,720
Yuting,

331
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,140
I can't stand watching this anymore.

332
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,860
I'll help you teach
this player a lesson.

333
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,120
He won't act cocky after this.

334
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,980
I've turned you down.

335
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,320
What else do you expect me to do?

336
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,220
Yuting.

337
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,400
I just don't get it.

338
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,180
What does he have that's better than me?

339
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,760
Why are you so obsessed with him

340
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,380
that you don't reply to my messages?

341
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,900
Is it worth rejecting me

342
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,060
for someone like that?

343
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,240
What do you mean?

344
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,480
You play with people's feelings.

345
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,100
Yuting.

346
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,260
I'm worried you'll get hurt.

347
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,880
You're targeting the wrong person.

348
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,740
I'll forgive that punch
since it was impulsive.

349
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,660
But please,

350
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,780
make sure you know the facts
before accusing someone.

351
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,740
I don't care what your relationship is

352
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,700
or what is happening.

353
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,080
Just don't drag me into this.

354
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,740
Also,

355
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,180
please show some respect from now on.

356
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,240
You guys talk; I'll go in first.

357
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,820
Wen Cheng.

358
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,340
Wen Cheng, please listen to me.

359
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,120
- Yuting...
- Wen Cheng...

360
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,320
Wen Cheng.

361
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,920
Wait, Wen Cheng.

362
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,920
Wen Cheng.

363
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,440
I'm really sorry.

364
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,620
At first, I didn't know how to say no,

365
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,300
so I told him I liked him.

366
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,900
I didn't expect him to act like this...

367
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,080
No need. I've got this.

368
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,220
Let me help you, or I'll feel bad.

369
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,200
Really, it's fine.

370
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,200
But you got hurt because of me.

371
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,560
No, it's okay.

372
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,320
You got hit?

373
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,000
Why are you here?

374
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,040
I originally felt a bit bad.

375
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,280
But I didn't expect

376
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,080
someone else to feel worse.

377
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,280
Don't overthink it.

378
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,120
Who hit you?

379
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,220
It's nothing.

380
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,200
It's all my fault.

381
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,740
I didn't handle my feelings properly,

382
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,580
so Wen Cheng got hit for no reason.

383
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm really sorry.

384
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,140
Alright, it's fine.

385
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
What do you mean?

386
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,760
You got hit, and you say it's fine?

387
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,060
I know you're young and playful.

388
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,740
But please handle your personal matters.

389
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,780
Don't drag others into it.

390
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,600
And you

391
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,980
got hit over a girl.

392
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,960
Aren't you embarrassed?

393
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,600
What are you doing?

394
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,520
You're making me look like the bad guy.

395
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,760
Enough. She didn't handle it well,

396
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,420
but she wasn't the one who punched me.

397
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,340
She's upset, too.

398
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,260
True.

399
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,740
You were punched, and you're not mad.

400
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,000
Why should I be?

401
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,400
I was just meddling.

402
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,520
I'm leaving.

403
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Xinran.

404
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,160
Wait a moment.

405
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,440
Why are you following me?

406
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm here to apologize for Wen Cheng.

407
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,040
I hope you won't misunderstand him.

408
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,460
You're apologizing on his behalf?

409
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,220
If you care about him,

410
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,070
stay away from him,

411
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,200
so you won't get hurt again.

412
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,800
I can't do it.

413
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,200
It's my fault he got hurt.

414
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,040
But that won't stop me from liking him.

415
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,320
You're pretty confident.

416
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,480
I don't want to miss out
on someone so great.

417
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,780
Besides, Wen Cheng is single.

418
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,840
Everyone has a chance.

419
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,860
Of course.

420
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,180
If he loves you more,

421
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,160
I can't take him away.

422
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm not Wen Cheng.

423
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,680
Save that line for him.

424
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,480
I know, Xinran.

425
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,940
Right now, Wen Cheng

426
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,000
cares more about you.

427
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,680
But I'll keep trying.

428
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,680
He's still waiting for filming.

429
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,880
I'll head back.

430
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,700
You guys are here eating again?

431
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,240
Today,

432
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,180
I highly recommend this.

433
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,120
Dongpo pork.

434
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,720
This is my signature dish.

435
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,560
And today, I upgraded the recipe.

436
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,420
Please give me your honest feedback.

437
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,960
Your valuable opinions are welcome.

438
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,880
So tender.

439
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,840
- Delicious.
- Thanks.

440
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,600
Uncle.

441
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Yuan.

442
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,440
What brings you here?

443
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,800
Have you eaten yet?

444
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,660
Not yet.

445
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,600
Come on.

446
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,520
Enjoy, everyone.

447
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,740
Here you go.

448
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,740
Here.

449
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,680
Here you go.

450
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,540
Give it a try.

451
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,480
Thanks, Uncle.

452
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,120
What's wrong, Yuan?

453
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,240
It doesn't taste good?

454
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,860
It's been ages since I tasted this.

455
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
It's just like Mom's cooking.

456
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,520
Yuan,

457
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,120
this is

458
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,160
our special recipe for fried rice.

459
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,220
I've never cooked it for anyone else.

460
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,840
When Mom was around,

461
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,260
I never asked her to teach me.

462
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,040
And I didn't want to learn.

463
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,120
Now that she's gone,

464
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,880
I just can't get

465
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,720
that same taste.

466
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,240
It's okay.

467
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,820
If you ever want to learn,

468
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,860
I'll teach you next time.

469
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,460
Eat more.

470
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,800
I'll cook more if it's not enough.

471
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Hey, Uncle,

472
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,880
are you getting used

473
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,400
to being a chef here?

474
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,720
Is it tough?

475
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,800
Not really.

476
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,180
Even though I'm surrounded

477
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,420
by grease and smoke every day,

478
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,920
I feel

479
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,520
steady in life.

480
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,160
Right now, I just want

481
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,360
to work hard

482
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,680
and pay off that debt asap.

483
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,720
Go ahead and eat.

484
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,220
Oh, I gotta get back to work.

485
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,560
- Sure.
- Enjoy.

486
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,940
Help yourself if you want a drink.

487
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,100
- Put it on my tab.
- Got it.

488
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
Hello?

489
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,820
You didn't ask me to come

490
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,560
just to get drunk in front of me, right?

491
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,540
Who's this?

492
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,680
Your new friend?

493
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,600
No, he's a classmate from high school.

494
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,180
He went abroad to study later.

495
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,380
We just reconnected recently.

496
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,140
Hi, I'm Zhou Xiaodong.

497
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,320
Just call me Zhou.

498
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,480
Hi.

499
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,800
What do you want to drink?
I'll go get it.

500
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,400
- Beer, please.
- Okay.

501
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,640
What do you think?

502
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,320
Do we make a good match?

503
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,100
This time,

504
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,530
things will surely turn out great.

505
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,520
Li Xiaoya,

506
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,480
I'm not in a good mood right now.

507
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,980
I don't want

508
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,080
to analyze anything for you two.

509
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,220
We don't need any analysis.

510
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
No analysis needed.

511
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,560
He studied psychology in the US.

512
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,900
I brought him here this time

513
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,740
because I want him
to analyze your situation

514
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,380
- Analyze me?
- Yeah.

515
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,840
Analyze my love life?

516
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,360
No need.

517
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,000
Don't worry about that.

518
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,020
You should worry about that.

519
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,080
Okay?

520
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,740
Come on.

521
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,680
Thanks.

522
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,760
I heard

523
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,720
you met a guy who loves to preach.

524
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,840
What?

525
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,520
I just want to help you.

526
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,120
They say losing yourself
and feeling insecure

527
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,000
are chronic issues in relationships.

528
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,340
But you

529
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,280
probably have

530
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,680
both problems.

531
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,920
Yes.

532
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,240
I've seen too many relationships

533
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
scarred by cheating from exes.

534
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,860
That's exactly how you are now.

535
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,200
You don't feel secure in love,

536
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,260
so

537
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,720
you tend to magnify small things.

538
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,540
You get it.

539
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,960
Why can't he?

540
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,040
I've pulled back

541
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,120
to a safe distance.

542
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,220
That's

543
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,720
to protect myself.

544
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,120
He just doesn't understand me.

545
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,100
He doesn't get it.

546
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,800
We can just stop being together.

547
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,040
As your bestie,

548
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,120
I have to say this:

549
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,840
Don't let stubbornness make you

550
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,700
miss out on a guy who truly cares

551
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,880
about you.

552
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,400
Drink less.

553
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,320
Since you're my bestie,

554
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,560
just drink it.

555
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,960
Cheers.

556
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,320
Cheers.

557
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,560
Why did you come with me?

558
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm just worried.

559
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,340
You might get kicked out
for something you said.

560
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,400
Very likely. Xinran can be unreasonable.

561
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,560
Forget it then.

562
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,120
You can stop here.

563
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,540
Alright.

564
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,480
Don't overthink it.

565
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,340
Looks like I was worrying for nothing.

566
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,700
Thanks for comforting me.

567
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,640
No problem.

568
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,180
- I'll leave then.
- Okay.

569
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,120
Sure.

570
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

571
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,680
Zhou, hurry up.

572
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,840
Coming.

573
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,180
Here.

574
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,120
Thank you.

575
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,260
I think

576
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,080
Yao Yuan seems pretty good.

577
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,880
But for families like ours,

578
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,740
when looking for a marriage partner,

579
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,520
we always hope
the other's family background

580
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,440
is not too far apart from ours.

581
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,480
Mom.

582
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,960
Yao Yuan is gentle and caring,

583
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,960
kind-hearted and optimistic.

584
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,220
I believe she'll get along well

585
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,080
with everyone.

586
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,720
Is she really that great?

587
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,160
You have to trust my judgment.

588
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,800
I've met her a few times.

589
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,720
She seems like a good girl.

590
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,880
I just don't know

591
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,640
whether your father will approve.

592
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,700
On your dad's birthday,

593
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,840
you need to arrive early.

594
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,800
Don't skip any of the proper etiquette.

595
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,280
Also,

596
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,620
you have to make sure

597
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,700
she dresses like a refined young lady

598
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,000
and shows up looking beautiful.

599
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,220
Got it?

600
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,160
Sure.

601
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,940
(Successful proposal)

602
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,920
(Official proposal)
Introduce her to the family.

603
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,520
It's time

604
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,320
to move this forward.

605
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,580
(Yuting: What a great couple.)

606
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,280
Your thoughts don't matter.

607
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,040
Others don't want to see this.

608
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,500
(Yuting: What a great couple.)

609
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,440
That's the little girl

610
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,980
bravely chasing after love?

611
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,260
I really don't get today's young girls.

612
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,640
How can they be so shameless?

613
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,680
Times really have changed.

614
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,180
What are you worried about?

615
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,480
Wen Cheng doesn't even like her.

616
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,280
But with an opponent like her...

617
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,040
Are you afraid Wen Cheng might waver?

618
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,260
What does it matter to me if he does?

619
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,300
If you're scared he'll waver,

620
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,620
go ask him.

621
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,240
Sulking at home

622
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,400
won't change anything.

623
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,800
Look at her,

624
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,920
young and stunning.

625
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,280
She's also very sweet.

626
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,240
What man wouldn't be tempted?

627
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,860
Xinran,

628
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,060
you're under so much pressure.

629
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,760
Why not let Wen Cheng know?

630
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Honestly,

631
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,120
this might be a good chance

632
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,120
to let you realize
how much you care about him.

633
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,680
Alright, now,

634
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,880
are you going to back out?

635
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,320
Or will you make a move?

636
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,060
If I back out,

637
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,200
I won't be satisfied.

638
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,700
If I go all in,

639
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,400
I'm afraid I'll end up getting hurt.

640
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,760
What should I do?

641
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,060
- It's okay.
- Well.

642
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,800
She's too young.

643
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,160
Then you beat her.

644
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,240
I'll poke her again.

645
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,500
You always forget to eat
when editing photos.

646
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,780
I brought takeout and red wine.

647
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,780
How did you know I was editing photos?

648
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,120
If you didn't leave,
you must be working.

649
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,640
Why won't you let me in?

650
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,840
I'm not hungry.

651
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,220
I just remembered.

652
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,620
I think I left some personal clothes

653
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,840
at your place.

654
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
I guess you wouldn't want

655
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
your future girlfriend
to accidentally find them.

656
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,480

658
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100

659
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,440

I have a question for you.

715
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,960
Why do you trust her so much?

716
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,320
I don't know who recommended her.

717
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,880
But Boss,

718
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,920
you've always been fair and impartial.

719
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,360
So, I'll be straightforward.

720
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,020
She has

721
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,640
no relevant experience,

722
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,620
yet you put her in charge
of a special project.

723
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,440
You even have others support her.

724
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,000
Is she threatening you?

725
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,040
No.

726
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,480
I just can't stand her

728
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,840
while doing nothing.

729
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,580
I'm worried she might slack off,

730
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,920
so I'm just training her.

731
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,300
I heard you asked her

732
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,120
to help your team organize the files

733
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,820
and go alone to the warehouse

734
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,760
to move heavy stuff.

735
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,440
Is that so?

736
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,800
What's the big deal?

737
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,240
Every one of us

738
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,960
has been through tough times like that.

739
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,300
So, her hand got hurt

740
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,240
because of you?

741
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,140
You went to complain about me?

742
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,160
Huh?

743
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,680

744
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,920

746
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,160

about why you did all this.

750
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,840
Given how much you've contributed
to the company,

751
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,320
I'm not firing you outright.

752
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,320
When you think it through,

753
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,260
you can come back to work.

754
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,400
Boss.

755
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,680
Is it only because of her?

756
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,640
My company

757
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,000
does not tolerate workplace bullying.

758
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,460
Having skills

759
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,460
doesn't give you the right
to pick on newcomers.

760
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,160
Besides,

761
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,780
the person you're bullying

762
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,520
belongs to me.

763
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,460
Do I need to explain more?

764
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,620
This time, our collaboration with Yike

765
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,920
is a new kind of project.

766
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,240
It combines photographers
with advertising proposals.

767
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
If it goes well,

768
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,640
we can also pitch annual plans

769
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,520
to manufacturers.

770
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,580
So, this battle

771
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,600
is crucial.

772
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,520
Thank you for your hard work.

773
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,240
Today,

774
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,440
I have a personal announcement to make.

775
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,600
From now on,

776
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,020
please stop guessing or speculating

777
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,320
about my love life.

778
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,820
I want to be upfront and share

779
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,660
that Yao Yuan

780
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,860
is my girlfriend.

781
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,420
I didn't make this public before

782
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,380
because I didn't want anyone to feel

783
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,640
there was any unfair treatment.

784
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,100
Now that I'm sharing this,

785
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,380
it's to avoid any baseless rumors.

786
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,300
Such rumors only hurt Yao Yuan

787
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,300
and cause me unnecessary trouble.

788
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,980
That said,

789
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,420
work is work.

790
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,100
You

791
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,380
don't need

792
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,060
to treat Yao Yuan differently.

793
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,020
A real rags-to-riches story.

794
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,700
Yeah, Ms. Wang

795
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,380
stepped into some serious trouble.

796
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,820
Yeah.

797
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,500
Do you want to go, too?

798
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,620
I need someone for lighting.

799
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,260
Remember the self-defense technique

800
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,280
I taught you last night?

801
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,540
You can't let your guard down

802
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,660
against this man.

803
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,940
Are you jealous again?

804
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,700
Didn't you say
in the meeting to keep work

805
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,760
and personal life separate?

806
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,020
I'll make sure of it.

807
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,500
But now, we're not at the company.

808
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,340
Hey, I'm also here.

809
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,900
Hurry up.

810
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,380
Don't smile.

811
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,660
Alright, everyone.

812
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,060
That's a wrap for today's shooting.

813
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,140
Thanks for participating.

814
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,460
We'll treat you to something delicious.

815
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,820
Mr. Su.

816
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,380
We'd love to take a photo with you.

817
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,460
Sure.

818
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,540
Of course.

819
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,040
Let's take a picture with you.

820
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,160
Let's snap a photo.

821
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,780
Look this way.

822
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,220
Thank you so much.

823
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,580
This time, thanks to you,

824
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,380
I finished the Bestie Project.

825
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,620
You're so dedicated.

826
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,700
Is it because of Jiang?

827
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,140
Look at those students.

828
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,740
They deserve to be just like them.

829
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,540
In life,

830
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,020
everyone should have a bestie,

831
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,500
a confidant.

832
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,740
So, are we

833
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,220
besties?

834
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,620
You're overthinking it.

835
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,140
We're not quite there yet.

836
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,300
But

837
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,220
we do have something in common.

838
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,060
We're both trying

839
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,020
to prove ourselves.

840
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,820
I want to prove

841
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,180
that I can be Anlan's right-hand.

842
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,780
You're proving

843
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,900
you haven't lost yourself

844
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,920
in your creative journey.

845
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,580
So, in a way,

846
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,500
we're comrades?

847
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,060
You could say that.

848
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,380
Best comrades.

849
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,060
Honestly,

850
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,100
it's the first time I've heard a woman

851
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,260
describe me like that.

852
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,380
Looks like my charm

853
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,260
has dropped below passing.

854
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,420
But Yao Yuan,

855
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,740
thanks to you,

856
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,460
I found my inspiration again

857
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,820
and slowly rediscovered

858
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,920
the original purpose behind photography.

859
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,030
What do you think?

860
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,340
My work should meet

861
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,180
your company's requirements, right?

862
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,380
Does Su Wen know you're here?

863
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,820
He doesn't.

864
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,440
But there's no need to hide it from him.

865
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,500
He'd probably

866
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,980
be supportive of this.

867
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,900
Alright.

868
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,820
I'll ask for his opinion.

869
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,260
Can't you decide now?

870
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,440
Do you want me to explain more
about my creative ideas

871
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,580
for you to know me better?

872
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,900
People born good-looking

873
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,580
have a certain advantage:

874
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,100
Things tend to go smoothly for them,

875
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,980
but

876
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,700
that's not always the case,

877
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,300
especially when dealing with people

878
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,980
with subjective aesthetic preferences.

879
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,260
If you ask me my opinion

880
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,460
on your work today,

881
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,420
my answer would be

882
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,020
I have no opinion.

883
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,740
Thanks for coming today.

884
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,900
Ms. Cui,

885
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,260
this way.

886
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,860
Alright.

887
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,780
You can go now.

888
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,420
I don't want to go.

889
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Why?

890
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,300
You'll see me tomorrow.

891
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,060
On my dad's birthday,

892
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,540
you'll have to meet my family.

893
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,900
We're an extended family.

894
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,820
I've always worried
they'd make things stressful for you.

895
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,250
So...

896
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,620
A daughter-in-law must meet the in-laws,

897
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,060
right?

898
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,860
You're so great.

899
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,880
They'll surely like you.

900
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,740
If I'm so great,

901
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,280
what's there to worry about?

902
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,340
No worries at all.

903
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,940
We're just there
to receive their blessings.

904
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,140
Go back.

905
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,180
Good night.

906
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,640
What are you thinking about?

907
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,980
Xinran.

908
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,900
I have a question.

909
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,380
Have you ever met

910
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,660
your boyfriend's parents?

911
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,060
Yeah.

912
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,220
I've met Zhuang Wei's parents.

913
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,860
When I meet them,

914
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,900
should I figure out

915
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,420
what they like and dislike?

916
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,740
What questions might they ask me?

917
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,180
What should I wear?

918
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,940
You're about to meet Anlan's parents?

919
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,640
That's great.

920
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,940
What's there to be great about?

921
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,340
I'm not ready yet.

922
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,900
What's there to prepare for?

923
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,220
You get to meet a man
who truly cares about you

924
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,340
and cherishes you.

925
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,660
Everything else is secondary.

926
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,860
I know

927
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,940
he cares about me a lot,

928
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,020
but I'm afraid I won't pass

929
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,260
the test with his parents.

930
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,980
Don't overthink it.

931
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,500
Just be yourself around his parents.

932
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,820
Be yourself.

933
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,900
Besides, you're loved by everyone.

934
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,300
They'll surely like you.

935
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,380
You and Anlan will be happy together.

936
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,420
Xinran, you're so nice.

937
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,940
When will you give Wen Cheng a chance?

938
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,100
Here, have an orange.

939
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,140
Orange?

940
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,260
Cheng?

941
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,340
