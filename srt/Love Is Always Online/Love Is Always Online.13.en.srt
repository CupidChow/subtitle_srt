1
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,881
Who said you could mess with my kitchen?

2
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,841
I don't ask your permission to use the bathroom.

3
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,801
Come have breakfast.

4
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,041
Think of it as thanks for letting me stay.

5
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:24,761
If you don't eat, I'll throw it away.

6
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,481
You don't want to waste food, do you?

7
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,121
Where are you heading later?

8
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,201
To school.

9
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,121
I was surprised when I found out.

10
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,521
Didn't expect you to have the patience to teach.

11
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,281
Got a girlfriend now.

12
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,081
There's someone I like.

13
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,841
So, that's a no.

14
00:02:59,001 --> 00:02:59,921
What kind of girl?

15
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:01,721
Is she pretty?

16
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,441
Come on, share with me.

17
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:20,481
Xiao Yuan, I bought you breakfast.

18
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:24,081
Xiao Yuan.

19
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,640
Are you awake?

20
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:29,641
Xiao Yuan.

21
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,001
Did you stay up all night?

22
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:39,481
Just rest at home.

23
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,481
I'll have someone call in for you.

24
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,561
If you go looking for uncle,

25
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:43,601
call me.

26
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,641
I'll go with you.

27
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:47,361
Thanks, sis.

28
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:49,641
Breakfast is over there.

29
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:50,481
Eat it later, okay?

30
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,281
I made coffee for you.

31
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:02,961
I don't want it.

32
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:15,921
I'm not joking with you.

33
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:17,801
Hurry and find a place.

34
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,441
I'm coming back tonight.

35
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,161
Don't want to see you.

36
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
You're going to find uncle?

37
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,920
I'll go with you.

38
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,001
But...

39
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:52,401
You can refuse my help,

40
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,081
but I can't not protect you.

41
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:01,521
Let's go.

42
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,081
You're here to collect debts, right?

43
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:18,961
No, we're not.

44
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,481
We're looking for Shi Zheng Yi.

45
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:21,561
He's my uncle.

46
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:22,841
Looking for him?

47
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:24,481
You'll have to get in line.

48
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:26,041
He owes a ton of money.

49
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:27,241
And just vanished.

50
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:28,921
Even I can't find him.

51
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:32,041
Is there no way to reach him?

52
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:33,361
I can't either.

53
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,240
Well then,

54
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,521
if you see him,

55
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:38,441
please contact us.

56
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:39,121
Okay.

57
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,881
If you see him,

58
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:43,841
please call me right away.

59
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:45,801
Thank you.

60
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,161
Don't worry.

61
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,001
Uncle will definitely contact you.

62
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,441
I really haven't cared enough about my uncle.

63
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:05,041
I didn't even know it's been closed for so long.

64
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,240
He just doesn't want you to find him.

65
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:10,081
No way he'll let you see him.

66
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:15,321
Hey, is that your uncle?

67
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:18,641
Hey.

68
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:48,681
Uncle.

69
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:50,641
Xiao Yuan.

70
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:52,721
Uncle.

71
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,321
Xiao Yuan.

72
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:55,561
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,320
Really, I'm sorry.

74
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,761
I didn't mean to.

75
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,560
I have a friend

76
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:03,721
who came up with a way to make money.

77
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:05,201
Opening a chain restaurant.

78
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,561
So I sold my old shop.

79
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,241
And used the money you gave me to invest.

80
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,321
I planned to pay you back

81
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,601
with interest once I made money.

82
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,161
But I didn't expect

83
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:17,681
this investment

84
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:19,001
to go way beyond what I thought.

85
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:21,561
Ran into some cash flow issues.

86
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:24,641
If you use someone else's money,

87
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,281
at least give them a heads-up.

88
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,441
That's basic courtesy.

89
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:28,601
Yeah.

90
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:30,001
So what are you going to do now?

91
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:31,921
Uncle.

92
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:34,481
No matter what, we're family.

93
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,921
We can talk things through together.

94
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,681
You just had to disappear like that.

95
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,241
Leaving the creditors to come after me.

96
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,121
Do you know

97
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,961
how hard I've worked to pay my parents' debts?

98
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:46,241
How much I've struggled, how tough it's been?

99
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:47,801
Xiao Yuan, don't worry.

100
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,841
Once I get back on my feet, I'll pay you back.

101
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:51,641
Back on your feet?

102
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,521
Can you even get the investment back?

103
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:56,201
Xiao Yuan.

104
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,681
I'm your real uncle, I wouldn't lie to you.

105
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,481
I'll talk to the creditors.

106
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:01,441
Is that okay with you?

107
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:04,521
Alright.

108
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,641
Tell me your solution first.

109
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,841
I will, I promise.

110
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,481
Where have you been all this time?

111
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,761
I almost thought someone buried you.

112
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:30,001
Was out trying to get money.

113
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:33,761
Now the chain restaurant can't even open.

114
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:34,921
Still owe my niece money.

115
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm worried sick.

116
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:38,041
Your niece

117
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:41,401
just came looking for you with her boyfriend.

118
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:43,201
Boyfriend?

119
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,121
Yeah.

120
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,721
That outfit

121
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:46,841
from head to toe,

122
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,201
any piece costs at least ten thousand.

123
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,161
How do you know that's her boyfriend?

124
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,401
That's why I say you're clueless.

125
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:54,801
If he wasn't her boyfriend,

126
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:56,401
why would he come with her to ask for money?

127
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:59,041
He looked like her knight in shining armor.

128
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,761
He must really like your niece.

129
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,121
Or maybe

130
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,041
you and her boyfriend

131
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:08,001
could borrow some money.

132
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:18,441
Where are we going?

133
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:20,161
Back to our place.

134
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:22,001
Our home.

135
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:23,881
My home.

136
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,481
It's also our future home.

137
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,401
I'll cook for you when we get home.

138
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,881
I've got a secret recipe, you'll love it.

139
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:31,561
But right now,

140
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:33,721
I'm really not in the mood to eat.

141
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,521
Being hungry won't solve anything.

142
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,841
You need to eat to have strength to face it.

143
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:40,281
Besides,

144
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,681
you still have to deal with your uncle.

145
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:42,921
Go back and forth with him for a while.

146
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,761
You might even have to chase him for a hundred meters.

147
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,001
You need to save your energy.

148
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:55,561
I've been helping my lady all day.

149
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,361
She didn't even join me for a meal.

150
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,401
It's fine. I'm the Pro, after all.

151
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,081
I'll heal myself. I'm really tough.

152
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:07,601
Let's eat, let's eat.

153
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,201
Heading home for dinner!

154
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,520
Welcome home, my lady.

155
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:19,561
And you?

156
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:21,521
Just sitting here watching something light.

157
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:23,521
Don't think about anything. I'll make dinner.

158
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:27,241
Didn't "God of Cookery" have Soul-Absorbing Rice?

159
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,121
I've got Soul-Absent Soup.

160
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:30,561
What's that?

161
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:31,881
After you eat it,

162
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,681
you'll keep thinking of the cook.

163
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:13,561
So these are your secret recipes?

164
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:14,801
Nope.

165
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:16,961
Secret recipe.

166
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,401
Isn't it right in front of you?

167
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,961
Then why do I come to your place?

168
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,480
Is it just for you?

169
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:24,801
Alright.

170
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:26,041
Go sit down now.

171
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,121
Don't think about anything.

172
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,081
Just do what makes you happy.

173
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:29,841
Go on, hurry.

174
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,001
Hey, Brother Cheng.

175
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,801
The last female guest you invited was a hit.

176
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,441
Management was very pleased.

177
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:48,921
I told you, just trust me.

178
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:52,121
Now my position is unshakable, right?

179
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:53,881
Don't invite Lin Lin again.

180
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,121
I agree, Lin Lin isn't a good fit.

181
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:00,161
Ashley.

182
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,641
Come in.

183
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:03,881
Come.

184
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:07,801
Let me introduce you.

185
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:08,441
Ashley.

186
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:09,321
Brother Cheng.

187
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,681
You two will be partners now.

188
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,001
Hello.

189
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:14,721
Partner.

190
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,321
Xiao Zhang, what are you up to now?

191
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:17,601
Wen Cheng.

192
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,121
Relationship shows

193
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:21,201
should cover both male and female views.

194
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,840
We need to consider all viewers.

195
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:24,561
Besides,

196
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,441
dual hosts are the trend now.

197
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,041
The last female guest you invited

198
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,001
was such a success.

199
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,320
It shows

200
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,481
our audience

201
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,081
prefers smart women.

202
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:36,321
Ashley

203
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,041
is a better fit than Lin Lin.

204
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:41,001
Do I have to accept this?

205
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:44,721
Wen Cheng, it's the company's decision.

206
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,041
Try working together first.

207
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,040
See how it goes.

208
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:49,361
Looking forward to working with you.

209
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,601
So what do you think makes women happiest?

210
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,681
I think the greatest happiness is being loved.

211
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,241
So you think being loved is happiness.

212
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:03,761
When you're loved,

213
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:05,841
someone buys you a house, a car, a bag.

214
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:07,641
You don't have to work hard every day.

215
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,361
Just dress up beautifully every day.

216
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:11,761
Live comfortably, that's enough.

217
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:13,721
So for you,

218
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:17,521
love means a house, a car, a bag.

219
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,040
No need to work anymore.

220
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:19,601
It's not just me.

221
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:20,921
In this world,

222
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,241
at least half of women think this way.

223
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:25,521
What about the other half?

224
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:27,561
Them?

225
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,441
No one loves them.

226
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:35,681
Have you thought this love might be fleeting?

227
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:37,921
When the man loses money and power,

228
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:39,841
where does your love go?

229
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,240
Money?

230
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,521
You can earn it again.

231
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:43,801
Exactly.

232
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:45,921
Money can always be made again.

233
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:47,321
But what's truly special

234
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,721
is if he's willing to give for you.

235
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,521
Buying a house or car isn't hard.

236
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,760
What's really hard

237
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,881
is when you share a tiny room,

238
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,441
he's grateful you're with him.

239
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:01,401
When you only have one car,

240
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,201
he lets you drive, takes the bus himself.

241
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,881
He gives you all the best.

242
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,160
He uses what's left.

243
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:07,841
And

244
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,240
you know how to cherish it.

245
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:12,721
In relationships,

246
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,321
luck isn't just loving or being loved.

247
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,881
It's when the one you love loves you back.

248
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,521
You love and are loved at the same time.

249
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:20,881
You learn to give

250
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:21,881
and to receive.

251
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,721
But some people aren't that lucky.

252
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:28,961
Some people

253
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,320
are always the ones who love.

254
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,481
Loving is a kind of learning.

255
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,561
In my view,

256
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:37,921
you still have a long way to go.

257
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:39,801
Oh, right.

258
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:41,161
I heard them say

259
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:42,801
the girl you liked for a long time

260
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,041
was won over by Su Wen with no effort.

261
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,601
No wonder, when he came to record last time,

262
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:49,841
your face was so stiff.

263
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:52,521
From a woman's perspective,

264
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:53,881
this situation

265
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,001
shows you

266
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,601
what kind of man

267
00:14:56,641 --> 00:14:57,801
is most popular with women.

268
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,081
Don't you think so?

269
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:03,641
What kind of person

270
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:05,801
brings up others' wounds when losing an argument?

271
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,001
Seriously.

272
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:20,561
Take it.

273
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:24,321
Are you trying to burn me?

274
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:26,441
To wake you up!

275
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,401
Are there people like Xiao Zhang?

276
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,041
Just for his own desires,

277
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:32,961
he betrays lifelong friends.

278
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:33,761
He sells them out.

279
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:37,761
There are.

280
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:39,601
We've just met one.

281
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:44,841
That kind of person.

282
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:45,961
Don't worry about him.

283
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:47,441
You make it sound easy.

284
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:53,801
Isn't there anyone reliable?

285
00:15:58,921 --> 00:15:59,401
Darn it.

286
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,641
Annoying.

287
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:01,361
Touching up my makeup.

288
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:02,681
Don't worry.

289
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,481
In a little while,

290
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,241
you'll definitely be a full host.

291
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:06,721
Ah.

292
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,561
But you know how things are now.

293
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:10,161
I...

294
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,201
Don't worry.

295
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,441
That Wen Cheng guy

296
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:15,721
won't last much longer.

297
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,441
Really?

298
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,361
The audience has lost interest in him.

299
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:27,041
What kind of friend are you?

300
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:28,241
I'm in deep trouble here.

301
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,401
You just brought coffee and left.

302
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:30,921
Now you're just glued to your phone.

303
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,681
You don't care how I'm feeling at all.

304
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:33,441
Oh, come on.

305
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:34,601
But with things like this now,

306
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:36,041
you know how it is.

307
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:36,481
I...

308
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,481
You're something else.

309
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,681
They really do have a plan.

310
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:41,521
They want to push you out.

311
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:42,801
I knew it.

312
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,161
Brother Wen, time to touch up makeup.

313
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:47,961
No need.

314
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:48,521
I'm done filming.

315
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:52,761
They were heartless first, so don't blame me.

316
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:54,601
Makes sense.

317
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,041
I need a place that suits my status.

318
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,561
Let those two keep messing around here.

319
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,041
Eat while it's hot.

320
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:14,001
This...

321
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,481
When I was little,

322
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,921
my grandpa made this for me

323
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,001
to take care of my health.

324
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,000
Now he's not strong anymore.

325
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,041
So I cook it for him now.

326
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,161
So that's how Pro became Pro?

327
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,560
I was born a Pro.

328
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:30,561
It's delicious.

329
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:32,881
You're smiling again.

330
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,640
From now on,

331
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,401
don't carry things alone.

332
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:40,001
I'll walk the road ahead with you.

333
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,841
Please don't misunderstand.

334
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:52,881
It's just that

335
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,641
bad things happened to me as a kid.

336
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,161
So I feel

337
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,721
I've relied on myself all these years.

338
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:05,241
I've lived on my own.

339
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:08,601
I don't want to depend on others.

340
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,201
Because I know very well

341
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:12,201
no matter who it is,

342
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:14,641
they'll leave one day.

343
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:16,641
Whether it's friends

344
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,041
or family.

345
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:23,561
I won't.

346
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,081
The future is uncertain.

347
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:28,201
I know I won't.

348
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:30,641
Unless it's for you.

349
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,201
Without you, my life isn't whole.

350
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,440
You're what I strive for.

351
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,081
Thank you.

352
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:49,041
What's wrong?

353
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:51,921
Did I say something wrong?

354
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,801
Or is the soup just too good?

355
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:01,921
I just feel

356
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:05,481
meeting you

357
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:08,041
makes me feel so lucky.

358
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:10,641
So this is

359
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,601
what happiness feels like.

360
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:15,681
It's not luck.

361
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,761
It's like attracts like.

362
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:21,641
You're wonderful.

363
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:25,441
That's why good things and people come to you.

364
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:27,801
You deserve all of it.

365
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:30,601
Eat up.

366
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,161
I want to go to your room.

367
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,081
What's up?

368
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,401
Should I go up with you?

369
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:52,961
Yao Yuan.

370
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:57,161
Is this...

371
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,081
the wardrobe you saved for me?

372
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:20,761
Thanks to you, I made up my mind.

373
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:22,601
Of course.

374
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,281
If they want to push you out, I don't mind.

375
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:27,921
But shady deals? No way.

376
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:29,521
This just shows us

377
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,601
what "you reap what you sow" means.

378
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,520
You should stay upright as a person.

379
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:36,401
Like me—open and honest, isn't that better?

380
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,120
How are you better?

381
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,481
You don't even have a job now.

382
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:51,161
Hey, An Lan, where are you?

383
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:52,121
I'm with Li Ao, we're...

384
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,561
Just tell me what to do if a woman cries.

385
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,161
A woman cried? What do you mean?

386
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:58,801
Did you make Yao Yuan cry?

387
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:00,561
Speakerphone, speakerphone!

388
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,521
She ran into my room crying.

389
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,041
No way.

390
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:08,881
What did you do?

391
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:10,921
You're an adult, why so impulsive?

392
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:12,761
Yeah, boss.

393
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:13,921
Don't push my lady too hard.

394
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:14,881
You can't force this.

395
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,521
No, what nonsense—who's impulsive?

396
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:19,881
Then...

397
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,401
Why else would my lady cry? Did you fight?

398
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:24,081
Tears of joy.

399
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:28,481
Does it matter?

400
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:30,681
The point is, tell me

401
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:31,881
what I should do now.

402
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:33,641
The woman I love cried in front of me.

403
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:35,001
Seeing her cry, I can't take it.

404
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:38,081
Okay, don't panic. I'll tell you.

405
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,720
There's only one way when a woman cries.

406
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,961
Hold her, kiss her.

407
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,401
Then tell her not to cry, and it's fine.

408
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,401
No, that's too flirty, boss.

409
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,521
Just break in, that's your style.

410
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:52,561
Break in? You think that's free?

411
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:55,761
What's more important, the door or her tears?

412
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,401
Of course it's...

413
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,161
Forget it, I'll handle it myself.

414
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:05,681
Looks like he really wants to get married.

415
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,881
My lady, are you okay?

416
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:05,401
Thank you.

417
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:07,921
You're so good to me.

418
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,321
It's what I should do.

419
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,281
Let's eat first.

420
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:40,641
Sure.

421
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:47,561
Hey.

422
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:49,041
Did you finish writing your book?

423
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:50,561
Sigh.

424
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:51,281
Don't even mention it.

425
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,761
My mind is a total mess right now.

426
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:53,841
I can't write a single word.

427
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:56,041
Looks like this so-called love expert

428
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:58,281
is about to start a failure log.

429
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,561
Don't lose hope.

430
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,161
Inspiration is always unpredictable.

431
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,361
Maybe tomorrow, while you're in the bathroom,

432
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:05,121
you'll get inspired.

433
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:05,801
Right?

434
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,641
When did you get so thoughtful?

435
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,241
Usually you tease me a couple times

436
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,041
just to feel good, don't you?

437
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,881
Well, teasing you gets old too.

438
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:14,961
Just...

439
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:16,441
showing some concern for you.

440
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,641
I'm worried you'll do something silly.

441
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:19,081
Your eyes are so red.

442
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,960
Are you drunk?

443
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,481
Who's drunk?

444
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:22,081
Seriously.

445
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:28,121
Isn't this Pro Su the photographer?

446
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:29,401
Why the sour face?

447
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:33,561
Li Ao, do you know

448
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:34,681
how to describe someone

449
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,520
who thinks they're unbeatable

450
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:39,041
but their confidence pops like a balloon?

451
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:41,561
No idea.

452
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:42,161
Uh...

453
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,521
Like a shriveled balloon.

454
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:51,321
Hey.

455
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:52,121
I've said it before,

456
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:53,441
An Lan is unbeatable.

457
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:54,921
You insisted on being tough.

458
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:56,041
And now?

459
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:57,761
Can't win over Yao Yuan,

460
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:58,841
so you drink alone.

461
00:25:59,321 --> 00:25:59,921
Is it that serious?

462
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,601
You think I'm the type who can't get Yao Yuan

463
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,321
and then comes here to drink alone?

464
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:06,441
Then why the long face?

465
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:07,681
Spent all your money?

466
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:09,321
Or...

467
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:10,841
Run out of ideas?

468
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:12,561
Nope.

469
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:13,441
If you ask me,

470
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,121
it's probably about a girl.

471
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:18,961
Hey, love expert,

472
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,480
didn't you write something called

473
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:22,761
"The Right Time"

474
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:23,681
or...

475
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:24,921
"Everyone meets someone in life"

476
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,281
who will always

477
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:26,961
be your match?

478
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:27,721
What does that mean?

479
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,241
You mean "the right person," right?

480
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,521
And that line

481
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:31,641
was from An Lan.

482
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:32,281
I just borrowed it.

483
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:33,401
What's up?

484
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:35,041
Did you meet your match?

485
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:36,401
No.

486
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:37,121
Just drinking.

487
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,641
Come on, Pro Su.

488
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:03,321
Why are you laughing?

489
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:05,801
I just remembered

490
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,041
your high school hair.

491
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:09,201
It was pretty cute.

492
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:11,921
What,

493
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,321
I'm not cute now?

494
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:16,601
You're always cute.

495
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:21,801
I should head back.

496
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,241
It's so late, you're still leaving?

497
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:27,281
Of course, shouldn't I go home this late?

498
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:30,681
The bed's big enough for both of us.

499
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:31,321
And then?

500
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,920
You sleep here.

501
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:33,881
No way.

502
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,121
Stop dreaming, I'm going home.

503
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:36,841
My sis will scold me.

504
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,761
Alright, I'll walk you out.

505
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:44,441
I'm off.

506
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,401
Alone in an empty room.

507
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:35,201
Wen Ruyu.

508
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,681
Can you stop making me your target?

509
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:40,601
Grow up a little.

510
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,681
At least my aim is mature.

511
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,361
Isn't it?

512
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:45,761
By the way,

513
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:46,561
Are you okay?

514
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:48,561
What could be wrong with me?

515
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,121
You got roasted on the show today.

516
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,841
I said, the sun must've risen in the west today.

517
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,321
Even you care about me now?

518
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:01,881
It's called sympathy.

519
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,001
You looked pretty pitiful.

520
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:06,721
Thanks for your great mercy, fairy.

521
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:08,801
I, Wen Ruyu, don't need your sympathy.

522
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:11,041
Kindness wasted on you.

523
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:14,601
Alright, alright.

524
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:15,881
Thanks for caring.

525
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:18,401
What about you?

526
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,321
Did your ex Zhuang Wei come back for you?

527
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:25,561
He still likes you, can't you tell?

528
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,161
What do you mean?

529
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,481
He's about to get married.

530
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,001
"About to" means not married yet.

531
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,161
Not married means he could be single anytime.

532
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,001
Trust me, I read people well.

533
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,521
Want to bet on it?

534
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,161
If Zhuang Wei really gets married,

535
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,601
I, Wen Ruyu,

536
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:43,841
will quit Tianxia Bang immediately

537
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,121
and join your Baihua Tang.

538
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:45,561
How about it?

539
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:47,761
Deal, I'm not afraid.

540
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,361
Baihua Tang needs people anyway.

541
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:51,321
Tianxia Bang won't miss you.

542
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:52,761
Deal.

543
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:54,521
Alright.

544
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,401
You go first.

545
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:38,681
Thanks.

546
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:48,321
Xiao Ya

547
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,281
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:53,401
I was too harsh that day.

549
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:55,321
Will you forgive me?

550
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:00,281
Actually,

551
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,321
I was wrong too.

552
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:06,521
I just envy you two sisters.

553
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:07,521
You both have someone who likes you.

554
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,681
I go to parties,

555
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:11,201
but still have no one.

556
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:14,081
Don't say that.

557
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:17,001
Look, I'm alone now too.

558
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:18,081
Love,

559
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:19,961
is a very delicate thing.

560
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:22,761
You meet the right person at the right time.

561
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:25,881
I believe you'll find the right one.

562
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,881
You sound more and more like Wen Cheng.

563
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:34,361
All those love theories.

564
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:35,961
Eh, I don't care.

565
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,521
You two have to help me find someone.

566
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:39,601
We

567
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:41,441
must get married around the same time.

568
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,241
Okay.

569
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:44,161
I'll help you look.

570
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:45,401
Ten candidates should be enough, right?

571
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:47,481
No need.

572
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:49,161
Just one right person is enough.

573
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:51,801
Deal.

574
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,761
Got it, got it.

575
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:58,561
Thinking about Pro again?

576
00:31:58,761 --> 00:31:59,921
You scared me!

577
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:01,761
Oh, it must be.

578
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:04,361
I heard

579
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:05,841
you came back late last night.

580
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:08,641
Did you go to Pro's place?

581
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,321
Can you not gossip like this?

582
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:14,281
You two are moving so fast.

583
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,321
I just went for dinner.

584
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,801
A man and a woman alone,

585
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,601
having dinner till so late.

586
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,921
I don't buy it.

587
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:28,161
He went with me to find my uncle yesterday.

588
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,281
He saw I was upset,

589
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:31,201
so he cheered me up.

590
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,121
Did you find him?

591
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:34,281
Yes.

592
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:35,801
He said he's short on cash.

593
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,481
He'll pay back soon.

594
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:38,961
You can't trust him anymore.

595
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:39,921
Once is never enough.

596
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:40,761
He lied to you now,

597
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:42,201
he'll do it again for sure.

598
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:43,401
Mm.

599
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:46,001
But he's still my uncle.

600
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:46,801
He asked me to wait,

601
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,081
so I have to wait.

602
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:49,241
Besides,

603
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:52,081
I understand how it feels to be chased for debts.

604
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:53,201
He's not a bad person,

605
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,001
just unlucky.

606
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:56,641
He knows you were forced to pay debts before,

607
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:58,041
yet he makes you go through this again.

608
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:00,641
You need to think more about yourself.

609
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:01,801
Exactly.

610
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,601
Don't take it all on yourself anymore.

611
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:31,681
Grandma

612
00:33:32,281 --> 00:33:33,481
Have you eaten?

613
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,121
Grandma ate already.

614
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:36,321
Oh, by the way,

615
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:37,041
Xiao Yuan,

616
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,161
did you reach your uncle?

617
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:40,721
Don't worry.

618
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:42,041
I've found uncle.

619
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:42,841
It's nothing serious.

620
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:43,761
Mm.

621
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:44,401
Grandma,

622
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,161
I sent you money.

623
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:47,081
Did you get it?

624
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:50,441
As long as you're fine, that's good.

625
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:51,761
Xiao Yuan,

626
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:53,921
Grandma lives alone.

627
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:55,401
I don't need that much money.

628
00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:58,441
Keep the money for yourself.

629
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:58,841
Ah.

630
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:01,601
Don't worry.

631
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:02,481
I'm doing well here.

632
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:03,481
I have food and a place to stay.

633
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:05,361
At home,

634
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,921
if anything's broken or worn out,

635
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:08,001
you should replace it.

636
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:08,401
Ah.

637
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:09,281
Don't be stingy with money.

638
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:11,321
Alright.

639
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:14,321
Come back often when you can.

640
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:15,201
Ah.

641
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,720
Mm.

642
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:17,841
Bye.

643
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:34,121
Sis Yao,

644
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,361
Are you sure you want to sell all these?

645
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,401
These are all rare treasures.

646
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:39,441
You can't get them again.

647
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:40,761
You

648
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,441
really need money?

649
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,401
I play games

650
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:45,521
just for the money.

651
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:46,961
Alright.

652
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:48,521
Then I'll take them all.

653
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,080
Thanks.

654
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:54,201
I really don't get it.

655
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,921
You're with Brother An Lan,

656
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,521
why are you still so miserable?

657
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,521
If you just ask,

658
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:00,761
the problem will be solved right away.

659
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,561
I won't ask him for money.

660
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,121
True.

661
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:06,841
It's always awkward to ask.

662
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,481
If you're shy, I can ask for you.

663
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,440
Brother An Lan won't mind such a small amount.

664
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,281
I'll handle it myself.

665
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:16,881
Thank you.

666
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,721
Drink this bottle of love milk,

667
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:40,161
you'll be full of energy.

668
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,720
Thanks.

669
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,241
I can't help with your problems,

670
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:45,641
but making you smile,

671
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:46,641
I'll do my best.

672
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:54,841
Don't like it?

673
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:55,681
Darn it, I'll get you chocolate.

674
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,480
No, no,

675
00:35:58,401 --> 00:35:59,481
I just want to say,

676
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:01,761
I hope

677
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:02,681
our relationship

678
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,201
can stay as friends.

679
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:08,041
I

680
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,681
really love your work,

681
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:11,641
but

682
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,881
I don't like you.

683
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:16,041
So

684
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:17,241
you

685
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:19,281
have really chosen Lao Jiang?

686
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:21,081
Want to think it over again?

687
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:25,801
Actually, I decided long ago.

688
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,081
The first time I saw him,

689
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:31,881
I already liked him.

690
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:41,681
So Teacher Yao ran into a clingy one.

691
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:45,121
No wonder I couldn't find anyone
in the office.

692
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:46,961
Hey, Su Wen.

693
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,201
Why do you look like
you've got a dark cloud over you?

694
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:52,321
Yeah, I'm the darkest.

695
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:53,961
I'm so dark, I'm turning purple.

696
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:55,041
You're the coolest.

697
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:56,241
Fine, you win.

698
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,561
Did you swallow a bomb?

699
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,681
Why are you so fired up?

700
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:09,361
Boss.

701
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:14,321
Can I borrow a moment of your time?

702
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:16,681
What's up?

703
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,120
Go ahead.

704
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:18,801
Well...

705
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,321
Today, whatever it is,
I'll help you out.

706
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:22,761
That's awesome, really awesome!

707
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,520
Boss, are you close with her?

708
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:32,121
Yeah.

709
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,841
So, does she have a boyfriend?

710
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:35,681
What kind of guy does she like?

711
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:39,201
Someone like me—good looks,
great personality.

712
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,561
And a solid family background.

713
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:42,761
Would she consider that?

714
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,081
Why do you fall for everyone you meet?

715
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,400
Come on, boss.

716
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,960
Nothing escapes your eagle eyes.

717
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:50,721
But right now, in my heart,

718
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:52,961
it's all Fang Jianing.

719
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:54,961
Boss.

720
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,161
I trust you know
what I'm feeling.

721
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:03,441
About this...

722
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:08,761
In this company,

723
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:11,401
there's an intern spot open.

724
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:13,601
I can get you in.

725
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:14,881
The rest

726
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,561
is up to your own luck.

727
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,960
Boss, I love you!

728
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:18,561
You're way too good to me.

729
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:19,321
Your kindness and generosity—

730
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:20,561
I'm forever grateful.

731
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,321
Alright, alright.

732
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:22,241
Go on, go on.

733
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:23,881
Thanks, boss!

734
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:24,601
Bye, boss!

735
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:31,161
Hey.

736
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:31,521
Xinran.

737
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,241
Wen Cheng was right.

738
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,081
He actually came to find me.

739
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:41,281
Why are you here?

740
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,321
Just passing by.

741
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:44,441
Have you had lunch?

742
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:45,321
None of your business.

743
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:46,561
Hey, hey.

744
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:47,201
Xinran.

745
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,201
Why so harsh?

746
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,321
It took effort to reach you.

747
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:54,521
Can't we at least be friends?

748
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:54,961
No need.

749
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:56,241
I don't need more friends.

750
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:58,641
And I don't want my boyfriend
to misunderstand.

751
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,281
He's really your boyfriend?

752
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:02,001
He is.

753
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,560
He's better than you
in every way.

754
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:06,121
Hey, Xinran.

755
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:09,481
You know,

756
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:10,801
that day you and your boyfriend

757
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:11,361
kissed—

758
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:13,801
I actually felt heartache.

759
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:15,441
Like I couldn't breathe.

760
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:17,841
I think that's jealousy.

761
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:19,081
I realized

762
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:21,841
I still love you.

763
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,800
What are you talking about?

764
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:26,721
I don't get it.

765
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,201
Weren't you getting married?

766
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,360
What marriage?

767
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:31,521
It's off.

768
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:32,961
It's off.

769
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:33,441
Yeah.

770
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:34,041
It's off.

771
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,001
Because I have to take responsibility.

772
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:37,801
I still have you in my heart.

773
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:39,761
How could I marry someone else?

774
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:41,201
Responsibility?

775
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:42,601
Are you kidding me?

776
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,121
Do you even know
what responsibility means?

777
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:47,001
Back then,

778
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:48,961
I didn't even know myself.

779
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:50,561
That's why I did those things

780
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:52,361
that hurt you.

781
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:55,601
But now it's different.

782
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:56,881
I can do anything now.

783
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:00,161
How about

784
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:00,841
you forgive me?

785
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:03,641
Can we start over?

786
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:05,801
Zhuang Wei.

787
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:09,201
What are you doing?

788
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:10,241
Yao Yuan.

789
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:11,161
Long time no see.

790
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,481
Hey, you've gotten prettier.

791
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:13,161
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:14,681
Help me talk to your sis.

793
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:15,841
Get her to take me back.

794
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:17,361
Are you joking?

795
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:21,041
Hey, Xinran.

796
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:22,281
I'm serious.

797
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:26,521
Sis.

798
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:29,001
Did you forget
how Zhuang Wei treated you?

799
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,361
Did you forget?

800
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:32,761
I haven't forgotten.

801
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,041
But seeing him today,

802
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:37,761
I can't bear to hurt him.

803
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:40,561
Don't be foolish anymore.

804
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,841
Don't see him again.

805
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:46,961
What do you want to buy?

806
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:47,921
I don't want to buy anything.

807
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:49,681
I just want to cherish
our time together.

808
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:50,841
Did you eat honey today?

809
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:51,761
Your mouth is so sweet.

810
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:52,121
Zhuang Wei.

811
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:55,321
You said you were working,

812
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:56,561
but you were picking up girls.

813
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:00,001
Who are you?

814
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:01,401
Why are you insulting my boyfriend?

815
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:02,801
He's my boyfriend.

816
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:04,001
Are you being fooled?

817
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:07,521
Are you stalking me?

818
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:08,921
Next time you lie,

819
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:10,441
don't forget to turn off
your phone's location.

820
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:15,761
Zhuang Wei.

821
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:17,361
Explain yourself.

822
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,241
Let's not waste time.

823
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:22,481
Zhuang Wei, tell us—

824
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:23,401
Who do you choose?

825
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:25,721
Can you stop making a scene?

826
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:26,481
Say it.

827
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:36,481
Xinran.

828
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:43,241
Let's break up.

829
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:45,161
I like someone else.

830
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:03,201
Let me tell you—

831
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,081
He'll never leave me.

832
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:07,441
Because I can make sure
his career soars.

833
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:08,841
He'll save years of hard work.

834
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,161
Sis.

835
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:26,601
What's wrong?

836
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,241
Weren't you going on a date?

837
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:31,481
Zhuang Wei.

838
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,441
Zhuang Wei has another woman.
