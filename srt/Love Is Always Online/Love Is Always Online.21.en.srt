Jiang,

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,940
why call me here

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,780
so late?

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,980
There's something

41
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,520
I need to tell you in person.

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,900
In person?

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,300
Couldn't you say it over the phone?

44
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,460
Cui Xi came to see me.

45
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,430
She wanted me to sign her.

46
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,060
So,

47
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,980
did you sign her?

48
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,460
I turned her down outright.

49
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,580
Why?

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
What?

51
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,770
Don't you want me to refuse her?

52
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,820
That's not what I meant.

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,980
I just don't understand

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,580
why.

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,490
Cui Xi

56
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,310
might not be

57
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,580
the same as before.

58
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,620
Jiang,

59
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,380
given our relationship,

60
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,360
just be straight with me.

61
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,500
If she truly liked you,

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,240
she wouldn't want to rely on looks

63
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,940
to get a job.

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,540
(Dear, go for it. Anlan)

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,580

This time,

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,980
we want to focus

70
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,500
on the theme of besties,

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,260
(Bestie)
showing different types of besties,

72
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,180
to give consumers

73
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,100
a sense of connection.

74
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,700
We hope Xiduomeng Tea

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,620
can become

76
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,420
the top choice

77

among women's drinks

78
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,700
because young women

79
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,100
are a highly influential

80
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,140
group of people,

81
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,860
so we want to convey

82
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,380
the idea of lovers

83
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,220
without blood ties.

Mr. Su Wen

86
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,580
also uses besties

87
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,700
in the work

88
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,820

89

confidence,

91
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,660
and optimism.

92
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,140
What's going on?

93
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,700
This concept and idea

94
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,340
have been presented by another company

95
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,280
and photographer to us.

96
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,740
Could you tell me

97
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,200
which photographer it is?

98
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,380
Hengguo Advertising.

99
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,680
The photographer is Cui Xi.

(Proposal Report)

101
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,420
Is this a case of plagiarism

102
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,540
or

103
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,780
a leak of trade secrets?

104
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,660
That's impossible.

105
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,380
We arrived at this

106
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,340
after multiple meetings.

107
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,740
It's absolutely original.

108
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,980
But

109
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,300
the similarity is very high.

110
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,020
Even the composition style

111
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,420
is very similar.

112
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
How did this happen?

113
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,820
Can you let us

114
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,460
finish presenting our proposal?

115
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
Maybe there's a different perspective
or insight.

116
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,300
Sorry.

117
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,140
Our time is limited.

118
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,860
If you can't bring anything new,

119
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,860
I think

120
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,180
this

121
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,220
proposal meeting

122
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,460
will be pointless.

123
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,340
We value the joint proposal.

124
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,460
But I didn't expect it
to involve plagiarism.

125
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,380
We hope you will

126
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,320
pursue responsibility.

127
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,220
Otherwise, our reputation

128
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,300
will be seriously damaged.

129
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,260
Sorry about that.

130
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,380
We'll resolve this asap.

131
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,500
How's it going?

132
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,100
I'm sorry.

133
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,260
You worked so hard,

134
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,280
but you didn't even get
a chance to show it.

135
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,860
It's okay.

136
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,060
Let's first figure out what happened.

137
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,080
Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

138
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,460
We're a step too late.

139
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,660
If we had submitted the proposal first,

140
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,380
it would've been clear
that they copied us.

141
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,260
Hey, Su Wen.

142
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,620
Isn't Cui Xi your girlfriend?

143
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Could she have taken

144
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,420
our idea from you?

145
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
I hope she didn't.

146
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,580
I'll find out.

147
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,020
You guys head back.

148
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,700
This can't be a coincidence.

149
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,740
How could they come up

150
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,060
with a proposal so similar?

151
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,660
The answer is obvious.

152
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,580
It depends on how Su Wen wants
to view and handle this.

153
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,700
Should we pursue this?

154
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,940
Pursue?

155
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,220
The company's ideas

156
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,740
are also assets.

157
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,360
No matter the reason for the leak,

158
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,020
we must hold someone responsible

159
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,100
and even seek compensation.

160
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,820
If it really was Cui Xi,

161
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,840
wouldn't Su Wen be in a tough spot?

162
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,660
But if we don't act,

163
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,540
it wouldn't be fair to those
who worked hard.

164
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,160
I don't want your efforts
to go to waste.

165
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,440
And I don't want Su Wen
to suffer quietly.

166
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,160
Li Ao,

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,540
set up a meeting with Kevin for me.

168
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,480
I want to get some info.

169
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,850
Okay, I'll arrange it.

170
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,820
Dear, thanks for your efforts.

171
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,480
What made you find time to see me today?

172
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,920
How can you act like nothing happened?

173
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,060
What did you say?

174
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Xiduomeng Tea.

175
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,920
Did you also pitch a proposal?

176
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,500
Oh.

177
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,900
You mean that image commercial?

178
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,740
Tom's company asked me to help out.

179
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,340
You pitched a proposal too?

180
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,420
Using besties as the theme.

181
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,660
Featuring loved ones without blood ties.

182
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,780
Does it sound familiar?

183
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,780
How did you know about our proposal?

184
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,220
No way.

185
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,300
Are we the same?

186
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,340
Can you stop pretending to be clueless?

187
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
You live in my place.

188
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,460
Can you say you never looked

189
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,480
at my computer or my work?

190
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,180
Why are you yelling?

191
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,900
We just happen to think alike.

192
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,700
Besides,

193
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,160
what proof do you have to accuse me?

194
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,240
Are you forcing me
to install surveillance at home?

195
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,460
Is this really how you see me?

196
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,700
You know better than anyone.

197
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,540
You don't understand me at all.

198
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,700
Maybe that's true.

199
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,180
You can say that you love me

200
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,540
and that you'd give up everything,

201
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,940
and then you get obsessed
with photography,

202
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,060
even crossing moral lines.

203
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,380
Only you know

204
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,920
what kind of person you are.

205
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,580
I know you won't believe what I say now,

206
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,300
but I really want to be with you.

207
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,300
Cui Xi,

208
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,160
if I still believe in you,

209
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,380
I'll be a fool.

210
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,480
Su Wen, you've gone too far.

211
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,420
Hey.

212
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,980
This is frustrating.

213
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,100
It just kills my motivation.

214
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,500
Su Wen was too careless.

215
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,380
How could he just let anyone see
the proposal?

216
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,340
Don't blame Su Wen.

217
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,860
He's a victim in this too.

218
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,700
He's surely feeling bad about it.

219
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,220
What I really don't get is

220
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,000
how he could still accept

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
such a problematic ex-girlfriend.

222
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,500
Well.

223
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,620
When it comes to love,

224
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,460
you can never tell.

225
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,960
If an ordinary person says

226
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,180
they've changed for the better,

227
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,260
you may even forgive them.

228
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,540
She's the one he once loved.

229
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,780
He was soft-hearted and nostalgic

230
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,380
and ended up dragging us down.

231
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,360
It's okay.

232
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,420
Though we fail this time,

233
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,640
we'll have new cases lined up.

234
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,200
Let's pick ourselves up.

235
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,040
Thanks for all your hard work.

236
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,620
It's fine.

237
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,300
But I'm not happy.

238
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,040
I understand how you all feel.

239
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,380
When we first started this company,

240
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,140
many clients didn't trust us at all.

241
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,100
Some even went as far

242
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,420
as taking our proposals

243
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,460
to other more established
investment consulting firms

244
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,020
to negotiate better deals.

245
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,580
That felt so unfair.

246
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,420
How did you handle that?

247
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,140
I was furious.

248
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,140
It wasn't just unfair.

249
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,500
It showed zero respect for our ideas

250
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,740
or for the work we put in.

251
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,820
But in the end,

252
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,400
I tried to see things
from their perspective.

253
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,060
When someone has no way out,

254
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,220
they'll lose their judgment

255
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,800
and do things that hurt others
and themselves.

256
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,740
I'm not as kind and open-minded

257
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,660
as Anlan.

258
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,900
They're just selfish.

259
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,340
Thieves.

260
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,780
We don't need to waste

261
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,260
too much time on them.

262
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,820
Exactly.

263
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,580
Let's just move forward.

264
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,600
Can we submit the proposal again?

265
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,740
Are you sure you?

266
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,220
If we don't give it another shot

267
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,180
and don't fight for it,

268
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,460
I think it'll hurt our company's image.

269
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,460
Such a good employee
who cares about the company.

270
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,620
Anlan.

271
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
I feel the same way.

272
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,840
I don't want to give up.

273
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,180
Master.

274
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,220
Why not help us fight for it again?

275
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,940
Alright.

276
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,340
I'll do my best to fight for everyone.

277
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,270
Leaving?

278
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,130
Yeah.

279
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,540
- Anlan.
- Yao...

280
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,380
Should we order some takeout

281
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
and work overtime?

282
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,020
I'm not hungry. You guys go ahead.

283
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,260
But I have a ton of ideas

284
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,380
to discuss with you now.

285
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,100
Zhang He.

286
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,940
You place the order.

287
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
Hey, Jianing.

288
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,500
I can't find my phone.

289
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Where did you put it?

290
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,060
Call my phone for me.

291
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,900
Okay, got it.

292
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,980
What's your number?

293
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,340
Let me.

294
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,220
Are you tired?

295
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,220
I'm okay.

296
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,740
Come here.

297
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,780
To be honest,

298
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,980
when you work seriously,

299
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,060
you look pretty good.

300
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,060
I'll tell you a secret.

301
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,660
The only reason I brought you here

302
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,220
is to show you
how impressively cool I am

303
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,780
and to let you admire me.

304
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,980
Impressively cool.

305
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Did you make that up?

306
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,660
Yeah.

307
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,780
Let's go.

308
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,620
Sure.

309
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,980
(What are you mad at?)

310
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,220
(At not letting go?)

311
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,260
(At feeling unworthy?)

312
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,700
(Or at believing)

313
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,360
(that we might get back together?)

314
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,220

Where's Warm as Jade?

325
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,180
I came to find him to team up
for a mission.

326
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,660
He hasn't logged in for days.

327
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,820
Are you guys okay?

328
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,800
I told you not to contact me,

329
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,160
and you did.

330
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,620

Wen Cheng.

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,420
Your coffee.

335
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,540
Thanks.

336
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,700
Here's the data I found
for today's show.

337
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,540
Take a look.

338
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,460
Just leave it here.

339
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
I stayed up late last night for this.

340
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,970
Thanks, I'll check it out later.

341
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,530
I don't need anything else now.

342
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,460
You go back to work.

343
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,740
How's it going with your crush?

344
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,740
Any progress?

345
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,980
He's so distant.

346
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,960
It's the first time a guy shows me

347
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,080
zero interest.

348
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,180
Then just give up.

349
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
No way.

350
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,700
You're being stubborn,

351
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,480
maybe because you can't get him.

352
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,820
You just don't want to accept it.

353
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,300
That's not true.

354
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,740
I've never cared about anyone
like this before.

355
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,420
It's not just because of that.

356
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,700
Wen Cheng

357
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,880
must have feelings for me too.

358
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,500
But

359
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,640
he hasn't realized it yet.

360
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,460
You must have a thing for me,

361
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,580
but how am I supposed

362
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,240
to get you to chase after me?

363
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,260
Today,

364
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,350
you didn't invite me
just for a drink, right?

365
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,180
You should've heard
about the similar idea.

366
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
To me,

367
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,700
it's not about what's fair.

368
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,340
Whether it's plagiarism

369
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,580
is not the point.

370
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,940
Of course,

371
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,100
whoever gets the edge first
wins in business.

372
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,640
Only the results matter.

373
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,220
The process is irrelevant.

374
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
Why did you step in personally?

375
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,300
You know

376
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,860
I won't go easy on you

377
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,020
just because of your father.

378
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,540
I surely don't expect that.

379
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,900
I want another chance
to submit a proposal.

380
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,180
For Su Wen,

381
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,380
you'll owe me

382
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,940
a favor this time.

383
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,740
We will investigate this matter.

384
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,940
If your company

385
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,500
publicly announces

386
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,820
that you offer fair competition,

387
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,860
it won't just boost your reputation

388
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,140
but also show everyone

389
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,820
your respect for ideas.

390
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,340
Alright.

391
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,700
Straight to the point.

392
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,820
Anyway, I won't lose anything.

393
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,940
Like father, like son.

394
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,420
I've heard you're better
than your brother

395
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,100
for business succession.

396
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,260
Indeed impressive.

397
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,140
Does that mean you agreed?

398
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,820
I'll surely deliver a better proposal.

399
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,420
That depends on our internal decision.

400
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,540
As I always say,

401
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,740
I won't give you a pass

402
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,360
because of our relationship.

403
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,270
Here.

404
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,380
Agreed.

405
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,220
Good.

406
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,180
This is called Rainbow After the Rain.

407
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,290
This one is Sunset.

408
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,500
I took over 1,000 shots to get these.

409
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,820
They're surely worth buying.

410
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,540
Thanks.

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,540

Sir, is taking photos fun?

Let me tell you.

435
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,940
Photography can freeze time

436
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
and memories.

437
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,980
You don't believe me?

438
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,420
Just think about it.

439
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,580
If one day,

440
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,780
you forget certain people or events,

441
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,100
photos will remind you of them, right?

442
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,620
You can even share your passion

443
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,860

in the world.

444
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,580

445
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,580
Isn't that how time

449

I remember you telling me:

450
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,560
Young people shouldn't just have dreams;

451
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,720
they should have goals.

452
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,060
So, I think

453
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,660
as long as I set clear goals for myself

454
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,140

Xiduomeng Tea

466
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,980

467

468
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,340

469
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,380
forget about the overtime.

If this project succeeds,

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,880
I'd be fine sleeping
at the company for a week.

472
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,820
Exactly.

473
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,100
I don't believe we'll lose again

474
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,580
after one more try.

475
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,420
That's right.

476
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,500
Now, our top priority

477
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,780
is to redefine our theme.

478
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
Any ideas?

479
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,380
I think

480
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,980
we should change our perspective.

481
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,580
We shouldn't just consider
what the manufacturer likes.

482
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,180
We should focus
on the market positioning

483
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,500
of Xiduomeng Tea

484
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,740
and think about what it truly needs.

485
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,260
Exactly.

486
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,630
Got it.

487
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,510
We could invite

488
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,460
a popular idol trainee to endorse it.

489
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,420
But I think the endorsement part

490
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,940
can be handled by Xiduomeng themselves.

491
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,220
We should focus
on something Su Wen can do.

492
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,420
How about we get

493
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,560
more young people involved?

494
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,920
I think that's a good idea.

495
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,620
The target age for Xiduomeng

496
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,140
is roughly between 18 and 24.

497
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,460
These buyers

498
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,020
prefer mostly creative

499
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,300
and high-quality visuals.

500
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,980
So, I think

501
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,580
we should bring in some college students

502
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,980
to hear their thoughts.

503
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,100
If Su Wen knew so many people

504
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,600
were working together for his project,

505
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,660
he'd be really touched.

506
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,260
Where is he?

507
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,460
He's not answering calls or messages.

508
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,860
Find him asap.

509
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,040
Leaving him alone
will only trap him in dead ends.

510
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,020
Got it.

511
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,620
Mrs. Jiang,

512
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,380
they're planning to get married.

513
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,010
I want to set the wedding date
for June next year.

514
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,660
First, there's enough time to prepare.

515
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,500
Second, the season seems just right.

516
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,540
What do you think?

517
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,900
Sounds good to me.

518
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,260
But

519
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,940
will you feel

520
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,500
like it's too long to wait?

521
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,350
Aunt,

522
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,940
Yaozu just came back
from Columbia Business School,

523
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,340
ready to take over the family business.

524
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
This year will keep him quite busy.

525
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,580
We both think

526
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,580
it's fine to take more time to prepare.

527
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,980
Yaozu, what kind of business
does your family run?

528
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,900
Mainly in film and entertainment.

529
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,820
Yaohua Entertainment,
which went public this March,

530
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,460
is one of our family's ventures.

531
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,980
That's impressive.

532
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,220
Look at how lucky you are.

533
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,020
Your son-in-law is truly a young talent.

534
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,940
Anlan founded Ruishi.

535
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,500
It's also doing quite well.

536
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,460
However,

537
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,140
his girlfriend

538
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,740
is a bit plain.

539
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,860
Dating is fine,

540
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,420
but marriage needs more thought.

541
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,380
Look at Mengmeng and Yaozu.

542
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,780
They're a perfect match.

543
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,020
Actually, I've met that girl.

544
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,860
I think she's good.

545
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,780
She's also quite pretty.

546
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,060
In today's world,

547
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,440
who really cares
about matching backgrounds?

548
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,820
Mrs. Jiang,

549
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,580
no matter the era,

550
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,740
girls dreaming of rising high

551
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,940

552
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,500
Who knows if they're genuine?

553
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,380
Aunt, I think
you should help Anlan with this.

554
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,100
Get to know his girlfriend better.

555
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,260
Yeah.

556
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,540
It's best to learn more

557
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,980
about her family background.

558
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,140
Maybe you'll uncover something.

559
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,420
Mom, what brings you here today?

560
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,540
Ancheng,

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,340
have you met Anlan's girlfriend?

562
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,260
How did they meet?

563
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,740
Did she know about his money

564
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,100
before they met?

565
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,500
Or did she find out afterward?

566
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,180
Mom,

567
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,300
what are you trying to say?

568
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,700
Your brother basically has
zero dating experience.

569
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,300
So, I just want to know

570
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,580
what kind of girl he's dating.

571
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,780
Are you worried

572
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,060
that Yao Yuan is with Anlan for money?

573
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Do you know

574
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,220
about Yao Yuan's family situation?

575
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,380
From what I know,

576
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,060
her parents have passed away.

577
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,340
If you dig deeper, her uncle

578
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,180
is actually a bit concerning.

579
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,700
Her uncle?

580
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,720
Last time at Anlan's company,

581
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,180
I saw him trying to borrow money
from Anlan to open a diner.

582
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,380
Anlan wasn't there,
so I lent him the money.

583
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,820
Later, the diner still didn't do well.

584
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,580
I heard Anlan helped him quite a bit.

585
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,460
They just started dating,

586
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,860
and now he's borrowing money.

587
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,060
If they get married,

588
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,620
won't they treat Anlan

589
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,020
like their personal ATM?

590
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,660
Ancheng, as you know,

591
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,100
your dad has high hopes for Anlan.

592
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,900
If he dates

593
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,580
such a girlfriend,

594
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,100
he might upset your dad.

595
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,820
Ancheng, help your brother.

596
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,060
Mom, what do you want me to do?

597
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,420
I want you to look

598
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,100
into Yao Yuan's family background.

599
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,380
If those two get married,

600
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,940
and something happens to her family,

601
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,860
Anlan wouldn't just stand by

602
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,540
based on his personality.

603
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,020
So as a mother,

604
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,540
I have to look out for him,

605
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,900
lest he marry someone

606
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,620
and end up supporting her family.

607
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,630
Sure.

608
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,800
(Celebrity Insights)
A viewer asked me

609
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,100
if dating a lot

610
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,820
can make someone a love expert like me,

611
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,300
able to handle emotional issues.

612
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,980
That doesn't always make you
a love expert.

613
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,540
Sometimes, it turns you into a player.

614
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,980
Actually,

615
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,420
I've lately realized something true.

616
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,740
It's easy to talk
about other people's relationships,

617
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,820
but your own love life

618
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,300
feels so much harder.

619
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,900
Carefree dating is surely easy.

620
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,580
No matter how much you understand

621
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,900
or how many strategies you know,

622
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,900
you still tread carefully
around someone you like.

623
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,660
There will always be moments

624
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,380
when you don't know what to do.

625
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,020
You wonder why

626
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,180
you can't get close
because of your edges,

627
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,820
even though you both

628
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,660
like each other.

629
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,180
You ask yourself:

630
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,220
If they like you back...

631
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,740
What are you staring at?

632
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,940
Why can't they understand you?

633
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,660
Wen Cheng is so different today.

634
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,500
Actually,

635
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,060
to meet someone you like

636
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,740
among so many strangers...

637
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,340
How's it going?

638
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,500
How's the click-through rate?

639
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,340
It's surged.

640
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,860
The discussion volume is
five times higher than usual.

641
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,600
Some even asked if Wen Cheng is single.

642
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,340
You'd want to cherish that.

643
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Not bad.

644
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
Taking him down a sentimental path

645
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,260
is quite fresh.

646
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,180
You two argue and struggle,

647
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,880
sometimes wanting to give up,

648
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,740
but you just can't let go.

649
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,940
Who knows who you're talking about?

650
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,980
It might be for the show.

651
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,140
You really miss her

652
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,380
and those happy moments together.

653
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,860
A low voice.

654
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,900
Eyes filled with deep affection.

655
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,260
Plus that warm, caring vibe.

656
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,460
Wen Cheng is so charming.

657
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,600
Any ideas?

658
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,960
My head hurts.

659
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,450
Nope.

660
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,980
What do you think about this?

661
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,220
Hello?

662
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,060
Sure.

663
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,980
Got it.

664
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,080
Let's take a short break.

665
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,700
I'm stepping out for some fresh air.

666
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,380
Dear.

667
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,620
Sit tight.

668
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,380
Your boss

669
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,300
will give you an exclusive benefit.

670
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,180
What is it?

671
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,780
My family's exclusive secret technique.

672
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,460
Just enjoy.

673
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,320
You must be exhausted.

674
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,900
Your neck's way too stiff.

675
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,380
Well.

676
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,580
Your creditor has seen

677
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,900
you wear yourself out

678
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
under so much pressure,

679
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,940
and he feels bad about it.

680
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,980
Honestly, all my hard work

681
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,900
is because of you.

682
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,540
I used to think that someone

683
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,540
born with a silver spoon like you

684
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,300
would have it easier than everyone else,

685
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,600
and that you wouldn't have
to do anything

686
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,580
and could get what others

687
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,700
spend their lives chasing.

688
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,420
But after meeting you, I realized,

689
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,500
actually,

690
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,580
you have to work

691
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,700
a lot harder than others.

692
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,660
Well.

693
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,300
That only works if your IQ is higher.

694
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,860
So, I truly realized

695
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,380
that to succeed,

696
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,260
it's not just about a bit of luck.

697
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,180
You have to work

698
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,660
really hard.

699
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,420
Dear,

700
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,640
I'll surely work my hardest for you.

701
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,800
Hello?

702
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,060
Yao,

703
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,660
we're still waiting to discuss things.

704
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,660
Where are you?

705
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,980
Well.

706
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,940
I'm buying some late-night snacks.

707
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,780
I'll be right back.

708
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,660
You've worked hard. Have some snacks.

709
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,300
Wow, finally here.

710
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,180
I was starving.

711
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,540
Come on.

712
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,300
Slow down; take it out before you eat.

713
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,740
Oh, my gosh.

714
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,620
Yao.

715
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,060
What took you so long?

716
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,580
The master was probably trying

717
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,580
to use this time to sneak in a date.

718
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,740
I know.

719
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,900
You two surely

720
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,740
were sneaking a midnight snack.

721
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,820
Look, Yao's lipstick is almost gone.

722
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,220
Yeah.

723
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,460
Four shrimps left.

724
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,060
Two squids left.

725
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,000
Almost finished anyway.

726
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,340
Oh, right.

727
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,120
Hurry up and eat.

728
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,180
Fill your mouth with food.

729
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,020
Hurry up and eat.

730
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,620
Eat up, everyone.

731
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,860
Your work deserves this.

732
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,900
- Eat up.
- Eat some?

733
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,020
I'm going to have a shrimp.

734
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,700
Eat more.

735
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,040
- We're leaving.
- Goodbye.

736
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,080
- Sure.
- Bye-bye.

737
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,540
Zhang He.

738
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,660
Jianing.

739
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
How about we go together?

740
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,060
No, thanks. Someone's picking me up.

741
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,980
Oh.

742
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,740
Ancheng.

743
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,260
Do you want to come with us?

744
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,780
I'll ask Ancheng to give you a ride.

745
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,920
No, thanks, I'll take the bus.

746
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,830
Go ahead.

747
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,820
Okay, see you tomorrow.

748
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,740
Alright, bye.

749
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,900
Are you tired?

750
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,500
Yeah.

751
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,060
But I also feel good.

752
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,080
Feeling good from tiredness?

753
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,660
Yeah.

754
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,380
I used to dread work
the moment I thought about it.

755
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,620
But I never expected

756
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,360
that a little hardship would make
midnight snacks taste even better.

757
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,750
Plus, spending money
I earned myself feels amazing.

758
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,760
Also,

759
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,620
the feeling of everyone
working late together

760
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,860
is just like back in school,

761
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,420
rushing projects with classmates.

762
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,140
Everyone is pushing hard together.

763
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,700
That kind of energy is just awesome.

764
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,380
Jianing,

765
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,900
you've grown up.

766
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,020
Ancheng,

767
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,700
I feel like I'm amazing now.

768
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,740
I'm unlocking new skills every day.

769
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,540
Looks like you really love this job.

770
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,860
Yeah.

771
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,820
This is the first time in my life

772
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,500
that I've felt this inner spark ignite.

773
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,980
It's like I'm supercharged.

774
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,320
With all the challenges I've overcome,

775
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,940
I might soon become

776
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,380
Anlan's right-hand.

777
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,860
By then,

778
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
maybe even Li Ao won't have a job.

779
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,140
Jianing, we're here.

780
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,860
Jianing?

781
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,420

797
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,620
You should eat more.

798
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,500
It's not working.

799
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,780
Xinran, take a break.

800
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,060
Isn't this your favorite kebab?

801
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,900
I have no appetite. You go ahead.

802
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,820
But you had no appetite
yesterday either.

803
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,460
Can you at least eat a little?

804
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,540
You'll get weak if you keep this up.

805
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,220
You eat. I'll go to the bathroom.

806
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,620
This is more

807
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,540
than just being in a bad mood.

808
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,420
It's heartbreak.

809
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,740
She hasn't eaten for days.

810
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,660
When I ask her,

811
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,940
she just says she's dieting.

812
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,700
This situation

813
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,300
is exactly like when she broke up

814
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,820
with Zhuang Wei before.

815
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,220
Wen Cheng.

816
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,780
Not your taste?

817
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,300
I have other options here.

818
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,290
Thanks, but I'm good.

819
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,780
You haven't eaten much these days.

820
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,880
You've lost a lot of weight.

821
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,300
You'll lose fans like this.

822
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,480
You really don't need to worry
about such trifles for me.

823
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,860
Then I'll leave this here.

824
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,380
At least eat a little.

825
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,300
You can eat it.

826
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,180
Wen Cheng seems so upset.

827
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,660
It has to be because of Yao Xinran.

828
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,580
Hello, who are you looking for?

829
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,460
Hello, is this Xinran?

830
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,900
I'm Yuting.

831
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,860
Yuting?

832
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,700
Put her on speaker.

833
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,480
Are you free right now?

834
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,800
Let's meet up and talk.

835
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,780
What do we have to talk about?

836
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,740
Little girl,

837
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,580
I'm agreeing on Xinran's behalf.

838
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,700
Who are you?

839
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,180
I didn't expect Xinran to need

840
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,660
someone else to agree for her.

841
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,220
Stop wasting time; send us the address.

842
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,260
Can't you let Xinran say it herself?

843
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,560
We're just going to talk.

844
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,860
No need to worry.

845
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,140
Just send me the address.

846
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,820
That girl's almost all over you,

847
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,290
and you're not fighting back?

848
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,900
This situation

849
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,580
could affect your future with Wen Cheng.

850
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,580
You have to go.

851
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,960
Even if it means laying everything out,

852
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,120
you need to know the truth.

853
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,540
Also, you care so much.

854
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,180
No need to keep pretending.

855
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,900
Go ask her

856
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,420
what she really thinks.

857
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,900
Xinran,

858
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,900
what do you want from Wen Cheng?

859
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,660
Is this about you or him?

860
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,140
I just can't stand it.

861
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,460
She's actually pretty cute.

862
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,860
