Remember.

You are the greatest pride of my life.

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,420
The last time we rode horses

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,940
feels like so long ago.

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,020
After I move out,

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,300
I'm not sure if there's another chance.

39
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,380
Who said that?

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,940
I moved out ages ago.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,260
Even if we live apart,
we're still family.

42
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,060
We can find time to meet up.

43
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,700
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,300
To become General Manager,

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,700
I hurt a lot of people.

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,340
I told you, no more apologies.

47
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,540
What's done is done.

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,590
Now that you're not General Manager.

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,010
You can finally be yourself.

50
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,620
I hope from now on,

51
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,700
you'll think things through
before acting.

52
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,740
When you get serious,

53
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,780
you'll definitely beat me.

54
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,300
Anlan,

55
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,580
could you help me

56
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,020
set up a meeting with Yao Yuan?

57
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,020
Darling.

58
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,500
You're back.

59
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,380
Someone joined us today.

60
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,260
- Ancheng.
- Yao Yuan.

61
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,580
I'm here to apologize to you.

62
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,780
That old funding withdrawal case.

63
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,500
I lost my way,

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,900
made a wrong judgment,

65
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,020
and caused so much trouble in your life.

66
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,780
I really regret it.

67
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,100
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,900
Actually, I've been trying

69
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,020
not to dwell on

70
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,460
the past.

71
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,580
We still have to look forward.

72
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,460
Plus,

73
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,220
you're Anlan's brother.

74
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,460
Don't worry.

75
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,140
I'll treat you with sincerity.

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,740
Thank you.

77
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,380
Now I finally understand

78
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,500
why you're so set on her.

79
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,060
I used to think

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,260
having a brother like you

81
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,420
was a burden and pressure.

82
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,100
But now I realize

83
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,340
being your brother

84
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,780
is my good fortune.

85
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,340
Just wait until
you eat Yao Yuan's cooking.

86
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,260
You'll change your mind.

87
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,020
Have a seat, Ancheng.

88
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,060
I'll get an extra bowl and chopsticks.

89
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,750
Did she make all this?

90
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,590
Mm.

91
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,940
Me and Dawn and Dusk

92
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,140
aren't just online friends.

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,500
We're real friends.

94
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,380
Stop joking.

95
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,300
I told you online scams are increasing,

96
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,500
yet you're diving in deeper.

97
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,340
Should I investigate for you first?

98
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,700
Right.
This needs a proper investigation.

99
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,340
Cui Xi fooled you badly last time.

100
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,780
Who's to say this isn't another one?

101
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,460
Wait.

102
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,460
We even don't know
if it's male or female.

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,900
This time,

104
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,540
it's definitely a copy of
Lord of All and For Thy Sake.

105
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,420
That familiar feeling

106
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,580
must come from real life.

107
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,740
Just give me a chance

108
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,020
to prove I'm right.

109
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,100
Okay?

110
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,060
If you really see me as a buddy,

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,060
then help me organize a meetup.

112
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,060
Please.

113
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,620
Just give me a chance

114
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,970
to prove I'm right.

115
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,100
Okay?

116
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,580
Why don't you meet her yourself

117
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,700
instead of dragging us along?

118
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,100
He's probably afraid of a bad match.

119
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,180
And we'll bail him out to escape.

120
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,260
Makes sense.

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,100
Li Ao, let's help him.

122
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,080
I kinda want to see Su Wen
make a fool of himself.

123
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,340
You're really getting married.

124
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,180
Then I'll be all alone here.

125
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,620
At least you have Wen Cheng.

126
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm the one truly alone.

127
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,940
I think my future boyfriend

128
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,220
must be terrible with directions.

129
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,500
He still hasn't found me yet.

130
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,540
If I meet someone good later,

131
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll introduce him to you.

132
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,460
Don't worry.

133
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,300
No, no. I accept my fate.

134
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,540
Right now,
I just want to enjoy my single life.

135
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,020
Oh my god, am I hearing right?

136
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,620
Aren't you always wanting to date?

137
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,180
Could it be...

138
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,420
You still can't let go of Ancheng?

139
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,570
No, I just

140
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,220
want to be alone.

141
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,580
What's this number?

142
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,820
Ah, I know what I'm saying.

143
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,300
I just want to
focus on myself right now.

144
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,780
I was too eager to be in love before.

145
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,300
Once I found a good match,
I rushed everything.

146
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,940
But all failed in the end.

147
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,900
Now, I've figured it out.

148
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,060
I'm not bad.

149
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,220
I'd rather use the time for dating

150
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,180
to enrich myself.

151
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,620
Read more books.

152
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,820
Learn new skills.

153
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,660
Travel.

154
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,780
Or when I feel lonely,

155
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,100
get a cat or a dog.

156
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,220
That's more reliable than
finding a man to take care of you.

157
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,500
Xiaoya,

158
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,700
you're glowing now.

159
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,540
I totally agree with you.

160
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,460
Once you become better

161
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
and more confident,

162
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,020
someone better
will surely come your way.

163
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,930
Ah, okay, stop, don't talk about me.

164
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,460
Today, you're the star.

165
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,740
Did you do pre-wedding

166
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,340
psychological preparation?

167
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,140
Psychological preparation?

168
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,300
Why do I need it?

169
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,780
From love to marriage is a big hurdle.

170
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,180
Many newlyweds complain that

171
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,620
their partner is very different
before and after marriage.

172
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,900
Nothing like they imagined.

173
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,660
Huge difference?

174
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,380
I've heard that too.

175
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,020
Men are totally different
before and after marriage.

176
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,940
You must have imagined

177
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,540
what's life with Jiang Anlan post-marriage?

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,380
Darling, I'm home.

179
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,540
Go wash up, dinner's ready.

180
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,860
Darling, you've worked hard.

181
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,580
By your look.

182
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,180
Totally thinking about
your honeymoon, huh?

183
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,850
But reality is different.

184
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,410
After you've been married a while,
you'll see

185
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,260
the saying
"Marriage is the tomb of love"

186
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,820
really makes sense.

187
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,420
Sounds like you've been married.

188
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,980
We haven't married,

189
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,740
but we've seen and heard about

190
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,820
many graves.

191
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,620
Don't believe me? Go to the street now.

192
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,740
Just pick any woman married
for three years.

193
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,940
Ask them about their husbands

194
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,100
before and after marriage.

195
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
She'll definitely complain to you
for days.

196
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,300
So, according to you,

197
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,340
what's the difference

198
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,980
between before and after marriage?

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,420
Let's put it this way.

200
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,380
A man before dating

201
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,780
can pretend to be perfect.

202
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,220
After marriage,
he can revert to their true selves.

203
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,860
Some men, after marriage,

204
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,380
put all their energy into

205
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,340
friends and work

206
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,180
and neglect you.

207
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,300
They find you annoying

208
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,340
and don't even want to talk to you
at home.

209
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,540
You're back.

210
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,940
Have some fruit.

211
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,780
Mm.

212
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
Still busy?

213
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,740
Darling.

214
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,260
You said you'd come to the movies
with me tonight.

215
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,110
I'm busy, go alone.

216
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,460
Then I'll wait for you.

217
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,530
Don't wait. I said I'm busy.

218
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,900
The house is huge.
Do you have to stand right here?

219
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,540
How can I focus on work with you here?

220
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,820
Before marriage,
a man never takes his eyes off you.

221
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,250
After marriage, he finds you annoying.

222
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
By then,

223
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,740
you'll regret it too late.

224
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,340
Alright, enough teasing.
Look how scared you are.

225
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,860
Saying this makes me marriage-phobic.

226
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,020
You two scared me.

227
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,860
Honestly,
I don't think you need to worry.

228
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,060
Actually, only some men act like that.

229
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,900
Anlan is different.

230
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,380
Look how much effort he put in chasing you.

231
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,180
After marriage,
you two will be so happy together.

232
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,620
Exactly.

233
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,780
A man like Ace who's true to you

234
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,470
and wants to marry you

235
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,260
is rarer than a national treasure.

236
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,540
Speaking of which.

237
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,860
Ace with such good qualifications

238
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,540
must have many girls chasing him.

239
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,540
You have to be careful.

240
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,180
Alright, stop scaring her.

241
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,260
Marriage requires loyalty and trust,

242
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,380
doesn't it?

243
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
Yes.

244
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,500
But, there's always a "what if".

245
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm just saying "what if".

246
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,820
If he really hurts you,

247
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,100
we'll never let him off.

248
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,940
Exactly.

249
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,980
Alright, happy wedding!

250
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,780
Happy wedding!

251
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,020
Happy wedding.

252
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,340
Hello, Mrs. Jiang.

253
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,580
Ms. Yao, what brings you here?

254
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,500
I brought lunch for Anlan.

255
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,580
Is he inside?

256
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,460
Wait, Ms. Yao.

257
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,540
Master has gone out to eat.

258
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,060
Gone out to eat?

259
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,900
Ah, yes.

260
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,770
I'll call him.

261
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,660
What do you want to eat?

262
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,500
Whatever.

263
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,300
Anything is fine?

264
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,140
Dear, why are you here?

265
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,740
Not Anlan's style.

266
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,900
Stop overthinking it.

267
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,020
(Is this what pre-wedding anxiety
feels like?)

268
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
Hey, Ms. Yao.

269
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,340
You… why are you here?

270
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,460
I brought lunch for Anlan.

271
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,660
Is he here?

272
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,300
Master just went out for a meal.

273
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,980
Went out for a meal.

274
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,060
Then I'll head back first.

275
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,060
Darling, what brings you here?

276
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,340
This is for me?

277
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,340
Thanks, darling.

278
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,270
Let's go to my office.

279
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,460
(Ruishi Investment Adviser)

280
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,700
Didn't you just eat?

281
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,100
Food made by my wife

282
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
deserves another stomach.

283
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,340
I have to eat it all.

284
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,500
(I was overthinking it)

285
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,380
Boss.

286
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,410
Come in.

287
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,740
Here's the report
you asked me to prepare.

288
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,060
Thanks for your hard work.

289
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,940
Who is she?

290
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,180
A new accountant.

291
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,220
Does she have a boyfriend?

292
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,940
What's wrong?

293
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,540
Just wondering. It's nothing.

294
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,980
Be good.

295
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,140
Confess and you'll be forgiven.

296
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,460
Well, actually.

297
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,900
I had a dream last night.

298
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,380
In the dream,

299
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,900
I brought you food at the company.

300
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
But all your colleagues

301
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,740
gave me weird looks.

302
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,660
Actually,

303
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,980
you were flirting with
a female colleague.

304
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,220
But most importantly,
when I came to the company today,

305
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,140
it felt

306
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,780
exactly like the dream.

307
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,380
Your colleagues looked at me
strangely too.

308
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,910
You know what. That girl just now.

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,980
Her back looks just like

310
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,940
the one

311
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,330
in my dream.

312
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,660
Hey, I wish I hadn't told you.

313
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,140
Darling.

314
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,020
You're just too adorable.

315
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,380
Are you laughing at me?

316
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,940
I'm laughing because I'm happy.

317
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,900
Happy about what?

318
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,900
Darling.

319
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
You know

320
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,140
why they might have looked unpleasant?

321
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,260
It's because I just scolded them.

322
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,900
As for that new accountant,

323
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,620
she's already married,

324
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,260
and she's a mother of three kids.

325
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,500
Dreams are always the opposite.

326
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,240
So you can't trust them.

327
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,260
Hello?

328
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
Okay.

329
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,740
Darling.

330
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,130
I have a last-minute meeting tonight.

332
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,340
I can't spend time with you.

333
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,980
Alright, it's fine.

334
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,580
Mm.

335
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,220
You look pretty good.

336
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,540
I didn't sleep all night.

337
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,220
All night?

338
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,260
He played Shengshi all night.

339
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,020
Seriously?

340
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Wanna join Tianxia Gang?

341
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,150
I can't stand you bullying others
with power.

342
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,900
You stole my gang members yesterday.

343
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,140
Today, we're taking them back.

344
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,940
You immature kids.

345
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,140
Only know how to shout.

346
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,820
Watch me wipe you out today.

347
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,700
I heard they got a new master recently.

348
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,780
Quite powerful.

349
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,100
We need to be careful.

350
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,660
Just a new player.

351
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
What's there to fear?

352
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,500
Anyone is the same.

353
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
♪We'll never allow it♪

354
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,340
♪Now, let's all unite♪

355
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,230
♪Now, we won't give up♪

356
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,310
♪Show the villains what we're made of♪

357
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,010
♪Even if you're a superhero♪

358
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,580
How can game bandits be so arrogant?

359
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,380
No one can stop them?

360
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,940
Male or female account?

361
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,740
Of course I am...

362
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,940
Should I tell the truth or lie?

363
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,300
Either is fine.

364
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,420
Do as you like in the game.

365
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,740
Gender doesn't matter.

366
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,180
What matters is

367
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,280
you must remember my name
before you die.

368
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,740
My name is

369
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,220
Ice Cream Cookie.

370
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,100
I'm speechless.

371
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,980
My mom's been calling me
every day lately.

372
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,820
Asked me to eat together.

373
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,660
Aunt misses you.

374
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,180
She misses you too.

375
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,380
Grab dinner when you're free.

376
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,700
I will.

377
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,380
I could come too.

378
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,900
I'm an expert at mooching meals.

379
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,980
By the way, Ancheng.

380
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,300
How's the new company?

381
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,780
If you need help, just say the word.

382
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,260
Don't worry.

383
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,340
I'm very confident.

384
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,020
We'll definitely surpass Ruishi soon.

385
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,100
Congratulations.

386
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,860
Stay tuned.

387
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,700
Alright.

388
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,060
Anlan.

389
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,660
I have something to discuss with you.

390
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,540
Job hopping?

391
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,260
Hey.

392
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,900
How do you know?

393
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
It's a crucial time for
Ancheng's startup.

394
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,940
I want to be there with him.

395
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,700
Congrats again.

396
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,580
You've managed to
poach a top player from me.

397
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,980
However,

398
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,110
no returns accepted.

399
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,180
Anlan, what do you mean?

400
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,860
Absolutely no returns.

401
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,910
Here.

402
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,700
Anlan.

403
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,380
She's back.

404
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,540
Did you find her?

405
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,900
No.

406
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,100
Since we posted
the meetup notice worldwide,

407
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,340
the sign-ups exploded.

408
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,460
But no one is Dawn and Dusk.

409
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,410
I've decided to reply that we're full.

410
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,060
Is it this one?

411
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,940
(Shengshi Forum)

412
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,320
Look, same name.

413
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
She's also a newbie.

414
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,460
It can't be her.

415
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,140
Dawn and Dusk told me

416
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,660
her body fat percentage is really low.

417
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,580
I even trained for an eight-pack.

418
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,310
Everything she says is true?

419
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,020
If I got three eyes, you buy that?

420
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,260
It might be her.

421
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,940
(Fashion Princess)
She posted on Weibo three days ago,

422
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,220
saying a male netizen

423
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,500
saved the girl.

424
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,140
They even went to Ziyun Mountain.

425
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,930
It can't be her.

426
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,140
Mr. Su.

427
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,300
I've never seen this person

428
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,180
in the newbie group.

429
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,780
Are you just imagining things?

430
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,260
Kid.

431
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,100
No way.

432
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,900
Keep looking.

433
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,220
Keep searching.

434
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,580
Alright.

435
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,300
Where did you go?

436
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,500
Why didn't you bring me along?

437
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,260
Not even a single message.

438
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,060
Don't think about it.

439
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,500
I heard that

440
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,860
men are most likely to slip up
before marriage.

441
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,260
Because the cost of messing up
after marriage is too high.

442
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,980
(Lord of All)

443
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,420
Yuan.

444
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,780
Did you check Moments?

445
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,380
Anlan posted a photo
with a beautiful woman.

446
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,100
(Jiang Anlan: It's been a while.
Your smile is still bright.)

447
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,500
If he posted it,

448
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,180
it should be fine.

449
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,620
Right?

450
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,660
I'll call and ask for you.

451
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,510
Have you seen the photos Anlan posted?

452
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,380
Who is that woman?

453
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,220
Do you know her?

454
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,620
I just asked Li Ao.

455
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,460
None of us know her.

456
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,780
You're best friends.

457
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,660
You don't know her?

458
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Don't lie to me.

459
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,740
If you lie, then you're done.

460
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
I really don't know her,

461
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,100
Fairy.

462
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,260
I swear.

463
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,060
Alright then.

464
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,660
Stop thinking.
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

465
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,220
Why are you so serious?

466
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,460
You might scare her.

467
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,700
Oh, right.

468
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,380
We should

469
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,220
pretend to chat.

470
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,260
Haven't had such a scene in a while.

471
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,060
Su Wen is really obsessed.

472
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,360
So what if he's obsessed?

473
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,880
What's it to me?

474
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,970
Why do I have to come to this?

475
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,700
You have experience.

476
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,380
Successful experience at that.

477
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,300
You can be the mascot.

478
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,780
Why not

479
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,620
ask him now?

480
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,980
Who's the woman in the photo?

481
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,420
Here, over here.

482
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,740
Seems not her.

483
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,460
Do you think Dawn and Dusk

484
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,220
might already be

485
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,140
watching us from the shadows?

486
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,940
Take it slow.

487
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,300
But she said she'd call me

488
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
when she arrived.

489
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,060
No calls for me yet.

490
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,820
Who is

491
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,100
Admiration?

492
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,420
Hello, Admiration.

493
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,700
I'm Dawn and Dusk's

494
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,540
friend.

495
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,180
Oh.

496
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,580
Dawn and Dusk had an emergency.

497
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,900
She asked me to apologize in person.

498
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,740
She'll contact you again.

499
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

500
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,100
That was a lot to take in.

501
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,660
You got stood up.

502
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,340
This girl is stringing you along.

503
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,980
I think she's not simple.

504
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,180
But somehow I feel like

505
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,900
this trick seems kind of familiar.

506
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,140
Boss used this move before.

507
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,690
But Anlan showed up back then.

508
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,140
Could she be

509
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,160
arriving late?

510
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,940
No way.

511
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,530
Because classics

512
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,720
can't be surpassed.

513
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,060
Darling.

514
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,820
Why are you so quiet?

515
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,060
Not feeling well?

516
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,580
What's wrong? You can tell me.

517
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,140
I want to go to the restroom.

518
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,340
Go ahead.

519
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,060
He already brought it up.

520
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,900
Why didn't you ask?

521
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,420
So many people around.

522
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,540
I'm too embarrassed.

523
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,380
Ask casually like it's nothing.

524
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,980
Say, who was that girl
in your Moments yesterday?

525
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,140
She looked pretty nice.

526
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,780
You might get something out of it.

527
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,060
I don't want to do that.

528
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,780
Make him think I'm suspicious.

529
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,060
Like I don't trust him.

530
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,860
But you can't

531
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,220
trust him unconditionally now.

532
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,020
Instead of being suspicious here,

533
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,240
it's better to be honest.

534
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,660
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

535
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,780
Women are really troublesome.

536
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,260
They won't marry men

537
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,100
with bad conditions.

538
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,780
But they feel insecure with

539
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,620
good-condition men.

540
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,620
You're just destined to be loved by Ace.

541
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,100
Accept it.

542
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,060
Never thought Master Su would face this day.

543
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,260
For this,

544
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,640
I have to give Dawn and Dusk a like.

545
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,980
What's good about her?

546
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,860
Why so eager to meet her?

547
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,500
It's just...

548
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,500
You know.

549
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,250
When you chat with her,

550
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,620
it feels so relaxed and easy.

551
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,140
No awkward silences.

552
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,660
I just feel

553
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,820
she must be
a rich and interesting woman.

554
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,740
You're just living in your imagination.

555
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,260
Maybe it's just
a beautiful misunderstanding.

556
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,980
Dawn and Dusk didn't come.

557
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,540
Maybe she's afraid to scare you.

558
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,780
Why can Jiang Anlan and Yao Yuan's love

559
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,940
grow in Shengshi?

560
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,180
But mine is a misunderstanding.

561
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,140
Why? That's not fair.

562
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,900
Boss already met Yuan.

563
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,660
They made their move

564
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,220
after planning everything.

565
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,420
Su Wen.

566
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,380
Don't invest too much.

567
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,860
Avoid being badly hit.

568
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,020
(Admiration)

569
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,700
Who's there?

570
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,180
It's me.

571
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,020
Dawn and Dusk.

572
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
Sorry about that.

573
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,420
Last-minute stuff came up.

574
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420
I couldn't make the meet.

575
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,340
You must be disappointed.

576
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,700
It'd be a lie to say I'm not.

577
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,020
But getting this call from you

578
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,940
has fully revived me.

579
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,300
Well,

580
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,460
we will meet up, right?

581
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,620
Of course.

582
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,260
Once I finish handling things,

583
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,100
I'll set a time.

584
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,180
Okay, I'll wait for you.

585
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,860
(Editing contact: Dawn and Dusk)

586
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,220
(Dawn and Dusk)

587
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,780
Ms. Yao.

588
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,620
Master went to a meeting.

589
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,800
Wait here for a while.

590
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,780
- Okay.
- I'll get busy now.

591
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,260
Yuan, did you check Moments?

592
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,990
Anlan posted a photo
with a beautiful woman.

593
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,540
There's coffee in this cup.

594
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
I made it myself for you.

595
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,380
You

596
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,420
don't do this for all employees, right?

597
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,740
Of course not.

598
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,940
Exclusive to you.

599
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,300
Thanks.

600
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,540
Ah, no problem.

601
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,900
Mm.

602
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,730
Is this coffee

603
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,740
for Mr. Jiang?

604
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,380
How do you know

605
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,300
it's for Anlan?

606
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,780
I recognize this cup.

607
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,060
Hello, may I ask

608
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,280
are you Anlan's...

609
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,850
You'll have to

610
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,420
ask him that.

611
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,380
He's always kept

612
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,020
our relationship low-key before.

613
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,420
(Before?)

614
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,340
(Did Anlan ever have a girlfriend?)

615
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,020
(Or maybe...)

616
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,140
(What exactly is their relationship?)

617
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,220
What's wrong with you?

618
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Could it be you have a crush on Anlan?

619
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,060
No, that's not it.

620
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,060
I'm his...

621
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,140
His what?

622
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,140
You... you're Yao Yuan?

623
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,100
Yes, I'm Yao Yuan.

624
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,580
Nice to meet you.

625
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,180
Finally, we meet.

626
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,140
Let me introduce myself.

627
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm Anlan's half-sister.

628
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,060
My name's Vicki.

629
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,140
Half-sister?

630
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,900
At last, I get to see the one

631
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,220
he's been missing.

632
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,700
You... you really are his

633
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,100
half-sister?

634
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,740
Why never heard him mention you?

635
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,460
Because

636
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,460
my sister has been in the US.

637
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,540
She just came back this time

638
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,940
and there's a lot to sort out.

639
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,900
No time to introduce you yet.

640
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,700
No wonder you're so protective.

641
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,100
Indeed.

642
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,300
She's very cute.

643
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,460
Of course, I have good taste.

644
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,820
Sorry.

645
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,780
I misunderstood.

646
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,980
I thought you guys...

647
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,820
Thought what?

648
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,060
Yuan probably thought

649
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,580
we were ambiguous.

650
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,380
She feared
you wouldn't hold back before marriage.

651
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,380
Because he never

652
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,220
posts other girls on Moments.

653
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,900
Now I get why you've been weird lately.

654
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,740
I finally get it.

655
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,140
Don't worry.

656
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,500
My eyes only see you.

657
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,420
Hello?

658
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,580
I feel like

659
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,460
I'm invisible.

660
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,980
You've been rushing around these days.

661
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,940
Hardly spent time with me.

662
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,340
Looks like your secret

663
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,260
can't be kept.

664
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,420
What secret?

665
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,060
Oh my god.

666
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,260
This is stunning.

667
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,660
Is this the surprise Ace gave you?

668
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,660
His sister is incredible.

669
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,530
She actually designed

670
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,930
an outfit exactly like in the game.

671
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,140
Vicki is beautiful

672
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,980
and talented.

673
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,620
Good thing she's Ace's sister.

674
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,900
Otherwise,

675
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,460
she'd be a serious rival for you.

676
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,300
Wrong.

677
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,780
I don't think anyone

678
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,580
can beat our Yao Yuan.

679
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,300
After all, Ace loves her the most.

680
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,020
Can you say
he doesn't care about you now?

681
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,780
No idea how many hearts
he's used up for you.

682
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,660
That was a misunderstanding.

683
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,900
A sweet misunderstanding?

684
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,900
Meeting the right person at the right time.

685
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,340
And being treated so well.

686
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,660
Apart from a princess in a fairy tale,

687
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,660
no one makes me more envious than you.

688
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,460
Hurry, let me catch some of your luck.

689
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,540
Me too.

690
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,100
No need, you already have Wen Cheng.

691
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,460
I'll just soak up your luck.

692
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,700
Am I misunderstanding?

693
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,900
Why do I feel like our outfits

694
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,860
only serve to highlight how handsome he is?

695
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,700
No misunderstanding.

696
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,940
Don't forget.

697
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,820
This is Lord of All's wedding attire.

698
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,220
Fine. When I get married,

699
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,580
I'll make you all my supporting roles.

700
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,980
That might be a long wait.

701
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,300
She's here.

702
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,620
Good thing it's broad daylight.

703
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,700
Or your shout scared me to bits.

704
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,300
Dawn and Dusk is here.

705
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,510
- Dawn and Dusk.
- She's shopping.

706
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,670
I asked if she wants

707
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,620
to say hi.

708
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,900
She said,

709
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,820
"Okay."

710
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,140
Dawn and Dusk is really is something.

711
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,700
She's here.

712
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,220
Anlan?

713
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,060
Vicki?

714
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,420
You two

715
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,780
are real siblings?

716
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,700
Same dad.

717
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,820
But different moms.

718
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,340
Half-siblings.

719
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,980
I never thought

720
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,940
you'd be good friends with him.

721
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,460
What a strange coincidence.

722
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,520
So Anlan's sister is Dawn and Dusk.

723
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,060
Looks like that's right.

724
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,860
Su Wen is so lucky.

725
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,020
Look how proud he is.

726
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,540
So

727
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,820
even if we didn't meet online,

728
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,700
we'd still know each other

729
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,260
through him in real life.

730
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,150
When you put it that way,

731
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,660
it really does make sense.

732
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,660
It really is destiny.

733
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,340
Me.

734
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,620
I'm

735
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,580
going to be your brother-in-law.

736
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,100
Anlan was so excited last night
he didn't sleep at all.

737
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,860
This is the most nervous moment of my life.

738
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,060
Anlan.

739
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,740
Today is your most important day.

740
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,020
Dad is proud of you.

741
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,620
From now on, you have to take responsibility.

742
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,100
For family and career.

743
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,260
Got it, Dad.

744
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,500
Anlan,

745
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,860
wishes you happiness.

746
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,340
Thanks, Ancheng.

747
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,940
- Mom.
- Anlan.

748
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,820
Anlan, with your qualities,

749
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,340
you could easily find someone better.

750
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,860
Wenqian, now's not the time to say that.

751
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,700
Why bring that up now?

752
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
Anlan.

753
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,990
You're right.

754
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,300
Your future depends on you now.

Such a wonderful girl.

759
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,420

Grandpa will teach you a trick.

768
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,940
If you let your mom
hold a grandchild sooner,

769
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,460
she won't have time to overthink things.

770
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,060
