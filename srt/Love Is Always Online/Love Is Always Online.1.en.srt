Art History seeks to explore

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,620

80
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,460
did the artist and his historical

81
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,780
and cultural context

82
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,020
interact to produce

83
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,740
these works we now see?

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,980
So, in your opinion,

85
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,380
with what kind of mood was Emperor Huizong

86
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,220
creating his works?

87
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,620
For Thy Sake,

88
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
I finally found you.

89
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,460
He ruled the world

90
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,130
and was capable of everything,

91
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,780
but his heart defies his scepter.

92
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,660
He couldn't run a country,

93
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,780
yet he became emperor.

94
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,180
He could paint,

95
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,220
but he wasn't allowed to just be a painter.

96
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,540
So tell me,

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,660
with what kind of mood
do you think he painted?

98
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,860
She'd have to be psychic to know that.

99
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Alright, I just want to tell you one thing.

100
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,920
Every viewer

101
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,820
perceives a work of art differently.

102
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,660
They live in different times,

103
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,980
take in different things,

104
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,980
and have unique perspectives.

105
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,260
So, of course they'll have their own take.

106
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,500
If you really want to know

107
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,420
what the artist was feeling

108
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,700
when they finished this painting,

109
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,900
you'd have to travel back to that time

110
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,420
and ask them yourself.

Let's go ask her.

115
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,060
Hey, Yao Yuan.

116
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,700
"Lord of All" didn't take you down.

117
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,340
And he didn't take down Baihua Hall either.

118
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,060
The man who dominates the server

119
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,580
kept chasing your old account like crazy.

120
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,820
He targeted you soon after you sold it.

121
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,420
He leaves no survivors wherever he goes.

122
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,580
Look at the situation now.

123
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,620
He really said it?

124
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,180
About the marriage thing?

125
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,940
It's true. Absolutely true.

126
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,020

127
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,860
Hmm.

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,580
Oh, it's just a game.

129
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,420
Don't take it so seriously.

130
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,860
I didn't mean to.

131
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,300
But I looked him up in real life.

132
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,980
He's kind of a big deal.

133
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,020
Did he messaged you privately?

134
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,540
Hmm.

135
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,540
He did?

136
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,380
Keep it down. You scared me.

137
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,060
What did he say?

138
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,660
He said

139
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,300
I saved him once.

140
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,420
But I really can't remember it.

141
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,020
But why would the master of Tianxia Gang

142
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,380
need saving from a girl like you?

143
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,500
Oh, right.

144
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,620
I heard he's young and accomplished.

145
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,220
You know Jiulong Group, right?

146
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,200
I heard its founder, Jiang Wenhua,

147
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,540
bravely gave up his stable job,

148
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,280
and ventured into entrepreneurship

149
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,490
during the reform and opening-up era.

150
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,620
With government support

151
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,700
and his boldness,

152
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,220
he turned Jiulong Group

153
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,740
into a top-tier company in Hangzhou.

154
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,260
"Lord of All" is his youngest son.

155
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,980
He even left the family corporation

156
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,380
and started his own business.

157
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,540
Though young,

158
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,020
he's calm and composed,

159
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,780
no matter the situation.

160
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,100
- Hello, Mr. Jiang.
- Hello, Mr. Jiang.

161
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,300
That's all I know.

162
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,980
What if it's a woman?

163
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,260
No way.

164
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,180
From the tone,

165
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,100
it's definitely a confident man.

166
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,500
What if it's a confident old man?

167
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,620
That won't do.

168
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,740
My sister is young and beautiful.

169
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,420
Only a fit,

170
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,460
handsome young man

171
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,380
with firm skin could possibly match her.

172
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,820
You guys aren't busy today?

173
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,420
We are.

174
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,300
Let's go.

175
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,140
Back to work.

176
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
Who's starting first?

177
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,760
This is Weixi Group's

178
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,100
restructuring proposal.

179
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,340
The main goal is to help them readjust

180
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,980
the proportion
of their industrial investments.

181
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,950
(Original Capital Allocation)

182
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,500
This is their old capital allocation.

183
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,340
Alright.

184
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,340
I've reviewed the proposal.

185
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,780
Make it short.

186
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,460
Okay, the conclusion is

187
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,500
that with just

188
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,460
a five percent increase in investment,

189
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,580
this plan could generate

190
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,500
over eight percent more profit
than last year.

191
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,380
This plan is solid.

192
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,740
However,

193
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,860
are you aware

194
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,900
that other firms have already

195
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,420
proposed similar strategies?

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,940
I…

197
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,170
I didn't know.

198
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,540
That means your team

199
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,100
didn't do proper market research.

200
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,580
Or maybe your proposal was inspired

201
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,820
by one already pitched by others.

202
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,420
But if we launch it first,

203
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,380
we can claim they copied us.

204
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,380
You're already a step behind.

205
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,540
Don't try to take advantage.

206
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
If you can't outperform them,

207
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,560
it means you're not capable.

208
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,420
Enough.

209
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,150
Before 4 PM tomorrow,

210
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,530
send the new proposal

211
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,580
to my email.

212
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,980
Meeting adjourned.

213
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,340
Boss.

214
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,780
Isn't this asking too much of them?

215
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,330
Did I tell them to fill the ocean?

216
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,910
No.

217
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,670
Or did I ask them to fly to the moon?

218
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,170
They rushed without putting in effort.

219
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,900
Tell them.

220
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,020
There's no shortcut to success.

221
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,210
If you want to win on the battlefield,

222
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,060
you need the skills
to face the enemy head-on.

223
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,620
Understood.

224
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,020
(Caution! Glass!)

225
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,460
Who put that up?

226
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,900
Get rid of him.

227
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,060
(Username, Password)

228
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,100
It's fine.

229
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,420
Slow down.

230
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,580
These kids don't have parents to begin with.

231
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,380
Life at the orphanage is already tough.

232
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,060
I'll visit them more often.

233
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,900
Lady, how come I don't have
a mommy and daddy?

234
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,340
Be a good girl.

235
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,660
You might not have a mommy and daddy,

236
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,420
but you have me.

237
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,020
And the Director.

238
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,820
And lots of friends who love you very much.

239
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,140
So,

240
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,020
be happy, okay?

241
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,060
Okay.

242
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,500
Here,

243
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,700
let's draw a little sun here.

244
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,980
(Log in, Sign up)

245
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,260
Now our Baihua Hall is in the spotlight.

246
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,540
We've gained more enemies.

247
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,260
Anyone who dares to cross "For Thy Sake"

248
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
is an enemy of the Tianxia Gang.

249
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,740
She's our master's lifesaver.

250
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,260
More than just a lifesaver,

251
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,420
she's also our master's wife.

252
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,780
Stop talking nonsense.

253
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,380
Even if it's true,

254
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,940
don't go spreading it around.

255
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,980
Why not?

256
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,430
You saved my life.

257
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,340
I want to devote myself to you.

258
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,340
I have important things to do.

259
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,060
Stop talking nonsense.

260
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,060
Fine.

261
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,860
You do your thing.

262
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,820
I'll just watch from here.

263
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,620
The flowers may be willing.

264
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,380
But the water is indifferent.

265
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,460
Looking for trouble?

266
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,380
Miss,

267
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,140
why is your dagger so expensive?

268
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,500
That stall over there

269
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,540
is selling it for only 400.

270
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,540
If it's 400 over there,

271
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,940
go buy it there.

272
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,780
Mine is 500.

273
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,500
Hey, what's wrong with you?

274
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,380
You're being unreasonable.

275
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,060
I...

276
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,180
I'll take them all.

277
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,380
If you don't sell to me,

278
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,160
I'm going to cause a scene.

279
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,060
I'll sell them all to you.

280
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,820
Just hurry up and leave.

281
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,700
You come with me.

282
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,340
Okay then.

283
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm not going anywhere.

284
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,740
Where do you want to go?

285
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,540
Zi…

286
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,700
Yun…

287
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,540
Mountain.

288
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Ziyun Mountain?

289
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,060
Isn't that a famous date spot?

290
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,020
I want to ask you something.

291
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,940
I can answer all your questions.

292
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,180
Why

293
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,940
do you keep killing my old accounts?

294
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,500
Because they're not you.

295
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,980
Who are you really?

296
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,140
Do we know each other?

297
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,260
We've known each other for a long time.

298
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,100
That's what you call fate.

299
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,540
Why do only you remember

300
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,860
and I don't?

301
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,420
Because I have an excellent memory.

302
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,540
And I'm sharper than most people.

303
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,220
I run my own company.

304
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,150
I was once voted
the most desirable entrepreneur.

305
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,740
I don't smoke or drink.

306
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,340
I enjoy swimming and running.

307
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,660
Thanks to fitness, I have a six-pack.

308
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,770
I'm also a decent cook.

309
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,710
I'm good at fixing light bulbs.

310
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,260
And I'm not afraid to fix a toilet.

311
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,700
I've never had a girlfriend.

312
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,940
Why are you telling me all this?

313
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,420
It's natural for a wife to know her husband.

314
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm logging off.

315
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,220
(Lord of All, Tianxia Gang, Spectator Mode)

316
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,300
Do you feel like your body is heating up?

317
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes.

318
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,140
Face is a bit hot... heart racing...

319
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,900
Yeah, maybe a little.

320
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,580
You… Why are you here?

321
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,660
I heard the call
from the depths of your soul.

322
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,980
When did you come in?

323
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,200
Since you were grinning at the screen,

324
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,220
I've been sitting here.

325
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,410
Watching you daydream,

326
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,500
I didn't want to disturb you,

327
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,770
so I just sat quietly.

328
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,980
This is huge.

329
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,500
You're in love.

330
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,340
What's more,

331
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,740
it's a one-sided crush.

332
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,140
I never thought the great Jiang Anlan
would see this day.

333
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,940
Security, come upstairs.

334
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,180
Hey, just joking, bro.

335
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,220
Never mind.

336
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,900
Li Ao told me

337
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,780
you already know where she is in real life.

338
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,740
Yeah, at a gallery.

339
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,870
She's an exhibition planner.

340
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,940
Why don't you go find her?

341
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,860
Wouldn't it be weird to just go find her?

342
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,940
What you're doing in the game isn't weird?

343
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,180
Excuse me,

344
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,700
am I the expert or are you the expert?

345
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,100
Oh, right.

346
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,620
Our relationship expert here

347
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,860
is going to lecture me again.

348
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,940
Anyway, this is my own business.

349
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,260
So stop egging me on.

350
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,280
You're not thinking clearly right now.

351
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,900
What if she weighs 200 pounds?

352
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,300
Or she's already in love with someone else?

353
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,240
If your crush

354
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,330
weighed 200 pounds, what would you do?

355
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,700
Genuinely liking someone isn't easy.

356
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,860
Let me think.

357
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,260
If she were, I'd help her lose weight.

358
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,020
If she were too thin, I'd fatten her up.

359
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,620
Exactly.

360
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,340
My "For Thy Sake,"

361
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,820
isn't just beautiful,

362
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,100
she's also slender.

363
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,140
Even if she likes someone else now,

364
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,300
I don't care.

365
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,100
My main goal right now

366
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,940
is to make her fall for me.

367
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,340
Come on.

368
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,740
Let's eat.

369
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,980
I told you I'll skip it.

370
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,340
I'm on a diet.

371
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,540
Look, out of the three of us,

372
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,900
I ordered the most.

373
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,500
That's because you have a big appetite.

374
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,900
Miss Yao.

375
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,740
Having lunch?

376
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,020
What else do you do in a restaurant?

377
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,540
Hey, don't be like that.

378
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,620
He's obviously up to something.

379
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,420
If I'm not mean to him, he'll never leave.

380
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,460
The restaurant is so crowded,

381
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,060
so I was wondering if we could share a table?

382
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,900
No.

383
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,940
Over there

384
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,100
and over there... those are all empty.

385
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,140
Go pick one yourself.

386
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,460
Alright then, enjoy your meal.

387
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,780
I say you should get married soon.

388
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,790
It'll get rid of these flies

389
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,180
buzzing around our heads.

390
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,030
Stop it.

391
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,380
I don't know who "Lord of All" really is.

392
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,300
Did I mention any names?

393
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,460
Your head is just full of him.

394
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,180
Hey.

395
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,060
Speaking of the game,

396
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,140
payments are due in a few days.

397
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,140
How are your equipment sales going?

398
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,500
Pretty good. Everything's sold.

399
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,220
Sold out?

400
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,180
Who bought them?

401
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,970
Who else?

402
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,780
"Lord of All" bought them?

403
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,910
He's practically your guardian angel.

404
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,750
Seems like he is serious about you.

405
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,300
Looks like our Baihua Hall is about to bloom.

406
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Keep it down.

407
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,300
It's just a game anyway.

408
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,940
Living our real lives well is what matters.

409
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,580
Hard to say.

410
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
Maybe he will show up

411
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,340
in your real life.

412
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,310
Alright, alright, let's drop it.

413
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,980
Let's go farm dungeons tonight.

414
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,260
Or we won't have anything to sell.

415
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,020
- Yeah, sure.
- Alright.

416
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,020
(Finally took down that BOSS.
Grab the gear and heal up.)

417
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,900
We're rich now.

418
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,900
For Thy Sake's final move

419
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,220
was absolutely nerve-wracking.

420
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,820
I thought we were done for.

421
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,660
The top female player of Shengshi

422
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
is no joke.

423
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,980
Alright, let's pack up the loot.

424
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,500
Time to move to the next map.

425
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,140
Are you okay?

426
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,900
I'm fine.

427
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
I'll recover in a bit.

428
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,500
Where did "Lord of All" go?

429
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,620
His wife is seriously injured.

430
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,100
Thank you all.

431
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,300
We've been watching this monster for ages.

432
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
We just couldn't take it down.

433
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,180
Thanks for risking your lives

434
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
to kill it for us.

435
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,860
So shameless.

436
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,810
Stealing someone else's kill?

437
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,740
Seriously.

438
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,860
Never seen hyenas
on the African savanna?

439
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,900
We're just learning from nature.

440
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,900
You sure picked up all the wrong lessons.

441
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,540
Why not learn from bees

442
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,540
and be self-reliant?

443
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,900
Enough talking.

444
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,020
Take their loot.

445
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,860
Go!

446
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,380
They only live off others' leftovers

447
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,700
without even a hint of shame.

448
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,420
In psychology, there's a term for it.

449
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,500
What's that?

450
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,500
Shameless.

451
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,020
Tell the others out there.

452
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,660
From now on, it's not just "For Thy Sake."

453
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,420
Anyone who dares cross Baihua Hall dies.

454
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,700
Thanks.

455
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,860
Though I didn't need your help.

456
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,720
You're welcome.

457
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,860
I wasn't saving you anyway.

458
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,020
Why did you shoot me?

459
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
You showed up too late.

460
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
We almost all died.

461
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,020
Let me tell you something.

462
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,420
In psychology, your behavior is called…

463
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,460
It's called shameless.

464
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,140
You're the shameless one.

465
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,740
It's called ambivalent attachment.

466
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,530
You crave love and protection,

467
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,060
but when someone actually cares about you,

468
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,060
you push them away.

469
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
Why make it so complicated?

470
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,740
It's just being tsundere.

471
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,180
Sorry.

472
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,100
Master has an important meeting today,

473
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,940
so he couldn't make it.

474
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,420
He asked me to apologize on his behalf.

475
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,620
And he promised,

476
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,620
he'll make it up with ten dates next time.

477
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,660
He doesn't owe me anything.

478
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,220
Master also said,

479
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,660
from now on, Baihua Hall's matters

480
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,980
are also Tianxia Gang's matters.

481
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,540
Anyone who disobeys will face consequences.

482
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,220
Even Baihua Hall is under protection now?

483
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,820
Seems like this big shot

484
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,420
is serious about "For Thy Sake."

485
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,050
Very serious.

486
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,380
Don't talk nonsense.

487
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,110
They might take it seriously.

488
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,500
But it is.

489
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,500
We're the top gang in the world.

490
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,740
We must have a grand wedding.

491
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,820
I can't wait to see her
in a white wedding dress.

492
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,580
Shouldn't she wear red

493
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,420
for good luck?

494
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,900
You're so clueless.

495
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,380
Who has only one outfit for a wedding?

496
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,900
Do you change outfits for weddings in games?

497
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,260
So, Madam, have you decided to marry?

498
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,450
No, I haven't.

499
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,340
Master said,

500
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,850
as long as you agree to marry,

501
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,250
you can name your price for the dowry.

502
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,940
What's so impressive

503
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,420
if it's all money?

504
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,260
Being showered with money isn't touching,

505
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
but it shows you mean more than money.

506
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,580
By the way,

507
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,780
your boss really said he'd give any dowry?

508
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,860
Hmm.

509
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,700
Alright then.

510
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,500
The Annual Quest is about to start.

511
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,620
If Lord of All

512
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,100
can defeat the Giant

513
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,660
and use the Five-Element Dragon Ball
as my dowry,

514
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,380
then fine.

515
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,500
I'll marry him.

516
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,380
It's not that simple.

517
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,140
There's a deeper meaning behind it.

518
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,460
What is it?

519
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,500
Isn't it sending our master to his death?

520
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,670
Since the game launched,

521
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,420
no one's ever completed

522
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,260
the Annual Quest.

523
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,900
Not even Master.

524
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,740

Deal.

00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,340
Hold on.

564
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,060
Go ahead. I'm listening.

565
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,460
If you

566
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,580
fail the quest,

567
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,180
then stop joking

568
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,740
about marriage ever again.

569
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,180
If I fail,

570
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,660
I'll never bring it up again.

571
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,900
Deal.

572
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,350
But when I, Jiang Anlan, propose marriage,

573
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,620
I'm never joking about it.

574
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,180
Good night.

575
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,700
Good night.

576
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,460
So his name is Jiang Anlan.

577
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,620
(Editing contact Madam)

578
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,220
(Madam)

579
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,340
The secret between blood types

580
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,940
and zodiac signs.

581
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,460
Hey sis,

582
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,740
(Zodiac Expert)
let me check your horoscope for this week.

583
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,460
I don't believe in that stuff.

584
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,020
There are over 7 billion people on Earth.

585
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,540
No way there are only 12 types of destiny.

586
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,580
Bad luck in love.

587
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,820
You might have missed a good match

588
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,740
because of a bad decision.

589
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,820
Nonsense.

590
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,780
I thought you didn't believe in it.

591
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,500
Seriously, I need to talk to you about this.

592
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,860
"Lord of All" is so devoted to you.

593
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,060
Yet you're sending him to his doom.

594
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,900
I didn't mean for that.

595
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,500
I had no idea he'd accept it.

596
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,180
But you knew

597
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,700
if he fails the Annual Quest,

598
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,340
his account will be deleted.

599
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,900
I didn't realize you could be so ruthless.

600
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,380
I truly didn't think he'd take it on.

601
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,480
But he's willing to risk it for you,

602
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,940
even if it means losing his account.

603
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,660
Don't tell me you still don't get it.

604
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,300
That's true love.

605
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,220
As the saying goes,

606
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,380
since ancient times,

607
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,620
heroes fall for beauty.

608
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,260
Just go to bed.

609
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,860
Even heroes fall for beauty.

610
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,700
Anlan worked so hard on his account,

611
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
and now it's gonna get wiped.

612
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,380
Remember how much effort you put in

613
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,660
to level that thing up?

614
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,260
We went through hell for it.

615
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,420
Truly, life is but a game and a dream.

616
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,500
You know what?

617
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,700
Sometimes talking too much is a problem.

618
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,660
Not using it is also an issue.

619
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,140
I use it when I eat, don't I?

620
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,540
That's why you're so boring.

621
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,820
There are so many ways to use your mouth.

622
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,090
Eating, talking, kissing,
and kissing goodbye.

623
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,180
So many possibilities.

624
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,460
Yet you fixate

625
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,180
on the most basic one?

626
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,940
I see your mouth's only good for talking.

627
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
You don't even bother eating.

628
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,420
Just flap your lips open and shut,

629
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,660
and breathing should fill you up.

630
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,420
- You...
- Hey, stop.

631
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,540
Honestly, you two should just get married.

632
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,620
(Flying Arrows in the Dark Forest)

633
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,780
Are you really going in?

634
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,200
Yeah.

635
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,300
What if you die?

636
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,060
I'll just build a new account.

637
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,100
She only said if I fail, I can't propose.

638
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,420
She never said I couldn't start over.

639
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,580
Respect.

640
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,300
If all men mastered love strategies like you,

641
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,420
I'd be out of a job as a relationship expert.

642
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,820
So you admit you're just a charlatan?

643
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,660
(Rank: SSS Lord of All, Tianxia Gang)

644
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,580
Impressive. Worthy of a guild master.

645
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,500
I can't bring a healer to restore HP or MP.

646
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,020
If my stats bottom out,
I have to start from scratch.

647
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,820
Want me to look up a walkthrough?

648
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,900
Stop showing off your ignorance, will you?

649
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,820
Have you heard of anyone
beating the Annual Quest?

650
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,680
The players who challenge it

651
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,540
usually die by the entrance
of the second level.

652
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,500
The Giant is on the third level.

653
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,020
Where would you find a walkthrough?

654
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,260
I don't read walkthroughs.

655
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,820
I write them. Now shut up.

656
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,860
(Rank: SSS Lord of All, Tianxia Gang)

657
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,340
My dear sister.

658
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,700
What are you doing?

659
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,420
Hey.

660
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,860
Why isn't he moving?

661
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,100
Shouldn't you be thinking about

662
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,900
the fact that if he wins,
you have to marry him?

663
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,100
I...

664
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,580
But why is

665
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,580
"Lord of All" so determined

666
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,380
to marry only you?

667
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,780
Have you met before?

668
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
No, we haven't.

669
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,780
We couldn't have met in the game.

670
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,180
You've always been with me.

671
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,500
If I'd met him, wouldn't you know?

672
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,420
Hmm.

673
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,260
That's true.

674
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,700
In the game, you couldn't save him.

675
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,900
Then it must've been in real life.

676
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,500
My dear sis,

677
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,100
in real life,

678
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,180
I'm just an exhibition planner who can paint.

679
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,580
I don't carry a sword.

680
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,420
How could I have saved him?

681
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,420
Besides, if I'd saved someone,

682
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,260
I'd know, wouldn't I?

683
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,900
Maybe it was trivial to you,

684
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,180
but it meant the world to him.

685
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,780
Ever since

686
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,020
you were little, you couldn't stand
seeing people suffer.

687
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,940
Remember when you were seven?

688
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,940
We went to buy steamed buns.

689
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,180
You saw an old man on the roadside,

690
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,140
sitting there all alone.

691
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,040
You gave him all your buns

692
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,420
and starved yourself.

693
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,500
Did you remember something?

694
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,100
I just think it's kind of funny.

695
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,620
Maybe he didn't even care.

696
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,170
Just some offhand comment,

697
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,060
and here we are, dissecting it

698
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,180
so seriously.

699
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,340
Don't you think that's hilarious?

700
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,700
But according to my reliable source,

701
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,700
"Lord of All" is a new player

702
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,980
who joined just 36 days ago.

703
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,540
To reach the top so quickly,

704
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,060
there are only two possibilities.

705
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,640
One,

706
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,500
he's loaded with cash.

707
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,140
Two, he's insanely talented.

708
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,340
He's no ordinary man.

709
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,300
You think he went through all this

710
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,180
just to mess with you?

711
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,700
I won.

712
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,500
We'll get married in seven days.

713
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,030
Oh my god.

714
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Who are you really?

715
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,220
Sis,

716
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,300
you're getting married?

717
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,420
On the wedding day,

718
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,300
you'll find out.

719
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,740
Madam, be patient.
