00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,140
Thank you for coming.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,140
What would you like?

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,980
Uh...

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,580
I'm just looking around.

37
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,820
Oh.

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,980
It's my first time here.

39
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,700
I want to buy something

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,500
for my grandson.

41
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,400
Hey,

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,740
do you have any recommendations?

43
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,380
Just look around, it's all there.

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Then,

45
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,620
I'll take this.

46
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,540
Chocolate ice cream.

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,820
Fifteen.

48
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,660
Alright.

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,860
I'll pay.

50
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,900
Sorry about that.

51
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,820
Hurry up, will you?

52
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,900
There's a line behind you.

53
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,860
Okay, sorry about that.

54
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,060
I'll wait.

55
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,900
It's fine.

56
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,740
But your attitude…

57
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,060
I think you should at least be polite.

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,500
He is an elder, after all.

59
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,740
Respect for the elderly.

60
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,680
You should know, right?

61
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,820
Besides, it's your job to serve.

62
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,460
What attitude do I have?

63
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,570
What's it to you?

64
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,150
It's not your place to lecture me.

65
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,460
So this is how you train your employees?

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,700
What's wrong with you?

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,420
How can you talk like that?

68
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,260
Manager Lin.

69
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,740
Chairman.

70
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,140
As a big mall,

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,860
we need to address staff attitudes,

72
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,820
or it will affect the overall image.

73
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,020
Understood.

74
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,430
I'll handle it right away.

75
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,220
Dear,

76
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,780
you're so amazing.

77
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,700
If I were there, I'd fully support you.

78
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,940
Of course.

79
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,780
I hate it when people pick on the elderly.

80
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,340
Dad would really appreciate

81
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,980
your sense of justice.

82
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,060
This visit to my family will earn you points.

83
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,460
Anything I should pay attention to?

84
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,220
Well,

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,340
I'll have to give you

86
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,180
our family genealogy and rules.

87
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,340
You might need to memorize them.

88
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,300
Okay.

89
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,580
Just kidding.

90
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,740
Just be yourself.

91
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,980
That's how I've always been.

92
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,460
So you were kicked out?

93
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,500
I chose to move out myself.

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,340
But,

95
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
after we're married,

96
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,860
my parents might want us to move back.

97
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,100
Do I need to

98
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,620
serve tea

99
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,460
and pay respects?

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,700
No need.

101
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,940
In our family,

102
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,330
apart from family reunions,

103
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,380
we keep to ourselves.

104
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,740
Not that many formalities.

105
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,900
But going there empty-handed

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,740
doesn't seem right.

107
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,300
I should buy something.

108
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,250
What does your dad like?

109
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,000
And your mom?

110
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,380
Your grandparents?

111
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,300
Honey,

112
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,500
you just need to dress up beautifully

113
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,380
and show up holding my hand.

114
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,420
Really?

115
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,620
Really.

116
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,980
If the sky falls, won't you hold it…

117
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,060
I mean, I'll hold it up for you.

118
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,180
Okay, I'll help you hold it.

119
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,900
Deal.

120
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,340
Wenqian,

121
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,140
watch what you say later.

122
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,300
Don't make things awkward.

123
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,340
Or you'll upset Anlan.

124
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,140
No matter what, I'm his aunt.

125
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,940
Do I have to watch my words around him?

126
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,900
This time,

127
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,820
Wenhua rarely wants to meet Yao Yuan.

128
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,660
Take this opportunity

129
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,140
to get to know her.

130
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,620
Mm.

131
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,420
- Dad.
- Dad.

132
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,820
- Mom.
- Hey.

133
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,700
Look,

134
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,980
Anlan said he'd bring his girlfriend home.

135
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,500
Why haven't they arrived yet?

136
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,580
Dad, don't worry.

137
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,140
It's not time yet.

138
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,820
How can we not?

139
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,700
This is a big deal for our family.

140
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,100
Any girl Anlan brings home

141
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,380
- has to be the right one.
- Exactly.

142
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,460
Grandpa, Grandma.

143
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,980
Oh, here they are.

144
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,980
- This is Yao Yuan.
- Hey.

145
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,820
Grandpa, Grandma.

146
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,700
Hello.

147
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,100
I brought some gifts for you.

148
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,940
Oh.

149
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,700
Thank you.

150
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,860
She's really charming.

151
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,420
When I was young,

152
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,580
I also learned painting.

153
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,540
After retiring, I painted some ink paintings.

154
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,980
How about this?

155
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,260
After dinner,

156
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,660
we can exchange ideas,

157
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,690
and you can instruct me.

158
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,740
No one gets your dark paintings.

159
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,300
Of course, you wouldn't get it.

160
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,420
Yuan can understand them.

161
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,220
Grandpa, I'm no expert.

162
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,900
Let's take a look later,

163
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,220
then we can exchange some ideas.

164
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,740
Yeah, that sounds good.

165
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,620
Mom, Dad,

166
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,740
there'll be plenty of time to talk later.

167
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,580
Miss Yao isn't going anywhere.

168
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,700
Right, go ahead and sit.

169
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,580
Dad.

170
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,300
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

171
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,500
Yao Yuan.

172
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,620
We meet again.

173
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
This is my uncle.

174
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,660
He works in our company too.

175
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,940
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

176
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,700
Hello, Ancheng.

177
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,260
Alright, don't just stand there.

178
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,340
Let's eat.

179
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,740
Here, try this.

180
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,940
My mom's signature soup.

181
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,420
I raised you this big,

182
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,740
and you've never served me soup.

183
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,980
Mrs. Jiang,

184
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,100
didn't you know?

185
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,900
Once a son has a girlfriend,

186
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,540
his focus completely shifts.

187
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,620
Mom, don't worry.

188
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,540
Yao Yuan will serve you soup every day.

189
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,420
So quick to push the responsibility?

190
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,890
Brother.

191
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,140
Miss Yao,

192
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,060
I heard your parents passed away.

193
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,260
Just take Anlan's parents

194
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,460
as your own.

195
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,980
I will.

196
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,860
Thank you.

197
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,240
From now on,

198
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,540
please take care of Yao Yuan.

199
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,860
Since you've asked,

200
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,340
how could we say no?

201
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,180
Wenqian.

202
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,340
Alright.

203
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,420
I mean,

204
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,820
Anlan already spoke up.

205
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,300
Of course, we'll treat Yao Yuan like family.

206
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,060
Anlan,

207
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,740
when do you plan to get married?

208
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,260
Dad,

209
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,700
my brother hasn't agreed yet.

210
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,780
Why not?

211
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,500
I'm waiting to hold my great-grandchild.

212
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,340
Grandma.

213
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,020
Look.

214
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,460
Anlan is blushing.

215
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,500
He is. Let me take a photo.

216
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,710
Let me take a picture.

217
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,740
Come on.

218
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,620
One, two, three.

219
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,460
Perfect.

220
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Alright, Uncle.

221
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,540
Yao Yuan,

222
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,500
I heard

223
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,050
you've been helping out at Anlan's company.

224
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,820
Yes, that's right.

225
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,900
That must be hard for you.

226
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,540
Anlan

227
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,980
has some bad habits.

228
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,500
You know that, right?

229
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Probably.

230
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,020
- Dad.
- Be quiet.

231
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,860
About Anlan,

232
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,540
let me sum this up for you.

233
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,900
Stubborn.

234
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,860
Bad temper.

235
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,300
Loves to talk back.

236
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,100
And there's more.

237
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,300
Yuan, I'm telling you,

238
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,300
Anlan doesn't like

239
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,670
to lock the bathroom door

240
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,940
when he's on the toilet.

241
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,340
Also, when he showers,

242
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,220
he likes to play loud music.

243
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,580
Whenever that music starts,

244
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,540
everyone in the house

245
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,060
knows he's in the shower.

246
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,140
He likes to raid the fridge

247
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,340
in the middle of the night.

248
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,780
One time I came home from work,

249
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,140
I thought someone broke in.

250
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,220
You all enjoy watching me

251
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,380
embarrassed in front of her.

252
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,220
Is that so?

253
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,460
Jiang Anlan,

254
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,900
didn't see this coming, did you?

255
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,780
Brother,

256
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
when you bring a wife home,

257
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,460
I'll make you twice as embarrassed.

258
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,900
You don't lock the door?

259
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,020
Alright, enough talk.

260
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,860
Dig in.

261
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,380
That's my brother.

262
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,500
Grandma must be mistaken.

263
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,780
Come on, eat up.

264
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,100
Yao Yuan.

265
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,080
Eat more.

266
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,970
Thank you.

267
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,810
Here.

268
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,020
Huang.

269
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,570
It's been ages since we last met.

270
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,940
Yeah, it's been a while.

271
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,020
By the way, what are you up to now?

272
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,860
You look pretty well.

273
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,340
Have you settled

274
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,180
all your debts?

275
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,140
Not so fast.

276
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,740
Right now,

277
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,960
I'm taking it step by step.

278
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,980
Working hard

279
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,940
to pay off the debt as quickly as I can.

280
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,300
Being steady and practical

281
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,580
is pretty good.

282
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,770
Come on, try some.

283
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,420
Yeah.

284
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,300
Let me try the braised pork.

285
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,710
- How is it?
- Mmm.

286
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,700
Your braised pork is amazing.

287
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,700
Rich but not greasy,

288
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,210
melts right in your mouth.

289
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,900
That chain restaurant you opened before

290
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,430
still calls it their signature dish.

291
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,740
But anyone who's eaten there

292
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,280
can taste the difference.

293
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,150
Wasn't that place taken over?

294
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
It wasn't.

295
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,900
Look.

296
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,220
I just went there a few days ago.

297
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,780
They still serve

298
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,980
your signature dishes.

299
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,580
And the owner is

300
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,820
still your old business partner.

301
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,060
Hey, Zhengyi.

302
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,900
Zhengyi.

303
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,050
(Diner of Delicacies)

304
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,910
Xu.

305
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,780
Xu.

306
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,620
Stop right there.

307
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,060
Tell me what's going on.

308
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,540
What's really happening?

309
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,660
What do you mean?

310
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,500
What's wrong with you?

311
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,810
Didn't you say the place was taken over?

312
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,950
Want me to take the loss?

313
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,260
Now what's all this?

314
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,340
Huh?

315
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,500
Reaping the profits alone?

316
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,780
Don't accuse me.

317
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,300
That's just how things were at first.

318
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,540
Later, Jiulong proposed a takeover.

319
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,220
They even offered me a manager position.

320
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,900
How could I refuse such a good deal?

321
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,820
Right?

322
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,300
But you should've told me about it.

323
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,140
That restaurant was my life's work.

324
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,100
For this place,

325
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,580
I put all my savings into it.

326
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
Even went into debt.

327
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,140
Now I'm stuck cooking in a tiny diner.

328
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,260
How will you fix this?

329
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,420
How do I fix it?

330
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,020
We already have a chef.

331
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,860
You don't know business., do you?

332
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,700
Cut it out.

333
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,970
- You…
- Listen up.

334
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,190
You can't steal my life's work.

335
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,820
You can't take my restaurant!

336
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,760
You can't…

337
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,100
Hey, are you alright?

338
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,940
Shi Zhengyi.

339
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,300
Shi Zhengyi.

340
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,260
What's up, Boss?

341
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,140
Ancheng,

342
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,880
don't you think

343
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,940
Yao Yuan looks familiar?

344
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,340
Have you met her?

345
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,420
No, I haven't.

346
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,660
But that name,

347
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,760
I feel like I've heard it somewhere.

348
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,020
When I was little,

349
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,060
I loved playing

350
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,560
hide and seek here with my brother.

351
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,180
We'd play all afternoon.

352
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,620
Look over there.

353
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Those are fruit trees.

354
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,980
In autumn,

355
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,300
we can come pick the fruit.

356
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,220
Hello?

357
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,460
Okay.

358
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,320
I'll be right there.

359
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,740
What's up?

360
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,370
My uncle's in the hospital
for a heart attack.

361
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,180
I need to go now.

362
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,620
I'll go with you.

363
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,420
Uncle,

364
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,500
what happened?

365
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,660
I'm fine.

366
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,500
I put in so much effort

367
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,100
in the restaurant.

368
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,020
I just got too upset.

369
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,340
What do you mean?

370
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
That restaurant

371
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,140
didn't go under.

372
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,940
The new owner is from Jiulong Group.

373
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
Xu told me

374
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,350
the debt was converted to operations.

375
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,810
Only I was kept in the dark.

376
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,010
I didn't know about this.

377
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,220
I'll find out.

378
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,980
Uncle, try to calm down.

379
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,820
Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

380
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,580
Misunderstanding?

381
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,420
A small fry like me,

382
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,050
no matter how hard I work,

383
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,620
I can't fight big companies.

384
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,610
Back then, I didn't want

385
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,270
to stay in the tea fields for life,

386
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,020
so I came to the city to make a life.

387
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,420
Finally,

388
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,140
I became a cook

389
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,410
and opened a small eatery.

390
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,910
Thanks to loyal customers' support,

391
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,420
I made my dream restaurant happen.

392
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,260
You've all tried the dishes.

393
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,660
Decent, right?

394
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,340
You've been a great cook.

395
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,980
That restaurant—

396
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
from dishes,

397
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,100
to décor,

398
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,380
to staff—

399
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,940
I poured my heart into it.

400
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,900
Now there's a new owner,

401
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,000
but even the name hasn't changed.

402
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,140
The menu shows

403
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,220
all my signature dishes.

404
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,420
Do you know?

405
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,900
Those dishes

406
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,020
were created

407
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,420
after countless burns

408
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,020
and countless failures.

409
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,580
It's okay.

410
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,860
I'm so useless.

411
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,940
No skills, no talent. Just useless.

412
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,180
Hard work doesn't pay off.

413
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,300
No one cares how much effort you put in.

414
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
Mrs. Jiang already knows.

415
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,910
She asked me to bring Shi some supplements.

416
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,260
Boss,

417
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,100
tell me,

418
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,140
ever since Ancheng lent money to Shi,

419
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,740
has this been planned all along?

420
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,260
I think he initially just wanted to help.

421
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,180
As for who planned what happened later,

422
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,250
and whether he knew,

423
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,180
I'm not sure.

424
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,660
Objectively speaking,

425
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,700
Ancheng's team came up with this.

426
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,860
We can't put all the blame on him.

427
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,180
Even so,

428
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,060
my brother didn't stop it.

429
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,460
Uncle,

430
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,300
have some fruit.

431
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,420
It'll help you recover.

432
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,740
Yuan,

433
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,420
Anlan was just here,

434
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,800
and I didn't get to ask.

435
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,050
How is he with his brother?

436
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,420
From what I know, pretty good.

437
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,340
His brother is a very upright person.

438
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,820
I don't think he is to blame

439
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,980
for the restaurant.

440
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,700
Maybe so.

441
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,500
He's helped me a lot,

442
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,340
and I'm grateful.

443
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,020
But if it's not what we think,

444
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,500
you should cut Anlan some slack.

445
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,180
After all, they're brothers.

446
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,460
Don't worry.

447
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,420
Anlan will handle it well.

448
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,580
Ancheng,

449
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,140
I've invited Chairman Zhang.

450
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,980
He's here.

451
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,220
Hi.

452
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,340
Mr. Zhao.

453
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,780
Mr. Ma.

454
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,980
- Mr. Zhang.
- Okay.

455
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,380
Please have a seat.

456
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,460
Please.

457
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,300
Have a seat.

458
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,740
Thanks for coming today.

459
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,160
Some of my recent projects hit a few snags.

460
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,900
My father's been critical of me.

461
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,500
So I want to take this chance to explain

462
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,360
my plans for the Group's future development.

463
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,980
You want to hear what we think, right?

464
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,340
I want to show my drive and determination

465
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,700
and earn your support.

466
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,260
Then we'll be honest.

467
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,180
Frankly, we don't like

468
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
some of your ways.

469
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,900
Take Liu from my department last year.

470
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,450
He was dealing with a divorce,

471
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,660
inevitably slipped up a bit.

472
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,820
You kicked him off the project

473
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,540
like his effort meant nothing.

474
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,700
And recently,

475
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,220
you took on that restaurant project.

476
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,220
Finance said

477
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,260
you knew what was going on.

478
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,980
How could you let them bleed money like that?

479
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,500
I think

480
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,580
you misunderstood me.

481
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,580
Manager Liu was reassigned

482
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,740
because he was moonlighting.

483
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,460
As for the restaurant,

484
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,700
Mr. Jiang

485
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,540
didn't get involved.

486
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,700
Funny.

487
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Isn't that the very project

488
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,780
you used to fill your performance gap?

489
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,340
I know you're serious.

490
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,910
But regarding performance,

491
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,990
you show no mercy.

492
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,300
What if someone disagrees with you?

493
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,140
What happens then?

494
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,580
Which is why I hope

495
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,380
we understand each other better.

496
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,300
With your support,

497
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,260
I'll have the space

498
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,860
to bring our shared vision to life.

499
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,780
Don't you agree?

500
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,980
Here's to you all.

501
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,820
Come on.

502
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,990
Cheers.

503
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,060
Let's drink.

504
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,920
Alright.

505
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,980
Cheers.

506
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,500
Zhang,

507
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,340
finish yours.

508
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,840
Last time at your place,

509
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,830
I drank way too much.

510
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
Yeah.

511
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,860
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

512
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,700
Come on.

513
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,660
Here, one more round.

514
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,740
Ma, drink more.

515
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,580
Come on.

516
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,860
- Drink up.
- Cheers.

517
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,020
Picked a wedding gift for Jiang yet?

518
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,700
I've been thinking about it.

519
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,540
But...

520
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,140
They finally made it official.

521
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,980
Anything will do.

522
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,820
Jiang is here.

523
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,020
Let's raise a glass to Jiang.

524
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,140
To celebrate his engagement.

525
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,420
Thanks, guys.

526
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,500
Jiang,

527
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,820
let's have a drink.

528
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,510
Congratulations.

529
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,620
You finally beat me

530
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,700
and won Yao Yuan's heart.

531
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,260
There's no winning or losing here.

532
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,320
I never saw you as a real rival.

533
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,220
Anlan, you're way too confident.

534
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,460
When it comes to flirting,

535
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,740
you might not beat Su Wen.

536
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,220
Here's your chance. Buy me a drink.

537
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,300
Isn't there some alcohol

538
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,140
in your glass?

539
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,780
You can buy a second, even a third.

540
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,980
So we can…

541
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,020
Sorry.

542
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,540
You actually turned her down?

543
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,020
I think Su Wen must be ill.

544
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Didn't I tell you

545
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,820
that I've changed?

546
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,580
Better to stay single than settle,

547
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,190
that's my new rule for love.

548
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,900
A leopard can't change its spots.

549
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,380
How could you suddenly change?

550
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,630
No point forcing it

551
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,360
with someone you don't love.

552
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,380
I won't settle out of loneliness.

553
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,550
Or be alone because I made a mistake.

554
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,160
Is this really the Su Wen I know?

555
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,220
Love isn't supposed to be a shelter.

556
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,010
The more you treat it like one,

557
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,260
the easier you get pushed out.

558
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,100
So I've decided I'll stay single

559
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,540
until I find true love.

560
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,360
If I'd understood this sooner,

561
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,310
I would've avoided the wrong turns.

562
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,580
Let's raise a glass to Su Wen.

563
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,340
To Anlan's engagement

564
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,140
and Su Wen's fresh start.

565
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,020
Here's to that.

566
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,340
Jiang,

567
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,780
shouldn't you let Yao Yuan know

568
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,620
you'll be home late?

569
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,820
It's nothing.

570
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,220
You're not being henpecked,

571
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,060
are you?

572
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,090
It's just pre-wedding jitters.

573
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,460
Stop talking nonsense.

574
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
Like anything could stump the boss.

575
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,060
You're back.

576
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,500
How's uncle doing?

577
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,820
His condition is stable for now.

578
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,540
But he needs some rest.

579
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,540
Don't worry. Uncle will be fine.

580
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,030
Be focus on the wedding now.

581
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,480
That'll make him feel at ease.

582
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,620
By the way,

583
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,420
I've packed your clothes, bags, and shoes.

584
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,020
All sorted by season and color

585
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,900
and packed.

586
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,540
Xinran, thank you.

587
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,050
You've always taken care of me.

588
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,940
Well, you are my cousin.

589
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,820
I can't believe I'm really leaving.

590
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,180
After all these years living with you,

591
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm moving out.

592
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,650
You'll live all by yourself.

593
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,450
Silly girl.

594
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,050
We'll both get married sooner or later.

595
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,210
We'll eventually separate.

596
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,340
But now, Anlan is here to take care of you.

597
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,540
That puts my mind at ease.

598
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,940
Hello.

599
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,180
Cheers.

600
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,300
Oh,

601
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,060
you're about to become Mrs. Jiang soon.

602
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,300
From now on,

603
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,540
will we still hang out?

604
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,540
Of course we will.

605
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,500
We'll still be friends after marriage.

606
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,930
We'll definitely hang out.

607
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,540
But the topics will be different.

608
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,620
Mostly about husbands.

609
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,300
You both have your futures set.

610
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,780
But

611
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,020
I'm still lagging behind.

612
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,230
How are things going with Ancheng?

613
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,020
I like him.

614
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,460
But I feel like he's so mysterious.

615
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,060
Hey, Yao Yuan.

616
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,690
Besides Fang Jianing,

617
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,060
has the Ace mentioned

618
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,620
if his brother has a girlfriend?

619
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,220
We never talk about that.

620
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,140
You've gone on dates,

621
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,980
haven't you figured it out?

622
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,940
He said Fang Jianing is like his sister.

623
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,540
But,

624
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,540
before marriage,

625
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,940
everyone has a chance, right?

626
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,300
Forget about it.

627
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,940
Today's star is my cousin.

628
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,980
I've made up my mind.

629
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,820
Since I like Ancheng,

630
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,060
I'll spend more time getting to know him.

631
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,220
How else will we know if we fit?

632
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,220
Right?

633
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,620
I must be out of my mind.

634
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,820
Coming here with you,

635
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,130
and bringing Wen Cheng.

636
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,980
I'm here to stop a mistake.

637
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,900
What exactly are we doing here?

638
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,740
Isn't that Fang Jianing?

639
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,620
I don't think they are in the same company.

640
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,740
It's noon. They're probably going to eat.

641
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,060
So they're going on a date.

642
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,980
Is a meal between colleagues a date?

643
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,260
Yeah, it's just having a meal.

644
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,940
Coming this way.

645
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,660
Let's follow them.

646
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,500
Huh?

647
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,700
What a terrible idea.

648
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,780
I'm curious.

649
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,980
Let's go.

650
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,740
Ancheng,

651
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,660
are they all on board

652
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,380
with our no-plastic initiative?

653
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,020
Yes.

654
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,060
That's why we need to confirm some details.

655
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,780
Come on, what are we doing?

656
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,180
Mr. Jiang,

657
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,460
I've banned the use of plastic bags

658
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,220
as you instructed.

659
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,340
We even switched the takeout utensils

660
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,940
to eco-friendly materials.

661
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,220
Isn't that Yao Yuan's uncle's restaurant?

662
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
I plan to turn this place

663
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,810
into a low-carbon, eco-friendly showcase.

664
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,940
Ancheng,

665
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,820
after the merger,

666
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,650
Xu and I have been dedicated

667
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,220
and managing according to the strategy.

668
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,260
Thanks to Mr. Jiang and Chen
taking over,

669
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,940
I've been able to keep the business going.

670
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,980
Now it's getting better and better.

671
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,340
Back when we first partnered with Shi,

672
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,220
he was managing blindly.

673
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,260
But now he had a heart attack

674
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,900
after it was taken over.

675
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,340
I shouldn't say more.

676
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,700
Right?

677
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
How could you do this?

678
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,000
Shi got sick because of this, didn't he?

679
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,300
You set him up.

680
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,580
Then,

681
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,620
isn't this called hostile takeover?

682
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Don't use every negative

683
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,660
business term you've heard.

684
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,780
Things might not be what you think.

685
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,620
You can tell by how guilty this person looks.

686
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,780
Did you take advantage of Yao Yuan's uncle?

687
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,100
Misunderstandings or what,

688
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,980
Ancheng is not that kind of person.

689
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,060
You. Explain.

690
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,980
What's really going on?

691
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,820
How come people are

692
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,300
talking about Ancheng like this?

693
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,660
You have no respect at all.

694
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,420
This is our company's business.

695
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,820
Mr. Jiang isn't someone you can question.

696
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,460
Don't waste time.

697
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,500
Let's go.

698
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,660
Jianing.

699
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,420
How could you do that?

700
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,180
Other people's hard work

701
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,510
means nothing to you, does it?

702
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,300
It's just normal business operation.

703
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,040
It's also the company's strategy.

704
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,980
I know I don't have your experience.

705
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,660
But he's Yao's uncle.

706
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,380
If Anlan finds out, he'll be furious.

707
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,300
He doesn't know...

708
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,340
Why is it always about Anlan?

709
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,340
I thought you understood me.

710
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,460
Is that what you think of me?

711
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,220
I'm sorry.

712
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,980
So my uncle's restaurant

713
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,060
was sold to Jiulong Group

714
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,260
by his partner?

715
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,580
I'm sure of it.

716
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,660
When I mentioned Shi Zhengyi,

717
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,500
Jiang Ancheng looked really off.

718
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,580
We checked the menu online.

719
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,060
All three chain restaurants still have

720
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,540
your uncle's signature dishes.

721
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,860
Why would Ancheng do this?

722
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,980
Before, my uncle and I thought

723
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,380
it was Jiulong Group's strategy.

724
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,900
Unexpected.

725
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,340
Jiulong is Anlan's family business.

726
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,060
How can it be like this?

727
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,380
No matter whose company it is,

728
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,660
malicious intent can't be forgiven.

729
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,820
But this kind of practice

730
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,660
is usually done within legal bounds.

731
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,980
Anlan said,

732
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,100
talent is the greatest asset.

733
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,820
I believe he won't approve of this.

734
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,500
He won't ignore it.

735
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,460
Are you here for Shi Zhengyi?

736
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,620
You took over his business?

737
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,180
Yes.

738
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,060
He couldn't pay back his debt.

739
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,860
After evaluation,

740
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,980
we found he was not business-savvy,

741
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,100
but his choice of locations was good.

742
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,780
So I decided to take over.

743
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,740
Just because it's more profitable?

744
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
So you just watched

745
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,460
as his business failed?

746
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,300
My earlier loan was purely personal.

747
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,620
I don't decide on the investment.

748
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Didn't you also say

749
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,100
that those meant to fail

750
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,060
are destined to do so?

751
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,020
Business isn't as simple as he thinks.

752
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,940
He's completely an amateur.

753
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,820
So you're the expert?

754
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,780
When you lent him money,

755
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,220
you knew he'd fail, right?

756
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,100
Are you blaming me for helping him?

757
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,940
Or are you saying

758
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,140
I abandoned him

759
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,380
for my own gain?

760
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,340
Is that part of your reported achievements?

761
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,380
You know I left the company

762
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,140
because I couldn't stand this approach.

763
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,220
I don't need your approval.

764
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,420
But you can't mess with Yao Yuan's family.

765
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,780
Dad was right.

766
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,980
You'd question family

767
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,300
for Yao Yuan without hesitation.

768
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
Don't mix things up.

769
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,060
You shouldn't, either.

770
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,180
You repay his debts your way,

771
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,980
and I do business my way.

772
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,180
No interference.

773
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
You know about her uncle

774
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,900
falling sick, right?

775
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,460
You need to make amends.

776
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,500
If I hadn't stepped in,

777
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,700
Shi's restaurant would've shut down long ago.

778
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,140
Everyone would have been fired.

779
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,380
Do you think you're helping him?

780
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,900
You're no different than a corporate vulture.

781
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,740
Don't lecture me with your theory.

782
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,580
It doesn't apply to me.

783
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,260
Ancheng.

784
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,620
What's up?

785
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,590
It's because of Anlan.

786
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,620
He scolded me for some outsider.

787
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,420
Outsider?

788
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,700
Who?

789
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,340
That chain restaurant acquisition you led.

790
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Oh, that one.

791
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,220
You two argued

792
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,820
because of Yao Yuan's relative?

793
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,860
He even called me a corporate vulture.

794
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,540
He really said that?

795
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,540
Isn't he basically

796
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,380
calling Jiulong a vulture company?

797
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,620
Oh, man.

798
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,420
What's going on?

799
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,660
Uncle.

800
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,980
It's all because of Yao Yuan.

801
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,540
Last time,

802
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,180
we took over your uncle's restaurant.

803
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,320
Now, Anlan

804
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,520
confronted Ancheng about it.

805
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,580
I came because of her, too.

806
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,620
Don't you think

807
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,100
she looks familiar?

808
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,900
Do you remember

809
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,930
Mr. and Mrs. Yao back then?

810
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,420
Dad, when will you finish talking?

811
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,660
Soon.

812
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,180
Wait here for a moment.

813
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,020
We'll go in first.

814
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,100
Sit for a bit.

815
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,940
Alright.

816
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,060
See you.

817
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,580
You can't pull out now.

818
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,620
I'm sorry.

819
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,340
This is the company's decision.

820
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,540
This is the toughest time for us.

821
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,700
Can you give us a little more time?

822
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,140
Look,

823
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,900
we've proposed a plan to improve operations.

824
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,660
And by the way,

825
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,220
we've always

826
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,100
placed great importance

827
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,300
on employee welfare.

828
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,780
Facing this difficulty,

829
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,580
we had no choice but

830
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,740
to cancel all company benefits.

831
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,780
We've also implemented pay cuts.

832
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,660
If you'd done this from the start

833
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,980
when there were losses,

834
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
wouldn't it be solved?

835
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
It's not that simple.

836
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,860
Employees are our most valuable asset.

837
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,060
They deserve

838
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,300
the best benefits.

839
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,920
That mindset is exactly

840
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,500
why the crisis is this severe.

841
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,860
Your operational plan seems useless.

842
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,140
That's not true.

843
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,260
Everyone knows the situation.

844
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,540
No one has quit.

845
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,740
In fact, they vowed

846
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,740
to fight alongside us to the end.

847
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,300
The data says

848
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,740
recovery will

849
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,660
take a year.

850
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,420
Can you guarantee

851
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,820
they'll work just as hard

852
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,020
with pay cuts or even working without pay?

853
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,860
Of course.

854
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,180
This improvement plan

855
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,780
is based on precise calculations.

856
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,620
It's solid.

857
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,940
Please trust us.

858
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,940
Mr. Yao,

859
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,020
Mrs. Yao,

860
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,940
we've given you a chance.

861
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,380
Your operations haven't been good.

862
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,220
We only decided to withdraw investment

863
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,500
after observing for a year.

864
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,220
This is just a transition.

865
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,460
It's inevitable.

866
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,620
We will get through it.

867
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,940
Our hard work will pay off.

868
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,620
I'm sorry.

869
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,860
Please go back.

870
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,820
Dad.

871
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,460
Dad.

872
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,540
Yuan.

873
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,820
Let's go, sweetheart.

874
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,260
We're having a feast.

875
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,820
Really?

876
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,380
What's the occasion?

877
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,100
Do you think

878
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,780
their plan is viable?

879
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,300
The risk is too high.

880
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,660
I agree with Wu Wei.

881
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,660
Paperwork claims
they'll break even in six months

882
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,180
and recover in a year.

883
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,540
They attached enough confirmed actual orders.

884
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,820
But

885
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,660
clients are fickle.

886
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,420
Until orders are signed,

887
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,540
they mean nothing.

888
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,900
I feel bad for them.

889
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,140
Nothing we can do.

890
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Data rules all.

891
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,580
The Jiang family motto is simple:

892
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,380
Maximize profit, minimize risk.

893
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,620
If a company can't turn a profit

894
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,540
or feed its staff,

895
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,180
it should close down.

896
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,580
Ancheng,

897
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,220
do you understand?

898
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,340
I understand.

899
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,940
If you consider

900
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,340
every individual's plight,

901
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,180
that misplaced mercy

902
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,500
will cloud your risk assessment.

903
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,780
So it was her.

904
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
I heard

905
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,580
they had a car accident,

906
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,660
and only the daughter survived.

907
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,020
We even went to see her, right?

908
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,340
This is it.

909
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,220
Wait.

910
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,700
Give this to her.

911
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,460
I'm not going.

912
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,500
You handle it.

913
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,540
I'll wait here.

914
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,820
Hello.

915
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,180
This is a small token from our company.

916
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,380
Please accept it.

917
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,820
Here.

918
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,940
Take it.

919
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,660
Just take it.

920
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,460
Young lady,

921
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,500
it's enough

922
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,700
to support you for a while.

923
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,300
Why won't you accept it?

924
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,980
Come on, take it.

925
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,780
Take it, please.

926
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,180
Take it, please.

927
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,540
Please, take it.

928
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,780
I never expected

929
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,980
to see her again.

930
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,940
How did she end up

931
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,780
as Anlan's girlfriend?

932
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,860
No, his fiancée?

933
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,900
Looks like

934
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,020
Yao Yuan doesn't know about this.

935
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,380
No,

936
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,860
Anlan knows about it.

937
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,220
Right,

938
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,140
he found out during his internship

939
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,180
at the company.

940
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,060
He even punched me.

941
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,260
Did he love her

942
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
even then?

943
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,700
Seems like this is

944
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,740
more complicated than we thought.

945
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,700
Anlan must've

946
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,060
been watching Yao Yuan for a while.

947
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,940
I wonder how she'll react

948
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,020
when she finds out.

949
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,580
Mr. Jiang.

950
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,380
Why were you

951
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,940
stalking me?

952
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,260
I'm really sorry.

953
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,700
We didn't mean to follow you.

954
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
It's all my fault.

955
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,740
I just wanted to know

956
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,940
if you had a girlfriend.

957
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,540
So I took Yao Xinran
and Wen Cheng along to...

958
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,300
We aren't close enough for that.

959
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,900
It's my mistake.

960
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,260
I overstepped.

961
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,020
I'm sorry.

962
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,050
Save your explanations.

963
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,340
You disrespected me

964
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,140
and caused trouble.

965
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,060
Don't contact me again.

966
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,140
We shouldn't meet anymore.

967
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,020
Ancheng.

968
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,900
Please.

969
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,500
I know I was wrong in this.

970
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,780
I apologize.

971
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,100
You just said that

972
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,460
because you're upset right now.

973
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,420
You have to trust me.

974
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,780
I really didn't mean any harm.

975
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,980
Please forgive me, okay?

976
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,540
You should go.

977
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,220
Well,

978
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,500
can we still be friends?

979
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,420
Wait a minute.

980
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,100
Don't tell Yao Yuan

981
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,130
that you came here today.

982
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,580
Hey, how did it go?

983
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,420
To be honest,

984
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,820
if I were Ancheng,

985
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,980
I'd be really upset too.

986
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,900
No one likes being stalked.

987
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,020
But you don't have to feel bad.

988
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,940
Someone who does this kind of thing

989
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,180
is too calculating

990
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,860
for you to handle.

991
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,340
Don't make him sound so cunning.

992
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,060
He used to be nice to me.

993
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
You're still defending him?

994
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,780
You did mess up.

995
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,580
But you admitted it and want to change.

996
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,220
Besides, you didn't mean to cause trouble.

997
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,460
But to be fair,

998
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,380
we did cause them some trouble.

999
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,460
You silly girl,

1000
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,420
do you think Ancheng likes you?

1001
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,860
He stopped me as I left.

1002
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,380
Not to ask me to stay,

1003
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,940
he wanted me

1004
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,460
but to warn me not to tell Yao Yuan I came.

1005
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,540
Why?

1006
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,700
I don't really understand what he meant.

1007
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,340
Why keep it from Yuan?

1008
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,740
What does Yuan have to do with it?

1009
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,740
Jiulong Group.

1010
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,340
(Jiulong Group)

1011
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,580
(Jiulong Group)

1012
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,180
Jiulong Group is Jiang Enterprises.

1013
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,300
Huh?

1014
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,300
The Jiang family is the reason
Yuan's family went bankrupt.
