Xinran,

124
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,060
I know leaving now

125
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,020
probably is useless.

126
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,260
I think so, too.

127
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,060
But I don't know what else to do.

128
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,460
I think about him every day.

129
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,500
When I'm painting in the studio,

130
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,700
he's the only thing on my mind.

131
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,580
When I took the bus home,

132
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,980
I always felt like he was following me

133
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,920
as if he was always there with me.

134
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,400
I...

135
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,220
When I saw his company was in trouble,

136
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,540
I was really scared.

137
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,060
I wanted to help him,

138
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,260
but I didn't know what to do.

139
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,740
Honestly,

140
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,340
when I saw someone splash water on him,

141
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,740
I felt so upset.

142
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,420
I was heartbroken.

143
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,020
I wanted so badly to help him

144
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,940
and comfort him.

145
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,060
But I just

146
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,780
couldn't get past that block

147
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,820
in my heart.

148
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,380
I don't know what's wrong with me.

149
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,660
I really don't.

150
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
There, there.

151

- Xinran.

152
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,700
Tell me.

153
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,580

154
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,540
I won't push you anymore.

I'll support you.

157
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,180
No one will blame you.

158
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,500

I'm okay, Xinran.

162
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,300
Help me wrap the painting.

163
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,140
Sure.

164
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,820
Think positively.

165
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,620
Yuan wants to go somewhere without you.

166
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,020
That means she can't forget you.

167
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,640
As long as it's not the final moment,

168
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,520
we still have time

169
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,680
to get Yao Yuan back, right?

170
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,380
I don't want to force her.

171
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,420
If Yao Yuan really wants to leave,

172
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,860
no one can force her.

173
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,260
Eat something.

174
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,360
Without strength,
how can you win Yuan back?

175
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,140
Are you okay?

176
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,980
You look terrible.

177
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,660
I'm fine. I'll get some water.

178
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,220
He can't go on like this.

179
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,140
He's burning the candle at both ends.

180
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,020
Both his company and Yuan are worrisome.

181
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,340
I'm worried about his health.

182
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,860
Doctor, how is he?

183
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,060
Haven't I told you?

184
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,620
Anlan can't overwork himself.

185
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,500
He's coughing

186
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,200
and having a persistent high fever.

187
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,220
These are signs of a lung infection.

188
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,580
With his condition,

189
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,320
lung complications
are the biggest concern.

190
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,380
So,

191
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,820
we'll decide after some tests.

192
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,780
Get him admitted to the hospital.

193
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Notify the family.

194
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,780
It's all my fault.

195
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,820
I was too caught up
with Wang Xing's matters

196
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,220
to notice he was feeling unwell.

197
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,380
You go tell Jiang Ancheng.

198
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,580
I'll stay here with him.

199
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll be out for a bit.

200
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,980
Are you going to finish this painting?

201
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,020
I don't want to finish it,

202
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,180
so I brought it back from the studio.

203
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,660
But you can't bear to throw it away.

204
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,660
(Su Wen)

205
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,340
Hello?

206
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,180
Hey, Yao Yuan.

207
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,980
Well...

208
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,440
Jiang has been hospitalized.

209
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,460
Hospitalized? Why?

210
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,140
He has a persistent high fever.

211
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,300
The doctor suspects pneumonia.

212
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,560
Why don't you come over?

213
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,900
Okay, I'm on my way.

214
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,700
What's going on?

215
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,120
Anlan has been hospitalized.

216
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,340
We've confirmed that Anlan's condition

217
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,820
is a high fever caused by pneumonia.

218
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,300
He needs to stay here

219
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,540
under observation for two days.

220
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,940
If the fever breaks,

221
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,020
he'll be fine.

222
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,940
But if the high fever continues,

223
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,500
it could

224
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,340
be very dangerous.

225
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,420
How did he get so sick?

226
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,060
Maybe

227
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,100
he was exhausted.

228
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,500
His body

229
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,500
and mind have been under huge stress.

230
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,420
Too much pressure

231
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,100
weakens his immunity.

232
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,500
And also,

233
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,540
he even got caught in the rain
a few days ago.

234
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,460
Caught in the rain?

235
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,100
What happened?

236
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,050
This...

237
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,740
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,140
It's my fault.

239
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,500
I was the one who caused Anlan

240
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,540
to get caught in the rain.

241
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,940
It was because of you?

242
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,240
Anlan got caught in the rain
because of you?

243
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,380
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
I'm really sorry.

245
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,780
You know he has pulmonary encephalopathy

246
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,740
and can't catch
even the slightest chill.

247
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,580
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,220
If it gets worse,
he could fall into a coma.

249
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,780
I honestly didn't know.

250
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,880
I really didn't know.

251
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,320
If I'd known, I'd never have let him
get caught in the rain.

252
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,700
We didn't know about his disease.

254
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
You're his girlfriend.

255
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,900
Didn't you know?

256
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,740
- How can you say that?
- What are you doing?

257
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,320
If Jiang kept it a secret on purpose...

258
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,500
Why would he hide it?

259
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,780
Isn't it because he cared
about your feelings?

260
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,820
Now, for you,

261
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,180
he's even risking his life.

262
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,660
How could you let my son

263
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,340
end up like this?

264
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,380
Anlan has been fine

265
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,500
for years.

266
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,580
And now, because of you,

267
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,580
look at what he's become.

268
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,420
Mom,

269
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,660
calm down.

270
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,820
I really regret it.

271
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,780
So many people warned me

272
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,300
not to let you get close to Anlan.

273
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,060
Why didn't I listen?

274
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,760
Mom, please don't be like this.

275
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,180
You should rest early.

276
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,340
If you fall ill when Anlan wakes up,

277
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,540
how will you take care of him?

278
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,620
Let's go.

279
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,900
Yao.

280
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,100
Mrs. Jiang is just upset.

281
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,700
She's just so worried about Anlan.

282
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,500
I'm fine.

283
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,660
Go comfort her now.

284
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,220
Go ahead.

285
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,060
It's okay, Yuan.

286
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,220
Xinran.

287
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,180
Don't cry anymore.

288
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,700
Alright, stop crying.

289
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,820
He'll be fine.

290
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,140
What's wrong with you?

291
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,480
Do you need to go to the hospital?

292
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,000
Hey, what's wrong with you?

293
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll have someone
deliver these to you tomorrow.

294
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,410
Do you need to go to the hospital?

295
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,900
Didn't you buy these for yourself?

296
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,780
I like collecting empty cans.

297
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,980
Hey.

298
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,660
- Are you okay?
- Why collect empty cans?

299
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,880
To stack them into towers.

300
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,320
Are you trying
to fill up your big house?

301
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh, my god.

302
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,700
Darling, your tongue is getting sharper.

303
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,740
You're just bullying me

304
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,020
because I like you.

305
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,860
- Have you heard this?
- What?

306
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,420
Hitting means love; scolding means care.

307
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,100
True love even involves a kick.

308
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,500
I haven't even kicked you yet.

309
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,260
I wish I had never met you.

310
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,490
Yao Yuan.

311
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,780
Yao Yuan!

312
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Sir, we'll take one.

313
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Two.

314
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,540
I don't have free hands.

315
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,340
We're outside the department store.

316
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,140
Yao Yuan.

317
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,140
Yao Yuan.

318
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,180
(Why does life
have to test me like this?)

319
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,560
The boss is always too hard on himself.

320
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,380
He always hides his discomfort,

321
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,500
so it's always serious

322
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,860
when it gets noticed.

323
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,580
It's all my fault.

324
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,740
I was wrong.

325
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,780
I never stopped to think about him.

326
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,620
I was always stuck in my own emotions.

327
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,820
I never considered Anlan's feelings.

328
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,780
Yuan,

329
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,340
Anlan will surely wake up for you.

330
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,540
Let's go home first, okay?

331
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
I'm not leaving.

332
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,540
When Anlan wakes up,

333
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,940
he'll surely want to see me right away.

334
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,300
I have to wait for him here.

335
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,620
I...

336
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,980
I'm going to wait here

337
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,820
for him to wake up.

338
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,860
His family is coming soon.

339
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,460
They might say something rude to you.

340
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,900
We should head back now.

341
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm not leaving.

342
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,240
I need to stop by his place

343
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,000
to bring some things
for the hospital stay.

344
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,380
Why don't you join me?

345
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,980
Once we're sure no one's around,

346
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,620
I'll let you know so you can visit him.

347
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,580
Right, let's go for now.

348
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,500
Yuan, you go upstairs first.

349
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
I'll head to the kitchen.

350
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
I'll be up soon.

351
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,300
What happened here?

352
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,620
The boss has been taking
Chinese herbal medicine.

353
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,860
I was worried he might catch a cold

354
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,740
because there was a chance

355
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,020
that he might not wake up again.

356
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,300
It was Chinese herbal medicine...

357
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,420
What are you drinking?

358
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,540
Coffee.

359
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,860
Why are you so startled?

360
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,860
I can't believe it.

361
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,820
How could I be so careless?

362
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,740
How did I not notice anything at all?

363
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,140
Yuan, don't blame yourself.

364
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,700
The boss didn't want to worry you,

365
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,300
so he was

366
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,440
secretly taking the medicine.

367
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,980
It's okay.

368
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,300
He'll get better.

369
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,820
I'll go upstairs

370
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,380
and pack his clothes.

371
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,660
Sure.

372
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,360
♪The future is like misty morning light♪

373
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,690

I just barely avoided a car crash.

381
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,460
They say when you're close to death,

382
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,820
memories you care about
flash before your eyes.

383
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,460
What flashed before me

384
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,220
were moments spent with you.

385
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,260
There wasn't a single painful memory.

386
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,420
But right then,

387
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,380
I felt a deep regret,

388
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,760
because I hadn't earned

389
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,820
your forgiveness.

390
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,180
If I really died here,

391
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,580
what would you do?

392
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,100
You're still mad at me.

393
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,260
You can't hit or scold me.

394
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,380
You can't vent your anger on anyone.

395
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,980
How could I face you then?

396
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,760
I can't make you struggle

Is Jiang feeling better?

413
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,160
He's still unconscious.

414
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,540
The high fever hasn't gone down.

415
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
Jiang,

416
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,140
please, get better.

417
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,340
Dad,

418
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,740
Anlan will be fine.

419
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,620
You need to eat something.

420
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,940
Since we found out
about Anlan's illness,

421
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,100
your mom and I have been so worried.

422
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,940
So many years have passed,

423
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,600
and he's been doing well.

424
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,720
Sometimes, I even wonder

425
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,400
whether doctors misdiagnosed him.

426
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,540
What happened to him?

427
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,640
Dad,

428
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,580
rest assured.

429
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,120
Anlan has been taking
Chinese herbal medicine regularly.

430
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Even with this relapse,

431
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,220
he'll recover soon.

432
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,420
Wang Xing has been found.

433
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,620
I didn't want you two
to worry about this project.

434
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,940
So, I sent someone to look into it.

435
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,420
A few years ago, Wang Xing

436
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,820
did complete several solid projects.

437
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,660
You could say we got rich overnight.

438
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,220
He also built

439
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,940
a good company image.

440
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,200
But you overlooked one thing.

441
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,740
Did you know he changed his name?

442
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,620
No wonder.

443
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,700
Li Ao checked him many times,

444
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,940
but there were no bad records.

445
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,300
The projects he worked on

446
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,100
with major corporations
went very smoothly.

447
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,180
After a deeper investigation,

448
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,820
we found
that before he changed his name,

449
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,980
most of the projects he was involved in

450
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,540
ended up in lawsuits.

451
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,360
I was planning to bring you two in
to discuss our strategy.

452
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,260
But Anlan fell ill.

453
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,220
Don't worry, Dad.

454
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,020
Anlan worked hard for Ruishi.

455
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,640
I'll figure out a way.

456
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,860
Also,

457
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,220
now that Wang Xing is back,

458
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,340
he must have thought of a way

459
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,140
to get himself out of this mess.

460
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,300
From my gut feeling,

461
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,300
this guy isn't exactly trustworthy

462
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,060
in business.

463
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,420
Be careful handling this.

464
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,860
I got it.

465
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
Wang Xing

466
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,700
always makes me uneasy.

467
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,820
Especially you.

468
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,960
You need to be careful.

469
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,500
Sure.

470
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,060
Ancheng,

471
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,940
this project has become a hot potato.

472
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,880
Are you sure about this?

473
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,500
I can't turn a blind eye now.

474
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,180
I get it.

475
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,680
You two have a deep brotherly bond.

476
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
But if you mess this up,

477
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,140
it could hurt your chances
at becoming the general manager.

478
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,900
Chen, please notify
the relevant team for a meeting.

479
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,280
Now that Wang Xing has been found,

480
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,760
even if it takes a few all-nighters,

481
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,880
we have to find a solution.

482
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,020
Ancheng.

483
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,860
Ancheng?

484
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,660
The boss is awake.

485
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,060
How are you feeling, Anlan?

486
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,000
Are you feeling better?

487
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,500
Why am I in the hospital?

488
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,540
How long have I been asleep?

489
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,380
Not long.

490
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,420
Just a few days.

491
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,200
I'll go get the doctor

492
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,380
and inform Yuan.

493
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,540
Are you thirsty?

494
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,580
I'll pour you some water.

495
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,260
Ancheng.

496
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,980
You've been staying with me?

497
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,100
Mom has been here even more.

498
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,560
I have work to do, after all.

499
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,900
I keep feeling

500
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,580
that I somehow caused this.

501
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
It's not your fault
that my health was weak.

502
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,020
If I hadn't told Yao Yuan...

503
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,620
Ancheng.

504
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,660
Don't say anymore.

505
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,460
I've always believed

506
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,220
that Yao Yuan and I can overcome this.

507
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,800
I stopped blaming you a long time ago.

508
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,060
After all, you're my brother.

509
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,020
That smells amazing.

510
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,730
What made you think of cooking soup?

511
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,280
Li Ao said Anlan has woken up.

512
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,650
I want to make him some soup
to help him recover.

513
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,040
Xinran, what are you doing?

514
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,780
If you keep weighing these,

515
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,520
Anlan will be discharged
before you finish.

516
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,880
The book says it has to be precise.

517
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,310
One extra date can change
the effect completely.

518
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,080
You're putting in so much effort,

519
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,920
but his family won't appreciate it.

520
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,740
This soup will be in vain.

521
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,900
I don't care.

522
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,240
I just want to take care of Anlan now.

523
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,140
(Li Ao)

524
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,300
Yuan,

525
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,860
no one's here now; You can come over.

526
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,940
I can go now.

527
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,340
Hey, you forgot your apron.

528
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,620
And the soup.

529
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,860
You go ahead.

530
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,300
I'll bring the soup over to you.

531
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,980
You really scared everyone.

532
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,260
We've been taking turns
watching over you.

533
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,540
We're worried you won't wake up.

534
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,620
What about Yao Yuan? Did she come?

535
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,580
Of course.

536
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,700
She came right away.

537
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,860
She stayed by your side,
refusing to leave.

538
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,580
She's not here now

539
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,440
because your family
doesn't want to see her.

540
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,900
I'll go see her.

541
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,740
Hey, hey.

542
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,100
Don't rush; you're still unwell.

543
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,460
I've informed her.

544
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,820
She's on her way.

545
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,540
Do I look okay?

546
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,660
You look fine.

547
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,980
Just like a patient.

548
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,060
Aunt.

549
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,460
Aunt.

550
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,180
Your mom hasn't been sleeping well

551
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,460
because of you.

552
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,900
She just fell asleep,
so we didn't wake her up.

553
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,940
Yeah, everyone was so worried.

554
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,680
Sorry for making you worry.

555
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm glad that you're fine.

556
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,440
The doctor said you need plenty of rest.

557
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,510
(Yao Yuan)
Don't worry about the company.

558
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,290
(Yuan, where are you?)
We're working on it.

559
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,380
Right, Li Ao?

560
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
Yes, that's right.

561
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,840
We're taking care of it.

562
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,700
(Yao Yuan)
Anlan,

563
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,410
- it was so serious.
- Yuan, where are you?

564
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,420
So, I've decided

565
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
to take leave
and be your special caregiver.

566
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
I even brought you lots of supplements.

567
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,780
What would you like?

568
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,420
Here's some Reishi spore powder.

569
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,260
Okay, enough with that.

570
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,980
I don't dare let you be my caregiver.

571
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,460
I might end up caring for you instead.

572
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,580
How about having an apple?

573
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,420
Okay.

574
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,100
Okay.

575
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,260
Thank you, Aunt.

576
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,780
No need, we're family.

577
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,020
Getting better soon
is what matters most.

578
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,740
Jianing,

579
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,690
please find a caregiver

580
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,960
for Anlan.

581
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,700
Yuan, what's with your outfit?

582
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,860
It's nothing.

583
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,180
Is he feeling any better?

584
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,140
Can he get out of bed? Is he eating?

585
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,660
He's upstairs.

586
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,500
Go ask him yourself.

587
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,220
Darling.

588
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,260

Why haven't I been able
to see you lately?

Why are the factory workers

620
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,220
going to Ruishi to negotiate?

621
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,660
I'm busy negotiating
with the patent panel.

622
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,620
Otherwise,

623
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,060
everything would just be empty talk.

624
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,660
Does this patent belong to you?

00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,660
Yes.

626
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,820
If you want to produce the product,

627
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,980
you have to be willing to pay the price.

628
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,260
Name your price.

629
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,280
Ten million US dollars.

630
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,540
Take it or leave it.

631
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,380
Why don't you just go rob a bank?

632
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,380
Wang Xing's previous records show

633
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,980
your patent was valued
at no more than three million.

634
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,620
Is this price

635
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,060
reasonable now?

636
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,980
When you first approached me,

637
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,900
my eco-friendly plastic technology

638
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,340
had patents in 15 countries.

639
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,500
But now,

640
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,460
I've got environmental certification

641
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,500
in over 30 countries.

642
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,440
It's only natural

643
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,690
that my price goes up.

644
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,900
That's right.

645
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,660
Ancheng,

646
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,380
few companies bid
for this patent before,

647
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,300
but now,

648
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,490
many more have joined.

649
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,430
Even international companies
are competing,

650
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,060
so it's normal for the price to rise.

651
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,660
Exactly.

652
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,780
It's your call.

653
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,980
Anyway,

654
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,280
there are plenty of buyers.

655
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,910
Fine.

656
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,500
Then I quit.

657
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,617
Ancheng.

658
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,403
Ancheng.

659
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,820
There must be room to negotiate.

660
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,180
Besides,

661
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,900
if you don't secure this patent today,

662
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,040
who can guarantee
the quality of future products?

663
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,180
Alright then.

664
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Since you are

665
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,380
the first company to approach me,

666
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,620
I'll settle

667
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,060
for eight million.

668
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,940
Sounds good.

669
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,860
That number works.

670
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,500
It also symbolizes
our partnership will thrive.

671
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,660
Ancheng,

672
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,960
think it over carefully.

673
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,820
After all,
this is a multinational patent.

674
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,780
In the long run, it's a good deal.

675
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,060
The few environmental companies bidding

676
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,260
are our direct competitors.

677
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,500
They're not friendly,

678
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,620
but that doesn't mean

679
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,240
I don't have ways
to find out about them.

680
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,020
Chen,

681
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,000
please do some digging.

682
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,300
Sure.

683
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,000
You should understand.

684
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,600
I'm doing this to save your face.

685
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,300
Hey.

686
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,470
I've heard what you said.

687
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,500
Do you want it or not?

688
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,600
At most, three million.

689
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,260
Hey, Mr. Wang,

690
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,380
didn't you promise a good price

691
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,700
for us to work well?

692
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,340
Can this really work?

693
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,340
Don't get upset.

694
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,580
Let's talk this through.

695
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,740
I'll give you time to discuss.

696
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,780
Also,

697
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,980
if I find out again

698
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,570
that you leak false rumors to the media,

699
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,430
you'll be receiving our legal letter.

700
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,020
Hey, Ancheng.

701
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,820
I'm planning to sue Wang Xing for fraud.

702
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,620
Anlan signed all the project contracts.

703
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,500
At worst, you just mismanaged.

704
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,250
Everything is your personal loss.

705
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,240
Last time, I didn't stop you
from helping Ruishi,

706
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,380
but this time,

707
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,900
you used Jiulong's resources.

708
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,780
How does that benefit the group?

709
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,780
Besides,

710
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,060
we still have two other projects

711
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,100
that need to be launched.

712
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,900
This will slow down our progress.

713
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,540
Work based on data; profits come first.

714
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,420
I know that better than anyone.

715
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,580
But if we don't handle Wang Xing,

716
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,220
I'm not in the mood
to deal with other projects.

717
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,620
Here, have some fruit.

718
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,260
Ancheng,

719
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,760
I've heard about Wang Xing.

720
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,140
Thanks.

721
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,130
No need; we're brothers.

722
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,660
Besides,

723
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,370
I should apologize

724
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,920
for the product failure.

725
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,450
You just made a split-second decision
not to tell me.

726
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,820
The nurse told me you stayed here
waiting for me to wake up.

727
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,140
So, on that note,

728
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,620
let's call it even.

729
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,190
She even asked me in secret
if you're single.

730
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,500
Ancheng,

731
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,940
if we'd been born into a normal family,

732
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,480
these conflicts might disappear, right?

733
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,380
We'd surely be a lot happier,

734
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,140
free from family pressures,

735
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,920
living life on our own terms.

736
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,500
I want you to know

737
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,740
that we all see the sacrifices
you've made for the family.

738
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,460
Ancheng,

739
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,980
come on.

740
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,180
Congrats on graduating from high school.

741
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,300
- Thanks.
- Here.

742
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,260
Ancheng,

743
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,660
what are your plans for the future?

744
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,460
Which field do you want to study?

745
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,300
I've applied to schools abroad.

746
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,920
That's what I like to hear.

747
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,340
A boy in our family

748
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,580
has to experience life overseas

749
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,020
to truly become a man.

750
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,100
Exactly.

751
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,580
Great, which country?

752
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,620
Is it the US or Switzerland?

753
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,800
It's the University of Bordeaux
in France.

754
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,220
A school specializing in wine.

755
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,780
I want to become a sommelier.

756
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,100
Whatever you study,
I'll be happy for you.

757
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,220
If you take your passion to the extreme,

758
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,820
you could also make it your profession.

759
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,020
Biyun,

760
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,380
don't take this seriously.

761
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,740
He's just joking with us.

762
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,580
I'm not joking.

763
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,620
I'm serious.

764
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,860
Ancheng,

765
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,460
if you like studying wine,

766
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,500
you can use it for amusement.

767
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,220
But if you want to make it a career...

768
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,940
I'm warning you:

769
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,220
It's not a good idea.

770
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,020
Dad,

771
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,940
you don't understand.

772
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,640
There's a lot to know about wine.

773
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,020
Ancheng,

774
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,840
why not share what you told me
with everyone?

775
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,460
Every grape has its unique personality,

776
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,660
just like people.

777
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,700
Different temperatures
and fermentation times

778
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,740
can change its flavor.

779
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,140
Each bottle of wine has its story.

780
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,480
It's really fascinating.

781
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,940
See? He's done his homework.

782
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,820
Ancheng,

783
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,460
having dreams is a good thing.

784
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,580
But I feel

785
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,680
that's a bit unrealistic.

786
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,340
You're the eldest boy of our family.

787
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,340
In the future,

788
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,660
we'll need you

789
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,020
