One bud with two leaves.

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,020
If you split these two leaves apart,

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,720
you'll see the bud

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,660
is actually connected.

37
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,820
So,

38
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,700
two people with no connection at all

39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,500
can still form a bond over a cup of tea.

40
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,540
Yeah, exactly.

41
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,380
Yuan, here you are.

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,660
I made some warm ginger tea for you two.

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,540
Drink a little.

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,660
Thank you, Grandma.

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,340
Drink more, okay?

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,060
Yuan,

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,260
why don't you stay for dinner?

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,580
I want to, but I really can't.

49
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,140
We still have to go back
and prepare some materials.

50
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,860
Is that so?

51
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,460
Grandma, please don't worry.

52
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,900
Once this order is done,

53
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,140
Yuan will come back
and treat you to a big meal.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,780
Right, Grandma.

55
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,500
I'll take you out
for something delicious.

56
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,740
Let's go to Uncle's shop,

57
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,100
and support him, okay?

58
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,940
Okay.

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,900
Drink up quickly.

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,540
- Have some.
- Drink it.

68

to present their proposal.

Our theme this time is besties.

73
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,180
We want to use a youthful vibe

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,660
to challenge the usual
stereotypes about tea drinks.

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,500
How can she say that
with such a straight face?

76
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,980
Shameless.

77
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,740
Every girl has her unique side.

78
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,900
Just like this tea leaf

79
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,700
used to brew Xiduomeng Tea.

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,700
With the change of seasons,

81
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,950
it shifts into different flavors.

82
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,980
Even the most unique girl can find

83
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,740
her best friend amid the crowd.

84
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,900
Like the many flavors of Xiduomeng Tea,

85
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,820
you're sure to find one you love.

to present their proposal.

(Xiduomeng Tea Proposal Report)
Our theme is time.

92
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,580
Time flows gently.

93
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,780
Your mother you haven't seen in years

94
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,660
have got a few more wrinkles.

95
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,660
Your childhood friends
who've married and started families

96
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,260
become strangers to you
when you reunite.

97
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
But some people,

98
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,060
keep doing the same thing.

99
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,180
(Time)

100
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,060
They head to the plantation at dawn,

101
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,460
only returning home when the sun sets.

102
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,220
These are the tea farmers

103
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,140
who bring us Xiduomeng Tea.

104
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,700
They've lived their youth
in the tea plantation,

105
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,900
growing up and aging alongside it.

106
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,500
Through time's trials and blessings,

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,380
their lives have deepened with meaning.

108
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,420
Each leaf they harvest

109
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,180
carries traces of time's refining.

110
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,140
Time also proves
many things remain unchanged,

111
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,820
like the tea farmer couple's

112
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,580
fearless dedication to their family.

113
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,700
Yes, we want to return
to simplicity and innocence.

114
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,300
The aroma tea leaves give off

115
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,620
reflects Xiduomeng Tea's
commitment to quality.

116
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,820
Can we see a few more concept photos?

117
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,020
No problem.

118
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,820
Thank you.

119
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,900
What if in the future,

120
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,280
only one of us achieves the dream?

121
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,090
What about the other then?

122
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,220
Here's the deal.

123
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,980
If you achieve it, you marry me.

124
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,180
If I do, I'll marry you.

125
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,980
If we both succeed,

126
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,180
then there's no problem at all.

127
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,740
Sir,

128
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,100
this concludes our presentation

129
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,180
for Xiduomeng Tea.

130
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,620
We need some time to decide.

131
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,870
Okay.

132
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,180
I'll let you know the results.

133
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,700
Thanks, everyone.

134
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
Aren't you going for her?

135
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,020
No. We've already talked it out.

136
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,220
But I think I caught a flicker

137
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,100
in your eyes just now.

138
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,540
A flicker of what?

139
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,740
Regret.

140
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,260
Mr. Su Wen, hello.

141
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,220
Congratulations on
joining Xiduomeng Tea.

142
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,780
We look forward to working with you.

143
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,140
Everyone's worked hard lately.

144
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,820
It's because of all your efforts

145
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,780
that we successfully secured

146
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,260
the Xiduomeng Tea case.

147
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,900
Of course, special thanks to Su Wen,

148
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,060
and Mr. Jiang from Ruishi
for their support.

149
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,900
Thanks to Yao Yuan for her dedication,

150
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,190
and Grandma's support.

151
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,460
Cheers.

152
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,020
Cheers.

153
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,020
I've done a lot too, you know.

154
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,780
But Anlan only knows to praise her.

155
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,540
Hey, you're great too.

156
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,980
Everyone sees how much you've done.

157
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,300
I see it too.

158
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,180
Nobody cares about you.

159
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,900
Hey, Jiang.

160
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,340
How are you going to thank me?

161
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,640
- Thank you?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,620
Honestly, I think you're
at least not a total loss.

163
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,860
Come on.

164
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,100
Take this opportunity,

165
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,020
let's all have a drink.

166
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,900
Come on, have a drink.

167
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,780
I don't drink.

168
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,340
No worries, just have a drink.

169
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,540
Yao Yuan.

170
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,060
Surprisingly, you came up
with such warm-hearted

171
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,500
and creative ideas.

172
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,140
No wonder you're with Mr. Jiang.

173
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,180
Yeah, this time it's all
thanks to you and Su Wen.

174
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,260
Come on, let's all raise a glass to you.

175
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,620
I'm not very good at drinking.

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,980
Come on, let's drink
at such a happy occasion.

177
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,420
Just a little.

178
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,940
I'll drink.

179
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,620
Boss,

180
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,540
we've never seen you drink
at company dinners.

181
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Are you acting all brave

182
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,660
because your girlfriend's here?

183
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,820
Acting brave?

184
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,820
Only weak people do that.

185
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,260
Pour the drinks.

186
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,940
Here you go, Boss.

187
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,740
Come on, I'll drink with you.

188
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,300
Come on, I'll drink with you all.

189
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,150
Let me show off a bit
in front of Yao Yuan.

190
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,820
Come on, come on.

191
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
Cheers.

192
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
Drink less.

193
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,820
I've heard about you long ago, Mr. Su.

194
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,740
I'm really glad to be working with you.

195
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,220
It's my honor to collaborate with you.

196
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,500
For this case,

197
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,420
we'll head to Lijiang
for on-location filming.

198
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,740
We won't be selecting models.

199
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,940
What we're shooting is

200
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,220
the locals at work
in their natural state.

201
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,700
Great, I'm really excited about this.

202
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,140
Thank you.

203
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,710
Sorry about that.

204
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,560
It's fine.

205
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,620
(Cui Xi)

206
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
I've decided to leave.

207
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,300
I hope we never cross paths again.

208
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,180
Whose place is this?

209
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,780
Yours, yours.

210
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,540
Take care, take care.

211
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,340
I'm fine.

212
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,340
I'm fine.

213
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,380
This...

214
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,500
This place is way too fancy.

215
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,540
Don't be surprised yet.

216
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,660
Let's get Boss upstairs first.

217
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,180
Take care, take care.

218
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,300
Why is he so heavy?

219
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,530
Careful, careful.

220
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,830
Watch out, here.

221
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,720
Which way?

222
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,690
Turn on the light.

223
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,850
This way.

224
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,960
Slow down, slow down.

225
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,940
Be careful.

226
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,790
Slow down.

227
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,020
We're still here.

228
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,380
Yuan, we'll head out first.

229
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,540
Boss handles his drink well.

230
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,500
He just has a cute little quirk.

231
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,420
What? Cute?

232
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,700
What's so cute about that?

233
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,540
Ao,

234
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,460
I'll just

235
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,980
stay here tonight.

236
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,020
Sure.

237
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,460
If you don't want to be

238
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,620
kicked out early tomorrow,

239
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,460
I'm not against it.

240
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,940
Let's go.

241
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,220
Ao, I gotta ask you,

242
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,220
what's Master's cute little quirk?

243
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,780
Yuan,

244
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,380
I want some water.

245
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,820
I'm thirsty.

246
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,180
Please, can you get me some water?

247
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,060
Okay, okay.

248
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,580
I'll go

249
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,540
get water for you.

250
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,660
Wait for me a sec.

251
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,340
Yuan.

252
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,100
Yuan.

253
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,860
Drink some water.

254
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,220
Have some water.

255
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,060
Just drink a little.

256
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,740
My water.

257
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,060
Yuan.

258
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,060
I'll give everything for you.

259
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,860
I will too.

260
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,340
Why did you come?

261
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,380
I came,

262
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,700
but you're leaving.

263
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,740
Cui Xi.

264
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,020
Why leave so suddenly?

265
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,860
Because I see no reason to stay.

266
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,020
This time you came back,

267
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,100
was it really for me?

268
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,660
You're different now.

269
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,780
The more I like you,
the more pressure I feel.

270
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,060
We both love photography.

271
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,420
When we were together,

272
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,420
I couldn't help but get competitive.

273
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,540
It's a mix of admiration
and competition.

274
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,820
But when I realized my talent

275
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,020
wasn't as good as yours,

276
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,140
I started feeling scared.

277
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,380
I feared I'd drift
further away from you.

278
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,180
You know,

279
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,780
I actually don't care.

280
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,860
But I still do care.

281
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,180
I'm afraid I can't measure up to you.

282
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,580
What I want

283
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,980
is your confidence and your shine.

284
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,860
I wish that one day,

285
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,260
you could look at me
the way I look at you.

286
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,780
But that's never happened.

287
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,820
I have.

288
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,220
Do you remember

289
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,660
the times we chased our dreams together?

290
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,580
Those were the happiest moments for me.

291
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,100
I guess deep in your heart,

292
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
you feel the same.

293
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,140
Back then, you were full of confidence.

294
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,460
I stood behind you,

295
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,380
feeling I could never catch up.

296
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,100
To be honest,

297
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
sometimes I doubted
my own photography skills.

298
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,780
We were just afraid to face the reality.

299
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,220
But in the end,

300
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,020
we have to face it.

467
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,460

00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,300

469
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,860

- Come on in.
- Have a seat.

Thanks, Jianing.

481
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,500
Thanks for rushing back from Europe.

482
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,820
I had to

483
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,740
fly over for your dad's birthday today.

484
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,780
Right, Wenhua.

485
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,180
You can't keep pushing your son

486
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,500
to inherit the family business.

487
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,620
You should be thinking about getting

488
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,780
grandkids for yourself sooner.

489
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,180
Why rush about grandchildren like that?

490
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,540
Wenhua,

491
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,380
you're really lucky.

492
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,260
I heard Ancheng has been

493
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,740
handling things solo at the company.

494
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,300
He's very capable.

495
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,420
You shouldn't

496
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,740
always spoil him.

497
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,060
If you keep praising him,

498
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,100
he'll just gloat.

499
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,020
I'm not praising him.

500
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,140
Thank you so much.

501
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,460
So, how's the European trip going?

502
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,100
Sorry, I need to take this.

503
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,080
Alright.

504
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,140
Go inside, please.

505
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,970
- Okay.
- Please come in.

506
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,940
Hello.

507
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,420
What's going on with you?

508
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,830
All the guests have arrived.

509
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,060
Yao Yuan is sick with a fever.

510
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,700
I probably won't make it today.

511
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,700
She's sick?

512
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,780
Is it serious?

513
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,060
Can you come over?

514
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,900
Please tell Dad I'm sorry.

515
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,340
Even if I rush back, you'll have
already wrapped things up.

516
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,660
Yao Yuan and I will go
make it up to him.

517
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,030
- Wenhua.
- Okay, got it.

518
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,140
Mom.

519
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,980
Mom, Dad.

520

522
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,780
Wenhua.

523
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,420
It's rare for you
to celebrate your birthday here.

524
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900

526
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,380
Grandpa, Grandma.

527
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,230
Ancheng.

528
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,500
Mom and Dad are here, it's about time.

529
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,380
Let's take our seats.

530
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,220
- Let's sit.
- Okay.

531
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,760
- Let's go.
- Help Dad along.

532
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,420
Where's your brother?

533
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,140
He got held up

534
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,980
with something.

535
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,340
Everyone,

536
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,940
it's rare that we all put work aside,

537
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
and get together

538
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,700
on my birthday.

539
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,180
Thank you.

540
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,340
Happy birthday!

541
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,180
Cheers!

542
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,710
Happy birthday!

543
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,180
Ancheng put so much effort

544
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,780
into this birthday party

545
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,980
and brought us all together.

546
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,180
Yeah, yeah.

547
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,300
Exactly.

548
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,860
Ancheng really went all out

549
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,980
just

550
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,380
to gather us.

551
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
And that's not all.

552
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,220
Ancheng put a lot of thought

553
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,540
into tonight's dishes and wine

554
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,660
so that we could have a great time.

555
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,580
That's what I should do

556
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,620
for Dad's birthday.

557
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,100
Wenhua,

558
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,460
Ancheng is

559
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,620
such a thoughtful kid.

560
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
He's always

561
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,940
so serious and responsible.

562
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,780
Everyone here

563
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,700
has high hopes for him.

564
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,820
Honestly, it's enviable.

565
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,940
Unlike my family,

566
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,780
my two sons

567
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,380
are surrounded by gossip.

568
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,540
They lack ability,

569
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,660
and want to split the family.

570
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,430
I wish they had even
half of Ancheng's qualities.

571
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,940
Ancheng,

572
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,020
did you hear that?

573
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,700
They rarely give compliments.

574
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,260
Well done.

575
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,260
Thanks, Dad.

576
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,820
Thank you all.

577
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,140
I'll keep working hard.

578
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,180
Come on.

579
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,940
Good.

580
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Strange.

581
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,300
Where's Anlan?

582
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,740
Oh?

583
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,580
Yeah.

584
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,380
I wanted to drink with Anlan.

585
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,820
Everyone in the business circle

586
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,180
is talking about him.

587
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,100
Some say,

588
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,260
staying safe at home is tough.

589
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,900
But,

590
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
if you don't see the world,

591
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,140
how do you understand startup struggles

592
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,580
and defend the home?

593
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,620
If there's a chance,

594
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,900
I still have to work with them.

595
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,860
I'll thank you on Anlan's behalf.

596
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,620
Why isn't Anlan

597
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,900
back home yet?

598
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,260
It's his dad's 60th birthday,
how could he be late?

599
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,260
Yeah.

600
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Where's Anlan?

601
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,900
Dad,

602
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,740
maybe something's holding him up.

603
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,100
Mom.

604
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,540
He just called and said

605
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,020
he probably won't make it today.

606
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,820
He can't even make it
to his own father's birthday.

607
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,500
That's kind of hard to accept.

608
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,340
This kid always does things his own way.

609
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,300
But what could be
more important than his dad?

610
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,500
Come on, come on,

611
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,300
let's eat and chat together.

612
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,420
Birthdays are meant
to be happy and joyful.

613
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,580
Everyone, dig in.

614
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,340
I'll check with him in a bit

615
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,340
and ask why he hasn't shown up.

616
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,100
Wenhua,

617
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,540
today is your birthday,

618
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,820
so you have to be happy.

619
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,380
Come on, happy birthday!

620
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,980
- Have a great time.
- Thanks, Mom.

621
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,980
Happy birthday.

622
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,140
Alright, thanks, everyone.

623
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,060
Let's raise our glasses.

624
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,060
- Sure.
- Come on, cheers.

625
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,260
Let's eat without him.

626
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,380
Everyone, start eating.

627
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,220
Okay, okay.

628
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,020
Come on, have some dishes.

629
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,050
Your fever is finally gone.

630
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,340
How could you skip

631
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,060
your dad's birthday party for me?

632
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,620
Don't worry.

633
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,220
I've talked to my brother.

634
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,900
Dad will understand.

635
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,660
He won't understand.

636
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,420
Parents don't say anything,

637
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,300
but deep down, they really care about

638
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,180
whether their kids

639
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,660
truly have them in their hearts.

640
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,220
No matter what, you have to go today.

641
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,290
Alright.

642
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,020
I'll change and head over.

643
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,820
I'm fine, you should hurry up and go.

644
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,860
Otherwise, it'll be over.

645
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,340
Okay, I'm going then.

646
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,540
Go on.

647
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,820
I'm off. Happy birthday.

648
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,180
Thanks, I appreciate it.

649
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,220
Mr. Jiang.

650
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,100
Thanks for your hospitality.

651
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,340
You're welcome.

652
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,740
Have a great birthday.

653
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,220
All the best to you.

654
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,260
Let me tell you,

655
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,180
this wine today is...

656
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,180
Good.

657
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,700
I'll have Ancheng send you two cases.

658
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,420
Ancheng,

659
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,500
today,

660
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,740
you really impressed me.

661
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,020
Now that your career's taking off,

662
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,140
when are you planning to settle down?

663
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,380
Dad,

664
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,740
why do you always ask people that?

665
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,020
Can't we young people

666
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,420
just go at our own pace?

667
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,060
Alright, alright.

668
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,420
He didn't mention you.

669
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,260
Look at you.

670
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,850
Mr. Jiang, we'll head back first.

671
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,740
- Okay.
- See you next time.

672
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,580
Ancheng will see you off.

673
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,940
Goodbye.

674
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,580
- Goodbye, Mrs. Jiang.
- Bye.

675
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,820
Although your birthday this year

676
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,140
wasn't as grand as before,

677
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,860
entertaining guests

678
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,100
still felt quite tiring.

679
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,780
Thank you.

680
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,660
I only want you to be happy.

681
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,940
Where are Mom and Dad?

682
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,780
They've gone to rest.

683
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,500
They keep asking

684
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,260
why Anlan hasn't come back.

685
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,700
Even if he didn't come today,

686
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,900
he should at least call me

687
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,300
to say congratulations.

688
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,460
Didn't he say

689
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,500
he'd bring his girlfriend home?

690
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,260
Could there be a reason,

691
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,140
like Wenqian said?

692
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,460
What reason could there be?

693
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,780
Stop talking about him like that.

694
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,140
Anlan is completely
different from before.

695
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,540
Ever since he started dating,

696
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,540
he's just not himself anymore.

697
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,420
Exactly.

698
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,580
Last time when his mom burned her hand,

699
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,380
Yao Yuan acted really arrogant.

700
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,420
I wonder what trick she used

701
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,540
to make Anlan defend her.

702
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,300
This time,

703
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,180
maybe she's the reason
Anlan hasn't come back.

704
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,380
Wenhua,

705
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,700
any woman who can
win over Anlan must be special.

706
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,700
Wenqian,

707
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,220
although

708
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,660
we don't see eye to eye with Yao Yuan,

709
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,620
I don't think she's that bad.

710
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,100
She doesn't seem like

711
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,460
someone with ulterior motives.

712
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,140
Stop saying that, will you?

713
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,180
Did I say something wrong?

714
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,940
Yao Yuan is clearly clinging to Anlan.

715
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,780
Alright.

716
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,100
The focus should be on Anlan.

717
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,540
If he really cares about me,

718
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,700
he'd come back no matter what.

719
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,580
This kid's gone off track.

720
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,740
Mom.

721
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,420
Why are you just back?
Your dad's already upset.

722
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,860
Mom, Yao Yuan's sick with a fever.

723
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,060
I got back as fast as I could.

724
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,380
How's he doing now?

725
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,780
He's fine now.

726
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,260
You didn't even call us.

727
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,660
We were all wondering

728
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,180
something serious had happened.

729
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,140
You didn't even show up
on your dad's birthday.

730
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,470
Where's Dad? He's asleep.

731
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,780
He's resting.

732
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,380
Many people came today just to see you.

733
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,660
It made your dad
feel really embarrassed.

734
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,620
Mom, don't worry.

735
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,180
I'll explain it to him.

736
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,020
You look so worn out like this.

737
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,380
Didn't Anlan take good care of you?

738
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,380
He missed his dad's birthday party

739
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,540
just to care for me.

740
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,660
He's on his way there now.

741
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,860
What a coincidence.

742
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,500
Don't worry.

743
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,540
Anlan will handle it.

744
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,700
Family won't mind these things anyway.

745
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,580
We had it all planned out.

746
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,140
I was going to make sure

747
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,020
his dad has a great birthday

748
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,100
and leave a good impression
on his family.

749
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,220
But you got sick.
There's nothing you can do.

750
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,700
They'll understand you.

751
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,140
By the way,

752
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,540
they say you only find out

753
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,300
who cares most when you're sick.

754
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,140
Is that true?

755
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,900
When I woke up,

756
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,100
he was right there beside me.

757
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,580
Congee,

758
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,700
hot towels, there was everything.

759
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,260
Honestly, I was pretty touched.

760
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,060
You're heartless, you know that?

761
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,500
Last time you were sick,

762
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,780
didn't I take care of you?

763
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,260
I don't recall you feeling touched.

764
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,020
Xinran, next time you're sick,
I'll take good care of you, okay?

765
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,940
No, thanks.

766
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,420
I don't want to get sick.

767
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,860
And I definitely don't need your care.

768
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Fine, I'll ask Wen Cheng
to look after you.

769
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,100
Still cracking jokes when you're sick.

770
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,220
I'll go make you some juice.

771
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,100
Dear.

772
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,500
Are you feeling better now?

773
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,020
Are you home yet?

774
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,300
(Jiang Anlan)

775
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,540
I'm already home.

776
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,660
How about you?

777
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,460
All good.

778
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,300
Don't worry about it.

779
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,940
Get some rest.

780
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,060
I miss you.

781
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,180
I miss you too.

782
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,580
Staying sober at a bar?

783
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,460
Bro, you've leveled up.

784
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,500
Tell me,

785
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,180
am I the one with the problem?

786
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
People say

787
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,100
when a finger points at others,

788
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,980
the other four point back at yourself.

789
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,580
I keep saying Xinran
can't let go of the past.

790
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,300
But am I the one

791
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,380
who's attached to gains and losses

792
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,740
and feels insecure?

793
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,260
So you've finally figured it out.

794
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
Since you've made it clear

795
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,860
with that assistant,

796
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,620
why are you still in the bar?

797
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,100
Get moving already.

798
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,660
I want to act right away too,

799
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,940
but when I'm with Xinran,

800
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,220
I can't get a word out.

801
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,140
And the last time we saw that guy,

802
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,140
he seemed pretty well off.

803
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,100
Maybe they've already started dating.

804
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,780
That guy

805
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,700
is named Zhou.

806
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,940
How do you know that?

807
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,580
Xinran introduced him to everyone?

808
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,700
Does that really matter?

809
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,940
Whether Xinran has suitors

810
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,180
is not important at all.

811
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,860
Happiness is in your own hands.

812
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,820
The person I like likes someone else,

813
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,140
but I still like her anyway.

814
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,260
So who do you like?

815
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,060
Not telling you, no way.

816
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,100
But if Xinran isn't with that guy,

817
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,780
I'd encourage her
to be with someone else.

818
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,980
I've had enough of
your self-inflicted troubles.

819
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,820
Can't you be a guy

820
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,700
who's not afraid of rejection?

821
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,340
If not,

822
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,380
don't ask me out for drinks anymore.

823
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,060
He's got a point.

824
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,900
Here, Ancheng.

825
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,740
- Eat this.
- Thanks, Dad.

826
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,820
After you went to rest last night,

827
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,860
Anlan came back.

828
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,860
He wanted to wish you
happy birthday in person.

829
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,560
He got here when
my birthday was nearly over.

830
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,420
What does that mean?

831
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,660
Don't you even respect me?

832
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,820
Dad, please don't be upset.
