1
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,040
You remember the day of the photo exhibit,

2
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:37,001
things got pretty out of hand.

3
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,601
My boss definitely wasn't happy.

4
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:40,081
I want to do something

5
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:41,121
to cheer him up a bit.

6
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:41,921
Me—

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,320
Yeah.

8
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:45,161
Like, what does he like?

9
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,121
Besides you, of course.

10
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:50,361
Just kidding.

11
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,081
I mean, what are his interests?

12
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:53,281
So I can cater to his tastes.

13
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,801
Interests...

14
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,761
He likes playing online games.

15
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:00,961
Online games?

16
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:02,001
He still plays those?

17
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:03,601
Yeah.

18
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:05,081
That's actually how we met.

19
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,081
Thank you.

20
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,041
I'll edit a batch later

21
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,641
and give you some of my archived photos.

22
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:10,441
Just wait for it.

23
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:22,881
You just went to a photo exhibit,

24
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,360
and Su Wen called you right after.

25
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,321
If you go see a movie,

26
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,161
Brad Pitt—

27
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:28,921
is he gonna show up at our door?

28
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,881
Sis, stop messing around.

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
I just helped him out that day,

30
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,281
just a little favor.

31
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,281
Jiang Anlan got involved with you

32
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,921
because of something like this, too.

33
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,201
So tell me,

34
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,201
do you think Su Wen

35
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,281
is using the same playbook?

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,800
No way.

37
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,401
You think everyone is Jiang Anlan?

38
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:47,561
But you never know.

39
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,961
I think Su Wen

40
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,081
isn't just anybody.

41
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:53,241
Why are you so free again?

42
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:54,601
My computer just broke.

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,080
Can you help me fix it?

44
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:56,961
I've got things to do.

45
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:57,841
Bye.

46
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,561
Su Wen has way too many girlfriends.

47
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,401
Look—

48
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,481
just look at this long list.

49
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,281
Teacher Yao,

50
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:11,961
are you upset?

51
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:16,081
Is it about the boss?

52
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,721
No, I'm not upset.

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,880
I thought you were upset because

54
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,400
he didn't tell you he was sick.

55
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,241
He was sick?

56
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,041
When did that happen?

57
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:30,481
Last week, when I went to see Li Ao

58
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,521
to pick something up,

59
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:32,721
I overheard it by accident.

60
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:35,601
Last week...

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,280
Wasn't that the day of the birthday party?

62
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,001
No wonder he disappeared out of nowhere.

63
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,041
Couldn't reach him either.

64
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,521
Turns out he was sick.

65
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,681
Hello?

66
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,601
I heard you were sick.

67
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:57,761
Are you okay?

68
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,481
Sis, it's Li Ao.

69
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:00,521
The boss is in a meeting.

70
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:01,561
I'm answering his phone for him.

71
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,161
Sis, how did you know

72
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,201
about the boss being sick?

73
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,361
Zhang He told me.

74
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,841
So it's true.

75
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:10,521
That Zhang He...

76
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,161
It's just a little cold.

77
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:12,921
Sis, don't worry.

78
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:14,801
That's good.

79
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,201
I was just a little worried.

80
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,241
Sis, don't worry.

81
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,161
You know the boss's personality.

82
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,761
He doesn't want anyone to know he's sick.

83
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,761
If I hadn't stopped him, made him rest,

84
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,281
he'd wish he could grow wings

85
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,241
and fly over to see you.

86
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,121
Okay.

87
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,281
Alright then.

88
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,081
Bye.

89
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,440
Teacher Yao just called you.

90
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,801
What did she say?

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,200
She said—

92
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:56,121
Ask her yourself.

93
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,081
She was pretty concerned about you.

94
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,281
Anlan,

95
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,321
they said you just finished your meeting.

96
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,761
See how good I am at timing?

97
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,161
I brought cake to see you.

98
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,761
This cup is for Li Ao.

99
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:26,841
Anlan, can you make me a cup too?

100
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,721
Make it yourself.

101
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,081
I don't know how to use that machine.

102
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:32,281
We don't drink that kind of coffee at home.

103
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:33,961
If you can't press a few buttons,

104
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,201
then just don't drink it.

105
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:37,681
It's fine.

106
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,561
I'll teach Miss Fang.

107
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,680
Forget it, I won't drink.

108
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,881
Anlan just got better and is already mad at me.

109
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,281
I don't have time to be mad at you.

110
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,881
But if you upset Yao Yuan, that's another story.

111
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:52,401
Sorry.

112
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,761
I didn't mean to.

113
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:55,841
Anlan,

114
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,161
you haven't eaten your cake yet.

115
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:58,961
You eat it.

116
00:05:59,241 --> 00:05:59,881
I'm not hungry.

117
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:02,961
Next time you see someone bullied,

118
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:03,801
don't just stand by and watch.

119
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,881
Even if they're not my friend,

120
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:06,721
you invited them,

121
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,841
so she's your guest.

122
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:09,361
Show some class.

123
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,521
Jiajia—

124
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:36,921
An Cheng,

125
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:40,321
What's wrong?

126
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,161
Nothing.

127
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:45,601
You came to see Anlan, right?

128
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:47,041
Why so down?

129
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,841
It's just that Anlan's upset,

130
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,761
so I'm upset too.

131
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:51,641
Well,

132
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
is there anything I can do to help?

133
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:54,801
Yes.

134
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,601
Make him fall for me.

135
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:01,681
I can find a way to cheer you up.

136
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:02,521
That I can do.

137
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,321
But—

138
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,201
But you can't control Anlan, right?

139
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:09,761
I know.

140
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,041
I don't blame you.

141
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,561
I just find it odd, you two brothers—

142
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,841
how are your personalities so different?

143
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
If Anlan were half as nice to me as you,

144
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:19,441
I wouldn't be this sad.

145
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,281
I'm leaving.

146
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:31,001
Let's go.

147
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,481
I'll take you out for some dessert.

148
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,121
I'm not in the mood.

149
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,441
What's more important than eating?

150
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,441
Are you upset about something?

151
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:39,521
Talk while you eat.

152
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,041
Come on, let's go.

153
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:45,881
Your favorite.

154
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:52,081
If Jiang Anlan knew me this well,

155
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:54,161
I can't imagine how happy I'd be.

156
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:56,841
You're just too stubborn.

157
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:58,001
All you think about is Anlan.

158
00:07:58,721 --> 00:07:59,361
Go ahead, tell me.

159
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,481
What's the reason this time?

160
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:04,401
Jiang Anlan met a new friend.

161
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,761
I invited them to my birthday party.

162
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,121
She spilled her own drink.

163
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:11,001
Got her clothes dirty and left without a word.

164
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:13,641
Jiang Anlan blamed it all on me.

165
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:16,121
How could I not feel wronged?

166
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,881
It's not like you just met him.

167
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,121
That's just how he is.

168
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,241
Don't take it to heart.

169
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,921
How can I not care?

170
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,321
I've tried for so many years.

171
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,081
He still doesn't love me.

172
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,161
Now I've lost to someone

173
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,881
he's only known for less than a month.

174
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:35,641
I get how you feel.

175
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,681
When you fall for someone,

176
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,361
everything you do

177
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,521
is just hoping he'll notice you.

178
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,001
But no matter what you do,

179
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:45,561
his eyes

180
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,681
are always on someone else.

181
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,880
You need to have faith.

182
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,721
Even if you're a bit stubborn sometimes,

183
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:57,561
or a little mischievous,

184
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,521
it's those things

185
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,760
that make you special.

186
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:05,881
So what should I do

187
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,441
to make Jiang Anlan fall for me?

188
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,081
Silly girl.

189
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,000
Love

190
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,321
can't be forced.

191
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,401
If you truly love someone,

192
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,481
be happy when he's happy,

193
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:18,321
share his sadness when he's down.

194
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,240
Giving without expecting anything back

195
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,200
is also a sign of true love.

196
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:23,121
Isn't it?

197
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,321
Oh, right.

198
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:28,761
When I came here,

199
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:30,161
I saw something that suits you.

200
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,001
Thank you, An Cheng.

201
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,081
I know what to do now.

202
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,441
I have something to do, I'll go first.

203
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:02,841
Come in.

204
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:09,641
Bro, how do you have time to visit?

205
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,681
No matter how busy I am, I have to check on you.

206
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,081
Otherwise, no one would know if you collapsed.

207
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:16,761
How's Dad?

208
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:18,321
He's doing well.

209
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:19,481
And you?

210
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:20,521
Are you managing okay?

211
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:22,321
I'm getting used to it.

212
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,400
But

213
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,441
there are still tough days.

214
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,041
I just saw Jiajia downstairs.

215
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,361
She didn't look happy.

216
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,601
Did you upset her again?

217
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,401
If she doesn't bother me,

218
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,601
my world would be peaceful.

219
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:38,121
She's been spoiled since she was little.

220
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,441
She looks grown up,

221
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,401
but she's just a kid inside.

222
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,881
She gets hurt easily.

223
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:43,881
She gets hurt,

224
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,401
but others get hurt too.

225
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,161
She always wants others to understand her.

226
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:48,761
Does she ever understand others?

227
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,441
Jiajia doesn't mean it.

228
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:51,601
Is it worth getting so mad?

229
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:53,601
I just want her to know

230
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,201
the world doesn't revolve around her.

231
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,561
Even childishness has its limits.

232
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,721
She's not this spoiled with me.

233
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,081
Why does she always act up with you?

234
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,161
When we see someone we like,

235
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,361
we all act foolish.

236
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:11,961
Especially when she

237
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,241
doesn't even glance at us.

238
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,401
We want her attention even more.

239
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:16,961
That's just human nature.

240
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,561
Loving someone like this

241
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:20,881
is pretty tough.

242
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,161
Don't hold it against her.

243
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:31,481
Um...

244
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:32,281
Put your hand down.

245
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:33,481
Don't cover your face.

246
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:34,241
Yeah, that's right.

247
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,001
Let me ask you something.

248
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,400
Do you know

249
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,361
how fashion and art blend together?

250
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,281
Emotion.

251
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:46,601
Imagine

252
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,161
I'm your boyfriend.

253
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:51,721
But

254
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,201
I'm way more handsome than your ex.

255
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,961
Yeah, that's it.

256
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:57,841
That's the smile.

257
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:58,721
Perfect.

258
00:11:58,761 --> 00:11:59,481
Xiao Shi, touch up the makeup.

259
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,601
Yeah, just like that.

260
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:06,241
Great.

261
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,041
Give me more body movement.

262
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:09,241
Perfect.

263
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:09,721
That's a wrap.

264
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:32,721
Xiao Chen.

265
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,281
You're never this focused at work.

266
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:36,561
Su Ge.

267
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:38,121
You don't get it.

268
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,961
This is the hottest online game, Sheng Shi.

269
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:40,881
It took me a lot of effort

270
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,601
to join the top guild, Tianxia Bang.

271
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,201
Of course I have to show off.

272
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:45,121
So...

273
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:45,881
How do you play this?

274
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:47,321
First,

275
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:48,361
create your own account.

276
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,321
Then join someone else's team.

277
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,120
Remember,

278
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:52,561
never play solo.

279
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:53,441
You'll die.

280
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,081
Everyone dies.

281
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:55,881
So this...

282
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:57,361
What's fun about this game?

283
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,441
The best part is

284
00:12:58,481 --> 00:12:59,961
teaming up for quests.

285
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:00,761
It brings people closer.

286
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,321
I heard

287
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,601
Boss Jiang and Baihua Tang's leader, Ruo Wei Jun Gu,

288
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,761
got married in the game.

289
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:13,761
Register.

290
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,001
How do I cancel?

291
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,561
Hey, everyone.

292
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:30,321
Dead already?

293
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:46,121
Dead again.

294
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,721
What's wrong with these people?

295
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:50,321
Do they have any decency?

296
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,561
Maybe I should call Xiao Chen.

297
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:00,681
Forget it.

298
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,080
Old Su, do you know what day it is?

299
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:16,841
Friday.

300
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:18,441
What's with your outfit?

301
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:19,561
What's going on?

302
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,161
Are you going to a pajama party?

303
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,001
I have something important today.

304
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,361
Let's hang out another day.

305
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:25,641
Wait.

306
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,121
Our Friday tradition—

307
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,041
Where's our darling Su, the love guru?

308
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:29,921
Yeah.

309
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:32,001
What's more important than your night out?

310
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,801
Surviving.

311
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:44,881
Let's go.

312
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,201
I think someone's following us.

313
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,441
Who goes there?

314
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,281
I'm For You I Long.

315
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:54,401
Why are you following us?

316
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:55,601
I admire Baihua Tang.

317
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:56,641
I want to join you.

318
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,601
I don't think she's lying.

319
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,041
She doesn't have any props.

320
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,641
She must be new.

321
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,561
We're short a healer in our guild.

322
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:09,681
How about—

323
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,161
Take her back and ask Ruo Wei Jun Gu.

324
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:14,121
Makes sense.

325
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:15,361
Hey.

326
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:17,401
If you want to join Baihua Tang,

327
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,921
you need our leader's approval.

328
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,281
Come with us now.

329
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:21,161
No tricks.

330
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:22,681
Okay, okay.

331
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:29,921
Sis,

332
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,401
I brought a new player.

333
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,361
She's pretty cute.

334
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:41,481
No manners.

335
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,001
Didn't even greet the leader.

336
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:43,961
So careless.

337
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,401
And wants to join Baihua Tang?

338
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:46,801
Sorry.

339
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,321
So beautiful.

340
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,361
No wonder Jiang Anlan plays this game.

341
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,321
Pretty person, pretty character.

342
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:00,241
I heard

343
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,841
you want to join Baihua Tang.

344
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,161
Yes, leader.

345
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:04,361
My name is For You I Long.

346
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,641
If I'm lucky enough to join,

347
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:06,801
I'll do my best

348
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,961
to serve Baihua Tang.

349
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:10,761
It's fate to play together.

350
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,121
To join Baihua Tang,

351
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:13,121
there's just one rule.

352
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:14,481
Elbows

353
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:15,601
can't bend outward.

354
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:18,041
If I find out you're a spy,

355
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:19,681
no mercy.

356
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:21,281
Yes.

357
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:22,841
I'll follow the guild rules.

358
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,641
If you have questions,

359
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,761
just ask us.

360
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,201
We're all nice here.

361
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,521
I don't know anything.

362
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,201
Could the leader show me

363
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,561
around a bit?

364
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,041
This way, please.

365
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,041
Monet.

366
00:16:58,441 --> 00:16:59,761
Giverny Garden.

367
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:01,561
What?

368
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,321
The design of Baihua Tang

369
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:04,441
reminds me of

370
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,641
Monet's Giverny Garden.

371
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,520
The garden seems romantic,

372
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,761
but it's actually full of competition.

373
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,841
You have to be tough to survive.

374
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,281
Just like our lives.

375
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,880
It's my first time hearing

376
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:17,961
someone explain Baihua Tang's metaphor.

377
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:21,241
The fun of art

378
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:21,961
is that

379
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,601
it truly shows the creator's personality.

380
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,721
No rules, always changing.

381
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,921
That's what makes it timeless and charming.

382
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,641
Didn't expect we're kindred spirits.

383
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:34,521
Likewise.

384
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:37,281
I'll take you somewhere.

385
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:38,561
You'll love it.

386
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:39,761
Sure.

387
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:40,361
Let's go.

388
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,441
Speaking of art,

389
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:51,721
Sis, do you know Su Wen?

390
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:53,321
I do.

391
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:55,521
What do you think of Su Wen?

392
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,201
He's handsome,

393
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,281
talented,

394
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,761
and has a charming smile.

395
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,081
He's definitely talented.

396
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,201
But lately, his work

397
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:09,241
I don't like as much.

398
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:15,641
But I heard

399
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,321
he's just trying to make a living.

400
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,361
It's hard to survive in art.

401
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:20,841
Sometimes you have no choice

402
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,201
but to shoot things you don't want to.

403
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:24,521
Really?

404
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:28,641
Of course.

405
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:30,921
Who would want to film

406
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,561
"twelve uses for designer bags"?

407
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:33,881
Stuff like that.

408
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:35,521
They even asked me to do hats.

409
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:36,281
Asked you?

410
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:44,921
See?

411
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,121
I like Su Wen so much

412
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,601
I talk as if I'm him.

413
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,241
Looks like

414
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,601
you know him well.

415
00:18:58,641 --> 00:18:59,481
You know him?

416
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,280
No, I don't.

417
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:02,841
I just think he's super handsome.

418
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
I just follow him sometimes.

419
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:27,641
Don't make noise.

420
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:28,801
Hello.

421
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,121
Who answers the phone and says
"Don't make noise" right away?

422
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:33,041
Is there something up? If not, I'm hanging up.

423
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,121
Hey, wait.

424
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:35,681
Have you heard of

425
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,081
"For You I Long" in the game?

426
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:38,481
No, never heard of it.

427
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,201
What's up?

428
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,400
I just saw her in Sheng Shi.

429
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:42,201
Ran into your wife.

430
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,761
She was chatting with "For You I Long,"
that female account.

431
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,161
They were really hitting it off.

432
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:47,601
Guess what they were talking about?

433
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:49,081
Come on, Wen Cheng,

434
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
are you really that bored?

435
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:52,881
You have zero patience.

436
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,401
They were talking about art.

437
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,361
Then the topic shifted to Su Wen.

438
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,680
"For You I Long" was praising Su Wen

439
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:00,561
like he was a god.

440
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,321
You mean this female account

441
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,840
is connected to Su Wen?

442
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:06,121
Uh-huh.

443
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:07,881
This "For You I Long" account

444
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,121
suddenly showed up, fine,

445
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,201
but keeps following your wife around

446
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,080
and sucking up to her about that jerk Su Wen.

447
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,080
I bet those two are definitely—

448
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,600
Hello?

449
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:40,681
Hello?

450
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,121
Jiang Anlan.

451
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,441
I'm at a club.

452
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,481
Can't hear what you're saying.

453
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,161
I didn't ask where you are.

454
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,761
What are you talking about?

455
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:04,361
Hello?

456
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,721
Hello, my lady.

457
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:07,721
Who is "For You I Long"?

458
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:10,121
I just met them.

459
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:11,121
And you already know?

460
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:12,881
How many informants do you have?

461
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,721
Not enough, if you ask me.

462
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,401
Just a new friend I met.

463
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:18,961
What's wrong?

464
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,481
Heard this person is linked to Su Wen.

465
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,481
Yeah, knows him pretty well.

466
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,001
Does it have anything to do with you?

467
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,320
Of course it does.

468
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:31,201
Everything about you is my business.

469
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:32,441
I'm coming over right now.

470
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:49,201
This is Unbreakable City.

471
00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:57,761
What are you doing?

472
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,281
He's Su Wen.

473
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:00,881
Made a female account just to get close to you.

474
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,041
You don't have to be so harsh.

475
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:05,841
You really are Su Wen.

476
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:07,001
Stop wasting words on him.

477
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:10,841
Hey, hey, hey.

478
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,520
How did you know she was Su Wen?

479
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:26,601
Guessed.

480
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:28,521
Guessed.

481
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,041
My lady.

482
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,241
Promise me,

483
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:33,401
don't just randomly

484
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:34,441
chat with strangers anymore.

485
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,841
How is he a stranger?

486
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:39,721
Isn't he Su Wen?

487
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:42,601
Su Wen is even worse.

488
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:44,281
Why?

489
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:46,921
Because you're my lady.

490
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,801
I don't want anyone getting close to you.

491
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:51,361
I'm very possessive.

492
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:58,361
I have things to do tomorrow.

493
00:22:58,521 --> 00:22:59,321
Logging off now.

494
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:24,641
Hey, stop.

495
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:25,401
Stop, stop, stop.

496
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,960
Young lady,

497
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
why are you digging such a big hole?

498
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:30,721
Planting flowers or trees?

499
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:34,961
Sorry.

500
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:36,481
Did you and your boyfriend

501
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,801
not make up yet?

502
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:41,721
Don't tease me.

503
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:43,121
I don't have a boyfriend.

504
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,321
Looking at you,

505
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
I can tell you're not being honest.

506
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:52,121
If your boyfriend showed up here,

507
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,801
would you still be so stubborn?

508
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,041
He doesn't know I'm here.

509
00:23:58,321 --> 00:23:59,441
Hello, Auntie.

510
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,321
She's my lady.

511
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,520
Thanks for looking after her.

512
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:03,201
Oh my.

513
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,521
No wonder you said no boyfriend.

514
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,201
You're already married.

515
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,841
Your husband is really handsome.

516
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,161
Why are you here?

517
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,120
Let me do it.

518
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:16,201
No, no, no.

519
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:17,161
Let me, let me, let me.

520
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:17,921
Let me do it.

521
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,601
Can I help as a friend?

522
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:21,361
Friend?

523
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,921
Not a friend, a husband.

524
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,640
Couples fight, it's normal.

525
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Lovers' quarrels don't last.

526
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,561
Between me and my husband,

527
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,521
if we have a disagreement,

528
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,201
when we can't agree,

529
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,961
he'll come over and kiss me.

530
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:41,881
Young man,

531
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:44,321
you should learn from that.

532
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:47,681
That's right.

533
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:48,961
We should respect

534
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,761
our elders' opinions, right?

535
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:51,561
My lady.

536
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:54,521
Look at this little face,

537
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:56,241
all dirty like this.

538
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:01,521
Auntie,

539
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,521
can you give us some privacy?

540
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,200
Leave your work here for now.

541
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:06,961
I'll help you later.

542
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:08,681
Okay.

543
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
You two carry on.

544
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,920
My lady.

545
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,761
Honestly, I like to do

546
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,601
everything myself.

547
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:19,561
Not the kind you said,

548
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,521
some privileged kid

549
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,801
waiting for others to do my work.

550
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,521
Take this company, for example—

551
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,921
I built it all by myself.

552
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:35,001
I could just hire a contractor.

553
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,121
Wouldn't that solve it?

554
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,641
Why do you always do everything yourself?

555
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:39,881
Don't you think

556
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,241
doing things yourself feels especially good?

557
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,241
That's what brings real happiness.

558
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,201
Then why don't you grow your own coffee

559
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,641
beans instead of just drinking it?

560
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:50,921
Don't forget,

561
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,321
our company started with a loan.

562
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,240
We're already way over budget.

563
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,001
If you want to hire workers,

564
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:01,241
it'll come out of your salary.

565
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,801
Then forget it.

566
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:05,201
I like working out anyway.

567
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:07,281
A little extra exercise won't hurt.

568
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:08,201
And also,

569
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,281
the air conditioner—

570
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:10,161
let's not turn it on either.

571
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,801
Isn't everyone promoting energy saving now?

572
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,201
Did you hear?

573
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,641
The boss of this company

574
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,281
is actually the son of a big group.

575
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,041
His dad's

576
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,721
money is backing him up.

577
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:21,481
Right?

578
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,920
Hello, everyone.

579
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,481
I'm Jiang Anlan.

580
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:32,721
I believe you all know

581
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:34,041
that our country

582
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:36,161
encourages mass entrepreneurship and innovation.

583
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:38,481
I like to be hands-on in everything.

584
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,441
I prefer to spot talent myself

585
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,881
and help them achieve their dreams.

586
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:45,521
I want to contribute to Hangzhou.

587
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,361
I believe we all strive for excellence,

588
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:49,721
not just making money.

589
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:51,921
So in my company,

590
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,041
we don't have employees—

591
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:55,481
only partners.

592
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,681
With everyone's abilities,

593
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,281
our future

594
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:00,921
will definitely keep rising.

595
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:03,161
Alright.

596
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,561
That's all for today.

597
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:05,921
Where's Li Ao?

598
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,001
He's still working on this table.

599
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,401
Been assembling it for hours.

600
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:14,361
What table is he putting together?

601
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,001
I always thought

602
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,561
you were living off your family.

603
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:25,681
Turns out

604
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:27,441
you built everything yourself.

605
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:29,641
Thanks to Li Ao,

606
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,041
the company grew so fast.

607
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,241
That's why we have today's success.

608
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:36,081
What I really want to say is,

609
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,321
I'm not someone who just sits back.

610
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:39,721
I like to work hard.

611
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:41,721
I know what failure feels like.

612
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,561
So we're not from different worlds.

613
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:47,961
I'll handle any problems we face.

614
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:50,721
I just want you by my side, always.

615
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,361
It's spraying water now—what do we do?

616
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,281
Isn't this a hotel?

617
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,481
Let's find somewhere to clean up.

618
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:18,281
I'm soaked.

619
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:36,801
Go take a shower.

620
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,801
Or you'll catch a cold.

621
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,081
You go first.

622
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:41,641
Or we could shower together.

623
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:42,921
No.

624
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,001
Put me down.

625
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:45,321
Okay.

626
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,121
Or together?

627
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:10,801
I don't want to.

628
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:11,721
Let me down.

629
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,041
I can't think about this anymore.

630
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:16,881
I can't think about it.

631
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:40,761
Love comes too fast,

632
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:42,761
like a tornado.

633
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:44,161
Can't escape the storm,

634
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,601
no time to run.

635
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:47,201
I don't want to think anymore.

636
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:49,481
I don't want to think—I don't.

637
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:53,241
I don't want to think.

638
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:54,201
You—

639
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:57,041
Love comes too fast,

640
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:58,601
like a tornado.

641
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,481
Can't escape the storm.

642
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:04,921
No time to leave.

643
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,521
I don't want to think.

644
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:09,521
I don't—I don't want to think.

645
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:14,881
Let's see who dares mess with me now.

646
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:26,561
Did you see Jun Lin Tian Xia?

647
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:27,441
He's a legend.

648
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,121
He comes and goes without a trace.

649
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:32,441
If you meet him,

650
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:33,241
consider yourself lucky.

651
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:39,961
Jun Lin Tian Xia—

652
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:40,721
did you see him?

653
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:41,761
You—

654
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:42,601
What do you want?

655
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:46,601
Revenge.

656
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:49,441
You're kidding, right?

657
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,241
If you're not in Tianxia Bang,

658
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:52,361
you'll never find him.

659
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:54,601
But I've heard

660
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:55,561
if you bring a treasure

661
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,161
and shout "tribute" in world chat,

662
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:58,241
the legend appears.

663
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:03,201
So world chat

664
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,481
is like a wishing pool.

665
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,081
It's just a game.

666
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:37,761
Watch me take you down.

667
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:41,121
Come out!

668
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,081
Ugly freak!

669
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:53,961
Can anyone survive this game?

670
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,441
Come here!

671
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,881
You think I'm scared of you?

672
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:37,881
Boss.

673
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:39,001
Lately, there's been someone

674
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,081
named For You I Long

675
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,121
asking about you.

676
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:48,881
Him again?

677
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:52,561
Guess I didn't hit him hard enough last time.

678
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:54,761
He tried to lure you out with a treasure.

679
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,201
Even did the latest beast quest.

680
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:58,401
With his skills?

681
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,161
He's barely got any real skills.

682
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:02,441
How long can he last?

683
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,201
Boss, you're wise.

684
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:05,801
No way he'd fight a beast.

685
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:08,321
I checked world chat—

686
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,321
he hasn't said anything.

687
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:10,401
Probably died ages ago.

688
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:25,721
Why are you looking for me?

689
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,041
Jiang Anlan.

690
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,961
You one-shotted me last time—so unfair.

691
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,561
I can't beat you in real life,

692
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,121
so in the game world, I'll—

693
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:53,321
Why are you just standing there?

694
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:54,441
Aren't you going to help?

695
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm not finished talking.

696
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,201
Hey—

697
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:07,241
Here's the bead.

698
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,360
What for?

699
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,721
I'm here to find you,

700
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:12,041
not for the bead.

701
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,081
Why is this person so hard to deal with

702
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,601
even in the game world?

703
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:34,081
Boss,

704
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:35,561
I'm about to leave on a business trip.

705
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:36,761
We can't afford any more delays this time.

706
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:38,721
You still have a lot to do over there.

707
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:40,761
Or you'll mess up your and your brother's plans.

708
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,360
Got it.

709
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:44,401
While I'm away these few days,

710
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:46,321
please tell the Tianxia Bang members

711
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,641
to take turns keeping watch.

712
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:50,081
Don't let Su Wen get near Yao Yuan.

713
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:51,481
Don't worry about that.

714
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:52,721
I've already given the orders.

715
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,001
And about Su Wen,

716
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,441
I've handled it all for you.

717
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,921
Now, except for eating, sleeping, and bathroom breaks,

718
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:58,961
his schedule

719
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:00,081
is packed full.

720
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:01,321
Also,

721
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:02,201
he's been constipated lately.

722
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,400
About the constipation—

723
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:04,401
you don't need to report that to me.

724
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,161
But you can help me

725
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:07,361
by buying some bananas for him.

726
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,401
No problem.

727
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:09,201
Now,

728
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:10,721
we can head to the airport.

729
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:15,601
Then help me switch to the next flight.

730
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,241
Last time it was because Yao Yuan was working.

731
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:19,601
This time,

732
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:20,281
what's the reason?

733
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:22,561
I just suddenly want to see her.

734
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:27,921
Look,

735
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:30,521
what's this?

736
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,080
And this one.

737
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:42,001
Remember to work hard.

738
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,401
Take care of yourself.

739
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:45,801
Go to bed early.

740
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:47,041
Don't wear yourself out.

741
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:51,561
I even have a video version.

742
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:52,641
Want to watch it first?

743
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:54,561
All these—

744
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:55,641
send them all to me.

745
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:56,601
When I hear her voice now,

746
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,601
I want to see her even more.

747
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:15,321
What do you want to draw?

748
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
I haven't decided yet.

749
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:20,041
Let's go.

750
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:21,241
No.

751
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:22,881
Why not?

752
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:24,201
If you keep saying no, I'll hug you.

753
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,120
I still need to spin around twice.

754
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:26,681
Hurry up, let's go.

755
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:29,121
Come on!

756
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,401
Okay, go ahead.

757
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:37,641
Why did you want to see me?

758
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,121
I came just to tell you

759
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:40,201
I'm going on a business trip.

760
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:43,321
You came all the way here to tell me

761
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:44,201
you're going on a business trip?

762
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:45,921
That's right.

763
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:47,841
And remember to miss me.

764
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,001
You came all the way here

765
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,561
just to tell me you're leaving,

766
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:52,561
and to remember to miss you?

767
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:55,001
Why are you so unromantic?

768
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:55,841
I even delayed my flight for you.

769
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,921
I postponed my flight.

770
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:00,361
You postponed your flight

771
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:02,321
to come here and tell me you're leaving,

772
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:03,401
and to remember to miss you?

773
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,121
Are you a broken record?

774
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:07,161
You're something else.

775
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:08,361
Then listen up.

776
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,521
Eat three meals on time.

777
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,041
Stay up less, drink more water.

778
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,481
Don't smile at other guys.

779
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,401
Don't make eye contact with other guys.

780
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:20,001
Don't even glance at other guys.

781
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,481
Don't talk to other guys.

782
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:22,241
Most importantly,

783
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:24,521
keep your distance from all men.

784
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,080
Did you forget?

785
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:29,241
You wrote all that in your texts.

786
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:30,201
Madam,

787
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,161
I think these words

788
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,321
are more memorable when spoken.

789
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,161
Why are you acting like a child?

790
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:55,801
You're back!

791
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,321
What are you guys doing?

792
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:00,401
Eating snacks!

793
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,200
Are you celebrating something?

794
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,440
Celebrating your freedom!

795
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:09,481
Our girls' game and snack party

796
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:10,801
was postponed endlessly by someone

797
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,241
who ditched us for love.

798
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,120
You're blaming me unfairly.

799
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,641
When did I ever ditch friends for love?

800
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:17,121
You did!

801
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:18,281
Did I?

802
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:20,521
Alright.

803
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:22,001
Then let's eat all the snacks today

804
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:22,921
and finish them all, okay?

805
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:23,641
Let's celebrate.

806
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:24,641
No need.

807
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
I'm on a diet.

808
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,441
We gain weight as soon as we eat.

809
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:30,961
Just a little is enough.

810
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:32,401
Just a taste.

811
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:34,001
Why diet?

812
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:37,721
For our

813
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:39,841
friendship.

814
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:40,841
Cheers!

815
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,721
Cheers to the master going on a trip!

816
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:44,801
Cheers to Yao Yuan's freedom!

817
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,001
Turns out you were a wolf in sheep's clothing.

818
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,881
We kindly brought you into Baihua Tang,

819
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:59,321
but ended up letting the fox into the henhouse.

820
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,881
After what you did,

821
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:03,721
how can I ever trust you again?

822
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:05,881
Don't be mad.

823
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,161
Let me explain.

824
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:08,201
It really was because

825
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,640
I'm not familiar with the game.

826
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,201
I came here just to apologize.

827
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:13,081
Look,

828
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:14,001
I even brought a gift.

829
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:16,361
You're so awesome,

830
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,280
I bet it's a knockoff.

831
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:21,161
Just like his account.

832
00:41:21,201 --> 00:41:22,921
I really made this myself.

833
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,201
And Jun Lin Tian Xia.

834
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,881
Sorry, sister-in-law, for scaring you.

835
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:36,441
I'll clean up the mess for you right away.

836
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:39,321
Take him out!

837
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:51,161
Here we go again.

838
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,281
Sis,

839
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:00,081
your master is so possessive,

840
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,361
it's off the charts.

841
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:03,481
Nothing escapes his watchful eyes.

842
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,001
You'd better look out for yourself.

843
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,001
I really can't help you, sis.

844
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:12,881
I think it's super sweet.

845
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:14,281
Even when he's not around,

846
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:15,281
the master still gives her

847
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:16,601
a strong sense of security.

848
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,081
This kind of possessiveness—

849
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:19,601
I'm totally fine with it.

850
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:26,241
Why are you here?

851
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:27,961
Sister Yao

852
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:29,001
I'm Jiajia

853
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:29,841
Fang Jianing

854
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:33,881
Fang Jianing is Rose Ice Cream
