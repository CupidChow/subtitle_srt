1
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:41,001
Without Water Fairy, it's just not fun.

2
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:44,121
Aren't you supposed to write out your struggles?

3
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,601
Then you should publish a book.

4
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,561
Not play games here.

5
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,321
World Alliance Leader isn't in the mood to play.

6
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:54,361
There are only a few people left.

7
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,721
You're distracted and keep getting hurt.

8
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,121
If I don't heal you, who will?

9
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,361
Do you have love troubles too?

10
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,201
Go ahead, let me help you out.

11
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:10,841
You should sort yourself out first.

12
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,721
An Lan, Sister-in-law just went home for a few days.

13
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,241
Her grandma is still there.

14
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:32,201
Su Wen won't go overboard, don't worry.

15
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,161
I just want to be an ordinary person.

16
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,881
Just fall in love, not worry about family.

17
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,321
Family is pressuring you again?

18
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,081
It's the same old fate as always.

19
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:47,801
Of equal social standing.

20
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,881
I won't marry anyone but Yao Yuan.

21
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,200
No one can stop me.

22
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:53,841
Who's trying to stop you?

23
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,041
Yao Yuan's back, just got off the bus.

24
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,001
Yao Yuan is back!

25
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,561
I have to go, you guys carry on.

26
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:11,001
Bye.

27
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,361
Bye.

28
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,401
Why are you here?

29
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,521
I missed you so much.

30
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,201
I missed you too.

31
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,081
Let me see.

32
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,401
Did Su Wen bother you?

33
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,601
No, he didn't.

34
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,201
He just eats a lot.

35
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,281
He even changed my lightbulb, he's pretty good.

36
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,281
I don't care how much he eats.

37
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,041
What about you? Are you taking care of yourself?

38
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,401
Yes.

39
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,601
I can eat three bowls of rice at my grandma's.

40
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,281
Nice.

41
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,241
Tomorrow after work, I'll cook for you.

42
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,721
I'll let you eat three bowls too.

43
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,961
Why are you comparing yourself to my grandma?

44
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:05,081
I have to compare everything.

45
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:08,601
Ah, oh my gosh.

46
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,521
Put me down, quick!

47
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,401
There's not a trace of girly stuff.

48
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:45,601
This place...

49
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:47,441
Is waiting for its lady owner to move in.

50
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:50,721
Let's go.

51
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:58,681
Where's the sous chef?

52
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:01,161
Here.

53
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:02,281
Master Chef.

54
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:03,121
What are your orders?

55
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,241
Chop the scallions, ginger, and garlic, wait for me to cook.

56
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:07,801
What about you?

57
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,241
Me?

58
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,481
I'll just enjoy

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,560
quietly watching my beautiful sous chef

60
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:20,481
working in the kitchen.

61
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:22,481
Why should I?

62
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:24,841
Why?

63
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:26,921
Because I'm the Master Chef.

64
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,521
If you don't listen to me, who will? Right?

65
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:33,321
Oh no.

66
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,121
What's wrong?

67
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:35,601
Ouch, that hurts.

68
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,241
It's ketchup.

69
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,161
You made me eat it.

70
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:44,561
I won't.

71
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:45,401
Eat it.

72
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:46,641
Gross, you eat it.

73
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,641
Sous chef tricking the Master Chef deserves punishment.

74
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,521
Close your eyes.

75
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,121
Close them.

76
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:07,601
You're so annoying.

77
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,321
My lady.

78
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:15,041
You, you...

79
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:25,961
Did you think I was proposing?

80
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,281
Of course not.

81
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,841
Looks like my lady is already

82
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,441
ready to marry me?

83
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,481
How could I propose in the kitchen?

84
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:37,841
Try it.

85
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,681
Give it a taste.

86
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,361
How is it?

87
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,200
It's delicious.

88
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:54,921
See?

89
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,641
Good-looking guy,

90
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,281
and a boyfriend who can cook.

91
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,281
Where else can you find one? You can't.

92
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,441
Why are you so full of yourself?

93
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:05,801
Let me say things like that, okay?

94
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:08,041
If you say it, you're not handsome anymore.

95
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,161
Eat more, here.

96
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:36,481
Stay a bit longer.

97
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:38,161
I can't.

98
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,641
It's my day off, I need to tidy up my place.

99
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:43,361
Clean up, do laundry.

100
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,441
And I have to paint.

101
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,081
I really want to marry you right now.

102
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,841
Alright, I'm leaving.

103
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,361
Let's go, I'm off.

104
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:00,321
I'll walk you out.

105
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,161
It's been a long time since we kissed, right?

106
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,841
Your kissing is so awkward.

107
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,201
You lousy Wen Cheng!

108
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,441
You actually said my kissing is bad.

109
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,721
Like you're some kissing expert.

110
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,321
I don't see your skills at all.

111
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,361
I'm going to kill you, you lousy Wen Cheng!

112
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:29,121
Who did you kiss?

113
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,601
You must've misheard.

114
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,081
Why did I just hear Wen Cheng's name?

115
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,281
Definitely not, you misheard.

116
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,441
Are you going to tell me or not?

117
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,081
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

118
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,241
It was just putting on an act.

119
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,320
Putting on an act.

120
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,361
What does that mean?

121
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,321
Zhuang Wei is getting married.

122
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,441
Wen Cheng pretended to be my boyfriend

123
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:56,201
to help me save face.

124
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,481
He went with me to the reunion.

125
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,241
Zhuang Wei thought he was a fake boyfriend.

126
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:00,481
To prove himself, he

127
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:06,481
kissed me.

128
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,841
He pretended to be your boyfriend?

129
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:11,521
I kind of think

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,160
he'd be a good real boyfriend for you.

131
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,201
He can't be my boyfriend.

132
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:17,361
Now your sister's being taken advantage of.

133
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,441
Don't you like funny guys?

134
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,201
Isn't Wen Cheng pretty funny?

135
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,200
He's tall, handsome, and stylish.

136
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:24,881
Isn't that just your type?

137
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:25,601
Yao Yuan.

138
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:27,001
Your last name is Yao, not Wen.

139
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,361
Why are you defending an outsider?

140
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,601
How much did he pay you to speak for him?

141
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,721
I just think Zhuang Wei's getting married,

142
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:35,081
so you should start a new relationship too.

143
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:36,761
Anyway,

144
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:37,921
I just hope

145
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,241
you find your own happiness soon.

146
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:43,001
Your sister will definitely find her happiness.

147
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,201
But that person won't be Wen Cheng.

148
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:47,641
Alright, alright, it's not him.

149
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,641
If it's not him, stop talking about him.

150
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
You go on about him every day.

151
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:57,601
Brother Li Ao

152
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,601
When's the right time to shoot
the World Alliance Leader?

153
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,121
He always has the same look,
what's there to shoot?

154
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:04,281
That's exactly my dilemma.

155
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,721
Why doesn't he ever smile?

156
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:06,801
How can I make him smile?

157
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:09,601
Sister-in-law,

158
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:14,721
why not try tickling him?

159
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:17,921
I tried that. Didn't work.

160
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:21,201
No way! I tickled his soles.

161
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:23,881
You could give that a shot.

162
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:26,161
Zhang He

163
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:29,881
Weren't you going to shoot me?

164
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,121
I'll let you take my photo now.

165
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:32,601
Afterwards, don't follow me. Come on.

166
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,241
Come on, World Alliance Leader.

167
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,321
Leader, that smile is way too fake.

168
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:41,881
If you won't shoot, forget it.

169
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:43,121
No, no, no.

170
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,401
Go ahead, shoot! Come on.

171
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:46,841
Give me a smile.

172
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:50,521
Okay.

173
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,401
I believe you all have great potential

174
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,641
to become tomorrow's stars.

175
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,921
Honestly, these photos

176
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,201
whether in lighting or composition,

177
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,521
are almost better than mine.

178
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:09,361
But you all

179
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,241
overlooked something important.

180
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,161
Emotion.

181
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,601
Emotion.

182
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,321
Photos are precious

183
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,881
because we turn a fleeting feeling

184
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:24,921
into something eternal.

185
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:29,121
Technique is just a tool.

186
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,561
I want more than pretty pictures.

187
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,161
I want vibrant stories.

188
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:38,561
Do you know

189
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,521
why I chose "lovers" as the theme?

190
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:42,321
No.

191
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,801
The lens is the photographer's eye.

192
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,201
Through photos, we interpret

193
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
and express the relationship

194
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,361
between photographer and subject.

195
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:54,001
In your works,

196
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,400
I only see self-expression.

197
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,441
I don't see real depth.

198
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:06,841
Alright.

199
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:08,081
That's all for today.

200
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,961
Looking forward to next time.

201
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,681
Create something that moves me.

202
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,361
Master Su, Master Su!

203
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,281
I have some questions for you.

204
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:20,561
Sure, go ahead.

205
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,481
I'm unsure about nighttime lighting.

206
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:26,961
Can I add your WeChat for guidance?

207
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,801
I'll cover lighting next time.

208
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,401
I have work to do.

209
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:32,121
I'm heading out.

210
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,721
Think about how to take photos first.

211
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:45,401
What's wrong with me?

212
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:47,761
Switched to vegetarian now.

213
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:07,201
An Lan

214
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,921
Why not come to me directly?

215
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,121
You even brought my brother.

216
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:16,241
I came on my own.

217
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,000
Jia Jia was my project intern.

218
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,041
But my current project isn't right for her.

219
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:22,921
You have an art project.

220
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,720
She studies art economics too.

221
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,841
So I thought

222
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:27,881
maybe I could help a little.

223
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:29,920
Brother Anlan,

224
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:31,681
I'll work hard and do my best!

225
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,561
Alright, we're hiring interns now.

226
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,801
But when it comes to work,

227
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,121
I'm very strict.

228
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:42,841
Okay.

229
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,441
I won't let Brother Anlan down.

230
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:46,801
Get familiar with the place first.

231
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,641
I have work at my company, so I'll go.

232
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:49,321
Okay.

233
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:50,161
I'm leaving.

234
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
Goodbye, Brother Ancheng.

235
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,121
Is she an angel?

236
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:13,001
So beautiful, so cute.

237
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,081
My heart's racing. Is this love?

238
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,401
Brother Anlan,

239
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,601
someone's sneaking around over there.

240
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:27,401
World Alliance Leader,

241
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:30,321
were you secretly photographing me?

242
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:32,761
Yeah.

243
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:34,641
Can I take your photo openly now?

244
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,601
I don't know you, why should I let you?

245
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:37,281
Delete it.

246
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:40,681
Let me introduce myself.

247
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,441
I'm Zhang He, twenty-two years old.

248
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:45,521
Aquarius, blood type A.

249
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,641
Jupiter in Taurus.

250
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:49,601
I'm the "go anywhere" guy in World Alliance.

251
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:53,001
Oh, so that's you!

252
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:53,841
You're a tank, right?

253
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,321
Can't be killed, can't kill. I know.

254
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,881
Wow, didn't know I was so famous.

255
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,961
A tank showing off, huh?

256
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,681
Wait, how do you know me?

257
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,241
I'm Rose Ice Cream.

258
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:12,641
Ah, you're Rose Ice Cream!

259
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,241
You're the one who messed with Ruo Wei Jun Gu.

260
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,721
I know I was wrong. Won't do it again.

261
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:24,881
Brother Anlan,

262
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,361
can you tell me about my job?

263
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:38,321
Smile!

264
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,961
You and Wen Cheng are really close.

265
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,201
You even go to gatherings together.

266
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:56,801
It's alright, just normal.

267
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:59,241
Normal?

268
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,081
You're always together.

269
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:02,041
And that's just normal?

270
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,441
He's just helping out.

271
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,241
Helping out this much?

272
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,401
He's really dedicated.

273
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:11,521
What are you really asking?

274
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,001
Be honest, do you like Wen Cheng?

275
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,641
If you really do,

276
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:22,641
as your friend, I'll wish you well.

277
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:25,321
I don't like him, I don't.

278
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:32,681
They say the onlooker sees most of the game.

279
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:36,521
Think carefully about your feelings.

280
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:37,921
You can't fool anyone.

281
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,161
Fairy Lady, I'm here to collect a favor.

282
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,041
Don't try to trick me.

283
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,521
The production company wants to replace me.

284
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,921
This show's ratings decide my career.

285
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,761
Can you support me? I'm begging you.

286
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:19,601
No need to be reserved, everyone.

287
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,161
Discussion brings inspiration.

288
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:24,161
You're all improving, getting better.

289
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,321
But art is subjective.

290
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm always the only one judging.

291
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,521
That doesn't seem fair.

292
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,601
Let's invite one more person to judge.

293
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:34,241
How about it?

294
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,521
Okay.

295
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,081
Planner Yao

296
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:41,241
Welcome.

297
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:54,881
Teaching Assistant

298
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,001
Instructor Su, please go ahead.

299
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,281
This photo

300
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:04,361
is an excellent example for teaching photography.

301
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:07,601
Body language can also express emotion.

302
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:09,881
Instructor Su is absolutely right.

303
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:13,881
Even though you can't see their faces clearly

304
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:17,481
the details and their gestures

305
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,441
reveal the feelings between them.

306
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:21,761
Teaching Assistant

307
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:30,761
Zhang, you took this photo, right?

308
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:33,841
Class,

309
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:35,681
this photo shows

310
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:38,281
choosing the right photographer is crucial.

311
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,841
Xinran, why aren't you done with makeup? Hurry up.

312
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:51,921
What's the rush? Stop pushing me.

313
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:54,641
Wen Cheng, perfect timing. Let me introduce you.

314
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,001
This is your partner.

315
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:58,321
Host Lin Lin.

316
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,521
Hello, Wen Cheng. Nice to meet you.

317
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:01,241
Hello.

318
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,121
Alright, I'll show you around. Let's go.

319
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:11,081
Ready? Let's head to the set.

320
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,800
Go where?

321
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,361
Today's topic is cheating.

322
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,921
We'll discuss both male and female perspectives

323
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,361
and explore their different views.

324
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,161
Today, you're representing the cheated side.

325
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:26,561
I'll ask you some questions

326
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:27,681
about your emotional journey.

327
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,401
Then offer advice to those who've been through it.

328
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,721
You're hitting my sore spot.

329
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,041
You're something else.

330
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:38,481
This isn't just for me, it's for you too.

331
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:39,921
For me?

332
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:40,881
You want me to dig up my own wounds

333
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:43,081
and tell everyone I got cheated on?

334
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:44,281
No way.

335
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:48,281
Xinran,

336
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,041
That jerk didn't appreciate you.

337
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:51,001
It's not your fault.

338
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,041
I know you're not ready yet.

339
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:55,441
But I'll face it with you.

340
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,481
What you say later

341
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:58,841
just pretend you're saying it to him.

342
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,081
Once you've said it,

343
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,160
let it all go.

344
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:06,721
Don't be nervous.

345
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:07,801
Use the same energy you have when you scold me.

346
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:08,881
Just bring that out.

347
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,361
Lin Lin, what are your hobbies?

348
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:17,641
I like swimming and working out.

349
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,720
We like swimming and fitness too.

350
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,681
Let's do it together sometime.

351
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,161
Sure.

352
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,041
Don't worry, I'm right here with you.

353
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,161
Everyone, get ready.

354
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:28,281
Countdown.

355
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:29,441
Five.

356
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:30,321
Four.

357
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:31,441
Three.

358
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:32,561
Two.

359
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,361
Hello, everyone.

360
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,881
Welcome to Celebrities Have Their Say.

361
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,481
I'm your host, Wen Cheng.

362
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,561
This is my new partner, Lin Lin.

363
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,201
Today, we're discussing

364
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,441
the hot topic: cheating.

365
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,241
We've invited both male and female guests

366
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:46,361
to represent each side.

367
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:48,601
They'll reveal their very different perspectives.

368
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,961
First, let's hear from the male guest.

369
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,281
Why do men cheat?

370
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:54,721
Actually, cheating

371
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:55,841
isn't just one person's fault.

372
00:20:56,641 --> 00:20:58,361
As the saying goes, "It takes two to tango."

373
00:20:59,321 --> 00:20:59,961
So,

374
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,001
there must be issues between both people.

375
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:03,441
That's what leads to this outcome.

376
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:05,321
So you mean

377
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,320
women are responsible for men cheating?

378
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:08,481
Absolutely.

379
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:10,361
If our partners

380
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:12,481
were as beautiful and gracious as the host,

381
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:14,321
why would men cheat?

382
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,400
We'd be too busy protecting them.

383
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:19,041
Based on your experience, what kind of woman

384
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,601
is most likely to be cheated on?

385
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,161
After getting together,

386
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,841
she stops caring about her looks,

387
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
isn't gentle or considerate,

388
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:31,041
and doesn't fulfill her duties as a girlfriend.

389
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:33,321
What do you mean by "duties"?

390
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:36,001
Of course, laundry, cooking, caring.

391
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:38,081
Aren't these things women should do?

392
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,081
Men and women are equal now.

393
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,000
With your requirements,

394
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,601
I thought you were looking for a housekeeper.

395
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,561
Alright, let's hear the woman's view.

396
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:49,641
Hello, everyone.

397
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
Honestly, falling out of love is pretty normal.

398
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,281
But the most painful and cruel part

399
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:58,521
is the so-called "kind" lies.

400
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,440
Thinking that hiding your change of heart

401
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:02,801
will minimize the hurt.

402
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:05,521
But it only hurts them more.

403
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,281
When the truth finally comes out,

404
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:14,121
a careless "I don't love you anymore"

405
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:15,241
and then you just leave.

406
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,201
I want to say,

407
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,241
have you ever thought

408
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,681
about the pain and damage

409
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,801
you've caused the other person?

410
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:26,801
It might make her

411
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,361
never dare to love again.

412
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,601
She locks herself in pain and hurt.

413
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:42,681
Everyone gets hurt in life.

414
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,361
Everyone feels pain.

415
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:47,321
Everyone has fallen in love's shadow.

416
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,640
But life moves forward.

417
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:53,441
We must bravely let go of the past

418
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:55,321
to welcome the future.

419
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,081
Now, I

420
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,600
can say to my past,

421
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,081
you're nothing to me anymore.

422
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,801
I can say goodbye to you.

423
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:21,601
Thank you to our guest for being so honest

424
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,801
and sharing your thoughts with us.

425
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:26,161
I think your

426
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:28,121
female host is really pretty today.

427
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:35,281
The producer just said we did great.

428
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:36,881
Thanks to you, I made a comeback.

429
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:38,521
Of course, I'm reliable.

430
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,761
Really, thank you for today.

431
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:45,121
What's with the politeness? Are you sick?

432
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:48,841
We're even now. No one owes anything.

433
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:51,961
You really want to cut ties with me.

434
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:55,561
What I said in the studio was true.

435
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:57,681
You deserve a better man.

436
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,801
If only a good man would show up.

437
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,641
Maybe he already has.

438
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:12,961
Wen, the show can start now.

439
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:13,441
Oh.

440
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:16,841
Wait for me a moment.

441
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,361
I'll take you home after my meeting.

442
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:19,761
No need, you go ahead.

443
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:21,241
I'll go myself. Bye.

444
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,641
The results of these photos are great.

445
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,161
Why don't we all share our thoughts?

446
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:45,321
Talk about your own shooting process.

447
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:47,561
Teaching Assistant, next photo.

448
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,041
This is my beloved.

449
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:55,521
She's also my grandmother.

450
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,401
She taught me not only how to love others,

451
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,401
but also how to love the world.

452
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,080
Even every blade of grass and tree.

453
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,240
We should respect them too.

454
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,121
Because without them,

455
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:09,401
we wouldn't be who we are now.

456
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,361
You captured your grandmother so well.

457
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:16,641
Now I know where Yao Yuan

458
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,281
gets her serious attitude from.

459
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,920
But I didn't inherit her cooking skills.

460
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:21,721
That's true.

461
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:24,841
Teaching Assistant, next photo.

462
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,281
True love

463
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:35,881
doesn't need to be forced.

464
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:37,081
One glance lasts forever.

465
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:42,881
Students, those who think love is just romance

466
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:45,281
are often very shallow.

467
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:48,521
Longing is the highest form of love.

468
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:51,361
Understand? Hey, I'm talking to you.

469
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:53,841
Next photo.

470
00:25:57,761 --> 00:26:00,401
It's beautiful, mostly because of the person.

471
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:02,441
I agree.

472
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:09,481
Next photo.

473
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,921
Which student took this photo?

474
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:15,601
I did.

475
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:21,241
Hey kid, weren't you going to shoot him?

476
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:25,561
I fell for this girl at first sight.

477
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:31,521
Class, have you noticed

478
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:34,281
these photos aren't about technique.

479
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:35,681
They all share one thing.

480
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:37,881
The people in the pictures

481
00:26:37,921 --> 00:26:40,121
are the ones we find most beautiful.

482
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,281
Agreed. Every moment is wonderful.

483
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:00,721
A cup of coffee.

484
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:02,121
Okay, just a moment.

485
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Su Wen.

486
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,641
You ended up photographing another woman.

487
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm back.

488
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:34,641
After seeing everyone's photos, I'm moved.

489
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,001
Maybe our skills aren't perfect yet,

490
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,801
but the feelings are pure.

491
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:44,481
I hope you all keep this sincerity.

492
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:46,321
Remember this innocence.

493
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,521
When did you get so sentimental?

494
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:56,241
Still waters run deep.

495
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:00,401
Yao Yuan.

496
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:03,841
Come here for a moment.

497
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,361
Mm.

498
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:14,561
What's wrong?

499
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:17,121
A creditor called the office for you.

500
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:18,841
They said you missed several payments.

501
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:19,921
That's impossible.

502
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,680
I gave every payment to my uncle.

503
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,521
He was supposed to pay for me.

504
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,361
Maybe call him quickly to check.

505
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:26,481
So there's no misunderstanding.

506
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:37,361
How did it go?

507
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:38,481
No answer.

508
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,321
The money I gave your uncle

509
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,320
might not be enough.

510
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:45,801
It's fine.

511
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:47,761
If it's not enough, I'll give you more.

512
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:49,241
No, no need.

513
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:50,761
Grandma has enough for herself.

514
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:51,241
No, that's not okay.

515
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,560
Let's go.

516
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:20,481
Hello?

517
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:22,241
Hello, I'd like to speak to Shi Zheng Yi.

518
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:23,601
Oh, he moved out.

519
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:24,401
Moved out?

520
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:24,721
Yes.

521
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:26,281
How long ago?

522
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:26,641
I don't know.

523
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:27,481
Hello?

524
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:29,601
What happened?

525
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:37,401
A creditor just called me

526
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:39,081
and said I missed several payments.

527
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,441
My grandma's money.

528
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,881
The money I gave my grandma.

529
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:47,121
I guess my uncle didn't give it to her.

530
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:49,801
Then go find him now.

531
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:51,881
He's already moved out.

532
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,241
I called him, but his phone's off.

533
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:56,681
How could he do this?

534
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:57,841
He actually lined his own pockets.

535
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,121
That's the money you saved by scrimping.

536
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:04,041
No way.

537
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,481
Something must have happened.

538
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,881
Your uncle really went too far.

539
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,321
He offered to help at first.

540
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:27,841
That's why you gave him all your salary.

541
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:29,961
To pay grandma or settle debts.

542
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,641
And now this happened.

543
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,881
There must be a reason.

544
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,641
What reason justifies taking your niece's money

545
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,201
and disappearing for no reason?

546
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:52,361
Your family

547
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:54,361
has been chased by creditors since high school.

548
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,161
Always hiding and running.

549
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:57,961
Moving from place to place.

550
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:00,081
Now you finally earn money.

551
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,121
And spend it carefully.

552
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:03,761
Hoping to pay off the debt soon.

553
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:05,081
But then—

554
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:16,161
Do you need my help?

555
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:22,161
Yeah.

556
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,241
Ask the master for a loan.

557
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:25,601
Owing him is better than owing others.

558
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:27,481
I don't want to owe anyone anymore.

559
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:48,441
An Lan.

560
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:51,841
About this matter,

561
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:55,841
I want to try first

562
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,601
to solve it on my own.

563
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,001
I don't want every problem

564
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,401
to need someone else's help.

565
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,041
Can you understand?

566
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,561
But this—

567
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:09,561
No buts.

568
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:12,921
I'll handle this myself.

569
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:15,601
You go back first.

570
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:17,681
Let me think it over.

571
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:18,921
Okay?

572
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:31,241
Don't take it to heart.

573
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:34,041
Yao Yuan's family used to struggle financially.

574
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:35,521
Always asking for help.

575
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,321
She saw the fickleness of human nature.

576
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,961
In the end, her parents, worn out from running around,

577
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,001
got into a car accident.

578
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:44,441
Since then,

579
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,401
Yao Yuan's personality changed.

580
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,961
She shoulders everything herself.

581
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,161
Sister-in-law is gentle

582
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:15,601
but stubborn inside.

583
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:16,961
She definitely won't take your money.

584
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,160
So we have to help without her noticing.

585
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,001
For example,

586
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,281
hold a raffle and let her win.

587
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,760
That's too obvious.

588
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:30,001
Should we say

589
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,121
a distant relative left her an inheritance?

590
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,441
How could I know before she does?

591
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
You two should get married.

592
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:45,601
Use the money you gave me in advance.

593
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:46,561
I'll give you a big wedding gift.

594
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:47,961
That works.

595
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,281
Is this a good time for a wedding?

596
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,800
And most importantly,

597
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,121
Yao Yuan won't accept

598
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,401
any financial help from me.

599
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:01,441
If you really don't know what to say,

600
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:02,361
just tell her directly

601
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:04,641
that you'll always be there for her.

602
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:06,961
Not bad, not bad.

603
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:08,641
Learned by osmosis, let's do it.

604
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:38,281
HELLO, THE USER YOU CALLED IS BUSY

605
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:40,081
PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER

606
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:40,801
No answer.

607
00:35:57,681 --> 00:35:59,481
This money's been overdue for over a month.

608
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:00,801
It has to be paid back today, no matter what.

609
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:02,761
But...

610
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:04,201
But I really don't have any money for you.

611
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,641
Your dad promised when he borrowed the money.

612
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:07,721
Now you say there's no money.

613
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:09,041
How about this—

614
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,601
I'll give you everything I have right now.

615
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:12,961
Look, these...

616
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:14,041
I also have...

617
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:15,801
And these, too.

618
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:17,761
Are you treating me like a beggar?

619
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:18,641
Hey, hey, hey.

620
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:19,041
Hey.

621
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:19,841
Brother, brother, brother—

622
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:21,961
You...

623
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,841
Don't make things hard for the girl.

624
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:25,521
Who are you?

625
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,281
I'm her uncle.

626
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,361
If you have a problem, talk to me directly.

627
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:31,161
She's still just a kid.

628
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,561
Even if you push her, she can't pay you.

629
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:34,401
No money to pay is your problem.

630
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,281
But if you don't give me an answer today,

631
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,560
we're not leaving.

632
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:43,321
Brother,

633
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:44,681
how about this—

634
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:46,921
We'll pay you back in installments each month.

635
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:48,761
We'll add more interest, is that okay?

636
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:52,361
Her parents are gone.

637
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:53,001
She's just a girl,

638
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,721
working and studying at the same time, it's tough.

639
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Please give us a little more time.

640
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:57,241
Even if you force us,

641
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,201
we still don't have any money.

642
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:00,921
Fine.

643
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:02,681
I'll consider it an act of kindness.

644
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,441
But don't forget to pay on time every month.

645
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:07,681
We will, we will. Thank you, thank you.

646
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:08,161
Let's go.

647
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:16,721
Uncle.

648
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:18,401
Thank you.

649
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:20,641
Let's not talk about that yet.

650
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:21,881
Yao Yuan,

651
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:22,761
here's what we'll do.

652
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,360
Give me all your monthly earnings from work.

653
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:26,921
I'll help you pay it back.

654
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:28,681
If I have extra,

655
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,560
I'll add some for you.

656
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:31,841
How can a girl like you face these people?

657
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:50,961
Why do you keep ignoring my calls?

658
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:09,801
Open the door.

659
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:11,441
I know you're in there.

660
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,361
How long do I have to wait?

661
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:22,881
Open up.

662
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,881
Long time no see, Su.

663
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,281
You didn't even change the lock.

664
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,481
Were you waiting for me to come back?

665
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:53,161
I'm not waiting for you.

666
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:54,361
You're even less welcome here.

667
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:57,361
The furniture hasn't changed.

668
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:58,921
You're pretty nostalgic.

669
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,200
Get out.

670
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:08,881
Don't be so heartless.

671
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:10,041
Just let me stay a few days.

672
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,081
I'll leave as soon as I find a place.

673
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:14,601
What do you think this place is?

674
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,761
Come and go as you please?

675
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:20,241
Just catching up with an old friend.

676
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,401
No need to overreact.

677
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,121
Don't tell me—

678
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:24,441
you still have feelings for me?

679
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:28,081
What makes you think we're still friends?

680
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,041
What else would we be?

681
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:31,761
Photography colleagues.

682
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:33,721
You still dare mention photography to me?

683
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,081
I really couldn't book a hotel.

684
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,881
I'm not familiar with this place.

685
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:41,761
You were the only one I thought of in this city.

686
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:42,841
You're the only person I could turn to.

687
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,601
Please, just one night.

688
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:48,121
Let me look for a place.

689
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:49,401
Once I find one, I'll leave right away.

690
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:51,881
Fine.

691
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:54,321
You can use the room for one night.

692
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:56,201
But don't open the suitcase.

693
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:57,361
You won't be staying long.

694
00:39:58,641 --> 00:39:59,001
Thank you.

695
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:09,961
No need to thank me.

696
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:12,401
I hope after tomorrow

697
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:13,961
I never see you again.

698
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:18,121
It's nice to see you, Su.

699
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,041
PLEASE ENTER ROOM NUMBER

700
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:05,921
Yao Yuan.

701
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,241
Yao Yuan, are you home? Yao Yuan!

702
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:09,961
Stop shouting, stop shouting.

703
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:10,921
They've moved out.

704
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:17,041
Moved out.
