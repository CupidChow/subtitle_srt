1
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,401
Why are you here?

2
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,121
Sister Yao,

3
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,161
I'm Jiajia.

4
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,001
Fang Jianing.

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,040
Fang Jianing is Rose Ice Cream.

6
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,001
The one who held the birthday party.

7
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,681
What does she want now?

8
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,081
Let's hear what she has to say first.

9
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,761
Why did you come to see me?

10
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,241
Sorry, Sister Yao.

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,801
About the birthday party last time—

12
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:57,761
Please just forget it.

13
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:00,001
Forget it.

14
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,721
Apologize first, then talk.

15
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,921
Hey, wait.

16
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:03,601
Don't say that.

17
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:04,881
She's still young.

18
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:05,681
Don't hold it against her.

19
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:09,961
It's fine with me.

20
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,641
That's great.

21
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,201
Are you free to talk tomorrow?

22
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,681
I want to apologize to you in person.

23
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:25,641
But thinking about it carefully,

24
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,441
what they said does make some sense.

25
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:30,001
You and Brother Anlan

26
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,921
have such different backgrounds.

27
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,761
Getting along,

28
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,641
you'll definitely run into some friction.

29
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:39,961
Sis,

30
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,361
please say yes.

31
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,761
Otherwise, I'll be really sad.

32
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:43,801
Hey.

33
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:44,521
Ignore her.

34
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,041
No.

35
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:48,121
Just agree to it.

36
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,361
Besides claiming our ground,

37
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,321
we need to show them

38
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,361
we're not easy to bully.

39
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:19,881
Sister Yao,

40
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,441
I was really afraid you wouldn't come.

41
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:24,361
But here I am, aren't I?

42
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:25,481
Have a seat first.

43
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:28,801
All of these

44
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,521
are for me to apologize to you.

45
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:32,201
I asked the chef to make them specially.

46
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,641
This is way too much.

47
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:34,601
I can't finish it.

48
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:36,281
Then take it to go.

49
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:37,881
Either way, you have to eat.

50
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:47,681
If you have something to say,

51
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:48,801
just say it directly.

52
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,041
Sister Yao,

53
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,281
I've really reflected on it.

54
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,041
Will you forgive me?

55
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:02,481
There's nothing to forgive.

56
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:03,801
I didn't take it to heart.

57
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,081
Don't be too upset.

58
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,001
So can we—

59
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,641
be friends again?

60
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:16,761
That's wonderful.

61
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,121
I'm so happy.

62
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,761
I have to tell Brother Anlan right away.

63
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,361
Jiajia.

64
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,001
Brother Ancheng, you're here!

65
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:25,801
Is she your friend?

66
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:27,521
This is Yao Yuan.

67
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:29,561
Anlan's

68
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,521
girlfriend.

69
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:32,961
Hello.

70
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,041
I'm Jiang Ancheng.

71
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,001
Anlan's older brother.

72
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:39,081
Hello.

73
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:40,441
I'm Yao Yuan.

74
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:42,641
Jiajia,

75
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:43,761
It's about time to go.

76
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,721
Sister Yao,

77
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:47,481
Sorry,

78
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,241
I have to go to the restaurant for the ribbon-cutting.

79
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:50,721
If Miss Yao is free,

80
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:52,001
you can come with us.

81
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:52,921
The owner of that restaurant

82
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,241
is a friend of mine and Anlan's.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,560
We can introduce you.

84
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:57,841
I—

85
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,601
Oh,

86
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,001
Sister Yao probably isn't used to this.

87
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
Let's not make it hard for her.

88
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:03,881
Otherwise,

89
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,521
Brother Anlan will scold me again.

90
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,081
Alright then.

91
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,401
Let's meet next time.

92
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:09,561
Okay.

93
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,241
No matter if Master Su's photos are good,

94
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,840
as long as he's handsome, that's enough.

95
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,281
I'm willing to be by Su Wen's side

96
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,281
as a photography assistant.

97
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,681
Travel the world with you.

98
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,721
By photographing children's backs,

99
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,320
without focusing on their facial expressions,

100
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:57,361
and through the deliberate neglect of others,

101
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:58,961
the viewers

102
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:00,841
can feel society's indifference.

103
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,641
I really admire your unique perspective.

104
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,041
Looking forward to your new works.

105
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:13,241
Su Wen.

106
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:14,641
Eh?

107
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:17,481
Does Old Jiang really like Yao Yuan?

108
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,161
Anyone can see it's real.

109
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:22,521
Then why does he like Yao Yuan?

110
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,800
Yao Yuan is his type.

111
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,201
I've known the boss for years,

112
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,921
and I still don't know his type.

113
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:31,801
Let alone you.

114
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,681
Don't try to get more out of me.

115
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Sorry, I can't tell you.

116
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:36,961
Are you ready?

117
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:37,441
Let's go.

118
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:38,321
Alright.

119
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,481
This Su Wen

120
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,881
is the super popular leading man lately.

121
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,241
Not the leading man.

122
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:13,121
He's a photographer.

123
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,001
Photographer.

124
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:16,321
Photographers these days

125
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:17,121
are so high-profile.

126
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:19,881
You'll see his looks soon and understand.

127
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,561
He's more leading man than the leading man.

128
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:35,721
Su Wen.

129
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,561
Su Wen.

130
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:37,281
Su Wen.

131
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,241
Su Wen.

132
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,041
Su Wen.

133
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,841
Everyone, please stay quiet.

134
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:42,881
Everyone, quiet.

135
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:43,681
Today

136
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:44,601
is Master Su Wen's

137
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:46,121
new work release day.

138
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,401
Is everyone ready?

139
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:49,561
Ready!

140
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:50,201
Alright.

141
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,801
Let's count down from three.

142
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:53,441
Three.

143
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,361
Two.

144
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:55,441
One.

145
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,441
Master Su Wen's work

146
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,321
has once again amazed us all.

147
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:07,721
Everyone, tell me—

148
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,641
isn't that right?

149
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,921
Yes.

150
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,241
Let's invite Master Su Wen

151
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,361
to say a few words.

152
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:16,841
So,

153
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,561
can anyone tell me

154
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:19,761
what these photos mean?

155
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,521
Me.

156
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,881
Master Su Wen is truly charming.

157
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,081
Then let's have Master Su Wen

158
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,601
pick a few lucky fans

159
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,481
to come on stage and answer.

160
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,041
Sound good?

161
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,121
Okay.

162
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:32,441
Or maybe

163
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,481
you pick for me?

164
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,001
Wow.

165
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:36,881
Are you giving me this chance?

166
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:37,681
Are you sure?

167
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:38,361
Alright.

168
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,001
Then I'll help you decide.

169
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:41,521
Is everyone looking forward to this?

170
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes!

171
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,200
Alright.

172
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,121
I'm picking three lucky fans now.

173
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,361
Who will they be?

174
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,561
Me.

175
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:50,681
Let's see—

176
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,761
who are today's three lucky fans?

177
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,321
I'm drawing now.

178
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,161
Now, the first ball is—

179
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,721
The first is—

180
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,801
Seven nine four.

181
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:02,841
Who is it?

182
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:03,601
Me.

183
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:04,441
Me.

184
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,760
Nine four eight.

185
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:07,281
Who is it?

186
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:07,921
Me.

187
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,121
Wow, congratulations!

188
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
The third is—

189
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:12,241
Six six six.

190
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:13,001
Who is it?

191
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:13,801
Me, it's me!

192
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,001
Congratulations!

193
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,361
Alright, next—

194
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,321
Our three fans are ready.

195
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,161
Now, please answer in order.

196
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,401
What does the work mean?

197
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:26,281
Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness.

198
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:26,881
Ah.

199
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:29,441
Okay, next.

200
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,841
A face has a thousand emotions.

201
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:36,721
Alright, alright.

202
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:37,721
Last fan.

203
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,401
Master Su Wen is so handsome.

204
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,321
So handsome.

205
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,321
Looks like everyone

206
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,281
was distracted by my good looks

207
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:52,401
and missed the meaning of these photos.

208
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,641
Over the years,

209
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,081
I've photographed many celebrities,

210
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,041
famous people,

211
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:57,921
and models.

212
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:00,601
They all share one trait—

213
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,161
determination,

214
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,080
confidence,

215
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:04,081
and beauty.

216
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,000
But I felt less and less moved.

217
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,921
I realized what truly moves me

218
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,521
is unfiltered emotion.

219
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,881
So I collected a thousand faces

220
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,521
to create this series.

221
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,361
I named it

222
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:21,201
"Life."

223
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:23,961
From afar,

224
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,401
they're a single human face.

225
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:26,881
Up close,

226
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,241
each emotion—joy, anger, sorrow, happiness—

227
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:30,361
is the main character.

228
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:33,361
People today

229
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,561
are more and more polished,

230
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:40,001
forgetting their true selves.

231
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:43,881
Maybe time really changes everything.

232
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:47,601
I hope everyone

233
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,201
can stop hiding

234
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,921
their real emotions.

235
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:52,481
Only then can you

236
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,481
be your true self again.

237
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,281
Su Wen.

238
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,120
Su Wen.

239
00:10:58,761 --> 00:10:59,401
Thank you, everyone.

240
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:00,761
We'll meet again.

241
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,081
Boss Zhou said your last photos were great.

242
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,241
He has a model over there

243
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,001
with a great look,

244
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,441
but can't capture any emotion.

245
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,561
He asked if you could give some guidance.

246
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:13,361
What,

247
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,241
you don't want to?

248
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,201
No, that's not it.

249
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,281
It's this one.

250
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,321
I'll leave it to you.

251
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:27,321
Hello.

252
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:28,241
I'm Su Wen.

253
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:28,801
Hello.

254
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,560
How's the makeup?

255
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:34,121
It's good.

256
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:35,601
Then let's

257
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:36,601
take a few test shots.

258
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:37,561
Okay.

259
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:47,041
Let's try a few poses first.

260
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:47,841
Get a feel for it.

261
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:48,641
Alright.

262
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:54,801
Yes.

263
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,041
Yes, more confidence.

264
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,320
Be more confident.

265
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,521
Hope you don't forget

266
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,241
your original intention as an artist.

267
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,121
Are you feeling a bit nervous?

268
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:19,121
Yeah.

269
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,241
So I boldly guess

270
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,121
you're an introvert.

271
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:25,401
Yes.

272
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,121
Then why did you choose

273
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,281
to be a model?

274
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:29,641
To...

275
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
To fulfill a promise with my sister.

276
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,200
Your sister?

277
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,040
Yeah.

278
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:37,961
My sister and I

279
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,361
are twins.

280
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,921
We made a promise as kids

281
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,361
to walk the runway together.

282
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:43,241
But...

283
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,241
She got seriously ill later.

284
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,080
Now she can't move much.

285
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:50,801
But she's always supported me

286
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:51,801
and encouraged me.

287
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:56,601
I think

288
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:58,041
your sister is right.

289
00:12:58,801 --> 00:12:59,801
You really have

290
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,601
a unique aura about you.

291
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,201
But

292
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,321
if you're nervous,

293
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,521
that aura disappears.

294
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,121
You need to think about

295
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,681
letting go of your nerves.

296
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,081
Because now

297
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,761
you're carrying your sister's dream too.

298
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:15,921
We're working together, right?

299
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,201
Let's keep going.

300
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,041
Okay.

301
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:23,201
Yes.

302
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,201
Beautiful.

303
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:25,081
Beautiful.

304
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,641
Very good.

305
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:28,721
That's the right vibe.

306
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,241
Beautiful.

307
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:32,521
All right.

308
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:44,121
President Jiang.

309
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,561
I've heard so much about you.

310
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,161
This project proposal

311
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,121
was completed by our two brothers' teams.

312
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:49,801
I think the details

313
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,081
my brother knows better than I do.

314
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,681
About your company's plan,

315
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:56,801
our boss is very satisfied.

316
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,521
Just some details

317
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,400
need to be confirmed with you personally.

318
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:04,761
I'll explain everything in a moment.

319
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,161
I told you,

320
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:07,161
with President Jiang involved,

321
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,201
there's absolutely no problem.

322
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:09,361
Of course.

323
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:10,801
With my brother here,

324
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,121
nothing can't be solved.

325
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:13,761
President Jiang, please.

326
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,601
Hey, you came back just in time.

327
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,281
Come with me somewhere.

328
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,121
Where to?

329
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,681
My mom wants me to go on a blind date.

330
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,601
Make an excuse and skip it.

331
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,360
No way.

332
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,721
You know how your aunt is.

333
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:35,641
If I don't go today,

334
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,961
she'll come knocking tomorrow.

335
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:39,241
Let's go.

336
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:40,761
Come on, go with your sister.

337
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:42,281
I'll take you for some good food.

338
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,081
Can't we just not go?

339
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,881
My mom says among her friend's sons,

340
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,001
I'm the most handsome.

341
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,441
No reason I can't get a wife.

342
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:52,961
The main thing is,

343
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,361
I haven't found someone worthy of me yet.

344
00:14:58,801 --> 00:14:59,521
Ladies,

345
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:00,841
what would you like to drink?

346
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,001
We'll order for you.

347
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,521
Iced coffee.

348
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:06,041
And you?

349
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:06,601
Same.

350
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:07,601
Okay, just a moment.

351
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,881
We'll go order for you now.

352
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,321
Please wait a moment.

353
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:17,001
Find a chance to leave soon.

354
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,681
I want to leave too. What excuse?

355
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:25,961
Where's the lady?

356
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:30,081
Eating.

357
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,721
With whom?

358
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:39,681
With my sister.

359
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:48,881
That guy

360
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:51,041
dressed like a banana, who is he?

361
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:04,521
His smile is so awkward.

362
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:14,921
Wait for me.

363
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,481
Why did she leave?

364
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,041
Hello?

365
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,241
Where are you?

366
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:28,561
At the hotel.

367
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,281
Just finished a meeting.

368
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,881
How did you know where I'm eating?

369
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,961
Someone from the gang saw you and told me.

370
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:37,281
I'm here with my sister for her blind date.

371
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,161
Don't worry, ma'am.

372
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,561
I know you don't mean anything by it.

373
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:41,681
But others do.

374
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,041
I wish I could put a barrier on you

375
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,041
once and for all.

376
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:52,801
Why'd you leave me alone there?

377
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:57,721
Wait a sec.

378
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:58,601
My sister's here.

379
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,841
I'll talk to you later.

380
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,881
Okay, bye.

381
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,081
So weird.

382
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,800
Hello, hello.

383
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:07,841
I get it now.

384
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:08,841
Tianxia Bang people.

385
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:10,601
No wonder.

386
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,441
I'm the one on the blind date anyway,

387
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:13,001
not you.

388
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:13,561
Come on, let's go in.

389
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:14,281
Wait.

390
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,121
Don't you think this is really weird?

391
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,440
I don't like this situation.

392
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,161
I'll figure something out. Let's go.

393
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,761
Sorry about this.

394
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,481
My sister's boyfriend just called.

395
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:33,761
We have to go now.

396
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,241
What?

397
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,641
She already has a boyfriend?

398
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,361
Then why are you two here for a blind date?

399
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:40,401
She's my sister.

400
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:41,721
She just came with me.

401
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,361
Just a boyfriend.

402
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:45,841
We're not even married.

403
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:48,961
Is he as good as we are?

404
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,281
He's way more handsome than you.

405
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:54,161
Sorry about that.

406
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,361
We really have to go now.

407
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:56,641
Wait.

408
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,201
She already has a boyfriend.

409
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,121
You don't, right?

410
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:00,881
Stay and chat with us.

411
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:01,721
Ah, that's right.

412
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,601
What do you take me for?

413
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:05,481
Sorry.

414
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,321
My sister isn't interested in you.

415
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,840
But please show some manners.

416
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:10,401
This drink—

417
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:11,961
is on us.

418
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,281
We really have to leave.

419
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:14,201
Hey.

420
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,561
Hey, you guys—

421
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:20,241
We're home.

422
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,081
Mm-hmm.

423
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
No Tianxia Bang people in our family, right?

424
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,081
No, definitely not.

425
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,081
Why did you come home so soon?

426
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,001
Is it because of me?

427
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:32,281
Of course not.

428
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,681
I just think that place

429
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:35,681
isn't really my style.

430
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:37,401
Don't worry.

431
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:39,241
My sister and I can take care of ourselves.

432
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,160
I need to bring you over here.

433
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,760
Huh?

434
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:43,921
I can't relax if you're not with me.

435
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:45,721
I'll have Li Ao book your flight.

436
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:46,841
You'll fly over first thing tomorrow.

437
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:48,241
Tomorrow morning?

438
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,201
But I have work.

439
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:49,801
Just take a day off.

440
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,121
Li Ao will send

441
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,481
the flight info to you anyway.

442
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:52,961
Bye.

443
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:55,601
Ah.

444
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:15,401
Sorry.

445
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,681
A guy from the mixer asked me to sing.

446
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:18,961
I'll be a bit late.

447
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:20,761
You can have a drink first.

448
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:21,961
It's on me.

449
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:37,721
Oh wow.

450
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,481
Miss Yao.

451
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,240
What a coincidence.

452
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:43,041
Tell me—

453
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,241
Isn't this fate?

454
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:45,641
It sure is, Miss Yao.

455
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:46,481
Oh, right—

456
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:48,361
Thanks for the coffee this afternoon.

457
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,401
This time, let us treat you.

458
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:51,081
Come on, come on.

459
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:51,961
Please, have a seat.

460
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:53,321
Today,

461
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,120
if you turn us down again,

462
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,241
we really can't let you leave.

463
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,201
Come on.

464
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,160
Oh, my stomach hurts.

465
00:19:58,201 --> 00:19:59,961
I'll hit the restroom, be right back.

466
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:01,921
Let's go order some drinks.

467
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:17,961
The number you dialed can't be reached.

468
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,121
Please try again later.

469
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,720
My buddy's on a business trip.

470
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:30,441
I was just missing a drinking buddy.

471
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:43,361
Hello?

472
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,481
Where are you?

473
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:46,681
So rude.

474
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:47,641
Are we even close?

475
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:50,681
I'm at a blind date right now.

476
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:51,921
And someone blocked me in.

477
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:52,601
I can't get out.

478
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:53,801
Can you come rescue me?

479
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,201
Send me the address.

480
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:58,561
Come on, bottoms up!

481
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:00,561
Two grown men

482
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,841
forcing a girl to drink in public—

483
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:03,561
Not a good look, is it?

484
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:04,361
Who are you?

485
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:05,321
Wait—

486
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:06,561
Who are you?

487
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:15,841
Who are you?

488
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:16,801
I'm her friend.

489
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:19,681
Friend?

490
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:20,481
Wait.

491
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:22,921
You're that... what?

492
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:24,441
Wen Cheng, right?

493
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:25,001
That's me.

494
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:27,201
As far as I know,

495
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:28,321
Yao Xinran is pretty proud.

496
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:29,721
I mean no disrespect.

497
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:30,561
But...

498
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:31,921
How did you meet her?

499
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:34,001
By chance.

500
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:34,921
No way.

501
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:35,401
Yeah.

502
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:36,801
Just a coincidence.

503
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:37,841
Just say hi, that's enough.

504
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,441
Come and go as you please.

505
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,921
Why force someone to drink?

506
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:41,281
No.

507
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,241
Who did we force to drink?

508
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:44,361
What's it to you?

509
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,161
It wasn't my business.

510
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:47,681
But since we met by chance,

511
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,041
I'd like to ask you both something.

512
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,161
You two chose blind dates,

513
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:52,321
to decide your future partner.

514
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,040
Why is that?

515
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:54,481
Blind date? What?

516
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,481
Future partner? What?

517
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:57,561
Isn't it just a way to meet people?

518
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:58,121
Hey.

519
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,521
That's not right.

520
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,481
A blind date means

521
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,881
getting to know each other
with marriage in mind.

522
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:05,441
It's a process of understanding.

523
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,321
If you just want to meet people,

524
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:08,921
just use a dating app.

525
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:12,721
Look, you two.

526
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:15,561
Yao Xinran is already over twenty-five.

527
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,921
If you don't plan

528
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,561
to take responsibility for her future,

529
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:19,801
don't waste her time.

530
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:22,041
She'll cling to you and refuse to marry.

531
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:23,841
Trust me,

532
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,161
when she's stubborn,

533
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,561
she's scary.

534
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,761
Giving you a chance to escape.

535
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,241
I've called a car for you.

536
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:32,881
It's outside.

537
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,081
What now?

538
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:38,841
What? What?

539
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:39,721
No.

540
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:41,161
Just... hey.

541
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:46,721
You're lucky today.

542
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,241
Let's treat today

543
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,161
as gathering material for the show.

544
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:51,761
Your show?

545
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,001
Does it even have ratings?

546
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:55,121
Is this how you treat your benefactor?

547
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:55,801
Yes.

548
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,521
Who said they owed me a favor?

549
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,441
I said I owe you a favor.

550
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:02,561
But I don't agree with you.

551
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,121
What's wrong with being twenty-five?

552
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,041
Who says you must marry after twenty-five?

553
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:08,201
Don't take it to heart.

554
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:09,561
I really need material.

555
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:10,921
Have a drink with me.

556
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,321
Share your blind date story.

557
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:14,561
Waiter!

558
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:18,121
This person is interesting.

559
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:20,401
I'm not drunk.

560
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,321
I'll walk a tightrope for you now.

561
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Yeah, right.

562
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,281
Impressive.

563
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:27,561
Not watching where you walk?

564
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,361
Are you okay?

565
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,441
Tonight...

566
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,561
Thank you.

567
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:36,801
For what?

568
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:37,961
Just owe me one.

569
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:40,161
Can you

570
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:42,041
not tell anyone about tonight

571
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:42,961
please?

572
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Which thing?

573
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,481
The blind date or being forced to drink?

574
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,201
You don't think it's your fault, do you?

575
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:52,841
Don't be silly.

576
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:57,721
Anyway,

577
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:58,401
you're not the problem.

578
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:00,201
Just didn't protect yourself well.

579
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:01,441
Water Fairy.

580
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:02,881
In real life,

581
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,241
you don't carry arrows with you.

582
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,120
Tonight...

583
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:08,681
Thank you.

584
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:11,201
I'm not used to talking like this.

585
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,121
I'll pretend you're drunk.

586
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:13,521
I'll call a cab for you.

587
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:18,921
What's wrong?

588
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,881
Feel Wen Ruyu's healing power?

589
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,241
Why are you running so fast?

590
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,481
Then come chase me.

591
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:31,481
Who invited just now?

592
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:32,961
You did.

593
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:15,761
I miss you so much.

594
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:20,561
Me too.

595
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,401
Let's go.

596
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,321
This is...

597
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,481
my room.

598
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,001
Where's my room?

599
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,480
All the rooms are full.

600
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,401
Only this one is left.

601
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:58,241
Ah.

602
00:25:58,561 --> 00:25:59,601
Ah what?

603
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,281
It's not our first time sharing a room.

604
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:02,881
Why are you

605
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,241
so shy this time?

606
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,001
Isn't it because

607
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,401
we haven't seen each other for days?

608
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:09,961
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

609
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:10,441
Right?

610
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:12,641
Yao Yuan.

611
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:14,601
It's so good to have you.

612
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,481
I'm going to change.

613
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,401
See you in a bit.

614
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,760
Change... change clothes?

615
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:28,561
Oh no.

616
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:29,721
Changing clothes.

617
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:52,881
I have a meeting to handle first.

618
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,321
Wait here for me, okay?

619
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:15,121
Pleasure working with you.

620
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:15,921
Pleasure working with you.

621
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:24,921
Congratulations.

622
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:27,161
This isn't my achievement.

623
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:28,201
Everyone worked hard.

624
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:29,801
How is it not your achievement?

625
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:31,001
If it weren't for Boss Wang

626
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:31,761
trusting you,

627
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,160
we couldn't have

628
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,241
finished the task so smoothly.

629
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,681
I know you dislike social events.

630
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,080
But let's have dinner together tonight.

631
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:39,561
You can go as our representative.

632
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:40,481
I want to be with Yao Yuan.

633
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,121
Miss Yao.

634
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:45,441
She's nice.

635
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:47,281
You two are a good match.

636
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:48,761
But...

637
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,080
About Dad's side...

638
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:51,681
You know what I mean.

639
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:53,721
I'll handle Dad's side.

640
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:08,881
Handling all these things

641
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,401
takes so much time.

642
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:20,281
Does it look good?

643
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,761
I totally don't get it.

644
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:24,761
If you don't get it, stop watching.

645
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,281
Just look at me instead.

646
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:27,001
You...

647
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:28,041
You're annoying.

648
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:28,761
What are you doing?

649
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,200
Don't run!

650
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:32,281
What?

651
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,081
You're making it look like I'm flirting.

652
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,881
I'm going to take a shower first.

653
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,921
I hope nothing happens while I'm showering.

654
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:41,041
Something happening...

655
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:42,481
What do you mean "while"?

656
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:44,081
Figure it out yourself.

657
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:45,481
I...

658
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:47,361
I just came to check on you.

659
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:48,641
Alright.

660
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,721
Then, my lady, I'll shower first.

661
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:10,841
Sis, log into the game.

662
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:21,841
Can I use your computer

663
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:23,081
for a bit?

664
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,201
Can I borrow your computer?

665
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:56,281
What's wrong, my lady?

666
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:58,601
Why?

667
00:29:58,641 --> 00:29:59,921
You're doing this on purpose.

668
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:01,561
You're the one doing it on purpose.

669
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:03,441
You could've answered from inside.

670
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:04,881
I was afraid you wouldn't hear me.

671
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:08,441
Give me your computer password.

672
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,641
The password?

673
00:30:11,761 --> 00:30:12,361
Let me enter it for you.

674
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:13,201
No, no.

675
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,761
Just tell me the password.

676
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:17,761
It's your birthday.

677
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:19,561
That's so uncreative.

678
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,041
What?

679
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:23,481
Even a pro is this basic in love.

680
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:24,641
My lady.

681
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,081
Want to shower together?

682
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:05,801
You must accept it this time.

683
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,721
He won't leave unless you come.

684
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:09,841
There's no other way.

685
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,201
Had to come get you.

686
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:13,721
Doesn't know how to operate.

687
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:15,361
But he's persistent.

688
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:16,441
That's praiseworthy.

689
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,281
What if I accept it?

690
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:22,881
Maybe

691
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,081
we can let go of the past.

692
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:26,321
Or maybe

693
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:28,041
I can join Baihua Tang.

694
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,721
Baihua Tang only accepts girls.

695
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:31,601
You think dressing as a girl

696
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,681
we wouldn't notice?

697
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:33,721
You think we're fools?

698
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:35,361
These people...

699
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:36,801
What's going on?

700
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:37,921
Did Jiang Anlan buy everyone off?

701
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,601
Where's the leader?

702
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,681
Water Fairy said you can't play now.

703
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:44,721
It's fine.

704
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:46,201
I'm in a hotel room.

705
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:46,801
That's nice.

706
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:47,921
Where did you go?

707
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:52,241
Sis...

708
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,401
What should we do with him?

709
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,001
Just accept it

710
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:56,481
and I'll leave.

711
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:05,801
Get lost.

712
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:08,961
That tone...

713
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,081
That's the pro's tone!

714
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,001
This is my account.

715
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:15,721
You're my lady.

716
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,321
Ah...

717
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:21,201
So you two are together!

718
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:24,841
So when you said you're in a hotel room,

719
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:28,641
doesn't that mean...

720
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:29,681
I had no idea.

721
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:30,521
Alright, stop asking.

722
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:32,521
Jiang Anlan.

723
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:33,921
What are you really up to?

724
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,121
Jun Lin Tian Xia.

725
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:36,881
You just met recently.

726
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:37,881
And already booked a room together.

727
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,321
They've already married and shared a room.

728
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:41,521
So what?

729
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,441
In real life, you still follow the rules.

730
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:46,841
Hearing that from you

731
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,961
is just hilarious.

732
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:50,681
I'm in a good mood today.

733
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,081
So I won't destroy you.

734
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,121
Now you've made people misunderstand me.

735
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:05,241
Are you happy about that?

736
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,201
Who cares about them?

737
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,761
Today, you're mine.

738
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:09,881
And I'm yours.

739
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:11,441
Let's go.

740
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:16,801
Wait a second.

741
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,321
I'm not ready yet.

742
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,521
Just lying here quietly

743
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,081
makes me perfectly content.

744
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:37,041
Your hair...

745
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,041
Why not dry it?

746
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:39,601
I won't dry it.

747
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:41,201
I'll just lie here forever.

748
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,241
No way.

749
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:44,001
You'll catch a cold.

750
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,721
Get up, I'll get the hair dryer.

751
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,441
Catching a cold is better.

752
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,721
My lady will care for me forever.

753
00:33:58,921 --> 00:33:59,561
Sit up.

754
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,200
Can we stay like this forever?

755
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:52,561
In this room?

756
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,200
Yeah.

757
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:56,961
I'll dry your hair.

758
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:58,281
You dry mine.

759
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,921
Like two monkeys in the forest.

760
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:05,121
Sometimes I think

761
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:06,281
I really envy them.

762
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:08,041
No need to work hard for money.

763
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:10,041
Don't care about others' opinions.

764
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,121
Or worry about social status.

765
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,161
So you worry about these too?

766
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:19,721
I didn't worry before.

767
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:21,921
But seeing you care so much,

768
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:23,201
I started caring too.

769
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,841
Madam wants to watch.

770
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,321
Just keep watching like this.

771
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:39,881
Forget it, stop watching.

772
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:41,961
You're not ready yet.

773
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:42,881
Don't tempt me.

774
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:09,641
Fell asleep so quickly.

775
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,760
Just how tired are you?

776
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:14,921
Still played with me for so long.

777
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,721
What are you laughing at?

778
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:56,561
Jiang Anlan's business trip went well.

779
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:58,041
Closed a deal.

780
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:59,681
I'm happy for him.

781
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:01,841
So soon, you're acting like a couple.

782
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,001
Hey, seriously—

783
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,721
You should thank me.

784
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:06,041
If I hadn't pushed you back then

785
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:07,481
to meet Jun Lin Tian Xia,

786
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,441
the world would miss a perfect couple.

787
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:11,961
What about you?

788
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:13,441
Why are you laughing?

789
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,281
I'm not laughing.

790
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,201
You must be seeing things.

791
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,481
Is it about Wen Cheng?

792
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,001
I felt something was off last night.

793
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,281
You didn't even shoot him in the game.

794
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:33,401
I just think it's pointless.

795
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:39,441
Communication is so easy now.

796
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:40,881
You say your boyfriend went out with friends

797
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,401
from nine at night to two in the morning,

798
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:43,441
and didn't reply to your messages.

799
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:44,841
Didn't answer your calls either.

800
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:45,761
Does that make sense?

801
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:47,921
Unless he went to the North Pole,

802
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,081
the problem is with you.

803
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:50,481
How could you believe that?

804
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:55,761
Let's give this lady

805
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:57,041
some time to heal.

806
00:37:57,601 --> 00:37:59,201
Still, I want to remind everyone watching—

807
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,200
In today's world,

808
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,040
even if you forget to get dressed,

809
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,041
you'll still bring your phone.

810
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,521
If he really cares about you,

811
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:06,081
spending three seconds

812
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,441
to reply isn't hard at all.

813
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,361
Trust me, we both know ourselves.

814
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,121
May we be wiser in love.

815
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,121
See you next time.

816
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:25,521
Wait, Wen Cheng.

817
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:26,801
What's wrong?

818
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:30,201
Constipated again?

819
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:32,401
Just say it.

820
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:33,601
It's not like you're confessing to me.

821
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,001
The higher-ups said

822
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,161
they want to change the host.

823
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:40,721
Why?

824
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:42,881
My views aren't bad.

825
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:45,561
Did my comments hit a nerve?

826
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:46,761
Not theirs.

827
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:47,681
It's the audience's.

828
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:50,121
Our show lets viewers call in.

829
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,601
It's to help them.

830
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,241
Not for you to scold them.

831
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:54,921
Scold?

832
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:56,721
Is telling the truth scolding?

833
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:59,481
Some people do deserve it.

834
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,921
They won't wake up without a scolding.

835
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:01,561
But—

836
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:02,241
Strange.

837
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:04,361
I help reduce love losers in this world,

838
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:04,921
is that wrong too?

839
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,161
Love losers, huh?

840
00:39:08,361 --> 00:39:09,881
You're not always successful either.

841
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:12,161
What do you know?

842
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,000
I heard

843
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:17,321
Su Wen stole your girlfriend.

844
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:19,681
That was ages ago.

845
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,040
And she wasn't my girlfriend.

846
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:21,881
Who told you that?

847
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:23,561
That's not important.

848
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:24,881
If it really happened,

849
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:27,001
why not meet up with Su Wen?

850
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:28,921
Why would I meet him?

851
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,521
Su Wen is trending now.

852
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:33,761
If you can get him on the show,

853
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:36,441
have a love philosophy showdown,

854
00:39:36,481 --> 00:39:37,521
the online buzz will be huge.

855
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,241
I could talk to the higher-ups.

856
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:41,401
Me, Wen Cheng,

857
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,161
need Su Wen to keep my job?

858
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:44,001
No way.

859
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:44,961
Just fire me.

860
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:45,521
Wen Cheng.

861
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:46,641
Are you really willing to hand over

862
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:48,601
the show you built to someone else?

863
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:53,841
How about this—

864
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,281
I'll ask my buddy Jiang Anlan to come.

865
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,001
He's a level above Su Wen.

866
00:39:58,401 --> 00:39:59,681
Jiang Anlan?

867
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,280
You think you can get him?

868
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:02,241
Please.

869
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:04,201
I treat his office like my backyard.

870
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:05,801
Alright.

871
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,841
If you really get Jiang Anlan here,

872
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:09,321
I'll make sure you keep your job.

873
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:10,561
Deal.

874
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:24,561
What are you doing?

875
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:26,921
Come on my show.

876
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:28,961
I told you, I'm not interested.

877
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,841
I really need your help.

878
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:33,721
I need your help, not because I'm weak.

879
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:34,841
It's just bad luck.

880
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:36,361
Our executives can't spot talent.

881
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,521
It's exhausting for a genius like me.

882
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,481
Even geniuses need friends.

883
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:43,961
Don't think I owe you a favor.

884
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:45,761
This is mutual trust and support.

885
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:47,041
You help me by joining the show,

886
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,161
and I'll help you chase girls.

887
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,921
I still need your help.

888
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:55,881
It seems

889
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,201
things are going pretty well.

890
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,440
No wonder you're a master.

891
00:40:58,481 --> 00:40:59,721
You learn everything so fast.

892
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,081
When will you learn some manners?

893
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,680
Between us, we don't need

894
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,200
all those annoying formalities, right?

895
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:10,881
I came here

896
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:12,401
to tell you some good news.

897
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:14,201
While you were on your business trip,

898
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,040
my meet-and-greet was a huge success.

899
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:20,201
Everywhere I went, crowds showed up.

900
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,201
You still have guests.

901
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:30,881
Oh.

902
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:33,921
You're that relationship expert.

903
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,201
I've watched your show.

904
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,160
Long time no see.

905
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,560
Thanks for helping me meet a girlfriend.

906
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,241
Even though now...

907
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,921
It's still a learning experience.

908
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:50,041
A learning experience, huh?

909
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:51,481
Yeah.

910
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,481
Hey, what are you doing?

911
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:55,761
Sorry.

912
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:56,921
I didn't know you were after her then.

913
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,761
But as someone who's been there, let me tell you—

914
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:02,761
Believe it or not,

915
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:04,081
calm down.

916
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:05,921
That kind of person isn't worth it.

917
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,281
Alright, alright.

918
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,521
I'm all for taking him down.

919
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,001
Just don't mess up my office.

920
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,521
There are plenty of wildflowers outside.

921
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:15,041
Why obsess over just one blade of grass?

922
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:16,601
It's not about grass or not.

923
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:17,801
Even if it's just a bun today,

924
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:19,281
I saw that bun first.

925
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:20,601
You took my bun.

926
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:22,961
This guy...

927
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,201
So stubborn.

928
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:25,361
The bun's gone.

929
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:26,641
You can just buy another.

930
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:27,441
You...

931
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:30,081
This person's got character flaws.

932
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:31,161
He'll cause trouble sooner or later.

933
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:32,921
You should cut off his funding soon.
