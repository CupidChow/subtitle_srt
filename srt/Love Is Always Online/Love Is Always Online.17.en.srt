33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,260
You too?

34
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,460
Yes.

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,840
May I ask you something?

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,500
Are you single right now?

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,220
Why ask me that?

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,380
I've heard about you for a long time.

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,220
I've always wanted to work with you.

40
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,300
I didn't expect

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,420
to get the chance.

42
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,980
Since you've known
about me for so long,

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,980
you probably know

44
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,460
I've had lots of girlfriends, right?

45
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,820
Yeah.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,620
Then you're really brave.

47
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,460
I think this industry
is full of temptations.

48
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,540
Besides, you're handsome

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,780
and talented.

50
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,460
It's normal to have lots of dates.

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,940
I think

52
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,680
you just haven't met the right person.

53
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,660
So, you're saying

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,140
that to you,

55
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,020
I am the right one,

56
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,180
or maybe, to me,

57
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,540
you are the right one.

58
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,820
Yeah.

59
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,020
At least in terms of looks, right?

60
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,620
Lady,

61
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,260
if he hasn't asked
for your WeChat by now,

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,540
it means he's not interested.

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,420
Su Wen has dated a lot of girls.

64
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,020
That's because he can't say no,

65
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,240
and he's afraid of being bored.

66
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,780
To be precise,

67
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,580
he's always had someone in his heart.

68
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,660
That's why he never settled down.

69
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,220
This industry is full of temptations.

70
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,590
But those who told you

71
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,740
about those theories

72
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,940
are just trying to trick you.

73
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,940
Isn't that too naive
to throw yourself into a man's arms

74
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,420
because you think

75
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,560
you'll end his playboy games?

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,980
No need to thank me.

77
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,780
Hey.

78
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,940
Wait a minute.

79
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,580
(Xinran)

80
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,580
I'm going to the movies.

81
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,420
I'll be back later.

82
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,660
Good.

83
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
They went to see a movie.

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,000
(Warm as Jade)
We're fine now.

85
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,940
Thank Yuan for me.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,940
Why thank only you and not me?

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,280
Because you're too harsh.

88
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,340
Am I harsh?

89
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,180
Yeah, you are.

90
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,210
Are you sure?

91
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm not harsh.

92
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,240
Hey.

93
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,420
They've made up.

94
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,780
Don't I deserve some major credit?

95
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,620
Of course.

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,980
You totally earned top honors.

97
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,620
So, you should thank me for it, right?

98
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,710
There's something here.

99
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,860
So annoying.

100
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,100
Hey.

101
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,420
Hey!

102
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,260
I...

103
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,460
No way.

104
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,580
I worked on this all night.

105
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,580
What should I do?

106
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,180
Hey...

107
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,460
What now?

108
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,100
(Ancheng)

109
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,540
Hey, Jianing.

110
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,020
Ancheng.

111
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,500
What's up?

112
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,340
What happened?

113
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,020
The files I spent so much time

114
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,040
organizing are all gone.

115
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,100
I have to submit them tomorrow.

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,380
What should I do?

117
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,660
Where are you?

118
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,060
I'm still at the office.

119
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,100
Wait for me; I'm on my way.

120
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,940
Okay.

121
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,740
Let's wrap it up for today.

122
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,580
Meeting dismissed.

123
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,720
Dismissed? But Mr. Jiang,

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,700
our case needs to be discussed
tomorrow morning.

125
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,780
Send the proposal to my email;
I'll review it soon.

126
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,920
I'll reply with my feedback.

127
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,760
Got it.

128
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,740
Don't worry.

129
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
I'll fix the bugs in the proposal.

130
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,460
Why isn't he here yet?

131
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,900
Ancheng, you're finally here!

132
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,020
Hurry and help me check this.

133
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,380
What should I do?

134
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,580
I worked on it for so long;
how did it just disappear?

135
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,380
This computer is driving me crazy.

136
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,900
Don't panic.

137
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,740
Let me take a look.

138
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,720
It should be in another folder.

139
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,740
Let's check the timeline first.

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,980
It should have
a record of your activity.

141
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,460
Wait a moment.

142
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,780
(Proposal)

143
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,420
Here it is.

144
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,580
Wow.

145
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Ancheng, you're amazing!

146
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,930
I spent a lot of time finding it.

147
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,180
What is this?

148
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,100
Anlan wants to invest in this company.

149
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,220
So, I put together

150
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,340
their performance data
over the past few years.

151
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,700
Not bad.

152
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,980
The recent data

153
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,020
is important,

154
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,660
but what's even more crucial is

155
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,940
their future plans

156
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,380
and the freshness of their products.

157
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,820
Their future plans?

158
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,020
Look.

159
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,820
This is their data you gathered

160
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,380
over the past five years.

161
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,140
But the market keeps changing.

162
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,580
Have they adapted accordingly?

163
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,900
How effective were those changes?

164
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,160
Compared to competitors,

165
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,940
what are the strengths and weaknesses?

166
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,390
Come on.

167
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,420
I'll find a few websites for you.

168
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,020
Their articles are pretty good.

169
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,180
You can take a look.

170
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,820
Sure.

171
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,140
Ancheng,

172
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,100
I think you're so handsome.

173
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,300
Done.

174
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,500
Let's call it a day.

175
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,740
I'll drive you home.

176
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,900
Dinner's on me tonight.

177
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,620
You helped me out a lot today.

178
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,640
Without you, I wouldn't know what to do.

179
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,220
At this hour,

180
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,880
it's time for a midnight snack.

181
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,700
Yeah, a midnight snack.

182
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,740
The noodles are already served,

183
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,020
but he's not here yet.

184
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,780
Mr. Wen, you're 30 minutes late.

185
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,500
(Warm as Jade)

186
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,940
(Warm as Jade)

187
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
I'm watching a movie.

188
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,900
I forgot to tell you

189
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,010
I couldn't make it. You eat without me.

190
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,580
Alright.

191
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,840
If you don't eat, I will.

192
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,660
Thanks for the dinner today.

193
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,940
It's nothing.

194
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
You look even better in person
than in photos.

195
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,180
With your qualities,
how come you don't have a boyfriend?

196
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,260
People always say that.

197
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,900
You can just stop here.

198
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,940
I'll grab a cab up ahead.

199
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,300
Are you going home?

200
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,820
Not coming to my place?

201
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,780
To your place?

202
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,620
Yeah.

203
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,260
We just met.

204
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,440
Isn't making friends about eating,

205
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,220
chatting, and getting
to know each other?

206
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,220
Haven't we covered all that already?

207
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,560
Come on, let's go to my place.

208
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,660
Let go of me.

209
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm not the kind of girl you think I am.

210
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,300
Why so shy now?

211
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,700
Let's go to my place.

212
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,020
- What are you doing?
- Let go.

213
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,660
Didn't you hear her say no?

214
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,600
Should I call the police?

215
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,780
Are you okay?

216
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,220
I'm fine.

217
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,060
Thank you.

218
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,260
No problem.

219
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,580
Be more careful next time.

220
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,660
Goodbye.

221
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,380
By the way,

222
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,930
you're pretty cute.

223
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,020
Be more confident.

224
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,640
That guy didn't deserve you.

225
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,820
Bye.

226
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,980
This girl dressed

227
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,580
head to toe in designer brands.

228
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,820
She must be from a wealthy family.

229
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,060
How nice.

230
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,700
Why am I so unlucky?

231
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,740
Based on your product,

232
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,010
I found a couple to model for us

233
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,150
to interpret the watch.

234
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,310
It shows the watch is not just a gift

235
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,840
but a symbol of heartfelt intention.

236
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
It represents

237
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,800
giving someone

238
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,930
a lifetime.

239
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,020
Mr. Zhang,

240
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,340
what are your thoughts?

241
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,980
If, in this man's eyes,

242
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,180
the woman is the most important,

243
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,700
why does his gaze

244
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,260
only rest on the watch

245
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,540
and not on her?

246
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,420
I think Mr. Su

247
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,180
still hasn't grasped our theme.

248
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,120
Our theme is love.

249
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,660
To give each other a lifetime,

250
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,050
the loved one

251
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,220
is what truly matters.

252
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,900
The watch does symbolize time,

253
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,120
but

254
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,780
from these photos,

255
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,720
I don't sense any affection
between them.

256
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,580
The product is surely important,

257
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,240
but

258
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,480
the message

259
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,830
in their eyes

260
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,820
matters more.

261
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,860
Mr. Su is well-known in the industry.

262
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,380
Originally,

263
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,020
we were very hopeful
about this collaboration,

264
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,420
but now...

265
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,060
Mr. Zhang.

266
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,780
Mr. Zhang.

267
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,260
Mr. Zhang.

268
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,860
Mr. Zhang.

269
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,380
This is our first cooperation.

270
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,420
Some adjustment is needed.

271
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,980
Please give us a bit more time.

272
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,460
I believe you've seen

273
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,400
Su Wen's previous work,

274
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,240
so you wanted to work with him.

275
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,740
I'm sorry to disappoint you this time.

276
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,140
Please give us another chance.

277
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,580
Next time,
we'll surely meet your standards.

278
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,020
Otherwise, you can put us
on your blacklist for good.

279
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,820
In 10 days,

280
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,220
bring your new work to me.

281
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,780
Don't let me down.

282
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,730
What's wrong with you today?

283
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,020
If anyone doubted your work before,

284
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,480
you would've defended it right away.

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,000
Why were you so quiet this time?

286
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,780
What he said

287
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,900
actually makes sense.

288
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,760
When I was shooting that set,

289
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,520
I didn't capture the emotions
between the two at all.

290
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,970
I was just focused
on composition and techniques.

291
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,120
If it's just about that,

292
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,660
any photographer could do it.

293
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,500
May I ask who you are?

294
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,140
What happened to the old Su Wen?

295
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,620
Besides,

296
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,380
do you know I didn't catch

297
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,980
their emotions at all?

298
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,380
I was quite restless.

299
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,500
I once spent hours on one series.

300
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,700
Just one series.

301
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,100
To photograph a butterfly,

302
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,510
I lay on the grass for 7 hours,

303
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,500
not moving at all.

304
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,780
But now...

305
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,080
Am I facing a career crisis?

306
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,420
If you keep this up,

307
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,300
I'll be the one in crisis,

308
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,560
Photographer Su.

309
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,960
I need to think this through.

310
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,460
Has something happened

311
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,740
to Su Wen lately?

312
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,260
It's probably because of Cui Xi.

313
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,740
His ex-girlfriend?

314
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,900
People's behavior follows a pattern.

315
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,620
80% of what they do

316
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,630
will be repeated.

317
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,780
So, Cui Xi

318
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,220
did something that affected Su Wen?

319
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,540
From the moment you met him until now,

320
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,820
have you ever seen him
act so unusually before?

321
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,900
Not really.

322
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,380
Cui Xi is the only woman he truly loved.

323
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,820
Only she could have that much impact

324
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,700
on him.

325
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,820
Both of you are here.

326
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,540
Of course.

327
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,820
What brings you here?

328
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,780
I feel bad
for standing you up last time.

329
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,980
I came to have dinner with you.

330
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,820
The sun must be rising
from the west today.

331
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,100
Let's go.

332
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,420
Anlan, join us.

333
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,100
You guys go ahead.

334
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,040
I still have work to do.

335
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,870
By the way,

336
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,660
don't take any new jobs
for Su Wen for now.

337
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,180
Give him some time.

338
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
Got it.

339
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,060
What's up with Su Wen?

340
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,900
Any trouble?

341
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,580
Who knows?

342
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,380
You seem to be in a good mood.

343
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,500
Xinran is really different
from what I imagined.

344
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,620
How so?

345
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,580
She's kinda cute.

346
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,580
When we watched movies,

347
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,800
she ate two buckets of popcorn.

348
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,220
When someone talked,
she even threw popcorn at them

349
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,300
and then hid away.

350
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Isn't that adorable?

351
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,820
There's a show
that'd be perfect for you now.

352
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,980
What kind of show?

353
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,260
Love Fools.

354
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,300
By the way,

355
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,020
what's your impression of Xiaoya?

356
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,500
What do you mean?

357
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,740
I just want to know
what you think of her.

358
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,420
Xiaoya

359
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,980
wants a passionate, whirlwind romance,

360
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,780
but she doesn't know
what kind of man suits her.

361
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,820
She has too many unrealistic ideas
about love.

362
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,380
You surely know your lines well.

363
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,340
I'm asking how you feel about her.

364
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,380
Why ask that so suddenly?

365
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
It's Xinran.

366
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,260
She said since you're both single...

367
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,300
Are you trying to play matchmaker?

368
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,300
My life's none of your business.

369
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,980
Suit yourself.

370
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,620
Sir,

371
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,860
the noodles?

372
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,460
Okay, coming right up.

373
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,300
You only asked me out for a walk?

374
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,100
No.

375
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,860
What's wrong?

376
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,180
I can't create anything good.

377
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,220
You know.

378
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,100
It feels like being trapped

379
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,900
inside a house you can't get out of.

380
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,100
That house doesn't have a door.

381
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,600
There are only windows.

382
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
No matter how hard I try,

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,760
I just can't get through those windows.

384
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,300
After Beethoven went deaf,

385
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,100
he used bone conduction

386
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,220
to listen to music and keep composing.

387
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,180
As long as you love it and keep at it,

388
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,820
you'll get through the low points.

389
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,100
Van Gogh loved art and creating,

390
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,620
but he couldn't get past reality.

391
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,180
No one's path is smooth forever.

392
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,100
Also,

393
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,620
you won't be stuck in a slump forever.

394
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,780
But what if

395
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,300
I've really lost my talent?

396
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,820
Talent doesn't just disappear like that.

397
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,780
You're not a robot.

398
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,900
Your mood affects you.

399
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,480
You just need to break out of it.

400
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,900
Try changing your mood.

401
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,740
Look at the world in a different way.

402
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,980
You could even try painting.

403
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,940
Let your mind settle for a bit.

404
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,100
You'll surely feel something new.

405
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,920
You really believe in me, huh?

406
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,860
Of course.

407
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,180
You're a photographer I really admire.

408
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,570
I love the days

409
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,230
back in college.

410
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,220
I liked painting, too.

411
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,420
Why did you stop?

412
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,970
Because the teacher back then

413
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,900
was not my type.

414
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,570
Let's grab something to eat.

415
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,150
You pick. I'll treat you.

416
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,020
Why? I'm a rich man.

417
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,100
Weren't you in a bad mood?

418
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,140
I'm feeling much better now.

419
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,500
Sure, what are you treating me to?

420
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,220
Su Wen reached out to me today.

421
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,980
What did he want?

422
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,380
He was feeling down

423
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,340
and wanted some advice from me.

424
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,420
He really isn't himself these days.

425
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,700
You can take him out more often.

426
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,020
Keeping it all inside isn't good.

427
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,060
What?

428
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,700
You want me to keep him company?

429
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,920
Since when did you get so reasonable?

430
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,460
Am I someone

431
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,780
who's not reasonable to you?

432
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,020
I didn't mean it.

433
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,740
You're just a bit overbearing.

434
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,740
I'm only overbearing with you.

435
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,940
Anyway, Su Wen

436
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,900
is truly facing

437
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,340
a major hurdle in life.

438
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,700
Yeah.

439
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,260
Let's do another set.

440
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,260
Okay.

441
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,220
Hey, wait a minute.

442
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,260
Aren't you

443
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,680
a bit unfamiliar with each other?

444
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,650
I want you to imagine

445
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,820
the other is the most important person
in your life.

446
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,980
If you didn't have each other,

447
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,340
you would

448
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,580
just die.

449
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,140
You'd really die.

450
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,780
- Okay?
- Okay.

451
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,140
We're kind of stuck on how to go on.

452
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,980
Let's take a break, then.

453
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,580
You're back.

454
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,820
I brought some red wine.

455
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,660
Let's have a drink.

We couldn't see where the future was.

462
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,340
But along the way,

463
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,620
we both built our own careers.

464
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,620
I know you're feeling down now.

465
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
But this will pass.

I'll be here by your side.

Yao Xinran

485
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,940
is probably using her break again

486
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,500
to go on a date with Wen Cheng.

487
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,540
Hey.

488
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,220
Do you know how far they've come?

489
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,020
Honestly, I have no idea.

490
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,820
No idea?

491
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,460
No way.

492
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,620
Hello.

493
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,120
Hello, is this Yao Yuan?

494
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,540
Yes.

495
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,170
I'm the manager at your uncle's diner.

496
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,380
Do you remember me?

497
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,140
Yes, I remember. Hello.

498
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,980
What's going on?

499
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,660
Here's the thing.

500
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,510
Your uncle hasn't paid salaries
for two months.

501
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,300
He kept asking us to wait,

502
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,550
saying he needed some time.

503
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,190
But the staff can't wait any longer.

504
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,460
How did it come to this?

505
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,600
Everyone needs to eat.

506
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,060
I really have no choice

507
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,900
but to contact you.

508
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,220
Okay.

509
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,020
Don't worry; try not to stress.

510
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,220
I'll look into it first.

511
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,300
Once I reach him, I'll update you, okay?

512
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,420
Alright, thanks.

513
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,580
That'd be a big help.

514
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,940
Alright. Goodbye.

515
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:22,060
(Diner of Delicacies)

516
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,140
Hey, Uncle.

517
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,980
You're finally back.

518
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,420
Why didn't you answer your phone?

519
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,310
Oh.

520
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,260
I've been busy
with the new diner's renovation.

521
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,200
Things have been hectic.

522
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,260
The manager called me,

523
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,900
saying the salary hasn't been paid.

524
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,250
Oh.

525
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,740
No worries.

526
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,740
The accountant made a mistake.

527
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,680
I told him to redo it.

528
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Once it's sorted, they'll get paid.

529
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,140
As you know,

530
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,940
these accounts are important.

531
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,220
Really?

532
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,540
But...

533
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,900
Come on. Don't worry about it.

534
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,460
This is my first time doing business.

535
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,260
Give me some time to get the hang of it.

536
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,480
Don't worry; it's fine.

537
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,620
Alright.

538
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,340
If anything comes up,
you have to tell me.

539
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,700
You need to think

540
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,120
about what Anlan said earlier.

541
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,140
Okay, okay.

542
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,300
I have work to do. Bye.

543
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,160
Boss,

544
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,220
Yao Yuan's uncle is here.

545
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,940
What?

546
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,820
I know he didn't have an appointment.

547
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,060
But he looks a bit off.

548
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,580
Let him in.

549
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,820
Please.

550
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,660
Alright, thanks.

551
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,820
Anlan,

552
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,740
well...

553
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,440
I want to talk to you about something.

554
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,900
Go ahead, Uncle.

555
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,460
Hey.

556
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,820
Look.

557
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,100
The diner was doing great at first.

558
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,760
The turnover rate was really high.

559
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,780
But now, for some reason,

560
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,340
we're having some financial issues.

561
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,280
Expenses are exceeding income?

562
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,220
This is all my fault.

563
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,960
I brought up your suggestion

564
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,120
with my partner,

565
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,540
but

566
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,790
he said you're the big boss,

567
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,480
and you don't understand our business.

568
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,400
He told me to decide.

569
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,220
After all, the customers seemed happy.

570
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,700
Of course.

571
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,620
They don't have to worry
about costs or losses.

572
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,180
But you guys can't ignore that.

573
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,500
Yes, yes.

574
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,940
It's all my fault.

575
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,660
So,

576
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,630
I came to ask you today

577
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,290
if you could help me out.

578
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,560
Once my three new diners open,

579
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,580
and I start making money,

580
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,620
I'll pay you back at once.

581
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,580
Three new diners?

582
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,740
I figured since business was good,

583
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,620
I should open more

584
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,220
to earn more.

585
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,700
Last time,

586
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,180
your brother helped me with funds.

587
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,100
But this time,

588
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,820
I really can't ask him again.

589
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,440
That's why I came to you.

590
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,300
My brother?

591
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,200
Did he lend you money?

592
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,840
Can you do me this favor?

593
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,140
It's not impossible.

594
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,900
But I need to check with Yao Yuan first.

595
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,020
Do we

596
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
really have to tell her?

597
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,860
I don't want to worry her.

598
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,660
You're Yao Yuan's uncle.

599
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,980
Since you're family,

600
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,450
there's nothing to hide.

601
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,000
Yao Yuan supports you so much.

602
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,260
She deserves to know the truth.

603
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,620
Yeah, you're right.

604
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,100
That's true.

605
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,200
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you

606
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,660
that your brother

607
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,820
lent me money.

608
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,940
He meant well.

609
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,300
Don't worry about it now.

610
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,630
Focus on sorting out the diner first.

611
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,810
Your dishes are pretty good.

612
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,820
But you can't rush things

613
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,060
when business looks good.

614
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,100
Now, the cost and management issues

615
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,300
are what you need to focus on.

616
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,060
That's more practical than expansion.

617
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,580
But my partner says

618
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,380
money comes in

619
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,500
through opening diners,

620
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,740
but money flies in through expansion.

621
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,800
Expansion is a double-edged sword.

622
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,930
It can quickly boost your reputation,

623
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,140
but without reserve funds,

624
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,900
it becomes a real problem.

625
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,940
Yes, you're right.

626
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,780
I should have listened to you.

627
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,660
So,

628
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,820
could you handle Yuan's side?

629
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,460
I'll leave first.

630
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,300
Sure, Uncle.

631
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,620
Goodbye.

632
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,900
What's up?

633
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,700
Give me some congrats.

634
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,140
Congrats for what?

635
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,740
Take a guess.

636
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,660
A promotion?

637
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,460
Or did you finally see reason

638
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,260
and want to give me a chance?

639
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,620
Have you ever seen a flower
grow from dirt?

640
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,760
I know I'm the flower here.

641
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,500
Don't talk about yourself like that.

642
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,420
Alright, just kidding.

643
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,960
So, what's the news? Share it.

644
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,210
Take a seat.

645
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
I'm telling you.

646
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Mr. Jiang

647
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,060
agreed to sign our cooperation letter.

648
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,820
Really?

649
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,780
All that hard work finally paid off.

650
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,820
I landed such a tough client.

651
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,180
See?

652
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,340
I'm sharp as a tack.

653
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,540
I'll surely be Anlan's perfect wife.

654
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,300
But

655
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,820
so many top managers

656
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,260
failed to do that.

657
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,320
How did you manage to fix it?

658
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,380
You look like you don't believe me.

659
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,940
I'll let you join in.

660
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,580
Come with me when I sign with Mr. Jiang.

661
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,700
I'll have you take photos as proof.

662
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Sure, no problem.

663
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,180
I don't mind
you helping Jianing at work,

664
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,220
but why didn't you tell me

665
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,740
you were supporting Yao Yuan's uncle?

666
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,860
So, this is why you came to see me.

667
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,100
I happened to be at your company.

668
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,240
Mr. Shi came for you,
but you weren't there.

669
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,860
He urgently needed funds,

670
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,220
so I helped him out.

671
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,780
Why didn't you tell me afterward?

672
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,620
I planned to wait

673
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,460
until he succeeded.

674
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,580
It was meant to be a surprise
for you and Yao Yuan.

675
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,940
But he ended up failing.

676
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,940
I didn't expect you

677
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,900
to confront me

678
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,100
in this tone.

679
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,020
Do you think his diner
is worth investing in?

680
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,580
What are you implying?

681
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,140
Are you suggesting

682
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,260
I had ulterior motives?

683
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,900
If it's not worth investing in,

684
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,340
why did you fund him?

685
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,180
I simply did it

686
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,530
because he's Yao Yuan's uncle.

687
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,160
That's why I lent him the money.

688
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,460
I didn't do any evaluation.

689
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,860
How could you think of me this way?

690
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,300
Can't I just help my brother?

691
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
I misunderstood you.

692
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,220
I'm grateful you funded her uncle.

693
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,700
But from now on,

694
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,660
if it's about Yao Yuan,

695
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,220
could you let me know beforehand?

696
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,040
I have a meeting to attend,

697
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,420
so I'll head back to the office.

698
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,140
Hey, Zhang He.

699
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,180
When signing the contract,

700
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,560
could you take a few photos for us?

701
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,860
Put both of us in the frame.

702
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,220
- No problem.
- Take more shots.

703
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,380
Is that Mr. Jiang?

704
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,500
Mr. Jiang, please have a seat.

705
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,440
That won't be necessary.

706
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,620
I came here to inform you

707
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,860
that I've reconsidered
our collaboration.

708
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,620
Why is that?

709
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,020
Is there an issue with our contract?

710
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,660
The contract itself is fine.

711
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,960
It's just because of you.

712
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,740
You're too young.

713
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,220
Just because I'm young?

714
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,860
Your experience

715
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,300
and your rank are insufficient.

716
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,000
I have reservations
about working with you.

717
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,870
I admit I'm young and inexperienced,

718
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,820
but that doesn't mean
I can't do a good job.

719
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,700
Exactly.

720
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,540
No need to say more.

721
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,860
I've made up my mind.

722
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,780
How could you go back

723
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,820
- on your word?
- Jianing.

724
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,420
Hey, young lady,

725
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,130
the business world
is like a battlefield.

726
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,620
It's not a place to make friends.

727
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,540
Order whatever you want.

728
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,620
Consider it as compensation.

729
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,980
Also,

730
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm very grateful

731
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,860
for the phone charm you gave me.

732
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,660
Let's go.

733
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,860
Mr. Jiang.

734
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,700
Come in.

735
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,080
Here's the info you requested.

736
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,140
Currently,

737
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,120
Mr. Shi Zhengyi's diner

738
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,500
has a gap in the profit-loss ratio.

739
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,490
The cost price doesn't cover
the selling price.

740
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,280
Yet he's expanding,

741
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,190
probably aiming
to quickly build a reputation.

742
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,460
How about the locations for expansion?

743
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,150
All three are listed in the report.

744
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,740
They seem to have foot traffic,

745
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,000
but the rent is steep.

746
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,980
Given his current profit-loss ratio,

747
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,180
he might not last two months.

748
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,500
Also, I found his partner

749
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,610
has a history of fraud.

750
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,100
Got it.

751
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,260
You can leave now.

752
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,500
Yes.

753
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,100
Miss Fang.

754
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,900
Jianing,

755
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,540
what brings you here?

756
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,580
Have a seat.

757
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,900
What's wrong?

758
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,740
It's Mr. Jiang again.

759
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,420
He went back on his word.

760
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,980
That sly old fox.

761
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,320
A real veteran in the game.

762
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,290
Do you know what he told me?

763
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,900
He said I'm too young,

764
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,540
I lack the ability,

765
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,440
I'm inexperienced,

766
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,840
and I can't make decisions.

767
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,340
So, he refused to sign the contract.

768
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,440
Before he left, he even thanked me

769
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,230
for my phone charm.

770
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,900
Oh, my gosh.

771
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,420
I worked so hard,

772
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,100
but he didn't even care.

773
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,700
What a jerk.

774
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,540
That's just how the world is.

775
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,100
Not everyone thinks

776
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,660
as you do.

777
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,500
It might be frustrating for you,

778
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,040
because you're eager
to prove yourself to Anlan.

779
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,300
But at work,

780
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,340
things like this

781
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,380
happen all the time.

782
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,100
When people make unreasonable demands

783
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,940
or criticize you,

784
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,340
we should think

785
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,880
about whether there's any truth
in what they're saying.

786
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,220
If there is, improve.

787
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,360
If not, take it as a lesson.

788
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
Right?

789
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,020
What should I do now?

790
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,180
My work...

791
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,070
Be honest with Anlan
about the situation.

792
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,620
Then send an email to Mr. Jiang

793
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,230
to thank him for his guidance.

794
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,020
Strive to become an amazing supervisor

795
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,860
and show him.

796
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,840
Right.

797
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,000
That's exactly what I'll do.

798
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,540
One day, he'll come begging me.

799
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,220
I'll give him a hard time.

800
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,320
I'll introduce you to a few friends.

801
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,300
They may help out.

802
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
Ancheng, you're the best.

803
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,500
(Jindi Fashion Magazine; Reply)

804
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,060
Miss Cui, we're sorry to inform you

805
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,420
that after careful consideration,

806
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,700
your work doesn't align with our needs

807
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,060
in terms of style and innovation.

808
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,580
We hope to collaborate in the future.

809
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,380
(Tom)

810
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,660
I found an opportunity for you.

811
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,100
I've sent the details to your email.

812
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,060
Wait a second.

813
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,180
Su.

814
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,460
Hi, I'm Yao Yuan.

815
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,540
Hello.

816
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,660
I'm Su's friend.

817
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,500
I'm Cui Xi.

818
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,940
Nice to meet you.

819
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,280
So, you're the exhibition planner
he mentioned.

820
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,900
You look so great.

821
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,820
Thanks for looking after him.

822
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,120
What are you talking about?

823
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,180
Since when do I need someone
to look after me?

824
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,780
Why are you here?

825
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,400
I can't find my house keys,

826
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,760
so I came to get them.

827
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,060
Yao Yuan and I need to work.

828
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,500
Head back first.

829
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,980
Alright.

830
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,020
I'll leave then.

831
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,140
She's your nemesis, huh?

832
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,900
What nemesis?

833
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,220
Just a regular friend.

834
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,660
Nonsense.

835
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,660
The way she looked at me just now

836
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,260
was like she was claiming territory.

837
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,380
Are you girls

838
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,700
always this sensitive?

839
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,240
It's just part of our nature as girls.

840
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,820
Do you want to get back with her?

841
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,100
Who knows?

842
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,480
(Incorrect password)
My birthday?

843
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,220
Nope.

844
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,500
Su Wen's birthday?

845
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,100
(Incorrect password)

846
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,180
Incorrect again.

847
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,220
It smells so good.

848
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,860
Well.

849
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,700
You didn't meet Cui Xi today.

850
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,780
Though he was smiling,

851
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,720
her eyes were like they could see
right through you.

852
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,900
No wonder Su Wen can't handle her.

853
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,020
Don't worry.

854
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,940
Su Wen's not a kid anymore.

855
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,780
He can handle it.

856
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,980
This tastes amazing.

857
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,340
Try it.

858
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,180
Okay.

859
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,740
Go ahead.

860
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,860
It's so good.

861
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,500
Yao Yuan,

862
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,460
your uncle came to me today.

863
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,020
What did he want?

864
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,270
He said

865
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,260
there's a bit of a financial issue.

866
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,360
He wanted to borrow money.

867
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,100
That's strange.

868
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,510
I just saw him.

869
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,420
He said everything was fine.

870
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,420
The accountant made a mistake.

871
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,590
Why's he asking you for money?

872
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,340
I can help him get through this.

873
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,340
But I have to respect your opinion.

874
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,580
No.

875
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,660
I don't agree.

876
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,860
You can't lend him money.

877
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,660
Yao Yuan.

878
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,300
I'm not just giving him money for free.

879
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,460
I'll have him lay out
his financial situation

880
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,120
to see where adjustments are needed.

881
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,540
I know you want to help him.

882
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,060
But I can't accept this.

883
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
I'll talk to him

884
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,140
and figure something out,

885
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,380
but we can't trouble you.

886
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,700
Really.

887
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,220
I can agree to anything else,

888
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,460
but when it comes to my uncle,

889
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,260
you have to respect my decision.

890
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,340
A lot of things have made me feel

891
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,140
that I don't trust him as much anymore.

892
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,710
He even secretly asked you
for money now.

893
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
Let's eat.

894
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,940
I'll discuss it with him.

895
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,980
Just leave it alone, okay?

896
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,490
Okay.

897
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,020
Eat up.

898
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,140
You're back.

899
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,140
Are you hungry?

900
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,380
I'll make you some pasta.

901
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,780
Does Yao Yuan

902
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,120
have feelings for you?

903
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,700
Her heart only belongs to Jiang Anlan.

904
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,660
Hey.

905
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,980
Let's go on a date tomorrow, okay?

906
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,500
A date?

907
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,620
Yeah.

908
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,220
I'm putting all my work aside
to cook for you.

909
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,360
And you still don't trust me?

910
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,280
Really?

911
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,500
How come I heard from others

912
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,040
that you're looking for opportunities?

913
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,340
Will you support me then?

914
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,540
Cui Xi,

915
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,700
I know all about your ambitions.

916
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,180
If fame and fortune came your way,

917
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,600
would you really stay at home?

918
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm going out tomorrow
to find inspiration.

919
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,860
I can't keep you company.

920
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,220
(Close)

921
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,580
Raising prices is your call,

922
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,120
but you can't use that as an excuse

923
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,530
to delay paying our wages, right?

924
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,780
Exactly.

925
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,530
We've done a lot to expand the business.

926
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,300
We've got families to support.

927
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,820
I'm sorry, everyone.

928
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,880
I'm doing my best to get the money.

929
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,580
Please give me some time.

930
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,860
You always say that.

931
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,760
You convinced me
to quit my job in Beijing,

932
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,640
promising I'd earn 15,000 more
each month.

933
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,660
But now,

934
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,700
I'm not even getting paid.

935
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,780
What am I supposed to do?

936
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,010
Just be honest with us.

937
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,620
Otherwise, we're not working.

938
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,820
Your diner can't open then.

939
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,100
Yeah, take responsibility.

940
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,740
Exactly.

941
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,260
I don't have a single penny to spare.

942
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,680
- We'll call the police.
- Please.

943
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,720
Please give me some time.

944
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,660
Everyone, I'm sorry.

945
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
Please listen to me.

946
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,820
I know you're upset.

947
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,140
I completely understand.

948
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,580
But please believe me.

949
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,340
My uncle must be more anxious
than you are.

950
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,580
Please trust us.

951
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,020
We'll surely resolve this, okay?

952
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Just give us some time.

953
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,140
Let me discuss it with my uncle.

954
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
We'll surely give you

955
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,780
a satisfactory answer, okay?

956
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,580
You're a person of your word.

957
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,280
Thanks for your trouble.

958
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,740
But

959
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,810
it's not just your uncle
who's struggling.

960
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,060
Everyone's trying to make a living.

961
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,400
I understand. Thanks for your patience.

962
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,500
