00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,460
(Lord of All, Tianxia Gang, Spectator Mode)

34
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,060
Stop.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,180
Finally, the day has come.

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,060
My little sister

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,740
is getting married.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,260
It's just a game. Why are you so excited?

39
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,260
If Yao Yuan really got married,

40
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,500
you wouldn't know how to react.

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,780
If she really got married,

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,620
I'd throw a banquet with 200 tables,

43
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,100
and give her a huge red envelope.

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,340
A huge red envelope?

45
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,820
How much money will you give?

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,690
That depends on your husband.

47
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,760
If he's broke,

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,860
I'd give more.

49
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,820
But this time,

50
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,940
I don't have to worry.

51
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,580
Yeah, true.

52
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,980
If you sell the Five-Element Dragon Ball,

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,400
it'll cover your fancy eats
for quite a while.

54
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,500
What do you think?

55
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,980
When do you want to meet him?

56
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,380
I won't.

57
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,220
Huh?

58
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,540
What's wrong?

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,820
That's just a game, okay?

60
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,780
Here we go.

61
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,340
You're pushing people away again,

62
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,880
always being afraid of burdening them.

63
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,090
But this guy can handle it.

64
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,990
Just meet him first.

65
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,100
What if

66
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,720
he's the one worth committing to?

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,500
You two go meet him.

68
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,140
Hey.

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,700
Boss,

70
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,540
something big happened.

71
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,660
What's the problem?

72
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,020
Check out the forum.

73
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,460
(I heard Jiangcheng's most
beautiful planner, For Thy Sake,)

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,820
(is actually getting married.)

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,820
(Such a beautiful lady.)

76
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,020
(Shouldn't her be public property?)

77
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,140
Is "Wander Wherever" from Jiangcheng?

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,460
Yes, that's right.

79
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,820
He left a comment below too.

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,580
Get him over here.

81
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,980
Got it.

82
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Do you know who I am?

83
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,940
You're... Lord of All.

84
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,460
Master of the gang.

85
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,300
Hello, Master.

86
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,140
I'm Zhang He.

87
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,260
Wander Wherever.

88
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,740
Master, you're really handsome.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
I'll get straight to the point.

90
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,180
You took For Thy Sake's photo

91
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,240
and posted it on the forum, right?

92
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,340
Did you get her permission?

93
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,580
You mean Miss Yao?

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,420
It wasn't me.

95
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,500
It was my classmate who took it.

96
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,060
Who gave you the right to do this?

97
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,980
Delete it immediately.

98
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,620
Oh.

99
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,100
Let me ask you something.

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,330
When did you find out

101
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,620
that she's For Thy Sake?

102
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,580
Just now.

103
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,660
What was her reaction?

104
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,380
She didn't react much.

105
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,620
She said,

106
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,940
"It's just the game world.

107
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,020
Don't take it seriously."

108
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,700
But after the photo was uploaded,

109
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,020
people started calling her "Madam".

110
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,380
She didn't object.

111
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,380
Really?

112
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,780
What kind of person is Miss Yao?

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,860
Well,

114
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,740
let me tell you.

115
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,180
Miss Yao is an amazing person.

116
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,300
I truly admire her.

117
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,340
Alright, alright, I don't need to hear it.

118
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,700
From now on,

119
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,980
I want to know everything, what she needs,

120
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,700
what she doesn't need, who's mistreating her

121
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,540
or who likes her.

122
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,980
Can you help me with this?

123
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,300
No problem.

124
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,380
Master, you've saved me so many times.

125
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,540
I still owe you big time.

126
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,660
But, Master,

127
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,900
I have to ask,

128
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,980
are you serious

129
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,460
about Miss Yao?

130
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,540
Are you worried I'll rip her off?

131
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,860
No, no, that's not what I meant.

132
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,020
Don't tell anyone

133
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,660
I called you here today.

134
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,340
If others find out,

135
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,780
I'll kick you out of the Tianxia Gang.

136
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,460
Or...

137
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,340
You kill me in the game.

138
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,300
Or I'll kill myself.

139
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,060
Got it.

140
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,330
Go on.

141
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,990
Alright, Master, I'll take my leave.

142
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,060
(Even Master's smile is so charming.)

143
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,740
(I'm so envious of Miss Yao.)

144
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,500
Boss.

145
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,300
The business transformation proposal
was a big success.

146
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,020
The client's boss said
he'd treat you to a meal.

147
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,460
No need.

148
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,300
Let them treat whoever worked the hardest.

149
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,940
Alright.

150
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,420
(Wen Ruyu)
Check the forum.

151
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,380
(Everyone knows Lord of All is top-tier.)

152
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,740
(His bad behavior is also well-known.)

153
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,820
(He often flirts with women in games.)

154
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,140
(But after a couple of days together,)

155
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,740
(he just pays them off and sends them away.)

156
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,820
(He's incredibly fickle and heartless.)

157
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,740
When did I ever flirt with women?

158
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,540
Sounds like the complaints
of a guy who can't get a date.

159
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,620
Look at this guy.

160
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,180
Why the jealousy if he can't get a date?

161
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,260
(Though he rarely speaks,)

162
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,980
(he's actually a decent person.)

163
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,340
(At least the severance pay is generous.)

164
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,740
(I don't think I'll forget him easily.)

165
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,340
(Maybe we'll meet again in the future.)

166
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,580
Severance pay?

167
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,540
I don't even know whether

168
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,620
this person is male or female.

169
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,020
What severance pay?

170
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,100
Look, there's more here.

171
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,620
Because of you,

172
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
someone doesn't believe in love anymore.

173
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,900
Get out of here.

174
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,020
(Lord of All)

175
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,460
There isn't much gossip

176
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,300
about you online.

177
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Didn't you say you didn't care?

178
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,660
I don't care now.

179
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,500
But I'm afraid someone else might.

180
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,740
- Let's go.
- Hey.

181
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,940
Those are his rumors.

182
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,140
What does that have to do with me?

183
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,580
But you're his fiance.

184
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,940
Don't you feel like

185
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,340
you're caught in the crossfire for no reason?

186
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,900
No, I'm not going.

187
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,620
What if he turns out to be good-looking?

188
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,780
Just go and meet him.

189
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,340
What if he's not good-looking?

190
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,780
Just say thanks and move on.

191
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,420
You're so practical.

192
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,580
Of course.

193
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,840
People need to be realistic.

194
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,500
Hurry up, hurry up.

195
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,780
I'm planning to organize an offline meetup.

196
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,900
An offline meetup?

197
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,780
With everyone together?

198
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,940
I just want it to be me and her.

199
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,630
But...

200
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,940
You're shy?

201
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,180
How would she even come?

202
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,900
(Ruishi Investment)

203
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,660
Someone already found For Thy Sake.

204
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,900
How could they not find out

205
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,940
you work here?

206
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,100
This ruins all my plans.

207
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,820
But plans never keep up with changes.

208
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,420
Hello.

209
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,060
Hi, we're looking for Jiang Anlan.

210
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,040
Take the elevator
to the third-floor dining area.

211
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,610
He's the one in the dark blue jacket
and plaid shirt.

212
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,660
The elevator is this way.

213
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,740
Okay, thanks.

214
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,940
Are you ready?

215
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,140
What if he doesn't recognize me?

216
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,780
As long as you recognize him,
that's what matters.

217
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,020
What's wrong?

218
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
You feel nervous?

219
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,900
You're not actually falling for him, are you?

220
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,060
Who's falling for him?

221
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,740
Um...

222
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,500
Are you Jiang Anlan?

223
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,500
Can I sit here?

224
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,020
Sure.

225
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,500
You don't recognize me?

226
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,220
Of course I do.

227
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,740
Hi, I'm Yao Yuan,

228
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,380
For Thy Sake.

229
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,950
Hello.

230
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm Jiang Anlan.

231
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
Lord of All.

232
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,380
Don't you want to see me?

233
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,380
I think about it every day.

234
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,980
Didn't you say I saved you once?

235
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,660
Hmm.

236
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,700
I was afraid you'd forget.

237
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,980
What's wrong with you?

238
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,900
Need to go to the hospital?

239
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,540
Hey, young man.

240
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,380
What's wrong with you?

241
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,900
What's wrong with you?

242
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,740
Need to go to the hospital?

243
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,860
- What's wrong?
- Sir, sir.

244
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,140
Please don't shake him like that.

245
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,980
He might feel uncomfortable.

246
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,980
Hey.

247
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,260
Hey, are you okay now?

248
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
Hey.

249
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,500
Hey.

250
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,620
Are you feeling okay now?

251
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,140
Wallet.

252
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,420
I lost my wallet.

253
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,660
And my phone too.

254
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,180
Don't worry.

255
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,240
I'll call an ambulance for you right now.

256
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,660
You'll be okay.

257
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,980
Hello, is this 120?

258
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,660
A classmate of ours has fainted.

259
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,740
We're in front of the department store.

260
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,220
You're awake.

261
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,900
Was there a girl who brought me here?

262
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,980
Yes.

263
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,060
She stayed by your side the whole time

264
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
and even paid the bills for you.

265
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,620
But she left after the doctors took over.

266
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,980
Did she leave any contact information?

267
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,340
No, she didn't.

268
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,660
Aren't you classmates?

269
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
It's fine, thanks.

270
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,260
Why aren't you saying anything?

271
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,870
Miss,

272
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
you sure you got the right person?

273
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,300
I don't know you.

274
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,630
Huh?

275
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,980
You... You don't play Shengshi?

276
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,220
You're not Lord of All?

277
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,580
I can't understand

278
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,100
a word of what you said.

279
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,980
Miss,

280
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
are you okay?

281
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,860
Are you feeling unwell?

282
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,140
You're the one who's unwell!

283
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,300
What are you trying to say?

284
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,940
You're relentless online,

285
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,580
but in real life, you act clueless.

286
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,100
Are you messing with her?

287
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,260
Go.

288
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,740
And don't bother us again.

289
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
What's going on?

290
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,940
It's For Thy Sake's doing?

291
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,420
How's the offline meetup going?

292
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,020
I've sent the message.

293
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,460
I'll get back to work now.

294
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,900
So, how was it?

295
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,460
Is Lord of All as tall and handsome
as they say?

296
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,620
Don't even mention it.

297
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,980
He's not good-looking,

298
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,260
and his character is even worse.

299
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,520
I don't know where those rumors came from.

300
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,620
How could someone like that be a boss?

301
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,180
Yuan, don't be too disappointed.

302
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,340
Maybe it's not him?

303
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,330
I just feel like it doesn't add up.

304
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,590
What are the chances of someone
having the same name?

305
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,380
These things are hard to say.

306
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,170
Yuan.

307
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,910
You should sell your account.

308
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,820
Don't you usually sell the accounts

309
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,930
at this level?

310
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,300
No, don't sell it.

311
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,660
If you sell it,
Lord of All won't be able to find you.

312
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,260
We don't even know each other.

313
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
If he can't find me, then so be it.

314
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,620
(Lord of All)

315
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,500
It's Lord of All.

316
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,540
Don't answer it.

317
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,740
So impatient, huh?

318
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,660
He's already looking for you so soon?

319
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,500
Maybe he wants to apologize to me.

320
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,540
Let's eat.

321
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,780
Hello, the number you dialed is busy.

322
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,100
Please try again later.

323
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Hello, the number you dialed is busy.

324
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,380
She hung up on me.

325
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,020
Miss Yao.

326
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,100
It's our master's call.

327
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,620
He insists you take it.

328
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,660
Hey.

329
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,780
This is Jiang Anlan.

330
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,300
You just came by my company.

331
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,860
Yes, I did.

332
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,020
Didn't we just meet at the company?

333
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,820
Silly you.

334
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,420
Can't you tell?

335
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,580
These two voices are completely different.

336
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,500
I just felt something was off.

337
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,580
So,

338
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,620
did I really mistake you for someone else?

339
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,180
Of course you did.

340
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,700
You have my number, why didn't you call me?

341
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,540
What's wrong?

342
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,100
I had the wrong person.

343
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,980
I knew it.

344
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,260
So,

345
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,980
you knew I was there earlier.

346
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,700
Why didn't you come out to see me?

347
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,580
Do you really want to see me?

348
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
I... I really do want to see you.

349
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,740
That eager, huh?

350
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,920
Our wedding is still five days away.

351
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,900
I just wanted to talk about that.

352
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,660
Maybe we should just forget it.

353
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,380
Are you trying to back out?

354
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,020
I'm not trying to back out.

355
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,860
It's just...

356
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,300
I get it.

357
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,780
Before the wedding,

358
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,940
we should at least get to know each other.

359
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,220
I understand that too.

360
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,820
So I had someone send out

361
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,220
an offline meetup invite
for Tianxia Gang and Baihua Hall.

362
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,740
Come by when you have time.

363
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,180
You won't mistake me this time.

364
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,140
Offline meetup?

365
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,500
Offline meetup?

366
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,260
Don't worry.

367
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,260
I won't claim to be a genius,

368
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,980
but at least I look decent.

369
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,220
See you tomorrow.

370
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,700
Tomorrow?

371
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,540
That soon?

372
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,700
You're the one in a hurry, not me.

373
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,910
Alright, dear.

374
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,940
I still have work to do.

375
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,060
See you tomorrow.

376
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,460
You play Shengshi too?

377
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,700
Yeah, I do.

378
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,020
Wander Wherever. from Tianxia Gang.

379
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,660
You're from Tianxia Gang?

380
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,980
Have you met your master then?

381
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,820
Is he good-looking?

382
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,700
Yeah, I've met him.

383
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,300
He's quite handsome.

384
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,140
What kind of person is he?

385
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,060
It's hard to describe.

386
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,020
You should meet him yourself.

387
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,180
It's just an offline meetup.

388
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,300
Why are you so serious about it?

389
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,020
Not everyone's as naturally stunning as you.

390
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,340
Besides,

391
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,780
look at the Tianxia Gang.

392
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,460
Everyone's gear is top-notch.

393
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,260
There must be a lot of
outstanding young people inside.

394
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,460
I should take this chance
to get to know them.

395
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,180
You're going dressed like that?

396
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,140
This is just how I am.

397
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,340
Fair enough.

398
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,380
You're getting married anyway.

399
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,980
It's good to keep it low-key.

400
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,460
Well,

401
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,940
don't get me any more gifts.

402
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,700
This isn't from me.

403
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,660
You bought it yourself.

404
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,060
I bought it myself?

405
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,180
Yeah.

406
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,820
Remember when I borrowed
your money yesterday?

407
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,900
It was to buy this for you.

408
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,500
Why did you go through all that trouble?

409
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,860
She didn't want to spend,
so I helped her out.

410
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Women should know how to love themselves.

411
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,220
That's something
you should learn from Xiaoya.

412
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,520
She spends her entire paycheck
as soon as she gets it,

413
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,030
and ends up keeping herself nice and plump.

414
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,740
What's wrong with building up some savings?

415
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,740
Of course, that's good.

416
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,620
But now that you have a stable job,

417
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,300
you should treat yourself once in a while.

418
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,340
Women shouldn't waste their youth.

419
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,220
Right?

420
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,060
Yeah.

421
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,580
Alright.

422
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,820
Just wear this one.

423
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,300
Let them see the elegance of For Thy Sake.

424
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,060
Go on, try it on.

425
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,380
Hurry up.

426
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,620
Hey, is this the place?

427
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,940
Hey.

428
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,780
Miss Yao.

429
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,260
Hello everyone, I'm Bloom.

430
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,460
Hi, I'm Yao Yuan.

431
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
This is Xiaoya.

432
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,300
This is Xinran.

433
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
- Asia.
- Hello.

434
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,460
- Fairy on the Wave.
- Hello.

435
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,660
Hello, everyone.

436
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm Ying.

437
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,620
Eagle One, from Tianxia Gang.

438
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,060
My name is Ruoshui.

439
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,300
Just call me Hanhan.

440
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,100
Hi.

441
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,820
Hello, Madam.

442
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,460
I'm Li Ao.

443
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,620
To be precise,

444
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,980
Dominate the Sky.

445
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,300
Hello.

446
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,140
I'm Yao Yuan,

447
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,180
For Thy Sake.

448
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,940
Madam,

449
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,820
Master asked me to apologize to you.

450
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,180
He has an urgent meeting today,

451
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,740
so he can't make it to the meetup.

452
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,220
It's fine.

453
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Work comes first.

454
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,180
Madam, can you say that again?

455
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
I'll record it.

456
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,780
Then I'll sell it to Master.

457
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,100
It could be worth a lot.

458
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,340
Alright, everyone.

459
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,300
Let's head in.

460
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,420
Master can't make it today.

461
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,780
But the tables are already reserved.

462
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,780
Let's go in.

463
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,930
- Alright, let's go.
- Let's go.

464
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,220
Wen Ruyu isn't here yet.

465
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,580
Oh, forget it. Let's go.

466
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,420
Time to eat.

467
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,580
Dear.

468
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,580
Let me introduce.

469
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,260
This is Lord of All,

470
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,100
Jiang Anlan.

471
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,170
He's also my boss in real life.

472
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,940
- And this is...
- For Thy Sake.

473
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,420
Yao Yuan.

474
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,180
Dear.

475
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,090
I still made it in time.

476
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,420
Boss.

477
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,100
I'll go in first to greet them.

478
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,340
Dear.

479
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,300
Are we going in to join everyone

480
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,940
or having a private meeting?

481
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,380
Let's join everyone.

482
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,020
Hello, everyone.

483
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,340
I'm Lord of All.

484
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,020
I called you all here today

485
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,380
- Hey, Xinran.
- to get to know each other outside the game.

486
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,710
He is so handsome.

487
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,620
- Second, I want to clarify something.
- He is the Master? So handsome.

488
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,460
I,

489
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,580
Jiang Anlan,

490
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,100
whether in the game or in real life,

491
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,780
have never been involved with any woman.

492
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,020
Because there's only room
for one woman in my heart.

493
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,980
And that's Yao Yuan.

494
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,460
So, if you see any rumors spreading

495
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,980
in the game,

496
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,340
no matter who it is,

497
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,180
shut them down for me.

498
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,780
The Tianxia Gang will owe you a favor.

499
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,020
Alright, everyone.

500
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,380
Is everyone here except Wen Ruyu?

501
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,260
Let's make sure we have a great time today.

502
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,500
If the food on the table isn't enough,

503
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,620
we can order more.

504
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,460
Don't hold back.

505
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,940
Let's dig in!

506
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,620
Go ahead, start eating.

507
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,180
Miss Yao, why aren't you eating?

508
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,260
Is it not to your taste?

509
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,820
Should we order something else?

510
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,180
No, no, it's enough.

511
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,660
Thank you.

512
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,580
You haven't eaten either.

513
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,140
I just had something during the meeting.

514
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,980
I was worried about food
getting stuck in my teeth.

515
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,620
Didn't want to ruin my image in your eyes.

516
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,660
Master.

517
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,740
Let's take a group photo.

518
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,820
- Me too!
- I want in!

519
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,660
Sure, sure!

520
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,790
Use the beauty camera.

521
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,170
- Yuan.
- Move closer, come on.

522
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,620
I think you really hit the jackpot this time.

523
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,700
Your guy is absolutely stunning.

524
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,620
Stunning.

525
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,100
Just eat your food.

526
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,340
Stunning.

527
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,620
Alright, alright, everyone.

528
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,540
Everyone.

529
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,820
Let's eat first, okay?

530
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,740
There's so much good food
waiting for you, okay?

531
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,100
Let's eat, let's eat, let's eat.

532
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,540
Let's go eat first, okay?

533
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
Let's eat.

534
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,780
Take your time and enjoy.

535
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,660
Sorry, I got held up by something
and arrived late.

536
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,100
I assume this is our lovely

537
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,220
madam, right?

538
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,430
Hi, I'm Wen Ruyu, from the game.

539
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,380
Of course, we know you're from the game.

540
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,460
Who doesn't know you're the famous

541
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,820
relationship expert?

542
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,860
I assume you're the one

543
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,340
who always shoots me with arrows,
Fairy on the Wave?

544
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,620
Your words are as sharp as your arrows.

545
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,300
What do you think of our master?

546
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,220
Isn't he so handsome it's blinding?

547
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,940
Don't you just want to marry him right away?

548
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
You're rambling on and on.

549
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,020
Aren't you annoying?

550
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,780
I wasn't even talking to you.

551
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,020
She's my cousin.

552
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,260
You're late and still talking a lot.

553
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,900
You're single, right?

554
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
Even if you're good-looking,
no one dares to approach you.

555
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,300
What's it to you?

556
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,050
I'm a relationship expert.

557
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,540
So what if you're a relationship expert?

558
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,460
- You're still single.
- These two

561
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,140

637
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,100
- Ace is here.
- Exactly.

638
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,500
I promised you.

639
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,180

645
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,320
what I want is you.

646
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,700

Madam,

651
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,620
please forgive my ignorance.

652
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,140
Don't take it personally with us two.

653
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,340
We were just being foolish.

654
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,820
You and Ace are a perfect match.

655
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,660

Madam is coming through.

662
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,140
Why do you act like you're Madam?

663
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,100
Ever heard of sharing the glory?

664
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,300
For Thy Sake.

665
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,140
Lord of All is mine.

666
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Don't be upset.

667
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,620
Before the wedding,

668
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,660
we'll get rid of that

669
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,940
For Thy Sake.

670
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,300
Problem solved.

671
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,220

674
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,140
It's me.

675
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,620

constantly replaying our kiss?

679
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Not at all.

680
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,140
It was just a kiss.

681
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,500
Why keep replaying it?

682
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,420
You sound like you're so experienced.

683
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,380
I'm surprised.

684
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,020

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,800

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,140
Your lips

746
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,980
are so soft.

747
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,060
No.

748
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,540
Uh, hello. Do you need something?

749
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,420
Sorry, sorry.

750
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,270
Please, carry on.

751
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,460
Good day, Mr. Jiang.

752
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,300
Morning.

753
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,260
Shuai.

754
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,100
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

755
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,980
I reviewed your proposal. Well done.

756
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,140
I'll give you a raise next month.

757
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,980
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

758
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,700
Boss.

759
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,860
The terms this company offered
are unreasonable.

760
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,460
Even if they have potential,

761
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,260
I doubt they'll deliver results.

762
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,700
So I turned them down directly.

763
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,560
Give them a chance.

764
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,070
Am I hearing this right?

765
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,500
Yes, you are.

766
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,620
If they can propose such unreasonable terms,

767
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,520
it shows they have confidence in themselves.

768
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,260
Don't reject them outright.

769
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,980
Look into it first, then decide.

770
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,820
Right?

771
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,300
Oh, it's the Ice Cream Family.

772
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,340
What are you doing here?

773
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
You think you can marry Ace?

774
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,020
It should be our master, Rose Ice Cream.

775
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,460
For Thy Sake.

776
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,220
He almost lost his life for you,

777
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,700
yet you have the nerve to take

778
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,220
the treasure he worked so hard to get.

779
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,170
I can't stand your fake innocence.

780
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,260
Today, I'll teach you a lesson

781
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,820
and expose your true colors.

782
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,020
What are you waiting for? Get her!

783
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,940
Madam, are you okay?

784
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,700
Luckily, a member saw you here

785
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,540
and informed us.

786
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,740
As soon as Master got the message,

787
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,080
he ordered us to come immediately.

788
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,100
For Thy Sake.

789
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,500
Don't think you're safe just because...

790
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,140
Get lost!

791
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,180
Did you hear me?

792
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,740
Go back where you came from.

793
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,380
Keep your distance.

794
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,740
It's because you want to marry me

795
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,220
that everyone has a problem with me.

796
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,570
Fine, I take it back.

797
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,720
We won't get married?

798
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,700
I mean the timing of the wedding.

799
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,540
We'll do it tonight.

800
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,260
Let me be clear upfront.

801
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,660
I didn't come here to find a boyfriend.

802
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,180
I came to make money.

803
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,700
Perfect, I've got money.

804
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,390
It's all yours from now on.

805
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,580
Be online at 8 PM tonight.

806
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,260
I'll arrange everything for the wedding.

807
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,940
Just show up.

808
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,100
I'll call you when it's time.

809
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,820
Everyone here is a witness.

810
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,540
Don't back out.

811
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,220
I won't go back on my word.

812
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,220
Will be there on time.

813
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,100
See you tonight, dear.

814
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,180
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

815
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm not eating today.

816
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,660
Huh? What's up?

817
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,140
I need to prepare for the wedding.

818
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,340
Isn't it just logging in with a click?

819
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,220
You act like you're really getting married.

820
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,020
What's the use of just
having relationship smarts?

821
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,020
Life, huh?

822
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,620
It takes all kinds of intelligence.

823
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,580
What you need most right now

824
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,820
is the intelligence to read the room.

825
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,660
(Character Lobby, Baihua Hall)

826
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,500
(Lord of All)

827
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,300
Hello?

828
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,300
Why haven't you logged in yet?

829
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,500
I was about to when you called.

830
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,580
Guess we're on the same wavelength.

831
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,580
Hurry up and join.

832
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,980
I can't wait any longer.

833
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,060
Okay.

834
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,860
Wow, it's so beautiful!

835
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,860
The Ace is truly amazing.

836
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,340
He gets everything done so quickly.

837
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,180
For Thy Sake is really lucky.

838
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,060
Thank you, For Thy Sake.

839
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,580
We'll never forget your kindness.

840
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,860
Thank you, For Thy Sake.

841
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,340
We're all benefiting from this too!

842
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,580
Yao.

843
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,660
I heard the Tianxia Gang has a rule.

844
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,940
Those who follow them thrive,
those who oppose them perish.

845
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,100
If you divorce their master,

846
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,940
will we all be wiped out?
