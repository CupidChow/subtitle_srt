Who's this for?

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,880
It's actually for someone else.

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,920
But since you're so cute,

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,200
I'll get you a cup too.

37
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,240
You were in the meeting room earlier?

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,140
Yeah.

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,080
What do you do?

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,320
I'm a project planner.

41
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,900
Is that coffee

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,640
for Yao Yuan?

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,160
Why do you ask?

44
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,080
Nothing.

45
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,040
I just think you and Yao Yuan
would make a great match.

46
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,840
I noticed it during the meeting.

47
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,720
Let me tell you a secret,

48
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,800
Yao Yuan is dating Anlan.

49
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,160
But honestly,

50
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,120
I feel like Yao Yuan
is too good for Anlan.

51
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,220
She should be with you,

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,120
a charming and dashing photographer.

53
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,240
True.

54
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,960
How about this,

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,340
let's work together

56
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,160
to break them up?

57
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,010
You could be with Yao Yuan,

58
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,520
and I with Anlan...

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,140
What you said

60
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,080
makes sense.

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,880
Jiang is so calculating.

62
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,180
Only someone like you,

63
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,200
who loves stirring things behind
deserves him.

64
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm not like that.

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,360
Alright, alright.

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,660
You're just a little girl,

67
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,600
I won't argue with you.

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,740
Only a girl like you

69
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,440
would like a rich heir like Jiang.

70
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,120
Anlan isn't a rich heir.

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,640
He's worked hard for everything.

72
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,080
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

73
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,080
Jiang has always relied on
his own hard work.

74
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,460
As for me,

75
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,960
I'm going to have coffee with Yao.

76
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,820
You can

77
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,760
just stay here

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,920
having coffee.

79
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,960
♪You sit at the bow♪

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,460

♪So loving and sweet♪

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,000
Lately, life's been getting harder.

83
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,920
First, Anlan focused only on Yao
and ignored me.

84
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,640
Then, when I tried to help Su Wen,

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,880
he said I liked stirring things.

86
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,520
And the office
only has that awful coffee.

87
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,800
Life's already tough enough.

88
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,480
Now I have to swallow this bitterness.

89
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,060
How about

90
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,600
I buy a few juices for you to take back?

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,640
No need, thanks.

92
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm not a water buffalo.

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,880
Ancheng,

94
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,790
what do you think I should do next?

95
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,820
For the upcoming cases,

96
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll still need to assist Yao.

97
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,880
If you really want to make Anlan happy,

98
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,560
stop bothering him about Yao Yuan.

99
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,200
Why not?

100
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,760
I'm just not happy about it.

101
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,680
Yao Yuan's Anlan's top concern now.

102
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,080
If you get in their way,

103
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,480
he definitely won't hold back.

104
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,640
But look at it another way,

105
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,640
if you get along with Yao Yuan,

106
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,600
Anlan will accept you too.

107
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,640
I knew you'd have the best advice.

108
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,680
Once Anlan accepts me,

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,730
I'll deal with Yao then.

110
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,760
Don't mess things up.

111
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,400
I won't.

112
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm the sharpest at these things.

113
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,980
No matter what,

114
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,820
if anything comes up,

115
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,760
you have to tell me.

116
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,300
Only you

117
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,000
will always stand by my side.

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,780
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

119
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,720
Yeah.

120
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,480
What is this?

121
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,240
You can't even do this?

122
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,120
Can you get it done?

123
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,880
Come upstairs now.

124
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,760
Hurry up.

125
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,580
What's wrong?

126
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,500
You're right here,

127
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,120
but I can't even touch you.

128
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,020
Then what are you doing now?

129
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,980
Of course. I'm thinking about you.

130
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,240
I think about you every single moment.

131
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
You have no idea.

132
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,520
Our boss is way too strict.

133
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,160
He's always got a stern look.

134
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,940
I...

135
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,120
I barely have any free time.

136
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,080
Do you even know what you're doing?

137
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,120
Sneaking on WeChat on your computer.

138
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,020
And now you're up
on the roof making calls,

139
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,860
saying I look stern?

140
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,280
Which boss doesn't?

141
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,840
Huh?

142
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,360
Do you realize what you're doing?

143
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,640
He's gone.

144
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,480
What are you holding?

145
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,680
Zhang He said,

146
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,280
when you're stressed,

147
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
bubble wrap could relieve your tension.

148
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,400
So I got one for you.

149
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,080
Ah?

150
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,640
He said when you're stressed, you like

151
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,760
to do this.

152
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,840
You actually believe that?

153
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,980
Yeah, I do.

154
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,860
When I'm stressed,

155
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,040
I like to go to the supermarket,

156
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,220
and put my hand in the rice,

157
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,160
doing this.

158
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,360
Don't you do that too?

159
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,160
You're lying.

160
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,440
Let's go.

161
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,020
I just don't get it.

162
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,500
I gave him honest advice,

163
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,760
and he said I was disrespecting him.

164
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,640
Do I have to praise him all the time?

165
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,720
Wen Cheng is a thoughtful guy,

166
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,660
can't you just give him some space?

167
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,060
That's his idea of being thoughtful?

168
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,200
He just cares about his image.

169
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,880
Men hate admitting they're wrong.

170
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,400
Maybe he just doesn't want
to lose in front of you.

171
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,160
What do you mean?

172
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,480
Which guy would

173
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,520
willingly show weakness
in front of the girl he likes?

174
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,640
Don't say that.

175
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,860
I think

176
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,680
he's just afraid of losing
his masculine pride.

177
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,620
He wouldn't want to keep up that act

178
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,280
in front of everyone.

179
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,840
Peacocks only spread their feathers
for the peahens.

180
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,160
You've changed since you started dating.

181
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,620
But love

182
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,280
doesn't need so many logics.

183
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,420
I'm no match for you.

184
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,440
You're already a relationship expert.

185
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,380
By the way,

186
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,680
how's work been lately?

187
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,760
Don't ask.

188
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,680
They may not notice,

189
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,720
but I'm super stressed inside.

190
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,960
Seriously.

191
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,380
I think you're just overthinking it.

192
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,000
It'd be great to have a boss like that.

193
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,500
By the way,

194
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,440
why is that

195
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,260
when we talk about others,

196
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,920
we always sound so sure?

197
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,240
But when it's about ourselves,

198
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,800
we act like fools.

199
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,660
Why is that?

200
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,060
Because

201
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,500
those involved get confused,

202
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,560
while outsiders see clearly.

203
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,220
Well,

204
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,700
why don't you co-host with Wen Cheng

205
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,220
and I'll work at Anlan's company?

206
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,020
Everyone wins.

207
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,860
Forget it, I'm rusty at words.

208
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm not happy with this proposal.

209
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,900
Redo it.

210
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,640
One complaint and we have to start over?

211
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,420
I'm the manager of planning department.

212
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,620
I have the right to do so.

213
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,580
Ms. Wang, may I ask you something?

214
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,620
Do you think there's something
that needs improving?

215
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,900
That's your problem

216
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,180
to make it better,

217
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,260
not mine.

218
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,940
Ms. Wang,

219
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,380
in theory,

220
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,100
this proposal was made by Su Wen
on behalf of the advertising company.

221
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,020
It's a special project,

222
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,300
not like any other

223
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,420
company projects.

224
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,020
You must be new here.

225
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,660
Are you so eager

226
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,700
to prove yourselves?

227
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,340
Or is it that

228
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,700
you're questioning my abilities?

229
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,060
No, no, not at all.

230
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,020
They're just young,

231
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,180
and brave enough to share their ideas.

232
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,340
We mean no harm.

233
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,940
If you feel unsatisfied,

234
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,060
we can start over.

235
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,780
You just arrived,

236
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,780
and Boss already admires you so much.

237
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,380
I thought you had superhuman ability.

238
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,340
Turns out

239
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,260
you're just average.

240
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,340
I hope you didn't get into the company
just because of your looks.

241
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
I look down mostly

242
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,860
on this kind of people.

243
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,820
Some people

244
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,620
are probably just jealous of Anlan,

245
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,500
so they deliberately cause trouble.

246
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,940
What did you say?

247
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,980
Why so aggressive?

248
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,580
Do you even know who I am?

249
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,540
I...

250
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,460
Sorry about that.

251
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,060
Ms. Wang, we've been really exhausted.

252
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,540
Her temper isn't the best.

253
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,950
It's okay.

254
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,760
If you don't like it,
we can make more changes.

255
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,020
Just give us some time.

256
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,940
Alright.

257
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,220
Since Boss appreciates you,

258
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,060
I want to see just
how good you really are.

259
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,700
Tomorrow,

260
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,620
I want to see

261
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,100
a new idea.

262
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,430
Got it.

263
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,340
Don't take it personally.

264
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,780
Ms. Wang's just a bit impatient.

265
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,860
I get it. She's just competitive.

266
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,060
I think Ms. Wang probably

267
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,500
has a thing for Anlan.

268
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,340
She dislikes whoever has his attention.

269
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,060
You know,

270
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,780
I caught her yelling at someone.

271
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,140
That person was just praised by Master.

272
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,060
Right?

273
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,900
So if Master likes someone,

274
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,020
she'll just scold them?

275
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,860
Alright then.

276
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,180
Stop making up stories.

277
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,100
We just need to focus on our own work.

278
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,320
It's easy for you to say.

279
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,980
Just wait until she targets you.

280
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,020
That's when it gets tough.

281
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,860
Workplace politics isn't like painting.

282
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,180
It's way more complicated.

283
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,020
Why are you laughing?

284
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,940
I'm laughing at...

285
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,420
You haven't worked here long,

286
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,780
but you act like an old pro.

287
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,380
I'm just a fast learner.

288
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,660
Okay, you're impressive.

289
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,700
Yao,

290
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,340
are you free for lunch tomorrow?

291
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,460
I want to take you out.

292
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,380
Take me out to lunch?

293
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,500
Why?

294
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,140
I want to ask you something.

295
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,140
I also want you to say a good word

296
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,460
for me to Anlan.

297
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,020
Tell him I work really hard.

298
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,920
Okay.

299
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,300
Hey, are you taking me?

300
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,260
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Take me with you.

301
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,540
Wen Cheng, you came just in time.

302
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,700
This is Yuting,

303
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,140
a new planner from the TV Station.

304
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,180
I invited her to help
brainstorm ideas for the show.

305
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,100
I'll let you two talk.

306
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,740
I've got other things to do.

307
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,460
She's new to the industry,

308
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,500
so be gentle with her.

309
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,020
Gentle? Where did you
get that weird idea?

310
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,580
Hi, Wen Cheng.

311
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,140
I'm a big fan of yours.

312
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,470
I've thought about
some ideas for the show.

313
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,580
Shall we discuss it together?

314
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,150
Can we do it another day?

315
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,940
But Producer Zhang said

316
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,440
we have to have a conclusion today.

317
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,780
I just started and want
to make a good impression.

318
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,060
Please, Wen Cheng.

319
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,060
Alright then.

320
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,660
Let's order takeout
and chat while we eat.

321
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,020
Sorry, today I have an overtime meeting.

322
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,860
Let's have lunch another time.

323
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,740
You think I have that much free time?

324
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,340
(Warm as Jade)
I'm in a good mood today.

325
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,260
I'm giving you a break.

326
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,380
I'll buy some noodles for him.

327
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,900
I think it's a great idea.

328
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,290
Because if my friend

329
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,580
has a fight with her boyfriend,

330
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,660
she won't know what to do.

331
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,540
Having some guidance is the best.

332
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,940
See? I told you someone

333
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,060
would want to be on this show.

334
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,980
Of course there is.

335
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,860
Who would say no to expert advice?

336
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,180
And yet she said no one would want

337
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,140
to be on my show.

338
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,220
Don't underestimate me.

339
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,500
Wen Cheng.

340
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,740
Do you know that girl outside?

341
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,260
What are you doing here?

342
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,100
Is that for me?

343
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,300
Want to eat together?

344
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,220
I have a big appetite.

345
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,500
Of course you do.

346
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,020
You don't even spare a girl.

347
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,700
Don't say that.

348
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,660
Zhang asked us to discuss
the show together.

349
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,300
I won't bother you guys.

350
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,900
Hey, why are you upset?

351
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,940
I'm not upset.

352
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,620
Then why not have lunch together?

353
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,660
You already bought it.

354
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,920
I'd feel bad interrupting you

355
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,070
get closer to the new female colleague.

356
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,660
I told you, it's all work-related.

357
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,180
Would you get upset if Li Ao
worked with a girl?

358
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,100
What are you implying?

359
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,020
What's our relationship?

360
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,300
Friends?

361
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,580
Are we dating or just flirting?

362
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,500
Who's flirting with you?

363
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Why get so worked up?

364
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,840
What's wrong with flirting?

365
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,340
Flirting is something you guys enjoy.

366
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,350
Because love is meant
for one woman only.

367
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,610
But when flirting,
you can do it with many women.

368
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,580
That's the kind of feeling men like.

369
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,880
That's not fair to say.

370
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,850
There are plenty who cheat after dating.

371
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,530
But with flirting,
you hold something back.

372
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,140
I was just joking.

373
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,360
Let's clear things up.

374
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,420
Okay, I'll clear it up right now.

375
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,140
Whether you're dating or just flirting,

376
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,060
stop involving me.

377
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,980
Wen Cheng,

378
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,730
who was that just now?

379
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Just a friend.

380
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,780
A friend?

381
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,160
Then why did she look upset

382
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,100
when she saw us talking?

383
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,300
Just a regular friend?

384
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,100
Or someone

385
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,180
you're flirting with?

386
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,020
Sorry for causing you trouble.

387
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,260
It's fine.

388
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,460
We actually argue a lot.

389
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,260
Arguing

390
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,740
means you care about each other.

391
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,110
By the way,

392
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,120
I just came up with a few more ideas.

393
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,260
Wanna talk about them now?

394
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,660
I forgot I'm busy.

395
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,540
Just send me your ideas by email.

396
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,260
If you're tired,

397
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
head back first.

398
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,820
I'll work on them here.

399
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,380
I'm not tired at all.

400
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,510
I've got the most energy.

401
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,900
I can keep going till morning.

402
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,500
If I head back now,

403
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,620
Anlan will definitely think
you work harder than me.

404
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,640
Really knows how to put on a show.

405
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,140
What are you saying?

406
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,820
Why haven't you gone back?

407
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,340
How could I leave you guys
here working alone?

408
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,060
I went to grab dinner for you.

409
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,820
Got any good ideas yet?

410
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,780
I just thought of one.

411
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,580
Go ahead, tell me.

412
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,940
Let's find some pretty models

413
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,580
and have them pick tea.

414
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,330
Under the clear blue sky,
with beautiful women

415
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,610
in the green tea plantation,

416
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,840
it will definitely look great.

417
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,940
We want everyone to know,

418
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,700
drinking tea can be stylish too.

419
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,140
But I feel this scene

420
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,260
doesn't seem very authentic.

421
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,620
Usually, it's older women

422
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,500
who pick tea at plantations.

423
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,860
But if the product shows

424
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,140
a smiling middle-aged woman,

425
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,740
who would want to buy it?

426
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,300
But the tea inside
the bottle is still the same.

427
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,660
The taste doesn't change just because

428
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,700
of different packaging.

429
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,260
I think we should focus more on

430
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,540
the product's intrinsic value.

431
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,020
I think Yao made a good point.

432
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,900
If everyone could see intrinsic value

433
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,820
and ignore just the appearance,

434
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,500
why do celebrities always

435
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,740
to be good-looking?

436
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,100
But

437
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,580
having just looks without talent

438
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,980
would definitely get you eliminated.

439
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,420
In the end,

440
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,620
only those with real skills remain.

441
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,900
But look at it another way,

442
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,700
if you get along with Yao Yuan,

443
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,660
Anlan will accept you too.

444
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,780
Yao's analysis is spot on.

445
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,900
I should learn from you.

446
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,420
Let's have dinner first.

447
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,700
Then we can keep working after.

448
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,900
Right, dinner first.

449
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,130
- Okay.
- Okay.

450
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,100
Thank you.

451
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,260
Looks delicious.

452
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,460
What are you guys doing?

453
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,380
Oh wow, who's this?

454
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,420
Your new partner?

455
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,220
He's definitely good-looking.

456
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,180
But he looks a bit older, doesn't he?

457
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,340
Let me take a look.

458
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,220
Older is better, you know.

459
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,980
It means he's successful in his career.

460
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,060
He's super charming when he's working.

461
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,020
Yeah, he is pretty cute.

462
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,680
No wonder.

463
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,840
I wonder why you'd been

464
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,180
working so hard all the time.

465
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,820
Usually good-looking and successful guys

466
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,380
are not single.

467
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,780
Maybe, but they're still just flirting.

468
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,060
So, is he single or not?

469
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,860
Not officially together yet, so no.

470
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,020
That's the worst kind in relationships.

471
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,780
They keep guessing what each other think

472
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,340
and end up wrong in the end.

473
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,590
This is my best chance.

474
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,540
But, is that okay?

475
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,380
That's their own problem.

476
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,300
Can't blame others.

477
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,060
Agreed.

478
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,260
It's rare to meet someone you like.

479
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,580
You should just go for it.

480
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,420
Hey, Wen, don't worry about me.

481
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,300
He's really single.

482
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,100
And I don't want to give up

483
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,020
without trying.

484
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,980
(Xiaoya)

485
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,780
Hello.

486
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,560
Come to Shengshi.

487
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,260
What's up?

488
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,540
The Scavengers have appeared.

489
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,630
This time,

490
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,720
they cleared out all weapons

491
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,600
from the mission failures.

492
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,580
Sell these weapons and props off,

493
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,780
and you can quit the company tomorrow.

494
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,820
Is this intel reliable?

495
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,310
Everyone's rushing there all at once,

496
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,500
afraid it'll get snatched away.

497
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,310
You should hurry up and come.

498
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,180
Ask Yao Yuan to join.

499
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,020
Yuan is working late.

500
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,180
I can get into the game alone.

501
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,500
It's a good chance to blow off steam.

502
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,460
Why are you so upset?

503
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,460
Nothing. See you soon.

504
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,140
(Wen Ruyu, Tianxia Gang
Fairy on the Wave, Baihua Hall)

505
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,100
This mission is seriously tough.

506
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,620
It is pretty challenging.

507
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,820
Finally, you're here.

508
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,260
Wen Cheng and Li Ao said

509
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,180
they'd go together.

510
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,900
Boss is working late,

511
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,380
and the two of us can't handle it alone.

512
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,500
We can only call for backup.

513
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,940
- You go.
- You go.

514
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,660
You go with them.

515
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,220
Why are you copying how I talk?

516
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,820
What's there to learn from

517
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,100
a washed-up host like you?

518
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,140
What did you say?

519
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,860
You know I'm really sensitive

520
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,900
about my job.

521
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,980
You go with them.

522
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,380
I might shoot the wrong person.

523
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,900
You're always shooting at random people.

524
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,980
Who even cares?

525
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,700
What's wrong?
You just hit it off recently.

526
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,740
Ask her.

527
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,820
I don't know what's wrong with her.

528
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,900
I think we should
skip the challenge today.

529
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,140
I'll check on her first.

530
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,220
Let's have some drinks.

531
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,380
He snaps at me when upset.

532
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,300
He doesn't act like this
with any other girl.

533
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,740
(Xiaoya)

534
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,220
What?

535
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,060
What do you mean "what"?
You're the one acting up.

536
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,580
Why did you
lose your temper at Wen Cheng?

537
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,980
I'm not losing it at him.

538
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,420
Look at how he's acting all shady.

539
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,660
Anyone would get annoyed.

540
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,220
But he didn't say anything
too harsh just now.

541
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,380
It's you, though.

542
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,300
You called him a washed-up host.

543
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,020
I don't know what happened

544
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,180
between you two.

545
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,260
If there's a misunderstanding,
just clear it up.

546
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,620
Keeping it bottled up
just makes things worse.

547
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,860
But I get upset just seeing him.

548
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,780
Then calm down a bit.

549
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,660
Give each other some space.

550
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,140
No need to rush.

551
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,180
What's meant to happen will happen.

552
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,380
Since when did you become so reasonable?

553
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,140
That's because

554
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,740
I watch Wen Cheng's TV Show.

555
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,340
Alright, got it. Bye.

556
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,380
Master, you're still not off work?

557
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,500
I'm waiting for
the international meeting.

558
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,060
Why are you so busy?

559
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
I have a report due tomorrow.

560
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380

(Thanks For Not Marrying Me)

600
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Hey, Master.

00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,120
Zhang He.

602
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,980
Who else is at the company?

603
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,300
Just me and Yao.

604
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,070
What are you still doing here?

605
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,340
With you here,

606
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,700
we don't even have space.

607
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,540
Don't have space?

608
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Why? I'm not a third wheel, am I?

609
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,620
Well,

610
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,300
Master, I'm off work now.

611
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,200
I'm heading out now.

612
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,260
- See you tomorrow.
- Leave now.

613
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,500
Yao, I'm leaving first.

614
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,340
Ah, okay.

615
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,510
- Yao, bye.
- Bye.

616
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,580
It's late, have something to eat.

617
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,740
You need to be full to keep working.

618
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,140
Here.

619
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,260
Sometimes,

620
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,660
I really don't know
whether to feel happy or sad.

621
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,580
Happy because I have good judgment,

622
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,340
picking such a great employee.

623
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,220
But sad because you work so hard.

624
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,860
Do you know I worry about you?

625
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,900
I just want to do this well.

626
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,420
But I suddenly realized

627
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,820
doing proposals is pretty fun.

628
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,780
And that feeling of
building something from scratch

629
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,940
gives me a real sense of achievement.

630
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,860
Why are you staring at me?

631
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,780
Thank you.

632
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,500
Thank you for bringing me
one step closer to my dream.

633
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,740
Me?

634
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,780
When I first started the business,

635
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,940
I always imagined a day when

636
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,900
I could work side by side

637
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,580
with the one I love.

638
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,420
We'd pull late nights
and grab midnight snacks,

639
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,780
then take a walk home together.

640
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,180
But you know,

641
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
the only person by my side
has been Li Ao.

642
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,380
So I'm not into working late.

643
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,860
Well, congratulations.
You got exactly what you wished for.

644
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,420
To show my thanks,

645
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,020
I specially drew you a sketch.

646
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,220
Please have a look, dear.

647
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,140
This is me?

648
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,060
Yeah.

649
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,380
Thank you again.

650
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,500
You have to keep this safe.

651
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Maybe I'll become famous

652
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,780
and this artwork will be quite valuable.

653
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,180
I'll get it framed for you.

654
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,300
Yeah.

655
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,540
Keep it safe.

656
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,140
Here.

657
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,340
Drink less. You're treating wine
like magic potion.

658
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,700
I wish that were true.

659
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,380
You and Xinran have fought before.

660
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,260
- Is it really that serious?
- This time it's different!

661
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,500
Keep your voice down.
What are you doing?

662
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,300
I'll tell you a secret.

663
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,180
I became a relationship expert

664
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,700
because I'm actually afraid of love.

665
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,900
What remarkable woman hurt you so badly?

666
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,420
Enough.

667
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,300
Not a remarkable woman.
It was my parents.

668
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,500
Your parents?

669
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,900
When I was a kid,

670
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,100
they argued about getting divorced

671
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,300
and always made me choose a side.

672
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,780
I just wanted to understand
what love really is

673
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,740
to change two people like that.

674
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,580
So,

675
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,060
I decided to study love psychology,

676
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,780
hoping they could
mend a broken relationship.

677
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,420
Guess what happened?

678
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,580
They still ended up apart.

679
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,780
And then no one wanted me.

680
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,260
I thought me and Xinran
would be different,

681
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,860
but,

682
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,900
I was still an empty glass.

683
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,780
I couldn't even manage my own love life.

684
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,540
How could I call myself
a relationship expert?

685
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,580
It's really ironic.

686
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,380
Actually, if you said this to Xinran,

687
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,420
she would understand you.

688
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,140
But I'm a man,

689
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,740
how could I possibly

690
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,700
tell the woman I like

691
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,740
that I'm actually very lonely?

692
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,260
Wen Cheng.

693
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,340
If you don't say this,
she'll never know.

694
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,580
If you miss out because of this,

695
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,580
wouldn't that be such a shame?

696
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,050
If everyone in the world

697
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,660
could just speak their true feelings,

698
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,620
wouldn't the world be at peace?

699
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
No misunderstandings,

700
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,740
no tangled feelings to deal with.

701
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,220
That's true.

702
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,500
Some things are just too hard to say

703
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,300
because there's a barrier
inside your heart you can't cross.

704
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,060
Wen Cheng.

705
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,980
You're right.

706
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,780
I think Jianing's approach

707
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,980
isn't entirely wrong.

708
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,660
But how exactly

709
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,100
can we get young women
to fit into the tea plantation?

710
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,340
Now that's the real question.

711
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,100
Still having a meeting this late?

712
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,700
You're lousy at your job.

713
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,980
Why are you still at Yao Yuan's place?

714
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,380
Do I need a reason
to be with my girlfriend?

715
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,660
We're only halfway through the meeting.

716
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,620
Don't come and distract me.

717
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,550
I'm here to help.

718
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,700
No, thanks.

719
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,820
I'll report to you tomorrow.

720
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,100
If you help me today,

721
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,060
wouldn't that be cheating?

722
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,180
Just think of it as
your boyfriend lending a hand.

723
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,340
The biggest help you can offer

724
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,100
is to let me focus on this meeting.

725
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,020
Okay?

726
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,340
Please, just leave.

727
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,910
No one's paying attention to you.

728
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,930
Behave yourself.

729
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,180
Got it.

730
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,380
I'll sit quietly over here

731
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,300
till you finish your chat.

732
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,020
Anyway, the night is long.
We've got all the time in the world.

733
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,980
Go away.

734
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,620
Keep going.

feature young women on screen.

745
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,300
Tea feels traditional and serious,

746
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,820
so we need something young

747
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,940
and lively

748
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,860
to break that image.

749
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,180
And this campaign's core theme

750
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,500
will focus on besties.

751
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,380
We want Xiduomeng Tea
to become the brand

752
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,180
that understands consumers best.

753
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,860
Mr. Jiang,

754
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,860
this proposal was
put together too quickly.

755
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,260
I've already asked them to redo...

756
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,020
In such a short time,

757
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,900
you came up with such a concise
and powerful proposal,

758
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,260
while keeping tradition
yet adding fresh ideas.

759
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,820
It's really impressive.

760
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,740
This is fantastic!

761
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,500
You'd break your hands clapping.

762
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,060
Weren't we supposed to stay impartial?

763
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,660
She did such a good job.

764
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,020
I have no reason not to praise her.

765
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,500
Of course you can.

766
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,340
Then please

767
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,980
treat the other colleagues the same way.

768
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,060
Don't just we're all
supposed to do well.

769
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,780
Hmm.

770
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,340
Meeting adjourned.

771
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,540
Are you still upset?

772
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,460
I'm not.

773
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,180
That's good.

774
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,340
Didn't you say you really wanted to try

775
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,860
that super popular restaurant?

776
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,160
I got someone to book it for us.

777
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,230
We can go together.

778
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,700
What's our relationship?

779
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,860
Why do we have to eat together?

780
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,220
What kind of relationship
do you want us to have?

781
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,180
Friends.

782
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,380
Just regular friends.

783
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,980
(Tracy)

784
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,300
Good morning.

785
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,900
I haven't come to see you
these past few days. Miss me?

786
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,220
I just wanted to tell you

787
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,340
I really miss you.

788
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,260
Tomorrow...

789
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,180
This place looks pretty expensive.

790
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,940
Don't worry.

791
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,860
Anlan will pay

792
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
for our lunch today.

793
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,500
Isn't that inappropriate?

794
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,060
Jianing.

795
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,380
What a coincidence.

796
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,580
Mrs. Jiang, Ms. Lin,

797
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,500
long time no see.

798
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,460
Are you busy with dates lately?

799
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,180
You haven't been to our place in ages.

800
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,580
Don't joke like that with me.

801
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,740
I'm working now. I'm really busy.

802
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,700
And this is...

803
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,260
This is Yao Yuan, my colleague.

804
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,310
She's also Anlan's girlfriend.

805
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,060
Anlan's girlfriend?

806
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,060
This is my first time meeting her.

807
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,620
Yao.

808
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,700
This is Anlan's aunt, and Ms. Lin.

809
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,700
Nice to meet you both.

810
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm Yao Yuan.

811
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,660
Since we ran into each other,
let's sit together.

812
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,580
Sure.

813
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,500
Someone's treating us now.

814
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,340
Eat more, don't hold back.

815
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,820
Miss Yao,

816
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,100
how old are you this year?

817
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,500
What did you major in?

818
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,420
Where do you work?

819
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,100
Just call me Yuan.

820
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,500
I'm 25 years old.

821
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,980
Now I work at
an art organization in Jiangning

822
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,940
as an exhibition planner.

823
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,780
It's summer break now.

824
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,460
I'm helping in Anlan's company
with curation.

825
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,420
Then you must be really talented.

826
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,460
I also work at Anlan's company.

827
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,140
Yao is one of the elite talents

828
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,940
specially hired by Anlan.

829
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,690
Mrs. Jiang,

830
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,180
you're asking so many questions.

831
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,980
Are you doing a background check?

832
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,060
What background check?

833
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,940
Maybe one day we'll be family.

834
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,780
Of course I want to know more.

835
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,500
Is it right, Yuan?

836
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,060
I'm going to the restroom.

837
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,390
Okay.

838
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,230
I'll go with you.

839
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,100
How come Anlan's dating

840
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,820
such a shabby girl?

841
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,060
Tell me about it.

842
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,420
Anlan is the golden bachelor
of the social circle.

843
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,460
He turns down all kinds of girls.

844
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,780
Yet he chose someone so unremarkable.

845
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,020
But you can't blame Anlan.

846
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,580
Plenty of girls are throwing themselves

847
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,100
at rich young guys now.

848
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,020
Yes.

849
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,980
I believe Yao Yuan

850
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,260
must have some impressive tricks

851
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,620
that we don't know about.

852
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,540
Right.

853
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,100
Let's not talk about it.

854
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,860
We'll check out the desserts.

855
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,780
Okay.

856
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,780
When we get home, I have to tell

857
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,380
my sister-in-law about this.

858
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,940
We can try some later.

859
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,860
Sure.

860
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,660
Have you finished eating?

861
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,820
Do you want to try some desserts here?

862
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,020
No, thanks. We still have work to do.

863
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
We need to head back first.

864
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,140
Jianing really loves desserts.

865
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,700
Come, take a look.

866
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,780
Pick whatever you like
and pack it to go.

867
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,980
Share it with your colleagues.

868
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,500
Just say I'm treating everyone.

869
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,060
Sounds good, thanks, Mrs. Jiang.

870
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,700
Look at this one.

871
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,020
This one's not bad.

872
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,900
This one is pretty good too.

873
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,540
This one looks good.

874
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,780
I'll take this one.

875
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,580
That color actually looks more stylish.

876
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,540
I'll take that one.
Wrap it up for me too.

877
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,460
Sure.

878
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,420
Sister-in-law.

879
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,540
There's something urgent.

880
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,820
Everything you do is always urgent.

881
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,660
You're always so rushed and fired up.

882
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,380
I was having lunch with Lin earlier.

883
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,940
We ran into Jianing
and Anlan's girlfriend.

884
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,180
Anlan has a girlfriend now?

885
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,940
Did you see her?

886
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,500
What's she like?

887
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,820
Not that great.

888
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,940
We introduced Anlan
to so many girls before.

889
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,300
He didn't like a single one.

890
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,420
I thought Anlan
had really high standards.

891
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,540
Didn't expect him to find
such a shabby one.

892
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,500
Is she really that bad?

893
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,340
Honestly, she's kind of decent-looking.

894
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,660
So Anlan actually

895
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
likes girls like this.

896
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,740
But I could tell right away
she's from a rough background.

897
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,700
Her clothes don't look proper at all.

898
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,180
She even feels out of place
at a fancy restaurant.

899
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,180
What other intentions could such a girl

900
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,300
have approaching Anlan?

901
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,940
Where did Anlan
even meet a girl like that?

902
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,740
And he never even brought her home.

903
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,100
Seems like Anlan is afraid

904
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,420
of bringing her home.

905
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
Sister-in-law,

906
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,620
do you think she might
have used some tricks

907
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,700
to lure and deceive Anlan?

908
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,620
Who's that generous?

909
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,060
Free desserts.

910
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,620
We get to enjoy
such a great afternoon tea

911
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,380
because of Anlan's aunt.

912
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,660
Even Boss's aunt is this generous.

913
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,500
I have to let them try it properly.

914
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
My aunt?

915
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,220
Yeah.

916
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,940
I ran into her when Jianing
and I were eating.

917
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,820
Did she give you a hard time?

918
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,140
No, she even treated me to a meal.

919
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,390
That's good to hear.

920
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,820
Don't drink too much coffee.

921
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,900
Two cups at most.

922
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,860
I'm watching you closely here.

923
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,540
Why does Boss

924
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,900
keep spying on his employees?

925
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,180
♪I want to take you to the tropics♪

926
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,080
♪To a blue sea of love♪

927
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,550
