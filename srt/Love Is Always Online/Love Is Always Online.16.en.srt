=Episode 16=

33
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,420
What's wrong?

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,320
I just remembered something.

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,540
Xinran and Zhuang Wei
used to be like us,

36
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,420
holding hands,

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,780
walking together,

38
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,300
thinking they'd live happily ever after.

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,620
But in the end, they broke up.

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,880
And now it's come to this.

41
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,020
Are you afraid
we'll end up like that too?

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,400
I just feel

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,860
that love is so unreliable.

44
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,310
Memories and promises

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,060
from the past

46
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,820
all seem to fade.

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,220
Do you know?

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,460
Before I met you,

49
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,060
I never believed in forever.

50
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,770
People's hearts change.

51
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,180
Loving now doesn't mean loving later.

52
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,620
And I've never experienced forever.

53
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,240
How could I know
what forever feels like?

54
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,620
But after meeting you, I realized

55
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,800
that forever doesn't matter at all.

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,540
For some people, their shelf life

57
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,620
is three years,

58
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,220
so they break up or divorce so easily.

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,400
For others,
they stay together for 50 years.

60
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,180
They marry at 30 and pass away at 80.

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,540
Those 50 years are forever to them.

62
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,340
So, forever varies for everyone.

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
For me,

64
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,940
every moment with you is forever.

65
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,660
What if I leave you?

66
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,860
What will you do?

67
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
I'll still love you and think of you.

68
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,420
How do I know you'll love
and think of me?

69
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,380
I will.

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,500
You're so confident?

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,340
Sure.

72
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,140
I think I'll love you
for about 100 years.

73
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,500
That should be more than enough
for a lifetime, right?

74
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,820
Alright.

75
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,980
Also,

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,820
I'll invest in longevity medicine.

77
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,780
We'll have to hibernate together

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,020
and go through cryopreservation

79
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,620
black holes and wormholes.

80
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,460
Enough already.

81
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,480
Wasn't I talking about Xinran?

82
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,860
How did we end up here?

83
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,700
Look at Wen Cheng.

84
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,660
He's been waiting for Xinran
even before they get together.

85
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,500
Now,

86
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,700
we have to wait for her
to figure things out.

87
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,380
Sorry.

88
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,260
I need to go back to the office.

89
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,770
I've got to earn enough
to support you for a lifetime.

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,300
I'll earn my own money.

91
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,020
Won't it be faster
if we both work for it?

92
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,300
I have to go.

93
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,700
The time I have left to love you

94
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,680
is 99 years, 11 months,

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,220
30 days, and 2 hours.

96
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,440
I need to make the most of it.

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,280
Enough.

98
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,580
(Zhang He)

99
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,220

100
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,900
(Zhang He)

101
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,860
(Delete)

102
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,340
Mr. Jiang.

103
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,580
Hello, Mr. Jiang.
I'm Fang Jianing from Ruishi.

104
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,540
You can call me Jianing.

105
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,540
Banana chocolate caramel coffee.

106
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,100
Mr. Jiang.

107
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,700
I've conducted an in-depth study

108
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,820
on your company's cosmetics.

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,100
I've even tried them myself.

110
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,140
So, here's the report and analysis

111
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,030
I've prepared for our proposal.

112
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,900
Young lady,

113
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,190
I have full confidence in our products.

114
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,740
Anyway, I want 70% of the profits.

115
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,180
Mr. Jiang,

116
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,330
our company won't make any profit then.

117
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,820
That's your problem.

118
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,460
If you can't negotiate,

119
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,380
find someone who can
and talk to me again.

120
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,780
You have 5 minutes left.

121
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,060
(Ancheng)
He completely ignored me.

122
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,340
(He completely ignored me.)

123
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,700
Please take a look.

124
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,500
To get closer to clients, you need

125
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,080
(Jianing)
to cater to their interests.

126
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,980
He seemed very interested
in your phone charm.

127
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,260
He must be a guy with a girly heart.

128
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
- Mr. Jiang.
- What?

129
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,700
Are you interested in this?

130
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,540
Oh.

131
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,980
This pink rhinestone is
from Seinelle, right?

132
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,020
Yes. Mr. Jiang, you have great taste.

133
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,960
This is a limited edition from Seinelle.

134
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,370
I have a friend who knows someone.

135
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,140
If you like it,

136
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,440
I can have it sent over for you.

137
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,280
Oh, sure.

138
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,310
I didn't know you were also
a fan of Seinelle.

139
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,020
I have pink, blue,

140
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,470
yellow and purple ones at home.

141
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,030
I have the rainbow one.

142
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,300
Wow, the rainbow one?

143
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,660
That's no longer available.

144
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,540
Could you show me sometime?

145
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,180
Sure, I'll show you.

146
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,860
That's fantastic!

147
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,660
Chairman, the car is ready
to head to the airport.

148
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,860
Okay.

149
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,620
Mr. Jiang, about the profit margin,

150
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,680
can we discuss it further?

151
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,100
Let's talk about it
after I return to the country.

152
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,460
Alright.

153
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,100
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

154
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,500
I'll send you the number

155
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,840
of the manager of Seinelle later.

156
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,940
Thanks, Ancheng.

157
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,860
If I can buy

158
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,180
that limited edition phone charm,

159
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,100
this deal is halfway done.

160
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,160
What do you want to eat?

161
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,080
I need to go back to the office.

162
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,780
You still need to eat.

163
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,700
If you push yourself too hard for work,

164
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,420
you're putting the cart
before the horse.

165
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,100
But I feel like every second
counts right now.

166
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,460
If anything goes wrong,
I've got your back.

167
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,260
Eating won't take much of your time.

168
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,460
Besides,

169
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,340
you need energy to fight, don't you?

170
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,420
Ancheng,

171
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,500
I have a feeling
we're going to succeed this time.

172
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,380
Absolutely.

173
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,540
What do you feel like eating?

174
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,380
Hot pot.

175
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,020
Isn't that Su Wen?

176
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,500
Su Wen, can I take a photo with you?

177
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,340
Is that okay?

178
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,540
Like this, this angle.

179
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,940
Su Wen, can I add you on WeChat?

180
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,420
No.

181
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,660
I'm his girlfriend.

182
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,260
I don't like him adding girls on WeChat.

183
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,260
I remember you didn't like
taking selfies before.

184
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,300
What's so urgent
that you called me over?

185
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,920
Introducing you to a friend.

186
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,900
Mr. Su Wen.

187
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,220
I've heard so much about you.

188
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,620
I'm Tom from Hengguo Advertising.

189
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,460
This is my colleague.

190
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,100
Hey, waiter.

191
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,260
Sit.

192
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,820
They oversee the editorial
and planning departments.

193
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,280
Getting to know them could help you.

194
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,300
Thanks, but I don't need it.

195
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,700
Consider it my way
of making it up to you.

196
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,140
Mr. Su,

197
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,260
how's your schedule looking?

198
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,820
We have a project, and your timing...

199
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,020
I'll have to check with my boss.

200
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,260
Your boss? Who's your boss?

201
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,820
Jiang Anlan.

202
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,860
Jiang Anlan?

203
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,580
We've been trying to get them
for a feature for a while.

204
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,900
He keeps turning us down.

205
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
Could you help us ask him?

206
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,780
Yeah, or maybe you could do it.

207
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,500
It'd be a great addition
for our company.

208
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,420
Our next highlight.

209
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,180
You guys chat. I'll go ask.

210
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
Hey, Li Ao.

211
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,340
A friend introduced someone
from an ad agency.

212
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,900
Can you check my schedule for me?

213
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,220
Yeah.

214
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,480
I'll send you the business card.

215
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,900
Okay, got it.

216
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,400
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

217
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,620
It's a surprise!

218
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
If Su Wen agrees,

219
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,000
don't forget about our proposal.

220
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,980
No problem at all.

221
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,380
How's it going?

222
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,540
Sorry, my schedule is full.

223
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,180
You guys chat, bye.

224
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,660
Su Wen.

225
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,100
Su.

226
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,250
Hey.

227
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,420
You haven't done it?

228
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,660
What?

229
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,220
Getting Cui Xi out of your heart.

230
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,780
Jiang, you...

231
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,200
Do you treat me like a brother
because I shared some

232
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,880
personal thoughts with you?

233
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,100
We're competitors.

234
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,180
Why not give her another chance?

235
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,260
What chance?

236
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,300
She might come looking for you,

237
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,700
saying she still wants to be with you.

238
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,420
If it's true,
be generous and forgive her.

239
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,020
If it's not true,

240
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,510
you can finally let go.

241
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,200
Are you trying to convince me
to stop pursuing Yao Yuan?

242
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,220
Even if Yao Yuan rejects me,

243
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,820
I won't give up.

244
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,140
Listen.

245
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,640
The worst thing a man can do

246
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,540
is to play both sides.

247
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,700
Don't worry.
I've always had poor balance.

248
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,460
Everyone,

249
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,140
Mr. Wen Cheng has an announcement.

250
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,340
If you're friends,

251
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,940
remember to tune in to his show tonight.

252
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,380
Help boost the view count.

253
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,900
Let's see what you're up to.

254
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,360
(Celebrity Insights)
I'm thrilled to be back

255
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,240
and continue sharing insights
on gender issues.

256
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,820
I hope men and women
can live harmoniously.

257
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,260
Live harmoniously?

258
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,420
Wherever you are,

259
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,220
harmony is impossible.

260
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,380
Today's topic is

261
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,460
whether you should get back
with someone.

262
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,020
Today, I'll talk about my friend.

263
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,300
She once had a relationship

264
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,460
that left a deep mark on her,

265
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,100
and her boyfriend cheated on her.

266
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,660
Since then,

267
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,740
she closed her heart.

268
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,220
For a long time,
she was afraid to love again.

269
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,620
Nonsense.

270
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,980
(The Way to Gender Harmony)
He's terrible.

271
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,180
Why put herself through that?

272
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,300
I'm still healing from being cheated on
by my girlfriend.

273
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,780
Recently, she attended
her ex's gathering.

274
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,380
She wanted to show that jerk

275
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,820
that she was doing fine without him.

276
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,780
But he canceled his engagement

277
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,200
and begged her to get back together.

278
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,940
Wen Cheng,

279
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,300
you're talking about me again.

280
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,820
Who said you could talk about me?

281
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,060
I didn't think

282
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,620
she'd be foolish enough
to take him back.

283
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,020
But then,

284
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,640
she avoided my calls out of guilt.

285
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,100
Who's avoiding your calls?

286
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,420
When did you even call me?

287
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,300
(The Way to Gender Harmony)

288
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,030
That cheating guy is impressive.

289
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,280
That guy deserves
to be struck by lightning.

290
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,420
If a woman's foolish, it's her fault.

291
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,020
As the saying goes,

292
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,740
a wolf looks back to repay a favor
or seek revenge;

293
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,700
a horse looks back to graze or stumble.

294
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,700
I want to advise anyone
with similar troubles:

295
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,420
Wisdom should grow with age.
Don't act foolishly.

296
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,040
Otherwise, the next fall
won't be as easy as in youth.

297
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,960
You can't just dust yourself off
and stand up.

298
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,180
You're such a jerk.

299
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,340
I'm going to make you pay for this.

300
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,020
He's got to pay for it.

301
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,220
Where are you going?

302
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm going to settle a score.

303
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,080
What's wrong with her?

304
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,300
Li Ao said Wen Cheng is live-streaming.

305
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,620
It's probably related to him.

306
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,620
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

307
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,380
Why go back to spoiled leftovers?

308
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,620
In my opinion,

309
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,620
even if the girl
who once caught my heart

310
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,700
came back to me,

311
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,000
I might not take her back,

312
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,020
especially when it's an ex who cheated.

313
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,660
Wen Cheng, you jerk.

314
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,360

You can speak on stage.

317
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,220
Why are you talking about me?

318
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,100
Did you even ask me?

319
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,760
How could you repeatedly use

320
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,940
my life as your material

321
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,620
and turn my tragedy into your comedy?

322
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,560
What are you even after?

323
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
I never mentioned your name.

324
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,340
Now, you're speaking out

325
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,460
in front of the whole nation.

326
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,260
You're the one admitting it.

327
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,740
What to do now?

328
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,380
Continue.

329
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,420
In that case, say what you want.

330
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,020
Let everyone judge, right?

331
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,700
Fine.

(Celebrity Insights)
Have you thought

336
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,920
that you can't just cut feelings off

337
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,940
as if you're cutting hair?

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,040
How can you pretend nothing's wrong
with a burden?

339
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,700
It's a scar. We can face it.

340
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,140
We can remind ourselves
not to repeat the same mistake.

341
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,100
Right.

If you get back with him,

343
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,940
isn't that repeating the same mistake?

Do you want to see
what the netizens are saying?

Is this show about second chances

or about cheating?

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,660
You finally admit you're struggling.

371
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,880
Going in circles in a dead end.

372
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,800
I can't be bothered to talk to you.

373
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,940
Stop talking.

374
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,540
Don't get back with your ex.

375
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,420
He's a jerk.

376
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,940
I'm done for.

377
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,460
Tell me.

378
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,340
Should I wear a gas mask?

379
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,620
Don't. You look so cute when you're mad.

380
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,300
It'd be a shame to cover that up.

381
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,500
You saw it too?

382
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,540
Don't take it to heart.

383
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
People will move on
to the next thing soon.

384
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,700
But if this situation

385
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,100
helps you face what's on your mind,

386
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,220
it might not be a bad thing.

387
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,140
Did my face look huge on camera?

388
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,420
Relax. Wen Cheng's face is bigger.

389
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,880
Why didn't you dress up a bit more?

390
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,020
I was so mad at the time.

391
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,260
I just grabbed my bag and left.

392
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,740
I didn't even think about changing.

393
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,740
After going through this,

394
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,300
you must've realized something, right?

395
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,780
What?

396
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,700
Wen Cheng put in a lot of effort.

397
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,980
Why does everyone keep saying that?

398
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,100
What about after your show ends?

399
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,100
How dare you talk about me online?

400
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,340
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Stop!

401
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,740
(Yuan: Xinran, you're famous now.)

402
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,960
Wen Cheng's a jerk.

403
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,660
I just kept hitting him.

404
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,740
Then I hit him even harder.

405
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,700
After that, I left.

406
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,420
But now I've made a decision.

407
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,760
I've decided to cut ties with him.

408
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,460
Cut ties?

409
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,200
No way.

410
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,780
I heard Mr. Jiang is willing
to talk further with us.

411
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,380
But I'm swamped with the proposal.

412
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,000
Didn't you ask Ancheng for help?

413
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980
How do you know?

414
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,060
It's fine.

415
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,020
He just gave you some advice.
It's not cheating.

416
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,180
But

417
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,680
he also helped you get
Seinelle's diamond pieces.

418
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,600
That's a bit like cheating.

419
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,900
Boss, the reports are all sorted.

420
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,640
Both sides' accountants
have verified them.

421
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,820
Their profits this quarter
are quite impressive.

422
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,460
Actually, it's 15%

423
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,420
above our expectations.

424
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,820
Great.

425
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,120
Evaluate the possibility

426
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
of increasing their performance bonuses.

427
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,770
Let me know next week.

428
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,610
Got it.

429
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,940
How's Fang Jianing doing lately?

430
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,340
Fang Jianing?

431
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,740
She's working hard. She'll be fine.

432
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,820
What did I do to deserve this?

433
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,460
I almost got torn apart by her.

434
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Weren't you talking
about her on the show?

435
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,460
Well, yeah, I was.

436
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,300
But

437
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,540
I thought it wasn't that obvious.

438
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,180
Then don't blame her
for coming after you, right?

439
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,300
Did you see the comments online?

440
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,980
They said she was eloquent and sharp.

441
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,820
A role model for modern women.

442
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,980
What about me?

443
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,140
They said I was out of ideas,
speechless, and overshadowed.

444
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,980
So much for my grand comeback.

445
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,620
You really stirred up a hornet's nest.

446
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,980
You're lucky to be alive.

447
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,620
But the views went up.

448
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,220
Isn't that what you wanted?

449
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,020
So?

450
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,700
I'm a well-known love expert.

451
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,940
And I got completely upstaged
during the live broadcast.

452
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,820
It's embarrassing.

453
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,780
I think Yao Xinran

454
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,060
is your nemesis as a love expert.

455
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,250
You should visit her soon

456
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,580
and apologize.

457
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm the one who got humiliated.

458
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,660
It's not my fault.
Why should I apologize?

459
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,740
You did publicly discuss
her personal life.

460
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,980
Actually, you should thank her.

461
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,100
Her honesty made your show
more interesting.

462
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Even I watched the whole thing.

463
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,580
Really?

464
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,940
(Ruishi Investment Advisor)

465
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,980
What's wrong?

466
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,700
Li Ao knows you helped me.

467
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,220
It's your own effort.

468
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,900
I just gave a little help.

469
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,100
But to Anlan,

470
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,140
it's like I cheated.

471
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,600
He'll surely think that way.

472
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,000
Don't worry about what he thinks.

473
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,260
Just focus on proving yourself.

474
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,380
Wait, no.

475
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,340
You're trying too hard.

476
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,520
You need to relax a bit,

477
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,760
so you can keep pushing forward.

478
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,540
Should I tell Anlan

479
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,540
to ease up on you?

480
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,700
No, no.

481
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,140
I want him to push me more.

482
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,380
The more he pushes, the more he cares.

483
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,080
I'd be worried if he ignored me.

484
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,740
You're back.

485
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,980
You've met. It's Tom.

486
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,100
This studio is also my home.

487
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,340
Before using it,

488
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,800
you should at least tell me.

489
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,700
And keeping it clean is basic courtesy.

490
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,180
Sorry, I forgot about that.

491
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,870
You rented the space; you don't own it.

492
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,260
There should be basic respect.

493
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,350
We got too caught up in the discussion

494
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,420
to tidy things up.

495
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,580
If you want to scold Cui Xi,

496
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,820
wait until I leave.

497
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,460
Otherwise, she'll lose face.

498
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,660
You've made my place a mess.

499
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,900
I've lost face, too.

500
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,500
There's no need to talk like that.

501
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,820
I'll talk however I want.

502
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,520
Seems like the rumors are true.

503
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,220
Su Wen, you're too arrogant.

504
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,420
It's not arrogance.

505
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,400
It's confidence.

506
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,860
You don't even understand manners.

507
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,300
How dare you criticize me?

508
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,140
You...

509
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,180
Enough!

510
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,100
It's my fault. I'm the one to blame.

511
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,460
Stop arguing.

512
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,280
Do you want to check out the photos?

513
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
Sure.

514
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,840
What do you think of the lighting?

515
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,980
It's too bright.

516
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,180
Increase the contrast.

517
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,420
Why didn't you mention

518
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,860
Su Wen is your ex?

519
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,900
Isn't that common knowledge?

520
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,740
I had no idea.

521
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,160
Actually, I came back this time

522
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,060
because of him.

523
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,180
Thanks for today.

524
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,220
I'll treat you to dinner.

525
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,380
Deal.

526
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,530
You should have a good chat

527
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,640
with the great artist.

528
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,180
Got it; don't worry.

529
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,380
I'll head out now.

530
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,800
What are you doing here?

531
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,220
Me?

532
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,260
I came to apologize.

533
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,100
Apologize for what?

534
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,020
The show yesterday

535
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,300
must've caused you some trouble.

536
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,260
Some trouble?

537
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,340
A lot of trouble!

538
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,500
Many people also encouraged you.

539
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,340
Right?

540
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,600
Let me treat you to lunch.

541
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,490
We can talk outside

542
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,340
to clear things up.

543
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,180
Come back with me.

544
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,060
Xinran, I'll leave now.

545
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,980
(Exhibition Planning Office)

546
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,420
Why aren't you recording today?

547
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,740
Just taking a day off.

548
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,640
What are you doing here?

549
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,300
What brings you here uninvited?

550
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,160
Don't tell me you're a fan
of my live stream.

551
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,260
Xinran,

552
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,360
why not have lunch with me?

553
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,340
Or maybe just coffee?

554
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,540
I want to talk with you privately.

555
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,180
Xinran.

556
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,020
Look at me.

557
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,580
This guy

558
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,540
is up to no good.

559
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,080
Don't fall for his tricks.

560
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,940
Don't waver.

561
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,250
Don't let him influence you.

562
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,540
We really need to talk.

563
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,500
What do you want to say
to my girlfriend?

564
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,940
This is between me and Xinran.

565
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,940
It's none of your business.

566
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,620
None of my business?

567
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,860
She's my girlfriend.

568
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,060
Please, leave the way you came.

569
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,040
Yao Xinran,

570
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,580
tell him you don't want to talk to him.

571
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,300
Make this jerk disappear now.

572
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,960
What do you want to tell me?

573
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,900
How many times have I told you?

574
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,860
You still want to listen
to this jerk's nonsense?

575
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
Why are you here again?

576
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,820
How many times have I told you?

577
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,140
Stop bothering Xinran.

578
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,580
Please leave now.

579
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,840
Exactly.

580
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,920
If you don't leave,
don't blame me for being rude.

581
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,960
Enough!

582
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,900
I'll go with you.

583
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,380

00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,420
I've made up my mind.

586
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,140
I need to be honest with myself.

587

Mr. Wen,

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,940
you called me out to play the game,

633
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,920
asked me to post a task,

634
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,300
and left me hanging.

635
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,420
Do you think that's fair?

636
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,220
Who knew you'd actually post it?

637
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,060
Don't take your bad mood out on me.

638
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,440
Besides, acting like this

639
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,290
won't solve anything.

640
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,280
Xinran accepted it.

641
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,740
Who?

642
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,300
Yao Xinran ended up choosing her ex.

643
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,280
Don't you think she's being foolish?

644
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,140
A jerk is always a jerk,

645
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,380
no matter how much they change.

646
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,940
What are you to her?

647
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,420
Her choices have nothing to do with you.

648
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,940
I just worry she'll get fooled
by that jerk again.

649
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,420
It's her choice.

650
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,240
Why are you so worked up about it?

651
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,140
I just can't watch it happen.

652
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,520
Anyone with half a brain
wouldn't choose that.

653
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,860
What are you doing?

654
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,620
The point isn't about her choice.

655
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,420
If you like her, why not tell her?

656
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,220
Who would like that dummy?

657
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,940
In that case,

658
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,580
neither of us needs to bother.

659
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,020
I'm leaving then.

660
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,580
Hey, wait.

661
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,080
What if I tell her directly,

662
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,260
and she rejects me?

663
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,260
Wouldn't I lose her as a friend?

664
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,700
But now,

665
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,520
you can't be friends either.

666
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,820
(Close)

667
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,580
Let's go.

668
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,340
How could they not be open?

669
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,940
Maybe they had to close
for something urgent.

670
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,080
We'll come back another day.

671
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,660
Let's go.

672
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,860
By the way,

673
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,900
Wen Cheng came to see Xinran.

674
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,900
Did she forgive him?

675
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,540
I can tell Xinran
really likes Wen Cheng.

676
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,340
Oh, right.

677
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,820
Let's invite them both out for a meal.

678
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,980
Nah.

679
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,340
They'd ruin our time together.

680
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,300
But it's about their happiness.

681
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,360
Fine.

682
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,420
I'm tired of seeing Wen Cheng
mope around.

683
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,980
Let's invite them. My treat.

684
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,380
Xinran.

685
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,260
Try this.

686
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,100
It's really good.

687
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,060
Anlan, could you ask Mr. Wen

688
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,340
to pass me the pepper?

689
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,300
Please ask Miss Yao

690
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,900
to pass me the water jug.

691
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,940
You two should know

692
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,860
that everyone's hearing is fine, right?

693
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,860
Xinran,

694
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,980
what did Zhuang Wei say to you?

695
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,500
He proposed.

696
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,780
Proposed?

697
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,060
You didn't say yes, did you?

698
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,380
Yuan, please tell Miss Yao

699
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
that she keeps giving him chances,

700
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,020
and that's why he's gotten so shameless.

701
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,720
She has no principles.

702
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,380
Mr. Jiang, please tell Mr. Wen

703
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,220
that my business is none of his concern.

704
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,110
Xinran,

705
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,340
come out. I need to talk to you

706
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,540
about Su Wen's class schedule.

707
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Let's just enjoy the meal.
Why get upset?

708
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,380
He kept lecturing me

709
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,740
with examples and morals.

710
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,760
Does he think everyone
loves hearing him talk?

711
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,860
Exactly. He's selfish, sarcastic,
and a playboy.

712
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,740
I think you should just ignore him.

713
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,420
Just say the word, and I'll tell him

714
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,580
to never bother you again.

715
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,700
Hey.

716
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,820
Wait.

717
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,180
Actually,

718
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,420
I don't think he's as bad as you say.

719
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,180
People just call him a playboy.

720
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,480
From what I know,

721
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,400
he's never been flirtatious
with other women.

722
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,640
There's no smoke without fire.

723
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,670
But I still trust what I see.

724
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,540
He's actually quite devoted.

725
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,180
Why are you defending him now?

726
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Not at all.

727
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,220
He might be sharp-tongued,

728
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,820
but he's kind at heart.

729
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,060
All those things
I said about him earlier

730
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,100
are just the impression he gives off.

731
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,660
He uses sarcasm to hide his loneliness.

732
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,360
He uses arrogance
to mask his fear of love.

733
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,900
Fear?

734
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,460
Exactly.

735
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,380
He doesn't know
how to confess his feelings.

736
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,020
He's even more afraid you'll reject him.

737
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,620
He can't say many things outright,

738
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,020
so he uses roundabout,
lofty explanations

739
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,300
to express what he really feels.

740
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,900

But

815
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,180
you showed me today

816
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,380
that our love is already in the past.

817
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,940
You easily broke off the engagement

818
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,340
and proposed to me.

819
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,020
Marriage in your heart

820
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,940
doesn't mean anything.

You're the smartest woman in the world.

833
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,980
The sweeter his words are today,

834
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,060
the more he'll hurt you tomorrow.

835
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,180

00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,580

856
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,420
My stomach's been bothering me today.

00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,820
Let me handle it.

875
