Yao,

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,580
I heard the Tianxia Gang has a rule.

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,860
Those who follow them thrive,
those who oppose them perish.

If you divorce their master,

37
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,940
will we all be wiped out?

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,740
Is that really a thing?

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,780
The groom is here!

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,380
The groom's arrived, look!

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,340
So handsome!

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,360
So good-looking!

43
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,340
Wow!

44
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,260
Lord of All's wife's outfit

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,260
is definitely different from ours.

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,220
Why are you giving me this?

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,820
To stop you from running away.

48
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,220
What if, you know,

49
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,580
I run away? Would I meet a bad end?

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,020
You wouldn't.

51
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,020
I'll guard your body.

52
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,490
Congratulations, Master,
and to Madam as well.

53
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,900
Seeing this moment,
I could die without regrets.

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,660
Wishing you a lifetime of happiness.

55
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,700
What's wrong?

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,580
Isn't this a bit too extravagant?

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,620
It only happens once in a lifetime.

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,780
Let's make it special this time.

59
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,980
After this, I'll listen to you.

61
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,980
Do you take For Thy Sake as your wife?

62
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,780
I do.

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,380
(System Notice)
For Thy Sake.

64
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,220
Do you take Lord of All as your husband?

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,100
I do.

66
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,170
Marry him! They look so happy!

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,180
Madam, take your time with the wedding night.

68
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,020
I'm heading back now.

69
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,020
Wishing you happiness.

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,860
Wedding night?

71
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,540
We're having the wedding night now?

72
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,940
Will Yao Yuan think it's too fast?

73
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,740
My heart is racing.

74
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,380
Lord of All.

75
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,660
Now's not the time to be nervous.

76
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,540
Don't be nervous.

77
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,660
There's a first time for everything.

78
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
Let's go, dear.

79
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,050
Let's get to bed.

80
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,060
What should I do?

81
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,620
Hello?

82
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,550
Hello.

83
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,540
I meant to rest in bed.
What are you worried about?

84
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,810
I'm not worried at all.

85
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,420
I just knocked the power plug.

86
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,940
What's with the giggles?

87
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,780
Nothing much.

88
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,580
Your reaction is quite amusing.

89
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,860
For Thy Sake.

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,940
What?

91
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,780
You're my wife now.

92
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,460
Good night, dear.

93
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,980
Can you stop calling me dear all the time?

94
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,300
It gives me goosebumps.

95
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,380
I can let you have your way
with other things,

96
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,760
but not this.

97
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
Dear, get some rest early.

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,460
Sooner or later,

99
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,540
we'll have our wedding night.

for a few days.)

Madam, you seem so distracted.

127
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,540
Could it be lovesickness?

128
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,900
Stop calling me Madam all the time.

129
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,460
It makes me feel like I'm actually married.

130
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,140
I was almost over it,

131
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,100
but seeing you so lost

132
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,420
makes us remember again.

133
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,900
It's not like I actually got married.

134
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,500
It's more like I made a bet.

135
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,620
I lost the bet.

136
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,740
I'll admit defeat gracefully.

137

been online lately?

140
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,260
He said he's going on a business trip.

141
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,780
Still saying you're not married?

142
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,940
You even know his schedule.

143
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,100
He told me himself.

144
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,300
I didn't even ask.

145
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,500
Partners who willingly share their schedules

146
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,580
are pretty rare these days.

147
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,260
So, were you waiting for a call just now?

148
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,380
No, I wasn't.

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,900
Why would I wait for his call?

150
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,820
I wasn't waiting for his call.

151
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,500
He didn't call?

152
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,900
Why would he call me?

153
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,460
Why am I waiting for his call?

154
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,350
Why would he even call me?

155
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,540
We're not married or anything.

156
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,460
We're just...

157
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,260
We're just playing a game, that's all.

158
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,180
- Why take it so seriously?
- No, no, no.

159
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,740
You've talked on the phone and met in person.

160
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,420
That's clearly a couple in the making.

161
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,360
You need to be careful.

162
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,900
Ambiguity is the most unstable thing

163
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,380
in the world.

164
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,980
Keep a close eye on him.

165
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,540
That's actually true.

166
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,260
A guy like him

167
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,340
probably has women lining up for him.

168
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,380
He might forget about you
in a couple of days.

169
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,620
Hey!

170
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,300
Why are you so free?

171
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,260
Don't you have jobs?

172
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,940
Can you share some of the load with me?

173
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,420
But Yao,

174
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,780
I need to tell you something.

175
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,220
A man like that is hard to come by.

176
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,020
If he ever mistreats you,

177
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,900
make sure you ask for alimony.

178
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,910
- Or just...
- Leave.

179
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,940
But don't walk away empty-handed.

180
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,900
Who's waiting for his call?

181
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,700
(Lord of All;
How's the business trip going?)

182
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,580
(Don't overwork yourself.)

183
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,060

184
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,740
You're really acting like his girlfriend.

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,900
Oh, my precious girl is finally back!

188
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,340
I'm back, I'm back.

189
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,420
You must be tired.

190
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,260
Not at all.

191
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,130
Look.

192
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,860
You've lost weight.

193
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,820
No, I haven't.

194
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,670
Hurry up, let's go.

195
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,380
Yuan, take a break.

196
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,140
I'll make you some chicken soup.

197
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,980
Okay.

198
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,950
- Have some water.
- Alright.

199
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,940
(Operating Room)

200
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,780
Doctor.

201
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,580
How are my parents?

202
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,380
We've done all we could.

203
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,220
(Operating Room)

204
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,540
(Car Crashes Into Tree,
Fatigue Driving Suspected)

205
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,900
Yuan.

206
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,140
Help me chop the garlic.

207
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,300
Okay.

208
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,900
Uncle Fang likes full-bodied red wine.

209
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,940
Let's open that bottle today.

210
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,500
Also, tomorrow is Mr. Zhou's birthday.

211
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,540
He's knows a lot about red wine.

212
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,060
Send it to him as a gift tomorrow.

213
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,780
Yes.

214
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,620
Head back to the company.

215
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,100
This flight delay is way too long.

216
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,500
We need to hurry to the recording.

217
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,460
(Anlan)

218
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,740
Brother, this recording notice...

219
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,660
You have to attend.

220
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,900
Dad insisted on it.

221
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,380
I understand.

222
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,460
Dear audience in front of the TV,

223
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,340
hello.

224
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,580
Welcome to this episode
of Appointment with Rui.

225
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,740
I'm your host, Rui.

226
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,260
Today, we are lucky to have

227
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,620
the emerging entrepreneur, Jiang Anlan.

228
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,710
Hello everyone, I'm Jiang Anlan.

229
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,540
Anlan is the CEO

230
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,180
of the startup Ruishi.

231
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,580
Could you please briefly introduce

232
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,740
your main business?

233
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,620
We specialize in finding

234
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,300
people, things,
and companies worth investing in.

235
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,860
As long as we see potential,

236
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,300
we propose a cooperation plan
for a win-win result.

237
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
A successful company like yours

238
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,380
must have many people
volunteering themselves.

239
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,460
In fact, we're like talent scouts
in the business world.

240
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,740
We know how to place the right person
in the right position.

241
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,220
That's how they can truly shine.

242
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,060
Right now,

243
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,820
there are so many competitors out there.

244
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,020
So how can they win the battle?

245
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,580
What kind of tips

246
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,860
can you share with us?

247
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,210
It's all about determination.

248
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,140
People spend too much time
focusing on competitors.

249
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,270
I only focus on my own goals.

250
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,340
Once I'm determined,

251
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,300
there's barely anyone

252
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,620
whose persistence outdoes mine.

253
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,140
He's usually so gentle with you.

254
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,290
I didn't expect him to be so driven
in his work.

255
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,860
I think he makes a good point.

256
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,020
Isn't persistence key in business?

257
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,380
Oh, you really admire him, huh?

258
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,140
Obviously.

259
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,420
But isn't he super busy
with his business trip?

260
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,540
Why does he look so energetic?

261
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,540
I think that energy might just be an act.

262
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,500
I feel like he's actually quite tired.

263
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,460
You seem to know him well.

264
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,860
But this show was recorded domestically.

265
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,180
Why didn't he look for you
as soon as he got back?

266
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,500
He's busy.

267
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,780
Too busy to even make a phone call?

268
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
As a talent scout in the business world,

269
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,300
(Guest: Jiang Anlan, GM of Ruishi Investment)
your insight must be very sharp.

270
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,340
Being a successful young man,

271
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,540
you must have lots of women

272
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,220
wanting to approach you actively.

273
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Are you currently seeing someone,

274
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,860
or is there someone you like?

275
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,300
Maybe you could share with us

276
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,300
about your ideal type.

277
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,540
Any specific criteria?

278
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,900
Just one condition.

279
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,220
What is it?

280
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,820
I like her.

281
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,100
So confident!

282
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Honey, marry him.

283
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,340
Please, just marry him already.

284
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
Alright.

285
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,620
Seems like Anlan is quite the charmer.

286
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,780
But what are your specific

287
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,540
requirements for someone you'd like?

288
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,180
Having the looks,

289
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,020
personality,

290
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,740
height,

291
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,700
and weight that I like.

292
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,820
Is he really talking about me?

293
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,020
Someone's feeling down.

294
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,300
Ugh, annoying.

295
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,940
Just focus on your Mr. Right.

296
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,860
It's me.

297
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,940
I know.

298
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,420
Are you seriously messed up?

299
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,860
Wanna give me your number?

300
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,430
I'll arrange for you
to meet some former classmates.

301
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,460
They're experts in psychiatry.

302
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,740
I'm guessing it's bipolar disorder.

303
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,760
But it's safer to leave it to the experts.

304
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,100
Aren't you an expert too?

305
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,220
Fair enough.

306
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,310
Mastery lies in specialization.

307
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,470
I'm a relationship expert.

308
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,410
Handling emotional issues is my thing.

309
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,340
What's your boss been up to lately?

310
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
He hasn't contacted my sister.

311
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,620
She's too distracted
to grind dungeons with me.

312
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,980
Brief absence makes the heart grow fonder.

313
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,380
So it was your idea.

314
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,800
Hey!

315
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,740
Not me.

316
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,900
Our master has always been busy with work.

317
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,720
He managed to squeeze out some time before

318
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,180
sitting in front of the computer all day.

319
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,670
Li Ao said
it even delayed a lot of his tasks.

320
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,260
He's only recently gotten back on track.

321
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,500
Really?

322
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,660
Absolutely true.

323
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,620
Did you enjoy holding it?

324
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,740
Go tell your master something for me.

325
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,380
He should call my sister more often.

326
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,500
Otherwise, the inventor of the phone
would be heartbroken.

327
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,820
Understood, Fairy. I'll pass it along.

328
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,140
I'll tell him when I get back.

329
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,310
What task were you working on earlier?

330
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,380
What's it to you?

331
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,700
I just wanted to help, that's all.

332
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,740
Master and Dominate the Sky are both swamped.

333
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,700
No one's around to keep me company.

334
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,820
Are you treating me as a substitute?

335
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,960
Not at all. It's mutual benefit.

336
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,820
Just like clownfish and sea anemones.

337
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,980
Have you seen clownfish before?

338
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,900
They secrete a special mucus

339
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,340
which makes the sea anemone
think they're not...

340
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,260
You...

341
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,740
Mom.

342
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,260
What brings you here?

343
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
I missed you, so I came to see you.

344
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,020
Are you in a hurry to leave?

345
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,500
Mom.

346
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,700
Mom, I've got plans with a friend.

347
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,980
What friend? Tell them to wait.

348
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,140
It's been so long since I last saw you.

349
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,820
Yeah, Mom.

350
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,820
Look, I've got some free time today.

351
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,820
I'll help you brew some herbal medicine.

352
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,060
You always say

353
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,660
you don't have time.

354
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,740
But cooking at home is better

355
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,620
than eating out.

356
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,020
Anlan, get me a pot for the herbs.

357
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,020
Where is he?

358
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,380
Hey, waiting for someone's call?

359
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,220
No, I'm not.

360
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,180
I wasn't thinking about him.

361
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,860
I was just wondering

362
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,630
if he's eating well

363
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,280
or getting enough rest
during his business trip.

364
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,130
He's so busy with work.

365
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,340
Then call him.

366
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,060
I'm not missing him.

367
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,100
I just noticed he hasn't been online lately.

368
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,100
Do you feel weird not seeing him now?

369
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,300
Of course not.

370
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,380
Don't joke about that.

371
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,900
If you don't want us to tease you...

372
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,660
I wish I could just shut my brain off.

373
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,300
Why don't you just sell the account?

374
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,380
Then you'll have no ties to him anymore.

375
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,180
That way,
we can't tease you about it anymore.

376
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,630
Exactly! Once you sell the account,

377
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,040
Lord of All will just be your ex.

378
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,500
As your best friend,

379
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,460
I'd never bring up your heartbreak.

380
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,500
No, no.

381
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,700
I've accepted the betrothal gifts,

382
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,580
and gotten married already.

383
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,860
If I just leave like this,

384
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,940
it'd be so disloyal.

385
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,300
He married For Thy Sake,

386
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,420
not you personally.

387
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,900
That was because I was playing this account.

388
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,740
If it were someone else...

389
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,900
If it were someone else,

390
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,260
I wouldn't have gotten married.

391
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,980
What's up? I heard you missed me.

392
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,060
I didn't.

393
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,460
You're lying.

394
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,460
Are you free later?

395
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,100
No, I'm going shopping.

396
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,860
I'm free. I'll go with you.

397
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,660
Ace.

398
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,260
Good luck!

399
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,340
Can you stop staring at me?

400
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,300
Who else should I look at?

401
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,340
No one's as good-looking as you.

402
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,210
I don't want to waste time looking at them.

403
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,900
Can you focus on walking?

404
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,090
Sure.

405
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,860
That way, it's a win-win.

406
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,380
You like taking photos?

407
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,260
Not bad at all.

408
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,180
So sweet.

409
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,380
Look.

410
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,340
The focus of this photo

411
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,700
is on this girl's hand.

412
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,620
She used her hands

413
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,380
to firmly grasp her happiness.

414
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,500
Hey!

415
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,180
Tell me,

416
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,660
how many good deeds did I do in my past life

417
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,780
to find someone like you,

418
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,610
who's great at photography
and understands art,

419
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,260
and is both beautiful and elegant?

420
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,220
You always know the right things to say.

421
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,910
I mean every word of it.

422
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,500
Hey, let me ask you something.

423
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,380
Aren't you glad

424
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,620
you found a husband like me?

425
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm genuinely curious,

426
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,620
how can you say that with a straight face?

427
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,100
Well, who else is going to say it?

428
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,180
What were you going to buy again?

429
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,380
I'm going to get my painting supplies.

430
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,980
Who's your favorite painter?

431
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,380
Honestly,
I don't have one I particularly admire.

432
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,380
I usually go by my gut feeling.

433
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,300
As long as the artist matches my mood
at the time,

434
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,340
they become my favorite artist
during that period.

435
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,860
So, whose paintings do you usually look at?

436
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,260
Chagall.

437
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,780
Who?

438
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,860
Chagall.

439
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
What kind of stuff did he paint?

440
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,620
We're here.

441
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,420
Hey!

442
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,020
Chagall?

443
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Chagall.

444
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,700
(Six years later, on July 7th,
it's Chagall's 28th birthday.)

445
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,180
What's up?

446
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,700
I'm trying to decide which one to buy.

447
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,380
Is there a difference?

448
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Of course there is.

449
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,820
This one

450
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,140
has a stronger color saturation,

451
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
but it's more expensive.

452
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,500
And this one,

453
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,260
the color looks the same,

454
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,660
but it gets watery after sitting for a while.

455
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,780
It's cheaper, though.

456
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,700
I don't use purple much.

457
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,700
Let's get this one.

458
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,140
Sir,

459
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,020
what other colors does this brand have?

460
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,620
This one? We've got light blue, dark blue,

461
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,100
sky blue, Tiffany blue.

462
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,220
We've got all the colors you need.

463
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,420
I want one can of each color.

464
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,500
Got it.

465
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,180
Sir, I don't need this much.

466
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,500
You don't need it?

467
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,340
I do, but...

468
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,220
Then take them all.

469
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,460
Alright.

470
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,380
I'll buy whatever you need.

471
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,020
I really don't need you to buy them for me.

472
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,500
Then I'll just buy them for myself, okay?

473
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,020
What do you need those for?

474
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,100
I like collecting paints.

475
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,580
Since when did you start liking that?

476
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Just recently.

477
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,340
Alright.

478
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,820
(You're So Artsy)
I'll have them delivered to you tomorrow.

479
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,100
Didn't you buy these for yourself?

480
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,300
I like collecting empty cans.

481
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,980
Why do you collect empty cans?

482
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,180
To stack them into a tower.

483
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,540
Is your house too big or something?

484
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,180
It really is too big.

485
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,060
It's just missing a lady of the house.

486
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,100
Want to move in?

487
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,100
Let's have some ice cream too.

488
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,540
One please.

489
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,340
Make it two.

490
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,580
I don't have any hands free.

491
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,940
I've got hands. I can hold it.

492
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,220
You don't even know if it's good.

493
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
Just buy one and try it.

494
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,100
Alright, I'll decide for you.

495
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,180
Just one. Couples share one.

496
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,140
Couples always share it.

497
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,060
Is it good?

498
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,540
Yeah, it's delicious.

499
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,740

530
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,780
I really admire him.

531
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,140
Admire?

532
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,380
You mean his works, right?

533
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,620
He rose to fame by capturing the lives

534
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,700
of ordinary people.

535
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,080
(Su Wen's Photography Exhibition)
His style is deeply personal.

536
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,260
Even in the same market,

537
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,140
with the same vendors,

538
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,300
his shots stand out from the rest.

539
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,900
He must pour his soul

540
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,100
into every piece he creates.

541
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,340
I think

542
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,980
he must be a caring

543
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,740
(Su Wen's Photography Exhibition)
and thoughtful person.

544
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,220

Why wouldn't a businessman understand?

548
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,660
Then why did you

549
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,740
make that face earlier?

550
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,660
I just think he doesn't seem

551
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,820
like the warm, caring type at all.

552
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,460
Someone who creates such works

553
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,620
must deeply care about
the ordinary people around them.

554
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,820
I think everyone

555
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,300

Why do you ask?

562
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,420

- No, I'm good.

- It's really good.
- Can I just leave?

743
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,660
What do you want to eat?

744
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,300
I love shrimp.

745
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,020
I'll take you out for some tomorrow.

746
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,100
But you'll have to peel the shells yourself.

747
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,460
Bye.

748
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,500
Stop staring and eat.

749
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,460
Shrimp.

750
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,860
(Though I'm tired,
life is slowly getting better.)

751
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,140
This way, please.

752
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,460
Wow, he's so handsome.

753
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,060
That woman must be his secretary.

754
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,420
Let's go, stop staring.

755
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,700
Why didn't you tell me

756
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,860
we were coming to a place like this?

757
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,860
I didn't even get dressed up.

758
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,040
- I think you look great.
- So handsome.

759
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,950
Don't be formal.

760
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:33,920
Just be yourself.

761
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,940
Aged Huadiao Drunken Shrimp.

762
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,780
Enjoy your meal.

763
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,220
This place doesn't even

764
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,180
give us a menu?

765
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,300
The dishes are already served.

766
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,740
I've already ordered everything.

767
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,540
What are we celebrating today?

768
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,460
Celebrating our first date.

769
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,540
Is this how you usually pursue women?

770
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,900
Forcing someone to be my girlfriend?

771
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,380
I've only done it with you.

772
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,660
I don't believe it.

773
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,700
You look like a pro at this,

774
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,660
pretty skilled.

775
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,820
If I truly like someone,

776
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,060
I don't need to practice.

777
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,540
I'll naturally do my best.

778
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,260
Tell me,

779
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,900
have I moved you?

780
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,500
Anlan,

781
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,900
it's really you.

782
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,340
The manager just told me

783
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,220
