1
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,241
Why is it just you here?

2
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
The boss took leave,

3
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,921
and dumped a pile of work on me.

4
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,680
Leave?

5
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:46,561
Even with a bad cold,

6
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:47,961
Jiang Anlan still insists on working.

7
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:50,641
Su Wen wants his lecture attendees
to take photos.

8
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,241
He asks them to photograph
their loved ones.

9
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:54,161
He even asked the boss’s wife
to be his model.

10
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,761
The boss is super protective
of his wife.

11
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:56,801
Now,

12
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:58,441
he’s sticking by her side,
won’t leave for a second.

13
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,121
Didn’t expect Su Wen
to really fall for her.

14
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:04,201
I think

15
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:05,561
Anlan’s in trouble now.

16
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:08,281
Su Wen’s no match
for the boss.

17
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,121
Don’t you know Su Wen
has only ever loved

18
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:13,201
one woman in his life?

19
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:14,761
Are you kidding?

20
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,801
He’s photographed
over a thousand models.

21
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,881
I mean the leading lady
in his personal work.

22
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:23,481
There’s only ever been one.

23
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,161
Cuixi.

24
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:26,721
Cuixi.

25
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:30,961
Heard they had a love
that left a deep mark.

26
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,961
Su Wen used to be
a caring, devoted guy.

27
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,321
He got hurt too badly
in that relationship.

28
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:37,281
That’s why he became
a playboy.

29
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:40,881
What did Cuixi do

30
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,361
to hurt Su Wen so much?

31
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:44,881
That, I don’t know.

32
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:45,961
Anyway,

33
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,921
Yao Yuan is the second woman
after Cuixi

34
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,721
that Su Wen has photographed.

35
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:50,721
That means

36
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,161
he’s serious this time.

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,560
Ugh, I’m really not used
to being a model.

38
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:12,441
This feels way too awkward.

39
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,081
My girlfriend’s beautiful,
even when she’s awkward.

40
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:17,641
Old Jiang,

41
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,601
your gear is already
a step behind mine.

42
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,121
Mine’s professional grade.

43
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:23,801
Yours is just amateur stuff.

44
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,401
Back in middle school,
I used a point-and-shoot

45
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,721
and still won first prize
in the city.

46
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:30,481
If I got serious,

47
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,241
you’d be out of a job.

48
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:34,761
You two can’t go
even one minute

49
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,201
without bickering, huh?

50
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:47,161
By the way, Su Wen,

51
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,081
I’ve always wanted
to ask you something.

52
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,601
Why did you choose

53
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,241
“loved one” as your theme
this time?

54
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:00,761
Isn’t it because of you?

55
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:04,001
Aren’t you just mixing
business with pleasure?

56
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,481
Am I that fake?

57
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:11,121
Didn’t you tell me
to find my original passion?

58
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:13,321
That’s why I picked
this theme.

59
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,401
When I started out,
I was broke.

60
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:22,561
It was tough.

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,080
I had to borrow money
from friends

62
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:26,521
just to afford rent.

63
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,241
But I was really happy
back then.

64
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:30,561
I felt blessed.

65
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:32,281
It’s because

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,240
people always wear masks
in life.

67
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:40,921
Only in front of a loved one

68
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,081
can you be your true self.

69
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,801
Like a child,

70
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,961
being willful, throwing tantrums,

71
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:47,921
acting unreasonable.

72
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,081
People

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
only show their true emotions

74
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,121
in front of their loved one.

75
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,761
That’s when you live
with real passion.

76
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,201
That’s why I chose
this theme.

77
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,281
When the loved one is present,

78
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:06,521
the person in front of the lens
shows

79
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:07,361
their truest side.

80
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,881
Isn’t that what I,
as a photographer,

81
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:11,961
want to capture most?

82
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,121
That’s my self-analysis done.

83
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,561
I have a question
for you too.

84
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:25,241
Who do you want
to photograph?

85
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:30,721
My grandma.

86
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:34,401
Grandma?

87
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,801
My grandma is the person
I love most in this world.

88
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,041
I’m going to her place
this weekend.

89
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:10,281
I’ll take some photos
of her.

90
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:13,041
Mm-hmm.

91
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,081
What’s wrong?

92
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:18,121
You’ve been quiet
for a while.

93
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:26,761
What’s up?

94
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:29,601
It’s nothing.

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,760
I just want to hold you
for a bit.

96
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:33,521
Just for a moment.

97
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,001
I’m a little tired.

98
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:48,481
I’ll stay out here.

99
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,561
You should rest early.

100
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:52,841
Okay.

101
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:55,081
Go ahead.

102
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:31,921
Boss, stop worrying about it.

103
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,241
Your wife only ever has eyes for you.

104
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,561
That Su Wen...

105
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,001
will be out of the picture soon.

106
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,881
I've never paid any attention to him.

107
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:43,721
So you...

108
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,721
Yao Yuan is going home to see her grandma this weekend.

109
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,161
You want to go with her,

110
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:53,641
but you're afraid her grandma will recognize you.

111
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:55,801
Even if you don't go this time,

112
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,041
you'll run into her eventually.

113
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,041
How long has it been since that happened?

114
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,721
Her grandma is getting old.

115
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:04,841
She probably forgot.

116
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:06,961
How could she possibly forget?

117
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:09,801
Boss,

118
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:12,241
it's really not your fault.

119
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,681
You don't need to take all the blame.

120
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,481
Your wife is reasonable too.

121
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,361
You should talk to her when you get a chance.

122
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:22,561
She'll understand you.

123
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:25,361
Mm.

124
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,801
Getting fussed over by two big shots all day—

125
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,081
it was quite an experience.

126
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:31,761
It's just two kids bickering.

127
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:32,921
I have to keep mediating.

128
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,480
On one side,

129
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,761
is a talented, romantic,

130
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:37,961
funny, popular artist.

131
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,480
On the other side,

132
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:40,841
is a rich, handsome guy admired by many actresses,

133
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:43,641
but he's only devoted to you.

134
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:44,601
If it were you,

135
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:45,441
who would you choose?

136
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,281
You bystander,

137
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:49,561
enjoying the drama, huh?

138
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:51,841
By the way,

139
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,681
Su Wen may seem a bit roguish,

140
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,361
but he's really devoted to you.

141
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,361
You... you haven't fallen for him, have you?

142
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,241
I just admire him, honestly.

143
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,200
I think his work is excellent.

144
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:10,961
It has nothing to do with feelings.

145
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,401
Then why are you bothered?

146
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:14,601
It's Jiang Anlan.

147
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:16,601
I think

148
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:17,881
he was acting strange today.

149
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,761
Someone's after his girl—

150
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,081
of course he's acting weird.

151
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,721
He's probably so jealous right now,

152
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:25,801
it's flooding the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.

153
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,641
Stop, that's not what I meant.

154
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:29,081
It's not about jealousy.

155
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:30,841
I just think he has something on his mind.

156
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,081
He always seems mysterious anyway.

157
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,601
Alright, stop worrying.

158
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,881
Come play a dungeon run with me.

159
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:38,561
I'm tired.

160
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:39,441
I'm going to bed.

161
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,281
You play by yourself.

162
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,881
Yangtze, Yellow River...

163
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,721
Alright.

164
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,841
Where did all the Baihua Tang girls go?

165
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,561
Li Xiaoya isn't online either.

166
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:59,401
Is she still mad at me?

167
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:14,681
If something's bothering you,

168
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:15,841
don't keep it to yourself.

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,600
If you want to talk,

170
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:18,801
I'm always here.

171
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:35,241
It's nothing.

172
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:01,881
Wen Ruyu.

173
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:40,681
Why are you alone?

174
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:42,881
Everyone at Baihua Tang is busy.

175
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:43,721
Can't I come alone?

176
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:45,841
You could've called me.

177
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:48,921
What are you doing?

178
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:53,201
We're even now.

179
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:54,881
Hey, you—

180
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,201
logging off just like that?

181
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,681
Who could it be this late?

182
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,481
Why are you here so late?

183
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:30,961
Are you avoiding me?

184
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,641
Why would I avoid you?

185
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,641
Ever since last time we...

186
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:37,401
Last time—

187
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:38,841
Truth or Dare.

188
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:39,761
You didn't finish your answer.

189
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,321
I asked who you last kissed.

190
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,041
Why did you look uncomfortable?

191
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,120
You came just to ask me that?

192
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:49,281
You think I analyze love on my show

193
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:50,761
because I know it all?

194
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,121
I've just heard a lot of stories,

195
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:53,361
collected a lot of material.

196
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:54,761
I don't want to be your material.

197
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:55,281
Find someone else.

198
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,600
If your mistakes can help others,

199
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,321
that's a good thing.

200
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:05,841
Two people meet,

201
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,641
and over time, feelings fade.

202
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:08,961
It ends quietly.

203
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:10,721
Or one cheats,

204
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,481
and they never speak again.

205
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,601
Even if they grow old together,

206
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,841
death will separate them someday.

207
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,641
Isn't that just how relationships are?

208
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,241
Your last relationship—

209
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:23,561
how badly did it hurt you?

210
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:25,681
The deeper the hurt,

211
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:27,441
the more you resist love.

212
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,641
Stop using your theories on me.

213
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,241
The other person cheated.

214
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,721
I don't want to talk about this. Good night.

215
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:39,121
Don't you want them to see

216
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,441
you're doing better than before,

217
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:41,441
prettier,

218
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,481
more confident?

219
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Don't you want him to regret it?

220
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,041
Childish.

221
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:48,961
They're getting married.

222
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,841
He's marrying the one he cheated with.

223
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:56,761
Yeah.

224
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:58,681
He was my first love.

225
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,801
My first relationship crushed me.

226
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,481
I'm a loser in love.

227
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,601
I'm just that useless.

228
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,761
Happy with that answer?

229
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,081
Xinran.

230
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:09,521
Then you should go.

231
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:12,121
When's the wedding?

232
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:13,161
Where is it?

233
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:14,601
I'll go with you.

234
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:17,841
Hawaii.

235
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:19,521
Ah.

236
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:21,081
That's extravagant.

237
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:24,041
But...

238
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,121
Before the wedding,

239
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,321
there's a class reunion.

240
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:30,841
It's a perfect chance from above.

241
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,561
Please look after Baihua Tang these days.

242
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:54,561
Okay.

243
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,881
Take care of yourself.

244
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:00,561
Too bad I have work.

245
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,041
I can't go with you.

246
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:05,201
It's fine.

247
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:06,481
Work comes first.

248
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,161
Yao Yuan, let me go home with you.

249
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,281
I'm going to my grandma's.

250
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:24,921
I know.

251
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,281
Home is where everyone belongs.

252
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,521
Only when you return home

253
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,721
can you truly relax.

254
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:30,241
Feel at ease.

255
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:32,241
I believe when you're home,

256
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:33,441
you must feel especially relaxed.

257
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,721
So I want to capture that with my camera.

258
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,161
You can't control that, can you?

259
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,401
Go wherever you want.

260
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:50,961
That's your freedom.

261
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,641
But if you cross the line,

262
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:56,961
I absolutely—

263
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,521
Jiang Anlan.

264
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,881
You can only show off in the game.

265
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:25,081
Yao Yuan.

266
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,001
You look much better after coming home.

267
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,361
Even your expression is more relaxed.

268
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:30,801
Of course.

269
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:31,801
I'm home, after all.

270
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:35,481
By the way, I agreed to bring you this time

271
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:36,561
because I respect

272
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,921
the theme of the shoot.

273
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,001
Got it?

274
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,121
I'm a professional photographer.

275
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,361
How could I not understand that?

276
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:44,961
Good.

277
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:47,041
Let me do it.

278
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,761
Hey, I can handle it myself.

279
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,761
We're going to your grandma's soon.

280
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,761
If she sees you carrying your own luggage,

281
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,481
she'll think less of me.

282
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,681
Give me a chance, man.

283
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,281
Grandma.

284
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:13,801
Oh, Yao Yuan!

285
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:15,481
I'm back.

286
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:21,641
Oh!

287
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,841
Oh, Yao Yuan, Grandma missed you so much!

288
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:25,681
Me too.

289
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:26,801
Is it hot?

290
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,361
Hot. Are you hot too?

291
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:29,241
It's okay.

292
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,521
And this is—

293
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:33,041
Hello, Grandma.

294
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:34,721
I'm Su Wen.

295
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:35,801
I'm Yao Yuan's

296
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,480
potential boyfriend.

297
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,481
Don't listen to him.

298
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:39,681
He's my colleague.

299
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:40,761
We're going to hold

300
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,761
a photography exhibition.

301
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,161
The theme is "lovers."

302
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,721
I want to photograph you, Grandma.

303
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,201
Photograph Grandma? Hmm.

304
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:47,281
Oh!

305
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:49,481
Grandma is so old, look at me—

306
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:51,361
Wrinkles everywhere, white hair.

307
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:52,481
And you want me as a model?

308
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
Will people laugh at me?

309
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,521
No, Grandma, you're the most beautiful.

310
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:57,841
Grandma.

311
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,721
Your beauty is the beauty of time.

312
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,121
It shines from within.

313
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:02,801
Oh, this kid really knows how to talk.

314
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:04,761
Grandma, it's so hot today.

315
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:05,721
Why not ask someone to help you?

316
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:06,801
Isn't your back still not healed?

317
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:07,761
Let me, let me, let me.

318
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,920
I'll help you.

319
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,041
When Grandma does what she loves,

320
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:12,121
she doesn't feel tired.

321
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,601
Besides, at my age,

322
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,241
if I don't stay active,

323
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:16,401
I'll get old fast.

324
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:19,801
How are you?

325
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,800
I'm pretty good.

326
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:21,601
Very good.

327
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:26,241
Hey.

328
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:28,161
Yao Yuan.

329
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,921
Let's take a selfie.

330
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:33,681
Sure.

331
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:41,201
Boss.

332
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:42,721
About the Shanghai acquisition case,

333
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:43,721
President Li has signed the contract.

334
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,441
And Su Wen's photo exhibition—

335
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,561
The setup is finished.

336
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:50,041
In fifteen minutes,

337
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:51,521
all departments will meet in the conference room.

338
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:52,761
You can rest for now.

339
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:53,961
Yes, yes.

340
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:55,841
This way.

341
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,161
He's just trying to annoy you.

342
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:24,081
Don't take it to heart.

343
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:25,441
Do I look angry?

344
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,081
Meeting's about to start.

345
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,001
It's going to be another fierce battle.

346
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:37,201
Red alert.

347
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:41,441
Let's eat.

348
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,161
Wow, Grandma!

349
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,281
All these dishes look delicious!

350
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:46,561
Tasty, right?

351
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,281
They're just home-cooked dishes.

352
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:51,481
Can't compare to restaurant food.

353
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:52,841
Grandma.

354
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,240
For those away from home,

355
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,201
it's the taste of home they miss most.

356
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:58,841
These dishes are way better than restaurant food.

357
00:19:58,881 --> 00:19:59,481
Really?

358
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:01,001
If you like it, eat more.

359
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,161
My favorite is

360
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,641
Grandma's quail egg stir-fry.

361
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:08,401
It's super tasty. Try it!

362
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:11,241
Yao Yuan.

363
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,801
Didn't know you could eat so much.

364
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,080
How does it taste?

365
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:23,041
Hmm.

366
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:25,041
It's really flavorful.

367
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,041
Told you it's good.

368
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:28,841
I'll try it too.

369
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:31,161
Here, have some of this.

370
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,521
Okay, thank you, Grandma.

371
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:35,721
What's wrong?

372
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:37,801
Grandma.

373
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:38,761
It's salty.

374
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:39,361
Yeah.

375
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:40,841
Oh, let me taste.

376
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:43,801
Oh!

377
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:45,961
Oh, it really is salty.

378
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,120
See, Grandma's getting old.

379
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:49,041
My hand slipped,

380
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,401
put too much salt in.

381
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,121
No way, Grandma.

382
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:53,401
Here, young man.

383
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,401
Let me get you some soup.

384
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,081
I can do it myself, Grandma.

385
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,720
It's fine.

386
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,481
Try Grandma's soup, see if it's good.

387
00:20:59,521 --> 00:20:59,841
Okay.

388
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:00,361
Thank you, Grandma.

389
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:06,201
Mm.

390
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,481
Grandma, this soup is delicious.

391
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:09,561
Tasty, right? Mm.

392
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,641
Drink more if you like it.

393
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:11,081
Okay.

394
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:17,841
Yao Yuan.

395
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:18,401
Mm.

396
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,361
You've been good-looking since you were little.

397
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:20,761
Even better looking now you're grown.

398
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:29,761
Hey, Yao Yuan.

399
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:31,041
Are these your parents?

400
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,001
Why have you never mentioned them?

401
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,201
They passed away.

402
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,840
Yuan.

403
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:47,321
We're out of water.

404
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:48,881
Help Grandma carry two buckets of water.

405
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:50,001
Sure.

406
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:52,801
Let's go together.

407
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:07,881
Sorry.

408
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:10,721
I didn't know about your situation.

409
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:12,801
It must have been tough for you.

410
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:14,961
It's okay.

411
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:17,481
You get used to it.

412
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:26,881
You don't have to look at me like that.

413
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,641
After my parents passed away,

414
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:33,241
I felt like I grew up overnight.

415
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,321
Life's been a bit hard,

416
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:39,441
but if you hang in there,

417
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:41,121
it eventually gets better.

418
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:45,801
My biggest wish now

419
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
is for my grandma to stay healthy.

420
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,680
Yao Yuan.

421
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,721
Do you know the Law of Attraction?

422
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:02,401
When I was in school,

423
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:03,401
I aspired to be a famous photographer.

424
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,360
So I devoted myself to it completely.

425
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:07,081
Eventually, people noticed me.

426
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:09,401
That's why I believe

427
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:10,761
if you stick to your goal,

428
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:12,201
the whole universe

429
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:13,561
will come to help you.

430
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:17,321
So now I have a clear goal.

431
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:18,761
I've set my direction.

432
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,320
You will definitely fall for me.

433
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:25,401
The buckets are full, let's go.

434
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,481
You should focus on the buckets first.

435
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:44,521
Yao Yuan.

436
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:46,601
I won't give up.

437
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:03,361
Hey.

438
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:05,241
Everyone's here.

439
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:06,081
Why aren't you going in?

440
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:11,761
Come on, hurry.

441
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:12,881
Make yourselves at home.

442
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:14,721
What do you want?

443
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,081
I'll help you.

444
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,121
Just him.

445
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,081
Maybe we shouldn't go.

446
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,041
I don't think this is a great idea.

447
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:24,281
Xinran.

448
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:25,481
Listen to me carefully.

449
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:26,361
I'll only say this once.

450
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:27,121
You're great.

451
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,440
It's his loss for breaking up with you.

452
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,081
But the point is you.

453
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,521
If you want to move on,

454
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,801
the best way is to face it bravely.

455
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:35,881
Otherwise,

456
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,760
you'll always live in love's shadow.

457
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:38,881
Is it worth it?

458
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:42,801
Don't be afraid.

459
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:43,401
I'm here for you.

460
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:45,321
Take a deep breath.

461
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:50,441
Let's go.

462
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:58,721
Sorry, I'm late.

463
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:00,641
Hello, everyone.

464
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:04,001
Long time no see.

465
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:05,441
Long time no see.

466
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:07,201
We...

467
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:08,681
Didn't know you'd come today.

468
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,801
I'll definitely come to your wedding.

469
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,481
Let me introduce, this is my boyfriend.

470
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,121
Wen Cheng.

471
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:16,921
Aren't you the

472
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,841
host of Celebrity Talk?

473
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:21,361
You look even better in person than on TV.

474
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,480
I'm a loyal fan of yours.

475
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,841
I watch your show every day.

476
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:27,241
It's great to come with Xinran.

477
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:28,281
I'm really happy.

478
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:29,601
Thanks to her ex-boyfriend,

479
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:31,681
I met the love of my life.

480
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:45,961
Hey.

481
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:47,761
You're Zhuang Wei, right?

482
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:49,841
Congratulations on growing old together.

483
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:51,681
But according to research,

484
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,681
guys with a cheating record

485
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,961
have a 98% chance of repeating it.

486
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,640
But

487
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,961
I believe you're definitely in the 2%.

488
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,081
Xinran, how did you meet Wen Cheng?

489
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:11,441
We met in a game.

490
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,841
I knew it.

491
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,361
So you're online friends.

492
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:18,841
You don't seem that close.

493
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:20,241
If you didn't know,

494
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:22,761
you'd think he was just hired.

495
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:25,281
Mr. Zhuang.

496
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,121
To be honest,

497
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:27,001
actually,

498
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:28,361
Xinran and I

499
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,601
are just hiding our deep passion.

500
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:33,241
Why not show it directly?

501
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:34,601
Let everyone see for themselves.

502
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,081
Ah.

503
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,600
Yeah, that's right.

504
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:37,601
How do you show it?

505
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,401
A kiss will show how close you are.

506
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:40,481
Yeah.

507
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:41,721
Kiss, kiss.

508
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:44,681
Kiss, kiss.

509
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:45,361
Go on.

510
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:46,481
Give a kiss.

511
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:47,441
Come on, kiss.

512
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,041
Come on.

513
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:04,481
It's just our little thing.

514
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:07,681
Babe, give me a kiss.

515
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,481
Your little thing, huh?

516
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,761
Alright, let's do it.

517
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:18,441
I'll owe you one for now.

518
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:19,681
I'll make it up to you later.

519
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:20,961
You're annoying.

520
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,321
You two are way too lovey-dovey.

521
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,600
A slap I can understand.

522
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:28,281
I'm always with my girlfriend at home...

523
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:30,441
Alright, that's enough, let's stop.

524
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:31,801
Okay, let's drop it for now.

525
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,000
It's great we could all get together again.

526
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:34,881
I'm really happy.

527
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:35,721
And here I am,

528
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,321
congratulating Nana and Zhuang Wei.

529
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,480
May you have a long, happy marriage.

530
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,240
Come on, let's have a drink together.

531
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,121
They say out of ten men,

532
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,281
nine are unfaithful.

533
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:49,081
But I've seen many guys after marriage

534
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,880
become real men.

535
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:53,641
They care for their family and love their wives.

536
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:56,281
So Xinran and I

537
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:58,401
sincerely wish Zhuang Wei and Nana

538
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,641
a lifetime of love and many children.

539
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,161
Cheers!

540
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:05,601
Let's toast to our friendship!

541
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,601
So, how was it? I did pretty well, right?

542
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,441
Very good.

543
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:22,841
Did you just see his expression?

544
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:23,481
Wen Cheng.

545
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:24,241
Yeah, I saw it.

546
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:26,121
Let's take a group photo.

547
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:29,641
Sure.

548
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:30,841
Come on, let's go.

549
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,561
Your boyfriend is pretty popular.

550
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:38,881
His biggest flaw is having too many fans.

551
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:41,761
Xinran.

552
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,601
I'm really happy you came today.

553
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:46,761
I thought you'd never forgive me.

554
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,240
I forgot about it long ago.

555
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:50,361
Forgiveness isn't the point anymore.

556
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:54,321
Sorry, everyone.

557
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:55,601
You look beautiful today.

558
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:58,681
How did I forget you were always this pretty?

559
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,441
She's always been beautiful.

560
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:02,841
What's wrong, regret it now?

561
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:04,441
Too late, she's already mine.

562
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:07,361
Xinran, it's been a long day. Let's go home.

563
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:08,881
I'll give you a massage at home.

564
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:09,961
You said it yourself.

565
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,241
I'm heading out first.

566
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,601
What's wrong with you?

567
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:22,321
Look how sweet they are together.

568
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:26,001
Let's go.

569
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:43,441
Does it hurt? Why is it so swollen?

570
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:48,761
Can you be a bit gentler?

571
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:52,281
You're a grown man, can't handle a little pain?

572
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,401
With your strength, a minor injury feels serious.

573
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,081
Does every guy who kisses you

574
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:01,001
get slapped by you?

575
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:02,281
Who would dare kiss you then?

576
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,081
And you blame me for that?

577
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,601
You didn't warn me beforehand.

578
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:08,121
So I...

579
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,281
That's just my first reaction.

580
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,401
Do TV drama leads announce before kissing?

581
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,401
Do they give a heads-up?

582
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:16,801
They follow the script.

583
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,201
You haven't kissed in ages, have you?

584
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:22,641
Your kissing skills are so awkward.

585
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,441
Here's a tip: practice more.

586
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:27,521
Kissing isn't something

587
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:28,801
you can just practice with anyone.

588
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:29,761
You think I'm like you?

589
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:30,961
Hey, wait.

590
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:34,281
Just reminding you,

591
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:35,441
you owe me a favor.

592
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:36,161
Don't try to skip out.

593
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:38,681
Relax, I know.

594
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:52,801
Don't move.

595
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:54,801
Hold still.

596
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:55,921
Very good, very good.

597
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,441
See, photos speak for themselves.

598
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:16,641
Don't keep things bottled up.

599
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:17,521
Talk to me.

600
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:22,081
You're overthinking.

601
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,041
I don't have anything bottled up.

602
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:26,761
There's no one else here.

603
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:30,121
I'll forget all this by tomorrow.

604
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,001
Actually...

605
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,401
Every time I visit Grandma,

606
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,161
I really miss my parents.

607
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:42,761
So...

608
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,761
That's why you come here to watch the stars.

609
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,721
Watching stars calms me down.

610
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:56,601
Look at these stars in the sky,

611
00:31:58,401 --> 00:31:59,801
they seem lonely too.

612
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,561
But they keep shining.

613
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:07,121
You know,

614
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,081
I loved shooting starry skies in college.

615
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,441
Because a girl once told me,

616
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:15,601
when your loved ones leave you,

617
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,041
they become stars.

618
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,281
Whenever you look up at the night sky,

619
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,041
they're the brightest one up there.

620
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:27,441
Hey...

621
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,361
I'm not saying this to make you cry.

622
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,481
Please don't cry.

623
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,161
You're really bad at comforting girls.

624
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:34,921
You know,

625
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:39,841
so that girl you mentioned

626
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:43,081
must've meant a lot to you, right?

627
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:45,761
Otherwise, you wouldn't still remember.

628
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:48,561
She...

629
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:50,761
was my ex-girlfriend.

630
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,241
So every time I shoot the stars,

631
00:32:57,481 --> 00:32:58,121
I think of her.

632
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:01,921
But it's not that kind of longing.

633
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,881
She must be doing well now.

634
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:10,481
Your ex was a photographer too?

635
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:15,041
We met through photography.

636
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,161
And parted because of it.

637
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:19,361
Pretty ironic, huh?

638
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:24,281
Hey...

639
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:26,641
Everything I'm telling you now,

640
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:28,041
you'll forget by tomorrow morning.

641
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:29,761
Alright.

642
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,721
Let's stop talking about sad things.

643
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:33,841
How about we grab a drink?

644
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:35,081
Tea.

645
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:36,001
Let's go.

646
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:51,321
That Su Wen guy...

647
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,801
is probably monopolizing Yao Yuan, talking nonstop.

648
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:56,601
One minute it's secrets,

649
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,441
the next it's pre-wedding talk.

650
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:14,361
Brother Anlan.

651
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,121
Are you working overtime?

652
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:19,081
I thought you never worked late.

653
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,041
If I don't finish my work,

654
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,721
I'll just

655
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,401
start overthinking.

656
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:28,041
It's something important.

657
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:29,561
I have to finish it today. Why are you here?

658
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,321
I brought you something to drink.

659
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:33,401
Brother Anlan.

660
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:34,721
When you're done,

661
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,041
let's go out together, okay?

662
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:37,321
I invited a bunch of friends.

663
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:38,041
I'm not going.

664
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:40,161
Come on, please?

665
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,401
I said I'm not going.

666
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:49,081
Why are you always so harsh to me?

667
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:51,241
You're only gentle with Sister Yao.

668
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:53,201
That's really unfair.

669
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:36,961
Yo, yo, yo.

670
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,041
Our relationship expert, Master Wen,

671
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,361
even hits a wall sometimes.

672
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,040
It's my first time meeting someone like Yao Xinran,

673
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:48,281
who's immune to both soft and hard approaches.

674
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:49,241
And she throws in an iron palm, too.

675
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,441
Maybe that's just her being flustered.

676
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:57,081
Don't you always say a reaction means feelings?

677
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:00,401
It's silence that's the real worry.

678
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:03,881
Here's to you growing wisdom in love.

679
00:36:04,481 --> 00:36:05,081
Let me ask you then,

680
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:08,481
how do you checkmate Yao Xinran in this game?

681
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:12,321
Didn't Sun Tzu say it best?

682
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,641
Surprise is the highest strategy.

683
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:18,241
If I were you,

684
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,521
I'd weave myself into her life.

685
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:23,961
Make her unable to be without me.

686
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:26,801
By your logic,

687
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:28,161
you spend every day with Jiang Anlan,

688
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,321
together twenty-four hours a day.

689
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,761
Wouldn't that spark a romance?

690
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:32,681
Absolutely not.

691
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:35,161
Are you crazy? No way.

692
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:38,161
You run around for him all day.

693
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,481
Where else can you find such a reliable partner?

694
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,481
Too bad you're the same gender.

695
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:44,481
Otherwise, I'd totally root for you.

696
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,241
Even if I look for a partner,

697
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:49,761
I wouldn't pick a boss who's an iceberg.

698
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,801
I want someone witty and funny.

699
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:53,961
That's my type.

700
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:56,361
So if I were a girl,

701
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,041
you'd be my ideal match, right?

702
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,081
Overflowing with confidence.

703
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:02,441
Why not use that on Yao Xinran?

704
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:06,081
If it were that easy,

705
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:07,441
would I still be struggling here?

706
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:09,561
So,

707
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,641
our love expert Master Wen,

708
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,161
your radar's not working?

709
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,001
Honestly,

710
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:22,721
I don't know how I feel about her.

711
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,841
When I see her, I just want to tease her.

712
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,561
She's especially cute when she's mad.

713
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,161
Anyway,

714
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:33,441
I can't really explain it.

715
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,600
I've never felt this way before.

716
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:39,041
Wow, Master Wen has met his match.

717
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:42,601
Didn't you say your new book lacks material?

718
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,161
Just write this in.

719
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,480
It'll definitely catch readers' attention.

720
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,161
After all, everyone has a crush phase.

721
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,041
Everyone goes through it.

722
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,081
Even if it lasts a long time,

723
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:53,081
it might not lead anywhere.

724
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:54,201
Don't you think?

725
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:58,121
Finally, you sound human.

726
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:00,321
Write down all this drama, fill up the pages.

727
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,281
Tonight, it's on me.

728
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,041
Come on, cheers to you.

729
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:19,481
Didn't you say you'd stay overnight?

730
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:24,081
You clearly said you wanted to stay longer.

731
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:27,361
Something came up tomorrow.

732
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,120
You're worried someone might overthink, right?

733
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:33,841
Yao Yuan,

734
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,041
come here.

735
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:39,921
Grandma packed this bag for you.

736
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:41,241
It's full of your favorite foods.

737
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,041
Red bean buns and green bean paste.

738
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:45,521
And a chicken.

739
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,121
This chicken,

740
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,761
Grandma picked it just for you.

741
00:38:49,321 --> 00:38:51,161
Take it home and make soup.

742
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:52,961
It's really good for your health.

743
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:55,201
And these two bundles of greens.

744
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,241
Look how fresh they are.

745
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:58,241
No pesticides at all.

746
00:38:58,521 --> 00:38:59,481
Grandma picked them herself.

747
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,841
She picked them just this morning.

748
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:02,241
Grandma,

749
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:04,121
this is too much, I can't finish it all.

750
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:07,521
Yeah,

751
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:09,761
I should've packed less.

752
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:11,001
But this way,

753
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:13,081
when you finish it,

754
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:15,961
you'll come back soon.

755
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,521
Grandma,

756
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:20,401
I'll visit whenever I have time, okay?

757
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:21,561
Alright.

758
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,441
Grandma,

759
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:26,321
Maybe next time we come back,

760
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:27,201
we'll bring wedding candies.

761
00:39:28,161 --> 00:39:29,481
Oh, that would be wonderful!

762
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,280
Don't listen to his nonsense.

763
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:32,561
We're just friends.

764
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:34,121
Grandma,

765
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:36,241
we're

766
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,081
more than colleagues,

767
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:39,601
less than lovers.

768
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:42,001
What are you talking about?

769
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:46,121
The car's almost here, let's go.

770
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:47,161
Grandma, we're leaving now.

771
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,321
Alright, be careful on the road.

772
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:56,281
What's wrong with this light?

773
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:57,881
Grandma, this light—

774
00:39:57,921 --> 00:39:59,281
You haven't changed it in ages.

775
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:03,761
It's fine, as long as it works.

776
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:04,921
No way.

777
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:06,521
It's broken, and we're here now.

778
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:07,561
If I weren't here,

779
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:08,921
how would you change it alone?

780
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:10,241
What if you got hurt?

781
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:11,201
It's fine, it's fine.

782
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,881
Grandma, since I'm here today,

783
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:14,481
let me change it for you.

784
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:17,601
Alright then, come on.

785
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:20,601
Here, the bulb.

786
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:21,201
Go slow, okay?

787
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,560
Okay.

788
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:24,321
Be careful.

789
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:26,401
What's wrong with this table?

790
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:28,841
Grandma,

791
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,401
Grandma,

792
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:32,641
The money I asked Uncle to give you—

793
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,721
is it not enough?

794
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:36,681
It's fine.

795
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,841
If it's not enough, I'll give you more.

796
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:40,521
Oh, no need, no need.

797
00:40:40,561 --> 00:40:42,041
Grandma has enough for herself.

798
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,241
Really, it's enough.

799
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,961
Grandma, you have to take it.

800
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,041
Grandma, just accept it.

801
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:49,721
If you don't, Yao Yuan can't sleep.

802
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:50,601
Please, just take it.

803
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:52,801
If it's not enough, ask me for more.

804
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:53,721
Alright then.

805
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,801
Did I give Uncle too little money?

806
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:58,841
It's fine, it's fine.

807
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:04,761
Grandma, the lightbulb.

808
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:05,521
Thanks to you.

809
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,481
Let's go.

810
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:11,361
Is everything installed?

811
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:13,161
Be careful on the road.

812
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:14,401
We're leaving now, Grandma.

813
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:16,681
Take care of yourself.

814
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,680
The table's been changed.

815
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:19,201
Grandma, we're heading out.

816
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,760
Okay.

817
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:20,721
Go slowly.

818
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:22,881
Make sure to look after yourself.

819
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:23,281
Hey.

820
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,401
Grandma, you don't need to see us off.

821
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,481
We'll visit you again when we have time.

822
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,041
Okay.

823
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,321
Grandma, bye-bye.

824
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,320
Goodbye.

825
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:31,281
Goodbye, Grandma.
