33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,220
Jiang Anlan is in real trouble
this time.

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,220
They decided to produce the plastic.

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,060
Investing without proper checks.

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,900
No one is to blame.

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,380
But I think

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,740
he might have been deceived.

39
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,340
Who could possibly fool him?

40
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,100
Isn't he usually tricking?

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,380
Even hid his relationship with
Yao Yuan's family till now.

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,260
They almost got married.

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,380
But I hope they end up together.

44
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,940
Since Mr. Jiang and his wife passed,

45
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,140
I haven't seen Yuan this happy.

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,300
I hope so too.

47
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,260
But the truth is, Jiang Anlan

48
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,750
has been deceiving Yao Yuan all along.

49
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,540
That his "Win Her Back" plan.

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,340
And Jiulong was the former Jiang Group.

51
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,900
Who knows
how many more hidden secrets?

52
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,300
Alright.

53
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,380
Let's drop it and go eat.

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,540
Mmm.

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,380
Yao, let's go eat.

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,660
- I'm not...
- I'm hungry.

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,820
Let's get the 3-person combo.

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,500
Let's go.

59
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,820
Yuan, you should eat something.

60
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,380
Here's your favorite Kung Pao Chicken.

61
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,180
Come on, have a little.

62
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,380
It's all your favorites.

63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,220
Exactly.

64
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,740
Let's go out this weekend.

65
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,300
We haven't hung out for so long.

66
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,760
Right.

67
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,420
Since you two started dating,
we've...

68
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,300
Yao.

69
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,820
Yao, long time no see.

70
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,380
Since you stopped going to the office,

71
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,860
it's been so boring.

72
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,420
It's fine that I'm bored.

73
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,180
But our master has been

74
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,420
losing sleep and appetite.

75
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,860
Isn't Yao Yuan the same?

76
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,100
Yao.

77
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,540
Look, neither you nor the master

78
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,500
has been eating.

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,940
Why not meet up

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
for a meal?

81
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,260
You're a bachelor.

82
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,680
Why do you care so much?

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,700
Yao.

84
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,500
I don't know exactly

85
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,980
what happened between you two.

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,140
But recently, our master has been

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,740
facing a lot of difficulties.

88
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,860
You saw the news
about the plastic thing.

89
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,310
Right now,

90
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,860
if you could give him some support,

91
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,740
I believe many problems

92
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,940
could be solved easily.

93
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,980
Is he okay?

94
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,980
He's okay, I guess.

95
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,060
But if you showed up,

96
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,140
he'd be way better.

97
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,420
Yao.

98
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,860
If you miss him, just go see him.

99
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,420
Honestly, I'm pretty worried too.

100
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,700
After all, I was involved in

101
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,180
that project as well.

102
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,380
If you really concerned about him,

103
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,660
go check on him.

104
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,660
I'd better not bother him.

105
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,980
How could that be bothering him?

106
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,580
Go on.

107
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,860
Alright then.

108
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,500
Zhang He, keep them company. Eat up.

109
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,020
I'm leaving.

110
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,180
Hey.

111
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,020
Yao.

112
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,140
Everyone,

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,900
the purpose of today's board meeting

114
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,860
is to discuss the candidate
for the new General Manager.

115
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,980
What are your thoughts?

116
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,700
I recommend Ancheng.

117
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,300
Everyone saw the news

118
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,260
about from Ruishi this morning, right?

119
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,940
Anlan can't even take care of
the company

120
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,980
he founded himself.

121
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,220
How can he manage one
he's never worked at?

122
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,380
Plus, the news says

123
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,780
it's not just Ruishi taking the hit.

124
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,580
As we all know,

125
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,220
Jiang Anlan is from the Jiang family.

126
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,420
Now even Jiulong's stock

127
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,380
has started to drop.

128
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Anlan really

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,260
made a big mistake this time.

130
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,700
This proves

131
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,060
he's not fit for
the General Manager position.

132
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
I actually think

133
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,500
everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

134
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,060
What matters

135
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,460
is how he makes up for it afterward.

136
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,220
I think we should wait

137
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,660
to see how Anlan handles things next

138
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,860
before deciding.

139
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,940
So by your logic,

140
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
when exactly are we

141
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,420
picking our General Manager?

142
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,900
I understand the your concerns.

143
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,100
Anlan's recent performance
has indeed been unsatisfactory.

144
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,300
Chairman,

145
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,740
I have a suggestion.

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,780
Let's assign the plastic issue

147
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,780
to Ancheng to handle.

148
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,940
If he can maintain Jiulong's reputation,

149
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,500
then the General Manager position
is his.

150
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,660
As for Anlan,

151
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,140
let him stay at Ruishi.

152
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,860
After all, they are brothers.

153
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,980
They can cooperate
and complement each other.

154
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,820
Don't you all agree?

155
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,900
I agree.

156
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,460
Asking Anlan to give up his own business,

157
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,860
I'm sure he won't be happy about that.

158
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,900
Mr. Zhang.

159
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,300
Your opinion?

160
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,100
I've always admired Anlan,

161
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,020
and I think it's a great pity

162
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,980
that he can't stay at Jiulong this time.

163
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,300
But this time,

164
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,060
I agree with Wu.

165
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,780
Whoever solves this crisis,

166
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,220
I'll believe he has the skills
to be General Manager.

167
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,460
Alright.

168
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,740
It's decided then.

169
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,060
Ancheng,

170
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,980
you heard all that, right?

171
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,900
I won't let everyone down.

172
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,100
Hello?

173
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,540
I'm here to ask Ancheng
about the plastic thing.

174
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,820
If Anlan asks about me,
then cover for me.

175
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,740
How do I do that?

176
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,100
I don't like lying to the master.

177
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,020
Come on, how should I know?

178
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,620
Sometimes a little white lie
is necessary.

179
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,460
Just don't let him know.

180
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,900
He doesn't like me using connections.

181
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,140
I see Ancheng. I'll talk later.

182
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,180
Hey?

183
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,460
Congrats, Ancheng.

184
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,380
I believe you can
handle the plastic situation well

185
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,460
and become General Manager.

186
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,620
Thanks, Chen.

187
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,580
Thank you, Uncle.

188
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,900
Without your help,

189
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,140
I wouldn't have gotten this far.

190
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,620
What are you saying?

191
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,340
If you weren't capable,

192
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
why would we support you?

193
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,700
Ancheng.

194
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,980
You did very well this time.

195
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,140
Thank you for giving me this chance.

196
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,260
Do your best.

197
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,660
Jianing.

198
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,060
Jianing.

199
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,860
What are you doing here?

200
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,580
If I didn't come, how would I

201
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,340
see you grovelling
to the directors?

202
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,460
Anlan is run ragged dealing with

203
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
the eco-plastic problem.

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,260
And you benefit from the mess
to become General Manager.

205
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,300
Happy?

206
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,100
It's not what you think.

207
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,980
Don't touch me.

208
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,860
Yuan, let me carry that luggage.

209
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,820
No need, Uncle,
you just discharged.

210
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,780
You're still not fully recovered,
and it's heavy.

211
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,820
It's fine. I'm all better.
Don't worry.

212
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,980
Give it to me.

213
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
Yuan.

214
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,900
You still seem

215
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,500
a little upset, huh?

216
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,540
Anlan is a good kid.

217
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,180
You should give him a chance to explain.

218
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,540
When I opened the restaurant,

219
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,380
you said Anlan

220
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,020
was worried about
my cost control, right?

221
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,140
Then I gave him a call.

222
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,410
Anlan.

223
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,260
Come, have some tea.

224
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,980
(Diner of Delicacies)

225
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,100
What brings you here today?

226
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,100
Earlier, you mentioned

227
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,980
wanting to know
some operational details.

228
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,620
I thought better to explain in person.

229
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,300
A phone call would've been fine.

230
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,780
No need to go out of your way.

231
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,900
No trouble at all.

232
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,220
You see,

233
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,620
costs are divided into

234
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,580
variable costs and fixed costs.

235
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,220
So when starting a business,

236
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,420
you first need to
confirm the fixed costs.

237
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,740
For you,

238
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,300
personnel and rent
are fixed costs.

239
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,860
Hold on, Anlan.

240
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,100
Let me write this down.

241
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,940
No need.

242
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,300
These are for you.

243
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,780
(Lead in 5 Days)
And the books.

244
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,860
I've read them all.

245
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,820
I've marked the parts useful for you.

246
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,860
Use as reference.

247
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Oh, Anlan.

248
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,820
I don't know how to thank you enough.

249
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,180
No need to thank me.

250
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,460
Yao Yuan's family is my family.

251
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,140
No need for ceremony between us.

252
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,660
Yuan has suffered so much.

253
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,900
Finally,
she found someone nice to her.

254
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,060
Anlan.

255
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,140
Thank you.

256
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,700
I should be the one saying thank you.

257
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,820
You gave me the chance

258
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,980
to take good care of Yao Yuan.

259
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,580
If you have any more questions,

260
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,060
just call me directly.

261
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,300
I'll make time to help.

262
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,020
Look at this too.

263
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,740
Price structure.

264
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,150
So I think your...

265
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,980
He could've easily ignored this,

266
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,180
but because I'm your family,

267
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,380
he did it without hesitation.

268
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,020
Not just doing it for show.

269
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,300
He took it seriously.

270
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,300
Such a sincere person,

271
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,660
silently doing so much for you.

272
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,380
I'm sure

273
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,580
you can feel

274
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,620
his genuine care for you.

275
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,380
After everything that's happened,

276
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
do you know

277
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
what I've realized?

278
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,020
Bad things happen every day.

279
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,580
We all face them at some point.

280
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,380
But those who ignore their own problems

281
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,180
to help you

282
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,100
are the ones who truly care about you.

283
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,180
Just like you.

284
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,660
You had no money,

285
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,980
yet you gave me a second chance.

286
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,820
Every day,

287
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,380
we all face huge challenges.

288
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,140
What matters

289
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,980
is finding someone
who truly cares about you

290
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,100
to get through them together.

291
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,060
Don't you think so?

292
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,940
What's wrong?

293
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,660
Still don't trust Anlan?

294
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,380
Uncle, let's go.

295
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,460
Looking for me?

296
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,740
You're back.

297
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,860
My uncle was discharged.

298
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,260
I took him home.

299
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,180
Is your uncle okay?

300
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,220
He's fine.

301
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
Thanks for teaching him

302
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,860
about the restaurant before.

303
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,780
He told me all about it today.

304
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,420
It's nothing.

305
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,940
Just a small favor.

306
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,940
How's the

307
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,060
eco-plastic project?

308
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,780
It's fine.

309
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,180
Don't worry.

310
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,220
And you?

311
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,460
Are you okay?

312
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
I...

313
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,500
I've already applied for another job.

314
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,860
Once I get the offer,

315
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,060
I'll leave.

316
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,500
Why?

317
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,780
Because,

318
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,040
I...

319
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,380
I really can't live like this anymore.

320
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,300
I know clearly

321
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,380
I shouldn't like you.

322
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,100
I shouldn't

323
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,980
feel happy when I see you.

324
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,900
But now that you're standing in front of me,

325
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,570
it seems my last defense

326
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,900
has crumbled.

327
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I really can't take it.

328
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,300
So I've decided that

329
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,740
I'm going to a city without you.

330
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,660
Somewhere I won't have to see you.

331
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,780
I think
I'll get used to life without you.

332
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
Maybe this way

333
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,180
will be better

334
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,460
for both of us.

335
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,020
I'll take good care of myself.

336
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,900
I hope

337
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,420
you will too.

338
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,780
Dear.

339
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,220
I'll stand here and wait for you.

340
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,660
I'm not leaving.

Are you

348

really letting him wait out there?

But let me be fair.

353
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,140
Anlan kept so many things from you,

354
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,300
not just for himself.

355
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,020
It's true.

356
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,100
Anlan made mistakes.

357
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,060
But you can't blame him entirely.

358
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,220
Before you got together,

359
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,260
he couldn't just tell you

360
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,740
he was from Jiang Group, right?

361
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,820
After you got together,
he was even more afraid to tell you.

362
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Anlan carried all this alone.

363
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,740
All to protect your relationship.

364
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,100
His biggest mistake

365
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,460
is being born a Jiang.

366
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,740
But that's not something
he could control.

367
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,300
Yuan.

368
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,500
I think you should give him a chance

369
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,860
and ask yourself

370
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,580
can you really let him go?

371
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,140

381
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,300
Boss, stop being stubborn.

382
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,260
Your body can't take it.

383
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
I'm waiting for her here.

384
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,260
She'll definitely come out.

385
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,220
Be rational.

386
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,980
Even if you pass out now,

387
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,340
it won't help either of you.

388
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,700
Even if Yao Yuan comes out
because of you,

389
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,460
do you think this will fix things?

390
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,900
She'd give you an umbrella,

391
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,790
then tell you to go home.

392
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,860
Then what?

393
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,820
You can't mess around with
your own body!

394
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,260
I'm begging you, just get in the car.

395
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,700
I'm not leaving! I'm waiting for her!

396
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,540
Don't touch me!

397
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,420
I'm not leaving!

398
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,100
- Let's go.
- Don't touch me!

399
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,660
- Hopeless.
- I'm waiting for her!

400
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,300
- Go.
- Let go of me, Li Ao!

401
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,990
I'm not leaving!

402
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,050
Let's go.

403
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,980
I'm not leaving!

404
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,180

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,620
Where is the Boss?

409
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,100
The Boss is over there!

410
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,530
Pay back the money!

411
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,780
Everyone, quiet! Quiet!

412
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,900
Pay us back!

413
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,540
We work at the plastic factory.

414
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,180
You owe us a lot of unpaid wages.

415
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,140
Pay or not?

416
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,180
I know the factory's unpaid wages

417
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,060
have caused you a lot of trouble,

418
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,220
but

419
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,860
you shouldn't be here.

420
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,140
We're investors.

421
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,940
We've given the funds to Wang Xing.

422
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,580
No idea what you're saying.

423
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,700
Are we supposed to work for free?

424
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,980
Isn't that right, everyone?

425
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,780
Right! Right!

426
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,220
I will pay what's owed.

427
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,620
But you have to give me some time!

428
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,660
Stop with the nonsense!

429
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,300
Pay us back! Pay us back!

430
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,460
Master, keys, I'll drive.

431
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,300
Hurry, get in the car.

432
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,260
I've followed you for so long.

433
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,740
Finally, I'm actually useful.

434
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,460
Master, are you okay?

435
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,700
I'm fine.

436
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,540
Boss, are you all right?

437
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,500
Security guard already informed me.

438
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,380
It has to be Wang Xing causing trouble.

439
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,460
Find out why Wang Xing

440
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,060
withheld the salaries.

441
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
Then contact the foreman.

442
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,140
Have him send a few people.

443
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,660
I need to understand their demands

444
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,300
and what exactly happened in between.

445
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,860
Boss.

446
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,980
Honestly, from your standpoint,

447
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,900
no need to do that.

448
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,500
Even though they aren't our employees,

449
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,820
they're still producing our products.

450
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,660
So we have a responsibility

451
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,220
to help solve their problems.

452
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,780
Okay, got it.

453
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Mmm.

454
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,580
Yao.

455
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,420
Something's wrong. Look at this.

456
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,700
Why don't you call and check in?

457
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,260
Ace really got dragged in
for no reason this time.

458
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,980
His company isn't the one
paying the wages.

459
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,940
(Lord of All)

460
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,740
(Lord of All)

461
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,180
(Mom)

462
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,060
Mom.

463
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,940
I'm fine.

464
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,340
They just acted on impulse.

465
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,660
How can you be fine?

466
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,560
How can you

467
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,780
let someone throw water on you?

468
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,620
We'll gather evidence.

469
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,980
Sue them for personal attack.

470
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,700
They had no other choice.

471
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,100
We'll help

472
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,540
as much as we can.

473
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,460
I've already contacted your uncle.

474
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,140
He's reaching media contacts.

475
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,020
They'll definitely hush this up.

476
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,140
Anlan, you must be extra careful lately.

477
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,100
You really can't let me worry anymore.

478
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,300
About this matter,

479
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,700
I'll inform your father.

480
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,100
Thanks, Mom.

481
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,780
Mm.

482
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,980
(Lying! Guys, keep throwing!)
You shouldn't be here.

483
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,220
(Deserts, Now learn)
We're investors.

484
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,220
(Drama mode on)
We've given the funds to Wang Xing.

485
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,660
(Lying again)
No idea what you're saying.

486
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,700
(What's happening)
Are we supposed to work for free?

487
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,020
Isn't that right, everyone?

488
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,860
Right!

489
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,660
What's wrong with this guy?

490
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,180
Can't they get plain talk?

491
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,140
This is going too far.

492
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,530
(Jiang Anlan gets splashed with water)

493
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,700
Wait.

494
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,220
Could it be that Jiang took on

495
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,380
all the responsibility alone?

496
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,980
(Dear)

497
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,580
What's with that expression?

498
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,620
Are you unhappy to see me?

499
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,180
I've already seen that video.

500
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,900
Even though I get mobbed often,

501
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,940
I've come up with a way around it.

502
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,940
People might hate you,

503
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,820
but the basic approach is the same.

504
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,660
Do you get that?

505
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,940
I'm talking to you right now.

506
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,060
Who are you calling?

507
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,180
Yao Yuan!

508
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,260
Oh.

509
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,860
You must be in a hurry.

510
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,300
Go ahead.

511
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,860
Hello.

512
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,780
You called me?

513
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,220
Hmm.

514
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,380
It's because of that video, right?

515
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,420
Don't worry, I'm fine.

516
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,300
Your call

517
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,550
makes the soak worth it.

518
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,940
You're worried about me?

519
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,620
Even just as friends,

520
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,820
I should check on you.

521
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,620
You still won't forgive me?

522
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,600
What's between us.

523
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,700
Forgiveness isn't even the right word.

524
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,940
So you're still leaving, huh?

525
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,500
Mm.

526
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,740
I'm glad you're okay.

527
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
I'll hang up now.

528
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,900
Jiang.

529
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,620
Don't cry.

530
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,740
I'm terrible at comforting guys.

531
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
I might really never

532
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,700
get Yao Yuan back this time.

533
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,380
How so?

534
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,380
She said she wants to go somewhere
without me.

535
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,700
Live a life without me.

536
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,940
When she thinks it through,

537
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,300
she'll come back.

538
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,580
Trust her.

539
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,540
Enough.

540
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,500
This isn't the end of the world.

541
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,140
When I broke up with Cui Xi before,

542
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,020
it was the same.

543
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,620
Like the old saying goes,

544
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,340
time will heal everything.

545
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,860
But if this time,

546
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,380
she really doesn't come back,

547
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,380
you'll have to move on by yourself.

548
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,140
How did things get to this point?

549
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,700
Probably Wang Xing dodged the problem

550
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,020
and shifted all the blame to Ruishi.

551
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,620
That's not what I'm asking.

552
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,220
I'm asking

553
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,900
why Anlan

554
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,540
got splashed with water for no reason.

555
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,700
Ancheng,

556
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,500
stop obsessing over the General Manager.

557
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,780
Don't forget, you're Anlan's brother.

558
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,500
Seeing Anlan like this hurts me too.

559
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,420
Have you called him?

560
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,700
No.

561
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,500
Right?

562
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,460
No matter what,

563
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,340
you two

564
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,820
took on this project together.

565
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,060
When trouble hits,

566
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,860
you gotta face it as a team.

567
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,100
I get it.

568
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,420
I've gotten countless calls
from reporters today.

569
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,700
Do you know how hard I worked

570
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,740
to hush this up?

571
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,780
All to avoid affecting the stock price.

572
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,580
Ancheng.

573
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,820
Let me be frank with you.

574
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,380
If you want to stand on your own,

575
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,780
crisis management is a crucial part.

576
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,580
What happened today
is just the start.

577
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,980
You must take responsibility.

578
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,820
Otherwise,
the consequences could be serious.

579
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,100
Don't worry.

580
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,580
I won't shy away from my duties.

581
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,500
You saw it too.

582
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,300
The workers aren't to blame.

583
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,060
The directors are all watching you.

584
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,300
Ah.

585
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,140
I will pay what's owed.

586
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,940
But you have to give me some time!

587
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,580
Anlan is in trouble already.

588
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,060
How can you act like nothing happened?

589
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,860
Who said I'm ignoring it?

590
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,500
Then why aren't you fixing it fast?

591
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,860
You became General Manager

592
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,100
because of this project.

593
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,460
Anlan got splashed with water.

594
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,820
Why is it so unfair?

595
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,220
And Anlan and Yao

596
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,460
broke up because of you.

597
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,220
How could you do that?

598
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,540
He's your own brother.

599
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
If no issues,

600
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,700
no breakup.

601
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,060
But now Anlan

602
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,060
has to face all these issues alone.

603
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,500
Why do I always get blamed
for everything

604
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,740
that happens to Anlan?

605
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,020
I'll help you.

606
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,740
Because it's my job.

607
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,100
Not because you asked.

608
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,060
Also, Jianing.

609
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,140
Please stop coming to me

610
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,980
about Jiang Anlan.

611
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,060
Okay?

612
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,860
Ancheng.

613
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,060
You weren't like this before.

614
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,260
I've always been like this.

615
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,980
That's why you don't like me,

616
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,340
isn't it?

617
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,900
I never disliked you.

618
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,820
It's just family love.

619
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,820
I've heard that line so many times.

620
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,420
I don't want to be your family,

621
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,060
yet you treat me like I am.

622
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,340
Real family always

623
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,380
expects me to fix problems.

624
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,780
I'm a brother.

625
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,100
A son.

626
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,180
But I'm also a person.

627
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,820
I have feelings too.

628
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,740
I need to be cared for as well.

629
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,940
Ancheng.

630
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,380
Are you okay?

631
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,260
I'm fine.

632
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,580
I'm sorry.

633
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,820
I forgot you're under a lot of pressure.

634
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,060
Pressure is part of the job.

635
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,820
I'm sorry.

636
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,060
Sorry for rambling on.

637
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,740
Please don't mind it.

638
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,340
But,

639
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,540
please don't come to me
about Anlan anymore.

640
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,220
That's my only request.

641
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,700
But...

642
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,540
That's it.

643
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,580
I have a lot to do.

644
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,740
You should go back.

645
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,420
You've been so busy today.

646
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,620
You haven't even eaten, huh?

647
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,500
Mom, don't worry. I'm fine.

648
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,020
How's the company?

649
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,300
Did you fix the funding issue?

650
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,340
I'll find a way to fix it.

651
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,820
What way?

652
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,660
Nothing is unsolvable.

653
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,420
Isn't that the motto
you always remind me of?

654
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,060
You and Ancheng are both adults.

655
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,540
I didn't want to
interfere in your matters.

656
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,780
But if you hurt the employees

657
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,220
and abandon the social responsibility
a company should uphold,

658
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,180
it'll be a huge problem.

659
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,340
I won't allow that.

660
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,780
After all, Ancheng is your brother.

661
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,080
If he's done something wrong,

662
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,920
you need to help him.

663
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,060
Okay, Dad. Don't worry.

664
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,500
That's good to hear.

665
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,260
I believe your brother
just lost his way for a moment.

666
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
He'll understand.

667
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,380
I trust him.

668
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,690
Dad, Mom,

669
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,140
thank you for your concern.

670
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,180
Nothing else, I'll return to company.

671
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,140
I have a lot to do.

672
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,700
Aren't you staying for dinner?

673
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,140
No, Mom.

674
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,860
You

675
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,420
clearly worried about Ancheng,

676
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,040
yet you beat around the bush.

677
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,140
At least Anlan is sensible.

678
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,860
No greatness

679
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,220
without struggle.

680
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,820
Xinran.

681
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,500
This is

682
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,740
the information I found

683
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,020
on eco-plastic.

684
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
Explanations of patent rights

685
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,660
in various countries are included.

686
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,100
Plus some

687
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,380
dispute cases.

688
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,580
Could you please pass it on
to Anlan for me?

689
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,580
Did you get the offer?

690
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,220
Mm.

691
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,140
Why don't

692
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,620
you look happy at all?

693
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,660
I'm not.

694
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,980
I'm really happy.

695
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,100
Come on.

696
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,300
Your fake smile might fool others,

697
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,580
but not me, I'm your cousin.

698
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,300
Since life

699
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,100
offered me a different path,

700
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,260
I'll just follow that it

701
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,180
and keep going.

702
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,420
But

703
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,900
fate is in your own hands.

704
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,140
Follow your heart.

705
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,220
You carefully gathered this info
to help Anlan.

706
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,900
I think you should give it to him.

707
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,980
I don't want to be your errand girl.

708
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,980
Ancheng.

709
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,900
You haven't answered my calls

710
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,260
or texts lately.

711
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,180
I'm a bit worried, so...

712
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,060
I've been busy lately.

713
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,180
If you're feeling down, I can

714
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,620
take you out, or even bring you to...

715
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,460
Xiaoya.

716
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,940
I know your feelings.

717
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,340
In fact, just because I know,

718
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,460
I sometimes take your kindness

719
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,740
for granted.

720
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,540
Doesn't that make you mad?

721
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,180
Mad?

722
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,580
Would you be mad at Fang Jianing?

723
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,140
It's the same logic.

724
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,140
I could never be mad at you.

725
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,060
If anything,

726
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,340
I'm mad at myself for having such bad taste.

727
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,940
Always falling for

728
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,900
people who don't like me back.

729
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,300
But who knows?

730
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,420
Maybe one day

731
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,490
you'll suddenly come around

732
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,100
and then like me.

733
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,260
Or maybe

734
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,940
one day I'll meet someone better,

735
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,620
and then I don't like you anymore.

736
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,690
You'll definitely meet someone better.

737
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,060
Hey, don't worry.

738
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,300
Liking you is my choice.

739
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,740
You don't even have to respond.

740
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,340
Not every effort needs a reward.

741
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,180
Otherwise, you'd always be calculating.

742
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,100
I'm here today just to

743
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,060
cheer you on.

744
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,700
Whether it's work

745
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,540
or love,

746
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,060
comeback is always possible.

747
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,580
I won't disturb you further.

748
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,140
Back to your stuff.. Bye.

749
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,860
Master.

750
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
Master, are you okay?

751
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,920
I'm fine.

752
