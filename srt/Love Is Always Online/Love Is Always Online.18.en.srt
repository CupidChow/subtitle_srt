=Episode 18=

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,400
It's not just your uncle
who's struggling.

34
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,560
We all have to make a living.

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,720
I get it. Thanks for understanding.

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,080
Alright, let's go back to work.

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm really not cut out for business.

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,320
They said open chain stores,
so I went for it

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,520
and borrowed money to start.

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,320
And now look at this.

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,760
Money's burning through.

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,440
I also heard

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,920
expanding stores brings more profit.

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,480
Tell me, was I stupid?

45
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,040
Uncle, don't be like that.

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,680
Is there really no way out now?

47
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,280
What about your partner?

48
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,480
He's in Beijing, birdwatching.

49
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,840
Uncle, what if we do this?

50
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,880
We close the other stores,

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,640
and just focus on running one well.

52
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,400
Let's not think about the rest now.

53
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,680
Anlan said the same thing.

54
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,220
But,

55
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,480
I've already invested a lot.

56
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,120
If I pull out now,

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,560
I might lose everything.

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,280
Still, no matter what,

59
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,200
we can't ask Anlan for money.

60
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,880
Think about it, he's my boyfriend.

61
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,780
If everyone around me

62
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,520
came to him for money,

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,260
what would I do?

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,510
And others wouldn't feel right either.

65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,620
He has money,
so just borrow from him first.

66
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,760
I would pay him back.

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,160
By that logic,

68
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,600
banks have money too,

69
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,960
but not everyone
can just get a loan from them.

70
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,320
What do you think I should do?

71
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,400
Both the employees
and creditors are pressuring.

72
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,560
I really don't have a single cent to spare.

73
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,160
How about this?

74
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,160
Let the accountant reassess everything.

75
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,320
See if there's

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,520
any existing assets
we can use as collateral

77
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,320
to pay off the debt first.

78
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,680
Starting fresh

79
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,320
isn't that hard.

80
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,800
You're amazing.

81
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,460
This secret romance technique

82
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,940
only works when practicing with me,

83
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,920
not with anyone else.

84
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,880
How can you even say
"secret romance" like that?

85
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,640
I feel like those two
are in a parallel dimension.

86
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,700
This is the lovers' barrier.

87
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,880
No trespassing.

88
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,320
Babe!

89
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,760
Why did you block that arrow?

90
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,120
If that arrow hit you,

91
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,080
the pain would be yours.

92
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,080
This hurts me deeply.

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,500
Oh my.

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,680
I feel like throwing up.

95
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,360
You can heal yourself, after all.

96
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,500
What's this act about?

97
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,180
Hey, at such a touching moment,

98
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,620
aren't you supposed to be crying?

99
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Why being so sarcastic?

100
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm just getting goosebumps all over.

101
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,520
Better to just go eat.

102
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,600
Hey, count me in.

103
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,120
Let's go together then.

104
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,900
Come on, let's eat.

105
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,840
Oh.

106
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,140
Is this enough?

107
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah. You want me to get fat?

108
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,140
Getting fat is fine.

109
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,080
No one will glance at you.

110
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,240
If I get fat,
no one will want to marry me.

111
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,340
Will you marry me?

112
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,360
Yes.

113
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,880
I won't be logging into Shengshi
anytime soon.

114
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,480
That flashbang was so bright,
it almost blinded me.

115
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,200
They're trying to kill
all of us singles on purpose.

116
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,320
You're single?

117
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,160
Seriously?

118
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,340
Then,

119
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,920
what's your zodiac sign, height,
blood type, and weight?

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,790
Li Xiaoya, you're at it again.

121
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,280
We could be together.

122
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,960
I have to take the chance
to get to know each other.

123
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,340
Hey.

124
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,360
Are you single because

125
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,600
your standards are too high?

126
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,530
That has nothing to do with standards.

127
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,930
You have great qualities
but you're still single.

128
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,720
Love is all about fate.

129
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,980
Yeah.

130
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,840
I agree with you.

131
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,530
Then, since we're meant to be,

132
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,840
add me on WeChat.

133
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,980
Bro.

134
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,920
You're right this time.

135
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,600
Xiaoya is cute and lively.

136
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,450
Just what you need to

137
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,610
break out of your shell.

138
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,640
We're just friending
each other on WeChat.

139
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,720
Seriously.

140
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,260
Exactly.

141
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,920
You guys are way more excited.

142
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,660
Hey.

143
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,140
Are you free later?

144
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,100
Let's catch a movie,

145
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,320
then watch the sunrise.

146
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,960
Watch the sunrise?

147
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,680
Wow, which movie runs all night?

148
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,840
I didn't mean it like that.

149
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,280
Even if I did,
you can't say it out loud.

150
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,750
Sorry, Boss needs me

151
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,920
to do something.

152
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,620
I'll help him translate.

153
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,720
He means things are moving too fast.

154
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,980
It's the other way around.

155
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,040
Now the women are the ones
making the first move.

156
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,000
No, I'm fine with making friends.

157
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,320
But I...

158
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,040
I already like someone.

159
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,720
Ah?

160
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,000
Why didn't you say so earlier?

161
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,680
So, are you two together?

162
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,560
Usually when one says that,

163
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,800
it means it's just a crush.

164
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,440
A crush isn't a big deal.

165
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,960
You're not actually together.

166
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,980
Then let's just

167
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,240
get to know each other better.

168
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,080
Alright.

169
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,360
You can start by being friends.

170
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,520
Yeah.

171
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,860
Sorry, I have to go now.

172
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,800
Enjoy your meal.

173
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,200
Does that mean

174
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,160
Li Ao is not interested in me?

175
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,790
Looks like it.

176
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,750
Why am I so unlucky in love?

177
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,270
Will I end up alone

178
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,820
when I'm old,

179
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,330
with only my dog and cat for company?

180
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,350
Of course not.

181
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,740
He'll show up sooner or later.

182
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,780
Just eat your noodles.

183
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,120
They're getting cold, hurry up.

184
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,720
Ah!

185
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,040
Are you Yao Yuan?

186
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,780
You... you...

187
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,720
Why are you following me?

188
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,820
Look at you, wearing such nice shoes,

189
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,690
carrying such a fancy bag.

190
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,300
Hey.

191
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,980
Your parents told me you have no money.

192
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,360
That can't be true.

193
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,720
Our family really ran out of money.

194
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,660
These clothes I'm wearing are all old.

195
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,640
This bag is from before.

196
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,200
We honestly don't have any money left.

197
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,180
They're not lying.

198
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,120
Alright.

199
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,520
Go back and tell your parents,

200
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,600
if they don't pay up soon,

201
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,480
I'll be with you at every class,

202
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,800
after school,

203
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,920
and all the way home.

204
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,400
Got it?

205
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,160
Mom, this tastes great.

206
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,680
Open the door!

207
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,080
I know you're in there, open up!

208
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,120
You're just hiding there
and not paying back?

209
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,400
Open the door!

210
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,640
I'll check if they've left.

211
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,040
Don't bother.

212
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,520
Let's eat.

213
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,280
Time to eat.

214
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,860
I asked you out

215
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,360
not to see you drinking alone.

216
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,720
Let me tell you.

217
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,910
Lately,

218
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,900
my reputation has taken a serious hit.

219
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,370
Those who liked me

220
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,920
and those who didn't

221
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,520
are all putting me down.

222
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,500
I've been thinking,

223
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,140
Jiang Anlan,

224
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,330
why don't you just end our contract?

225
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,240
Honestly,

226
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,160
ending it now

227
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,120
would be the smartest way
for the company to cut losses.

228
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,000
But I

229
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,240
just have this stubborn confidence
in my own judgment.

230
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,580
Ending the contract now

231
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,280
would be like slapping myself
in the face.

232
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,420
I can never tell

233
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,920
whether you're complimenting me
or making fun of me.

234
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,880
Neither.

235
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,680
This is just work.

236
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,280
As long as our contract is active,

237
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,800
your matters

238
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,880
are my matters.

239
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,560
If you fail,

240
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,440
it means I fail too.

241
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,140
Hey.

242
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,480
The second proposal is coming up soon.

243
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,320
Do you think

244
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,120
I will make it?

245
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,200
No idea.

246
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,560
Are you guys trying to comfort me?

247
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,280
Shouldn't you be saying

248
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,820
"Keep it up,

249
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,030
I believe in you,"

250
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,000
stuff like that?

251
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,930
Yeah.

252
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,900
I believe in you.

253
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,920
You can do this.

254
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,280
No sincerity.

255
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,920
Hey, Jiang.

256
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,250
I have something to tell you.

257
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,480
Well,

258
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,720
on her way over,

259
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,950
Cui Xi

260
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,920
told me,

261
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,780
she's always heard your name,

262
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,920
and wants to see

263
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,120
the real you.

264
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,190
She wants to see me?

265
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,610
I really don't want to see her.

266
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,920
Su.

267
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,920
Not introducing us?

268
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,500
Jiang,

269
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,340
this is Cui Xi.

270
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,060
My boss,

271
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,460
Jiang Anlan.

272
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,740
Finally I've met you, Mr. Jiang.

273
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,740
Hello, I'm Cui Xi.

274
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,980
Just as the rumors said,

275
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,260
you're young and promising,

276
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,420
and especially handsome.

277
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,380
No wonder Su Wen's career is booming.

278
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,900
Even I want to join your company now.

279
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,820
Miss Cui, having you join us

280
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,780
would truly be an honor for Ruishi.

281
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,500
It's just a pity,

282
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,180
our platform is too small

283
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,900
for a talent like you.

284
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,580
I don't care about the company's size,

285
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,100
only the boss's ability.

286
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,980
I just want to know,

287
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,820
are the rumors really true or not?

288
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,060
Seems like you misunderstand me.

289
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,220
Su Wen and I used to be a couple.

290
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,060
It's pretty normal
that photography styles

291
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,340
influence each other.

292
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,790
Miss Cui's words reminded me

293
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,180
of something from years ago

294
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,420
when I was at the Louvre Museum.

295
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,980
I bought

296
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,360
a realistic Mona Lisa painting
from the store outside the entrance.

297
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,340
Guess what happened later?

298
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,220
Over time,

299
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,380
it actually faded.

300
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,660
Eventually,
it turned into just a watermark.

301
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,420
That's when

302
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,700
I realized,

303
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,380
counterfeits

304
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,020
will always be counterfeits.

305
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,610
That's an unchangeable fact.

306
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,900
Does Mr. Jiang

307
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,300
always speak so bluntly?

308
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,370
I just don't like

309
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,660
beating around the bush.

310
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,820
(Yao Xinran)

311
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,220
Hey, Xinran.

312
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,180
Anlan, is Yuan with you?

313
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,740
No, why?

314
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,580
She hasn't come home,
and her phone's unreachable.

315
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,820
I'm wondering if it's because her uncle

316
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,020
hasn't paid the creditor,

317
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
so they're coming after Yuan.

318
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,380
What?

319
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,300
(Diner of Delicacies)

320
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,420
(Su Wen)

321
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,020
Hey, any news?

322
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,940
She isn't at the company.

323
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,860
Jiang, what about you?

324
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,140
No luck here either.

325
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,060
Got a call.

326
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,300
(Yao Xinran)

327
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,300
Xinran, has she come home yet?

328
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,140
Not yet.

329
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,260
Besides these usual spots,

330
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,180
where else would she go?

331
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,860
I have no idea.

332
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,540
I got it.

333
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,620
She's probably at the studio.

334
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,590
Okay.

335
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,380
Is anyone here?

336
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,220
Is anyone here?
Yao Yuan, are you inside?

337
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,780
Is anyone here?

338
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,940
Yao Yuan?

339
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,420
Are you in there, Yao Yuan?

340
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,790
Yao Yuan.

341
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,780
What's wrong?

342
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,740
Why are you here alone?

343
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,820
I... I think I'm being followed.

344
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,060
Who's following you?

345
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,900
It seems like

346
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,220
those creditors

347
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,860
who were after my parents for debt.

348
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,300
It's okay now.

349
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,620
That's all in the past.

350
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
They won't come again.

351
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,060
Why is that?

352
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,980
Why do I always
get caught up in these things?

353
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,140
I feel like I might never get away

354
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,620
from these debt collectors.

355
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,540
What am I supposed to do?

356
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,860
It's all my fault.

358
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,460
I won't let this happen again.

359
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,340
I've made up my mind.

360
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,740
I'll handle the money

361
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,980
your uncle owes.

362
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,620
You clearly know I...

363
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,260
I know you don't want to trouble me.

364
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,740
But right now,

365
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,700
this isn't just about money.

366
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,180
It's about your safety.

367
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,380
I can't let you get hurt again.

368
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,300
But

369
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,420
I don't want to be a burden
to anyone anymore.

370
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,140
You're not a burden.

371
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,180
Not now, and never will be.

372
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,140
You know,

373
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,140
once I've made up my mind,

374
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,740
I don't change it easily.

375
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,460
So,

376
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,940
consider that money

377
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,660
as a loan to me.

378
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,740
I promise I'll pay you back.

379
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,060
I'm not taking it for free.

380
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,140
Okay?

381
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,380
Why don't you work at my company?

382
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,420
We happen to need
an exhibition planner right now.

383
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,700
Your salary

384
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,340
can count as repayment to your uncle.

385
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,500
How does that sound?

386
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,020
Come on,

387
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,620
exhibition planning
fits your major perfectly.

388
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,260
I trust your ability.

389
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,700
And also,

390
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,580
I do have my own reasons.

391
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,020
This is for my personal gain, too.

392
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,900
Is that okay?

393
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,660
I heard that

394
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,820
you're really strict.

395
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,440
Very strict.

396
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,300
Extremely strict.

397
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,940
Then won't I get scolded by you?

398
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,740
Definitely.

399
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,860
But you can scold me back after work.

400
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,980
Alright.

401
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,900
It's settled then.

402
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,380
No more crying.

403
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,980
Thank you.

404
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,740
For what?

405
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,300
Trust me.

406
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,020
Okay.

407
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,020
Ancheng,

408
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,380
do I look too young dressed like this?

409
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,780
Maturity comes from within,

410
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,140
not from appearance.

411
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,610
But people say
first impressions really matter.

412
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,580
I don't want people
to doubt my abilities

413
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,460
just because I'm young.

414
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,820
That's not acceptable.

415
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
I need to get changed.

416
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,660
Hey, stop the car, stop.

417
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,500
I'll go buy a new outfit
and be right back.

418
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,420
Jianing,

419
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,740
you look at least
twenty years older like that.

420
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,060
Isn't that perfect?

421
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,900
It makes me look more mature.

422
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,780
But you'd scare off the client

423
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,940
before you even speak.

424
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,140
You don't have to force yourself

425
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,460
to be someone others want you to be.

426
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,180
But I don't want to fail again.

427
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,620
I'm here. What can't we handle together?

428
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,860
I know.

429
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,740
Even if the sky falls, you'll shield me.

430
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,300
Let's go.

431
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,740
Long time no see, Ancheng.

432
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,460
Still just as handsome.

433
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,580
You guys too.

434
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,460
You're getting younger,
and the company keeps growing.

435
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
We should hang out more often.

436
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,380
- Definitely.
- Let's sit down.

437
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,340
This is...

438
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,220
My good friend Fang Jianing.

439
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,820
She's currently working at Ruishi.

440
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,620
I hope you can look out for her.

441
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,110
Hi, guys. Just call me Jianing.

442
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,180
Alright.

443
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,920
Miss Fang, what's your background?

444
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,180
I just returned from studying abroad.

445
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,510
My major was Art Economics.

446
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm currently doing market analysis.

447
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,140
Jianing's market research
is very accurate.

448
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,180
She identifies pros and cons easily,

449
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,700
and shares unique takes
on the investment target's

450
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,780
competitiveness.

451
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,980
I'm young and full of energy.

452
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,180
If you work with me,

453
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,300
you won't be disappointed.

454
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,820
With Mr. Jiang endorsing,
she must be talented.

455
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,980
We're happy to collaborate.

456
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,180
Miss Fang, are you
good at project proposals?

457
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm pretty good at them.

458
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,740
Charts, data, videos,
I have them all covered.

459
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,940
I can also do big data analysis.

460
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,180
Great, that's really helpful.

461
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,220
Let's exchange contacts.

462
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,700
We can reach out if anything comes up.

463
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,340
- If we face work challenges,
- Sure.

464
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,380
we can support each other.

465
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,820
Okay, done.

466
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,060
The watch is a main focus.

467
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,540
But I believe

468
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,700
what you notice first

469
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,540
are the expressions
and smiles of the leads.

470
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,140
Not overly highlighted,

471
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,660
yet they still stand out.

472
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
This profile photo

473
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,020
subtly showcases
the company's top quality.

474
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,940
The image

475
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,780
really moved me deeply.

476
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,860
Mr. Su,

477
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,260
this time,

478
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,300
I'm very pleased.

479
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,540
Thank you.

480
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,420
With Mr. Su's support,

481
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,220
I'm confident this project
will be a hit again.

482
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,460
I'll handle the contract.

483
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,540
Alright.

484
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,140
We finally turned things
around this time.

485
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
You bet.

486
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,290
Otherwise, Jiang would've teased us.

487
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,820
Okay, see you later.

488
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,900
The meeting must've finished.

489
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,660
Mr. Zhang is very satisfied this time.

490
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,900
I heard he decided to sign the contract

491
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,060
out of respect for Mr. Jiang.

492
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,180
Jiang Anlan.

493
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,260
Look at me.

494
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,500
What?

495
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,420
Backing out at the last moment?

496
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,780
What's going on?

497
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,700
Who's stopping you?

498
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Turns out Ruishi never sold my work,

499
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,860
but your reputation.

500
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,420
I heard that Mr. Zhang

501
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,050
signed the contract because of you.

502
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,780
What do you mean by that?

503
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,100
So it was true after all.

504
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,700
Then why was I struggling

505
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,140
and waiting for emotional breakthrough?

506
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
I might as well just mention you

507
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,900
at the proposal meetings.

508
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,860
This photo was sent to me
by Li Ao a few days ago.

509
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,840
He asked where
it still needed improvements.

510
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,320
After seeing this photo,

511
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,000
I felt his emotional
delivery was spot on.

512
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,700
I told Li Ao immediately

513
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,060
that Su Wen would be fine.

514
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,100
So Boss told me to contact Mr. Zhang

515
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,180
for another proposal.

516
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,100
This time, we were 100% sure
we'd secure the contract.

517
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,540
But I

518
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,900
clearly heard people say otherwise.

519
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,660
Who did you hear it from?

520
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,100
Those two assistants?

521
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,420
They're just gossiping.

522
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,260
Mr. Zhang spent a seven-figure sum
on promotion this time.

523
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,380
If I were worth that much,

524
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,300
would I still need someone

525
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,860
arrogant like you?

526
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,020
Turns out even Jiang Anlan

527
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,140
needs me.

528
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,500
Don't underestimate your own work.

529
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,940
This self-doubt isn't like you.

530
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,020
Focus on how to get the contract signed.

531
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,380
Your skills are coming back.

532
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,780
Don't ruin your own reputation.

533
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,140
Okay.

534
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,500
My dear little cousin.

535
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,220
You've been picking
for two hours straight.

536
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,700
Not even a matchmaking date
gets this serious.

537
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,580
How do office workers dress these days?

538
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,260
Just wear what you usually do.

539
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,340
It still feels a bit too casual.

540
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Ace won't mind at all.

541
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,340
He wouldn't mind me, that's for sure.

542
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,380
But I still have to think about

543
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,740
what the other employees will think.

544
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,860
You're worrying way too much.

545
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,590
Ace wants you at the company
to show your skills,

546
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,700
not to show off your looks.

547
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,540
Now that you put it,

548
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,860
I'm even more worried.

549
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,500
Worried about what?

550
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,060
You'll be the perfect work duo,

551
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,640
making everyone else jealous?

552
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,700
It's my first time
working at such a company.

553
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,980
I don't even know
if I'm capable enough.

554
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,300
What if I embarrass him?

555
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,010
Don't worry.

556
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,140
You're our company's

557
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,180
top exhibition planner.

558
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,980
An organization
is different from a company.

559
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,020
Ah.

560
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,420
Stop doubting yourself.

561
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,380
Remember,

562
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,980
you don't need to please anyone.

563
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,380
You're going there to

564
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,340
repay a debt.

565
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,840
Or,

566
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,060
you could just marry Anlan.

567
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,640
Just offer yourself

568
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,210
in marriage.

569
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,380
What are you even saying?

570
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,260
Am I smart or what?

571
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,380
Right?

572
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,740
Annoying.

573
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,380
Mind if I give you a ride?

574
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,530
Isn't it out of your way
to stop by my place first?

575
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,340
Wherever you are,

576
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,540
it's always on the way.

577
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,420
Let's go.

578
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,740
Stop posing.

579
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,760
Alright.

580
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,580
Breakfast is in the back.

581
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,340
I don't know what you like,

582
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,700
so I bought a bit of everything.

583
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,540
Sesame flatbread,

584
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,580
and fried dough stick.

585
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,460
There's no way I can finish all this.

586
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,900
Give the leftovers to Li Ao.

587
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,980
Li Ao can't finish it either.

Hey, Li Ao.

Tell her we have a surprise inspection

604
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,340
and she should come upstairs.

605
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,130
I don't care what we inspect.

606
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,620
Even fingernails work.

607

00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,980

Let's go.

Should we call security?

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,740
- No need.
- No need.

- Hello, Mr. Jiang.

635
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,580
Yuan.

636
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,980
Hello, Ms. Yao Yuan.

637
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,140
Welcome to Ruishi.

638
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,980
Yao.

639
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,660
What brings you here?

640
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Once you're here,

641
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,980
you can have a big talk with Master...

642
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,900
Shut up.

643
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,220
Listen,

644
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,420
if you dare to tell anyone

645
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,980
about Yao Yuan and me,

646
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,420
you know what will happen.

647
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,470
Let's go.

648
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,140
Anlan.

649
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,420
I've landed a new client.

650
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,940
What are you doing here?

651
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,180
Yao, you're here too.

652
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,860
She's here to help with the curation.

653
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,980
I can do curation too.

654
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,260
I've seen a lot of exhibits.

655
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,380
No need to trouble Yao.

656
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,940
Have you ever watched
someone build a house?

657
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,420
Yes, I have.

658
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,540
Can you build one yourself?

659
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,030
I...

660
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,460
Anlan is being biased.

661
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,060
Just because Yao is your...

662
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,220
We'll handle it here.

663
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,420
You guys go ahead first.

664
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,780
Why?

665
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,260
Let's go.

666
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,180
Alright.

667
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,590
Uncle.

668
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,540
Yuan.

669
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,600
Have a seat.

670
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,260
The reason I called you today

671
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
is to discuss your debt

672
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,620
problem with you.

673
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,700
I've decided

674
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,790
to help you sort out your debt,

675
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,750
but this won't come without a price.

676
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,610
I've only helped you avoid some

677
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,820
unnecessary debt collection methods.

678
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,840
You need to first shut down

679
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,330
the restaurant business,

680
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,550
settle accounts,
and pay off your debts first.

681
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,220
If it's not enough,

682
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,380
I'll cover the rest.

683
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,080
From now on,

684
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,990
I am your creditor.

685
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,620
Thank you.

686
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,700
But you must make
regular loan repayments,

687
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,140
including what you owe Yao Yuan.

688
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,620
You can't let creditors bother her.

689
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,780
In the future,

690
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,060
we need to rethink the business strategy.

691
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,740
It's possible if you wanna

692
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,740
run a new restaurant.

693
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
When you're ready,

694
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,540
submit your proposal to me.

695
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,940
If it's approved,

696
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,900
the debt can be paid off quickly.

697
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,060
I promise I'll work hard.

698
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,500
Thank you, Anlan.

699
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,820
No need to thank me.

700
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,860
We will be family

701
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,780
in the future.

702
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,980
Yuan,

703
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,220
I was greedy before.

704
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,100
I listened to my partner,

705
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,500
and have taken a big hit.

706
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,980
But I've applied as a chef

707
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
at a small restaurant.

708
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,660
This time,

709
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,740
I'll definitely do my best.

710
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,820
Thanks.

711
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,580
You absolutely

712
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,460
can't

713
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,380
reveal Yao

714
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,180
and Master's relationship
in front of everyone.

715
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,580
Got it.

716
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm not saying anything.

717
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,540
Who wants people to know

718
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,690
that Yao and Anlan are...

719
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,020
Alright.

720
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,260
They're just good friends.

721
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,780
Alright, remember that.

722
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,700
Don't say it again.

723
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,220
Never say it to anyone.

724
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,260
Yao Yuan,

725
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,580
let me show you around.

726
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,580
Li Ao,

727
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,700
let me do it.

728
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,470
That way, I'll seem like Yao's senior.

729
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,300
Yao, look this way.

730
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,820
This is our office area.

731
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,740
None of the desks are assigned seats.

732
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,060
Anyone can sit here.

733
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,860
Let's go this way.

734
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,180
Here, take a look.

735
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,100
This is our break area.

736
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,500
All the coffee and snacks here

737
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,740
are free of charge.

738
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,220
If you need anything,

739
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,620
just call me.

740
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,980
But I have to warn you,

741
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,300
our master's

742
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,380
eagle eyes

743
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,820
are incredibly sharp.

744
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,940
Any sneaky moves

745
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,380
will be spotted by him.

746
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,140
You really think Yao Yuan

747
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,220
spends her days

748
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
goofing off like you?

749
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,580
Well,

750
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,380
laziness is human nature.

751
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,940
If people could live without eating,

752
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,020
I guarantee you,

753
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,260
someone definitely will

754
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,380
lie still for 100 days
without moving their eyes.

755
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,620
Yuan,

756
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,540
what he means is,

757
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,860
Boss is very strict at work,

758
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,100
emphasizing

759
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,260
both quality and efficiency.

760
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,660
If the goal isn't met,

761
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,580
he shows no mercy.

762
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,940
Yes.

763
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,100
But after watching for a long time,

764
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,940
I've noticed our master

765
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,820
has a unique habit.

766
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,620
He likes popping bubble wrap
to relieve stress.

767
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,100
Bubble wrap?

768
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,540
You mean the kind
with little bubbles on it?

769
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,700
Exactly.

770
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,660
Isn't that oddly charming?

771
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,460
Kind of weirdly appealing.

772
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,900
Is that so?

773
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,820
Yeah.

774
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,020
I can understand this situation.

775
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,340
But it doesn't quite fit

776
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,460
Master's image,

777
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,660
so,

778
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,020
he usually doesn't tell anyone.

779
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,940
Remember to clean up any spills.

780
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,460
That glass is...

781
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,220
For Yao Yuan.

782
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,140
I asked you to make some for me,

783
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,060
but you refused.

784
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,180
Now you're making it for Yao.

785
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,340
Didn't you learn
how to make it yourself?

786
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,340
You're quick to learn.

787
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,220
What does it mean?

788
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,900
That's totally unfair.

789
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,020
Who would want to work
with Yao like this?

790
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,500
If you don't,

791
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,940
then quit.

792
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,060
I went through so much
just to get to this company.

793
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,700
But Yao?

794
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,780
She just came without breaking a sweat.

795
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,300
How's that fair?

796
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,420
Don't you still have an unfinished task?

797
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,500
But Mr. Jiang hasn't signed the contract.

798
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,380
I'll let it slide this time,

799
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,780
for your effort.

800
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,100
But your new task is

801
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,380
to help Yao Yuan finish the curation.

802
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,060
That can't be real.

803
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,140
Surely you can handle

804
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,260
this little thing.

805
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,100
This isn't a small thing.

806
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,300
It's the biggest deal of my life.

807
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,500
It really is.

808
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,780
If you mess this up,

809
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
your career could be in serious trouble.

810
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,420
So, good luck.

811
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,460
Problems are bound to come up

812
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,600
in relationships.

813
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,990
Sometimes it's arguments,
other times it leads to breakups.

814
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,020
But

815
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,270
that happens because
they haven't found a bacon.

816
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,500
So

817
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,300
for the new TV show, I want to find

818
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,290
couples in relationship trouble

819
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,250
and have them come on for counseling.

820
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,060
That sounds good.

821
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,980
It'll make some noise.

822
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,180
How do you know

823
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,860
people will be on a show like this?

824
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,630
What do you mean?

825
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,860
Couples don't even like
to talk about fights with friends.

826
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,500
How could anyone agree to share that on TV

827
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,820
with a bunch of strangers?

828
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,060
They don't want to open up

829
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,900
cause friends can't really help
solve the problem.

830
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,420
If people knew that talking about it
would fix things,

831
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,890
some would be willing to come on.

832
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,420
So how do you know

833
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,340
you can solve everyone's problems?

834
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,820
The same rice can feed
a hundred different people.

835
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,740
You really think your way
works for everyone?

836
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,260
Zhang.

837
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,340
I'm going out for coffee.

838
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,500
Okay, take your time and enjoy it.

839
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,420
No rush here.

840
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,620
You should come too.

841
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,460
You can tell me privately

842
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,380
if you have problems.

843
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,590
Do you have to embarrass me like that?

844
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,340
Can't I just be honest?

845
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,780
But don't shut down
my opinion right away.

846
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,540
I'm not shutting you down.

847
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,700
I'm just expressing my view.

848
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,020
Your view doesn't match mine.

849
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,940
That's shutting me down.

850
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,740
So what, you want me to

851
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,620
just nod along
and agree with everything?

852
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,780
You care more about your image.

853
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,560
Is it so hard to handle
when I speak honestly?

854
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,860
Why do you always
have to be so aggressive?

855
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,780
Can we just talk calmly?

856
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,340
I get it, you have your own views.

857
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,100
But this is my job.

858
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,220
I want you to respect that.

859
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,610
This time,

860
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,970
Yike Advertising Company

861
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,900
invited us to collaborate
with Xiduomeng.

862
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,970
It's a rare opportunity.

863
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,940
Xiduomeng holds a 50% share
of the domestic

864
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,140
canned tea market.

865
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,940
It's a huge slice
everyone wants a piece of.

866
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,620
In the past,
their annual brand campaigns

867
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,500
always had a fixed photographer partner.

868
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,060
But that photographer

869
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,660
has been involved in some controversy.

870
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,100
That's why our photographer
now has a chance to pitch.

871
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,900
Su Wen and Yao Yuan will work

872
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,940
together on this proposal this time.

873
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,820
One has outstanding photography skills,

874
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,380
the other has an acute sense
of aesthetics

875
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,500
and strong analytical abilities.

876
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,300
They'll put forward the proposal.

877
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,820
Please, everyone, assist them as needed.

878
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,620
Yao, you heard that, right?

879
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,540
This project is huge.

880
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,980
We have to stay closely connected.

881
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,300
Like, 24/7 nonstop communication.

882
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,660
What are you saying?

883
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,140
I've never seen you discuss

884
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,700
about the big projects so seriously.

885
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,940
Usually, it's just me and Li Ao.

886
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,380
Don't you realize

887
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,300
how big this project is?

888
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,500
If he bothers you
about anything off work,

889
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,940
tell me right away.

890
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,780
I'll just hire another photographer.

891
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,260
Ah?

892
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,220
Anyway,

893
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,340
I don't want anything outside work

894
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,260
to affect efficiency.

895
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,380
This applies to everyone.

896
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,860
Meeting's over.

897
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,220
Who's this for?

898
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,300
It's actually for someone else.

899
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,340
But since you're so cute,

900
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,620
I'll get you a cup too.
