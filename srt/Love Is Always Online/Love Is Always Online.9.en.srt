1
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,321
This person loves to overthink things

2
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,441
about things that don't matter.

3
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,921
I suggest you cut ties with him soon.

4
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,560
Or you'll end up just as pointless.

5
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,121
Hey, watch what you say.

6
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,601
Wen Cheng is my friend too.

7
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,361
And I understand him.

8
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:46,561
The feeling when your shaobing gets stolen.

9
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,281
Why do you all love shaobing so much?

10
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:51,801
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

11
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,201
Let's handle things one at a time.

12
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,641
Wen Cheng.

13
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:56,921
What's going on with the show?

14
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:00,881
The producer asked me to find guests.

15
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,841
So I recommended you.

16
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,241
You're way above Su Wen's league.

17
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:06,201
You're going on his show?

18
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,321
No way.

19
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,841
I bet you'll never go on his show.

20
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,521
How about this—

21
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,401
I'll do it.

22
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:13,801
I'll share my years of relationship experience.

23
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,721
And clear my name while I'm at it.

24
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,521
Maybe even confess my feelings.

25
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,681
I'm in.

26
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,361
Then I'll go next time.

27
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,561
What's going on?

28
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:36,281
We're filming live.

29
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,561
Go back, hurry!

30
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,041
Come on, get ready.

31
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,201
Live in five seconds.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,240
Five.

33
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:41,921
Four.

34
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:42,881
Three.

35
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:43,801
Two.

36
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:45,401
I'm your host, Wen Cheng.

37
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,761
Today we have a very special guest.

38
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,761
Let's give a warm welcome to

39
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,121
Jiang Anlan.

40
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,041
Hello, everyone.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
Jiang Anlan is a top choice for many.

42
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,361
I'm sure you're all curious

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,000
how such a cool, handsome guy

44
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,681
acts when he's in love.

45
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:02,761
Just like this, in front of you.

46
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,321
No different from anyone else.

47
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,761
You're not the one I love.

48
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:08,961
So you can't feel it.

49
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,681
I bet many people want to know too.

50
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:13,281
Would you share with us

51
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,361
how you treat the woman you love?

52
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,281
My whole world revolves around her.

53
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,361
What's with this guy?

54
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,961
Even using his friends now.

55
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:24,561
He's just

56
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,281
sharing his own opinion.

57
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,641
Hasn't had the chance yet.

58
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,481
He goes on the show every week.

59
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,201
Who are you talking about?

60
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:34,801
Wen Cheng.

61
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:36,921
I'm talking about Jiang Anlan.

62
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:39,041
It's fine.

63
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,561
In some people's eyes,

64
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:41,521
there's only Wen Cheng.

65
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,121
So if I look at your husband—

66
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,001
That sounds so abstract.

67
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,161
Do you spend all day circling around her?

68
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,361
If I could,

69
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:54,401
I'd honestly want to.

70
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:56,641
Let me ask you this—

71
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,121
When you like someone,

72
00:03:58,161 --> 00:03:59,681
what do you actually do?

73
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,121
I set up an inescapable net around her.

74
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,561
No other man crosses the line.

75
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,281
Isn't that a bit possessive?

76
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:10,761
Not when I do it.

77
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:14,081
You seem really confident in yourself.

78
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,921
I'm confident in our love.

79
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,841
Isn't love supposed to be

80
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,201
the most unreliable thing in the world?

81
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:23,721
I'm the reliable one.

82
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,321
That's an amazing answer.

83
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:32,361
Since he's already here to visit,

84
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,361
how about

85
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,001
later on,

86
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,521
you both go on the show together?

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,640
Who joins a show halfway through?

88
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,721
We can't always stick to tradition.

89
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:42,361
We need to innovate.

90
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,281
Right?

91
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,681
The path's always looked like this.

92
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:45,921
There's a reason for that.

93
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,281
Su Wen isn't exactly

94
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,881
an unknown figure.

95
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,161
When people see him,

96
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,441
they get excited.

97
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,721
Who cares about the little details?

98
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,081
No wonder you're the company's

99
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:58,721
famous producer.

100
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,801
You know how to adapt.

101
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:04,801
So,

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,080
you two will go on the show together later.

103
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,481
Boss Jiang,

104
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,361
is that okay with you?

105
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,561
A mysterious guest just appeared here.

106
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:20,281
A very mysterious guest.

107
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,961
Let’s give a warm welcome

108
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,361
to photographer Su Wen.

109
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,441
Su Wen is openly declaring war, huh?

110
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,761
Su Wen is a master in romance.

111
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,041
The kind people love to hate.

112
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,521
He’s joining our show today

113
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,001
to share with us

114
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,321
his tips for winning a girl’s heart.

115
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:42,281
I don’t want to.

116
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:43,081
Ah.

117
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,481
I want to talk about it too.

118
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,561
When I fall in love,

119
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,201
I

120
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,041
wonder what I’ll be like.

121
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,361
We really don’t want to know.

122
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,841
I only have eyes for that person.

123
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,361
I don’t care about anyone else.

124
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,841
Just want to stay by her side.

125
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:01,601
Then you must be blind all year round.

126
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,161
And most of your income

127
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:04,601
is spent on travel expenses.

128
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,161
That was the old me you’re talking about.

129
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:11,241
Let the past die with yesterday;

130
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,640
let the future be born with tomorrow.

131
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,641
So, what will the new Su Wen be like?

132
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:17,641
What will he look like?

133
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,121
From now on,

134
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,441
I’ll only care about one person.

135
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:23,081
That’s for the future.

136
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,681
Why talk about it now?

137
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,161
True love can’t be forced.

138
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,241
We have to keep trying

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,320
to find the one who suits us best.

140
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,521
But usually not three at once.

141
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,441
That’s usually just a rumor.

142
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,640
I just try three in a row.

143
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,321
We only live to eighty.

144
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,961
How long will you let morals tie you down?

145
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,641
It’s not about moral coercion.

146
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:48,641
It’s about respecting relationships.

147
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,880
Don’t let past failures

148
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,361
make you give up future happiness.

149
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,161
Do you respect yourself?

150
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,441
Past relationships aren’t failures.

151
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,521
They’re memories, nutrients for growth.

152
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,401
Nutrients?

153
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,121
What are nutrients anyway?

154
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,721
Nutrients come from what’s dead.

155
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,401
Once it’s dead, it won’t come back.

156
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:08,681
What’s alive

157
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,161
is what we should care about most.

158
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,161
I’ve only been in love once.

159
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:15,681
I plan for it to be my only one.

160
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:16,601
This topic

161
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,801
I’ll leave it to you all.

162
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,041
I’ve decided to follow my boss’s lead.

163
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:23,681
And lately I’ve noticed

164
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,001
my taste is becoming more like my boss’s.

165
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,921
More and more alike.

166
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:29,521
Because of my situation,

167
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,681
there’s been a lot of gossip lately.

168
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,001
I don’t want to clarify anything.

169
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,161
I believe truth speaks for itself.

170
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,321
I’m honored to be on this show today.

171
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,081
I want to share my views on love.

172
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,521
I think this show is great.

173
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,521
It’s a good chance to clear up

174
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,681
everyone’s misunderstandings about me.

175
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:46,241
Who cares?

176
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,121
I’m holding an exhibition soon.

177
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,721
Through a woman I care about,

178
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,441
I’ve found my true self again.

179
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:00,521
Boss.

180
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:02,761
Coffee.

181
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,441
How much longer is our contract with Su Wen?

182
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:12,881
A long time.

183
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:14,161
Why?

184
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:17,001
Because you thought you had great taste.

185
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,241
Su Wen.

186
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,321
He’s got a bright future.

187
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,441
How much to break the contract?

188
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:24,761
Terminate the contract?

189
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:25,801
Trust me,

190
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:28,121
you won’t spend that much on Su Wen.

191
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,161
What are you doing?

192
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:45,481
Su Wen must want to photograph you.

193
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:46,881
I’d better be careful.

194
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,721
It’s too dark, he can’t get a clear shot.

195
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:50,601
He’s not a paparazzo.

196
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:52,241
Doesn’t he love to capture

197
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,521
real moments?

198
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:55,601
I can’t let him see your beauty.

199
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:58,161
Is that possessiveness talking,

200
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,880
or do you really mean it?

201
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:00,801
Both.

202
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:03,121
All my possessiveness

203
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:05,521
is always based on sincerity.

204
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,361
It’s just the neighbor’s dog barking.

205
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,721
Why are you so sensitive?

206
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,521
Dogs are sensitive animals.

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,680
There must be an uninvited guest.

208
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,521
What if it’s barking at you?

209
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,961
No way.

210
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,561
Unless Su Wen is playing the dog.

211
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:25,921
Alright, you go now.

212
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:26,881
I’m heading back.

213
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,561
No, I have to walk you in.

214
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,641
Is Su Wen at my place?

215
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,360
Maybe.

216
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,521
I need to check for you.

217
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,041
Why do I feel you have other motives?

218
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:40,201
I’m leaving.

219
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,521
Sis, I’m back.

220
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,320
You’re back.

221
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,761
Hey, let me tell you what I bought today—

222
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,001
Master, why are you here?

223
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:00,441
You didn’t even say anything.

224
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:01,161
Something came up.

225
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,681
Weren’t you going to the bar?

226
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,241
Li Xiaoya ditched me.

227
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:07,161
Stood me up.

228
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:09,761
Hi, Xinran.

229
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,161
You two just treat me like I’m invisible.

230
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,201
Go ahead, keep going.

231
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,601
Wish you both happiness.

232
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,280
Sit.

233
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:26,521
Want some water? I’ll get you some.

234
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,200
I’m not thirsty.

235
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:29,521
Are you hungry?

236
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:31,041
I’ll cook for you.

237
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:31,721
Fried rice.

238
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:32,361
Sound good?

239
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,481
Anything you make is fine.

240
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,280
Close the door.

241
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:00,441
Su Wen can’t take photos,

242
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:01,601
but you can, right?

243
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:02,761
That’s right.

244
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,561
That’s one rule for them,

245
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:06,801
another for us.

246
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,641
So you’re saying you’re the official?

247
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah.

248
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,641
Su Wen is just a regular person.

249
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:24,281
Looks pretty good, right?

250
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,641
This is

251
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
soy sauce fried rice.

252
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,761
It's not burnt.

253
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:33,641
Don't get me wrong.

254
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,440
I just added a bit too much soy sauce.

255
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:36,641
Our soy sauce isn't salty.

256
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,360
Really.

257
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:40,801
This probably isn't the soy sauce's fault.

258
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,001
Try it first.

259
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,281
Maybe it'll taste good.

260
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,841
Just like I imagined.

261
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:02,920
Is it good?

262
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:03,321
It's good.

263
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:06,921
You try it.

264
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:16,761
Let's order takeout.

265
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:17,121
Okay.

266
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,521
Sorry.

267
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:21,561
It's fine.

268
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,081
I'm really good at cooking.

269
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:23,641
From now on,

270
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll do the cooking.

271
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:25,441
You just need to eat.

272
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:26,881
Do you like Northeastern cuisine?

273
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:27,601
I'm fine with it.

274
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,241
Hello?

275
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:35,881
This is Yao Xinran.

276
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,041
Who are you looking for?

277
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,201
Hi, I'm Su Wen.

278
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,481
I want to join Planner Yao's art exchange project.

279
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:41,321
As a photography instructor.

280
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:42,281
Great, great.

281
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:43,641
I can arrange that.

282
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,001
Don't worry.

283
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,041
It's an honor to work with you.

284
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,081
It's truly our privilege.

285
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,921
That's awesome.

286
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,121
The photo you're seeing now

287
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:56,961
is from before,

288
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,121
a candid wedding shot.

289
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:00,881
I was very poor back then.

290
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,001
Cases like this

291
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:04,961
couldn't support my life at all.

292
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:07,281
But luckily,

293
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,281
those experiences

294
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:09,681
led to this photo.

295
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,921
Someone told me

296
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,001
the colors in this photo

297
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,161
and emotion

298
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:16,041
are too intense.

299
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:18,201
But I don't think so.

300
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,241
I feel

301
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,081
it's real.

302
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,401
Because the parents outside the car window know

303
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,321
their daughter is about to get married.

304
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,601
On the journey ahead,

305
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:31,681
they can't go with her.

306
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,441
Hands tightly held

307
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,201
will eventually let go.

308
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:42,361
Alright.

309
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,961
Now it's open Q&A time.

310
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,481
Feel free to ask any questions.

311
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:47,961
Me.

312
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:53,841
Planner Yao.

313
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,281
What's wrong?

314
00:13:58,761 --> 00:13:59,361
Planner Yao.

315
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:00,961
Thank you.

316
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:03,321
Thank me for what?

317
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:07,321
You're right.

318
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,481
I shouldn't let a bit of fame

319
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:11,521
make me lose myself.

320
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:14,161
Photos without soul

321
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:15,361
can be taken by anyone.

322
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:17,401
I've decided

323
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,720
to find my original purpose.

324
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,521
The reason I came here to share

325
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,440
if I may be bold,

326
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,121
is all because of you.

327
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,640
Actually,

328
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,000
we're all working hard

329
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,281
for the art industry's growth.

330
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:37,521
And as the curator of this exchange,

331
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,201
I hope for more lectures like yours.

332
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:40,201
No need to thank me.

333
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:41,561
Of course I should thank you.

334
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,961
Both professionally and personally,

335
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:44,681
you're my Muse.

336
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:53,321
Hey, Planner Yao.

337
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,801
Planner Yao, are you free tonight?

338
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,401
Don't think your laid-back attitude

339
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,721
can fool Sister Yao.

340
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:33,801
Hello, Zhang He.

341
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:34,601
What's going on?

342
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:35,881
Guild Leader.

343
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:36,921
Big news!

344
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:38,681
Su Wen came to give a lecture.

345
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:39,961
Anything else?

346
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,361
And also,

347
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,121
he said Sister Yao

348
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:44,401
is his Muse.

349
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:48,361
Well done.

350
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,281
Any other developments,

351
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:51,321
keep reporting to me.

352
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,041
Yes.

353
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:52,761
Guild Leader.

354
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,041
Your business is my business.

355
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,521
I'll support you all the way.

356
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:56,201
For you,

357
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:57,641
I'd go through fire and water.

358
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,721
Old Jiang actually called me.

359
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,401
Hello?

360
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:10,441
Ah.

361
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:12,201
Okay.

362
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:12,921
I'll be right there.

363
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,361
Yao Yuan.

364
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,081
What's going on with you lately?

365
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,161
Why do all these dream guys

366
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,481
keep showing up around you?

367
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,721
Share some of your luck with me!

368
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,801
You think it's that easy to share?

369
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:32,481
By the way,

370
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,561
Su Wen may sound all high and mighty,

371
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,761
but he's here because of you.

372
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,081
Jiang Anlan must be super jealous.

373
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,241
Sis,

374
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,241
what are you going to do?

375
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:46,961
I don't care why Su Wen came.

376
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,721
I just know he's working with us now.

377
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:50,241
As for me,

378
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:51,681
I need to help with his lecture.

379
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:52,401
As for everything else,

380
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,681
I don't want to think about it.

381
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:57,241
Look at her—

382
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:58,481
so firm in her stance.

383
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:00,121
Such great guys chase her,

384
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,521
but she never wavers.

385
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:02,601
Unlike you.

386
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:03,841
Looking for a better option while settling.

387
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,880
But

388
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:08,121
whether I settle or search,

389
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,281
I can't find anyone at all.

390
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:23,681
Hello? What do you want?

391
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:25,681
Seriously.

392
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,241
Can you answer the phone
a bit more gently?

393
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:32,081
Wen Cheng, big bro.

394
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,680
Why are you calling me?

395
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:35,201
Forget it, forget it.

396
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,161
I'm not used to you
acting like this.

397
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,881
Isn't the new episode
going to discuss

398
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,441
the topic of modern women
and blind dates?

399
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,121
Your experiences
are pretty interesting.

400
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,081
Do you want to be
on my show?

401
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,320
Share some stories
and insights?

402
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:46,441
Wen Cheng.

403
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,081
You're rubbing salt
in my wound.

404
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,920
No way I'm going.

405
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,401
You have a wound?

406
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,721
If you don't take it to heart,
how could you get hurt?

407
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:53,521
Besides,

408
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:54,361
you could remind

409
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,401
the girls going on blind dates

410
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,321
not to rush into marriage
headfirst.

411
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't mistake jerks
for good guys.

412
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:02,361
Don't say I don't treat you well.

413
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,041
I'm giving you a chance
to return a favor,

414
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,281
and I have to pick
a restaurant.

415
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:06,121
I'll treat you to a meal.

416
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,321
That's not bad.

417
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:11,801
It's settled then.

418
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,921
Okay, bye.

419
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:19,001
Why did Wen Cheng
call you?

420
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,521
He wants me to help
with his show.

421
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,641
Share my blind date
experiences.

422
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,361
Yao Yuan has two handsome guys.

423
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,001
You have a love expert.

424
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:35,001
I'm the only one
with no clue.

425
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,721
You should be glad

426
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:38,641
your life is so peaceful.

427
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:40,641
No.

428
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:41,481
I don't want peace.

429
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,601
When you eat with Wen Cheng,

430
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:49,881
can you bring me along?

431
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:51,321
I'm free anyway.

432
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,161
Waiter.

433
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:09,241
Coffee.

434
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:13,241
Old Jiang.

435
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:14,561
Why are you looking for me?

436
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:17,041
If you want to mess around,
find someone else.

437
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,001
Don't bother Yao Yuan.

438
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:20,441
Who says I'm messing around?

439
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:21,721
I'm serious with you.

440
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:22,641
Don't joke around with me.

441
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,161
I'm serious too.

442
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,241
You think I don't know
how "serious" you are?

443
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,121
You're always just
into things for three minutes.

444
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,960
Yeah.

445
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,081
I used to

446
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
be a bit fickle.

447
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,720
But this time
it's really different.

448
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:43,521
Think about it.

449
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:45,441
I love being alone so much.

450
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:46,801
But for her,

451
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:48,921
I'd give up fun
to learn gaming.

452
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:50,401
And you crushed me
in the game.

453
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:53,081
I even became
a photography instructor.

454
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:54,961
Have you ever seen me

455
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,201
do this for any other girl?

456
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,001
You're just after novelty.

457
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,001
Chasing something new.

458
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:01,681
Let me tell you,

459
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,441
what I didn't say
on Wen Cheng's show—

460
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:05,361
Whenever I see Yao Yuan,

461
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,561
I feel a wave of calm inside.

462
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:09,481
When I recall her words,

463
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,720
it's like warmth
flows through me.

464
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:13,721
When I think of her face,

465
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:16,361
I feel like I can do anything.

466
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:19,241
You sure memorized
Wen Cheng's posts.

467
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,681
Yeah, it's Wen Cheng's posts.

468
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,201
But it's also
straight from my heart.

469
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,121
Old Jiang.

470
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,201
Let's compete fairly.

471
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:31,961
I won't compete fairly
with you.

472
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,521
When it comes to loving Yao Yuan,

473
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:34,721
no one can beat me.

474
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:36,041
Jiang Anlan.

475
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,281
I mean, usually,

476
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,801
so many girls
throw themselves at you.

477
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,281
Why are you so set
on Yao Yuan?

478
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:48,121
She saved me once.

479
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:49,641
I could never forget her.

480
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:51,481
Hey, classmate.

481
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,001
Are you okay now?

482
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:53,601
Classmate.

483
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:55,881
Don't worry.

484
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:58,001
I'll call an ambulance
for you right now.

485
00:20:58,521 --> 00:20:59,481
You'll be fine.

486
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:30,681
Yao Yuan.

487
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,241
Oh, I remember now.

488
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:36,281
I remember you.

489
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:36,961
Are you okay?

490
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,161
I'm fine.

491
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,201
Last time, it was all thanks to you.

492
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:41,961
Thank you.

493
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:42,921
No problem.

494
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:43,961
Glad you're better.

495
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:48,201
By the way,

496
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,921
this is the money
you lent me for medicine.

497
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:54,921
It was no trouble at all.

498
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,721
Didn't expect you'd
actually pay me back.

499
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,880
Thank you.

500
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll head out now.

501
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:02,081
Yao Yuan.

502
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:04,721
If you have time,

503
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:05,881
let me treat you
to a meal.

504
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,001
Treat me to a meal?

505
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:10,241
Yes.

506
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:12,201
If it weren't for you
last time,

507
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,521
I might've been done for.

508
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:15,321
I really need
to thank you.

509
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:16,761
Sure.

510
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,481
Just say what you want to eat,
don't be shy.

511
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,001
How about the place
across from school?

512
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:23,921
Want to go together?

513
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,041
Ah, no, no.

514
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:26,201
That place is expensive.

515
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:27,121
We're just students.

516
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:28,081
We don't have much money.

517
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,240
Let's just eat something simple.

518
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:30,761
Okay, I'll listen to you.

519
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,001
Then I'll pick a place.

520
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:33,481
Let's go.

521
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:34,201
Okay.

522
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,960
Why aren't you eating?

523
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:19,201
Honestly, I don't have
much appetite.

524
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:23,161
Here, you eat.

525
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:26,161
You eat.

526
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,441
I am eating.

527
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:30,721
But you're not in great health.

528
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,321
You should pay more attention
to nutrition.

529
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,361
If the food at the cafeteria
isn't good,

530
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,801
you can always

531
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,681
buy something you like
and cook at home.

532
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:40,441
You have to make yourself eat,
no matter what.

533
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:42,681
Okay.

534
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,680
I'll listen to you.

535
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,001
Because of what she said,

536
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:04,201
I started learning to cook.

537
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:04,801
Working out.

538
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,121
My health slowly improved.

539
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,641
Back then, I was just an ordinary person.

540
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:11,441
But Yao Yuan—

541
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:12,721
She was the campus beauty.

542
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,601
She was genuinely kind to everyone.

543
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,241
At that time, I thought,

544
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,441
I told myself I had to become

545
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:18,681
someone worthy of her.

546
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:21,641
Hey, wait, wait.

547
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:24,841
You said Yao Yuan was the campus beauty?

548
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,201
I was the campus hunk back then too!

549
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,920
Sounds like you peaked early, huh?

550
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:39,681
Hey, Jiang.

551
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,960
Listen,

552
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,521
You lacked confidence back then,

553
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:45,601
I get that.

554
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,321
But now,

555
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:51,121
why didn’t you confess to her?

556
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:53,641
You think I didn’t want to?

557
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:04,361
Yao Yuan,

558
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:07,321
You’re always in class or working.

559
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
Can your body handle this pace?

560
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,681
It’s fine, sis.

561
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:12,601
I want to keep myself busy.

562
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,081
That way, I won’t overthink things.

563
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,881
But you’re in college now.

564
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:18,841
You should enjoy campus life.

565
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,441
Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.

566
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,241
Got it, sis.

567
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,801
Hi, Yao Yuan. I’m Zhang Jie.

568
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:27,921
Hello. What’s up?

569
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:29,081
I wanted to ask—

570
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,480
After class today,

571
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:31,441
are you free?

572
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:32,521
I’d like to take you to a movie.

573
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:35,001
You’re trying to date our Yao Yuan, huh?

574
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,880
Yes.

575
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:36,841
Which department are you in?

576
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,840
Medical department.

577
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,161
No bad habits.

578
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,841
Likes basketball and playing violin.

579
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,481
How about giving him a chance?

580
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:50,201
Classmate,

581
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:51,801
Sorry,

582
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:54,441
I don’t want to date for a few years.

583
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:55,801
Besides studying,

584
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:57,961
I want to focus on other things.

585
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:00,401
You’re great, really outstanding.

586
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:02,241
But no matter who it is,

587
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:03,881
I wouldn’t accept.

588
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,401
Sorry.

589
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:07,401
Alright.

590
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:19,001
Later, I went to the US.

591
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:20,721
I thought, after a while,

592
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:22,121
everyone would meet new people.

593
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:23,961
But I didn’t expect

594
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,641
when I saw her again,

595
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,801
I just knew

596
00:27:01,841 --> 00:27:03,361
she was the one I’d been looking for.

597
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:06,921
So fate brought us together again

598
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,161
for a reason.

599
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,160
This time,

600
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:12,001
I worked so hard to find her.

601
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,081
Tried to enter her world.

602
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
Just so I wouldn’t miss her again.

603
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,721
I won’t let myself miss her again.

604
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:19,161
I get it.

605
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:21,321
I surrender.

606
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,680
No,

607
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:26,041
You went through so much

608
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:27,201
before falling for her.

609
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:28,881
I liked her at second sight.

610
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:30,761
So I think

611
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:31,961
I won’t lose.

612
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:33,841
Because I’m sincere too.

613
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,841
You’re really confident in yourself.

614
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:38,841
Yao Yuan truly is

615
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:40,201
a rare, wonderful girl.

616
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:41,241
Mm-hmm.

617
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,041
So, Jiang,

618
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,041
stop telling me to give up on her, okay?

619
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,281
She’s not just some shirt,

620
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:47,201
or a job.

621
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:49,041
She’s my new goal.

622
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,480
I can become better for her.

623
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,201
I admire your courage.

624
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:54,681
But you can’t beat me.

625
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,801
Yao Yuan’s heart has long been mine.

626
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,281
Love is full of surprises.

627
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:04,001
Until the end,

628
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:05,761
no one knows who’ll win.

629
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:08,361
Failure isn’t allowed in my world.

630
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,361
That’s your world.

631
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:12,961
Others can be indecisive in their world.

632
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:14,881
Yao Yuan isn’t like that.

633
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:16,241
That’s because she hasn’t met me yet.

634
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:24,281
Jiang,

635
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:27,881
I know you always win.

636
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:29,761
But—

637
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:32,121
Your reaction to my challenge

638
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:33,961
makes me think

639
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,081
maybe you have a bit of

640
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,480
uncertainty inside.

641
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,160
Although

642
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:45,521
I don’t know what it is either.

643
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:54,641
Jiang,

644
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:57,081
let’s compete fairly.

645
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:01,521
Love can’t tolerate any impurity.

646
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:03,041
I can’t promise

647
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:04,641
our rivalry will be gentlemanly.

648
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,001
I can’t promise that either.

649
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:14,161
Hold on.

650
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,921
Why does he look so good today?

651
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,441
Is it the color of his clothes or his hair?

652
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:39,561
Her outfit fits better than usual today.

653
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:42,001
Or are her heels one centimeter higher?

654
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:45,201
Her legs look extra long.

655
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:54,281
Apple martini.

656
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:55,321
I remember you like it.

657
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:57,441
You offer me a drink right away.

658
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:58,561
What’s your motive?

659
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:00,201
Didn’t want you to wait, so I ordered first.

660
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,241
You’re so guarded.

661
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:14,081
What a coincidence.

662
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:15,081
You’re here too?

663
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:16,441
Weren’t you looking for me?

664
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,321
Was I?

665
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:19,641
I was just passing by.

666
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,761
Since you’re here, join us.

667
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:22,721
Mm, okay.

668
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:30,121
You always put romance before friends.

669
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:35,241
Wen Cheng,

670
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:37,721
today,

671
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,921
you look really handsome.

672
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,401
Aren’t I always this handsome?

673
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:43,681
I ordered food first, hope you don’t mind.

674
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:45,521
Of course not.

675
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:46,761
I like

676
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,401
guys who always think of girls first.

677
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:50,441
Let’s eat.

678
00:30:59,081 --> 00:30:59,601
Your favorite food.

679
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:01,001
Thank you.

680
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:02,761
Xinran.

681
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:04,521
Wen Cheng treats you so well.

682
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,281
He just needs something from me.

683
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,601
By the way, Wen Cheng—

684
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:09,521
Go ahead, what do you want?

685
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:11,361
Okay.

686
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:14,121
I need to prep the outline before the show.

687
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:15,761
I want to formally ask you a few questions.

688
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,081
Someone as attractive as you,

689
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:20,241
who’s also independent in life—

690
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:22,521
what do you think are the pros and cons of blind dates?

691
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,561
When it comes to blind dates,

692
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:25,721
you’re asking the right person.

693
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:27,401
I’m a blind date expert.

694
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:30,161
I’ve met all types—tall, short, oddballs.

695
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:31,401
But still,

696
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:34,201
none as high-quality as you.

697
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:37,081
Xiaoya, you’re so honest.

698
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,921
I’m just afraid if I go, everyone will pick me.

699
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:41,761
Wouldn’t that ruin other guys’ happiness?

700
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:43,161
So,

701
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:44,441
I give up automatically.

702
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:45,721
Let others have a chance.

703
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:49,841
You go on blind dates to find true love.

704
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,361
If not for true love, what else?

705
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,601
Find a roommate?

706
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,281
There are many ways to fall in love.

707
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,521
Why must it be blind dates?

708
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:59,321
Society values efficiency now.

709
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:00,761
Blind dates are like job interviews.

710
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:02,041
If it’s not a match, just delete.

711
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:03,281
No time wasted,

712
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,761
no stress about rejecting people.

713
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,521
Didn’t you oppose blind dates before?

714
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:09,161
Why are you so talkative now?

715
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,121
Can’t I be flexible?

716
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:13,561
I’m not like Xinran.

717
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,601
I believe

718
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:18,321
my true love is truly lost.

719
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:19,841
So I have to

720
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,401
search through the crowd.

721
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:22,281
Him.

722
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:24,801
Don’t you think

723
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:26,601
blind dates are just two lonely people

724
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:27,721
trying to comfort each other?

725
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:29,521
Maybe so.

726
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:30,681
But

727
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:32,601
what woman doesn’t want a good home?

728
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:34,641
Doesn’t want to be cared for?

729
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,801
But I’ve realized,

730
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:41,401
fate is right beside me.

731
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:43,001
Ah.

732
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:45,041
Before,

733
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:46,641
I always messed around with Baihua Tang and you.

734
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,521
Looking back, that was silly.

735
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,321
You’re so handsome yourself.

736
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:52,761
Why did I always look elsewhere?

737
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,321
Why not look in Tianxia Bang?

738
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,921
Xiaoya, cheers to you.

739
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:01,481
Speaking of Tianxia Bang,

740
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:02,681
have you played games lately?

741
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:04,601
I think

742
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,481
we could grind dungeons together.

743
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,001
Sure, I’ll heal you.

744
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,481
It’s still early.

745
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:13,281
How about

746
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:14,681
we go somewhere else for another drink?

747
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:15,841
You’re already this drunk,

748
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:16,681
and still want more?

749
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:17,561
Let’s go, let’s go.

750
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:24,961
The weather changes so fast.

751
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,201
It’s freezing!

752
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,281
Put this on.

753
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:32,121
Don’t catch a cold.

754
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,281
Xinran, thank you.

755
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:40,321
Ah.

756
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:41,401
Look at me, so forgetful.

757
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:42,521
I forgot I need to take Yao Xinran

758
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:44,241
to our company for a show rehearsal.

759
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:45,041
Xiaoya.

760
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:45,841
Let’s drink next time.

761
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:47,601
Ah.

762
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:50,001
A rehearsal this late?

763
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:54,841
Xiaoya.

764
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,001
Then you head home first.

765
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:56,921
Be careful, okay?

766
00:33:57,641 --> 00:33:58,401
But—

767
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,161
I want to go to the production company too.

768
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,721
Since I was little,

769
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:02,881
I’ve never been.

770
00:34:03,881 --> 00:34:04,401
Xiaoya.

771
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:05,401
It’s not that I won’t let you go.

772
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:06,041
It’s just

773
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:08,281
unreleased content must stay secret.

774
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,160
Unrelated people are kept out.

775
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:11,721
I see.

776
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:14,441
Alright then.

777
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:15,641
I’ll head home now.

778
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,001
You should go home early too.

779
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,401
It’s cold and dark outside.

780
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:22,641
Next time,

781
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,561
we must drink together.

782
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,561
Definitely.

783
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:27,401
Bye.

784
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,200
Bye.

785
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:29,921
Take care.

786
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:30,921
Call me when you get home.

787
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:34,921
Wen Cheng.

788
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,401
What are you up to?

789
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,801
You’re the one up to something.

790
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,081
What’s up with Li Xiaoya?

791
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:40,081
Possessed by Pikachu.

792
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,041
Sparking nonstop.

793
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,201
How are you not fried yet?

794
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:43,321
No,

795
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:44,161
I’m really scared of

796
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,481
women with love deficiency syndrome.

797
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,881
Desperate for male hormones.

798
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,281
Don’t talk about her like that.

799
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,601
Everyone wants to fall in love.

800
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:02,361
Let’s go.

801
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,481
Where do you live?

802
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:04,081
I’ll walk you home.

803
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:05,641
No need.

804
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:06,721
I can get home myself.

805
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:07,881
Also,

806
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:08,641
Here, take this back.

807
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:09,961
I’m leaving. Bye.

808
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,241
A man doesn’t even know to walk you home.

809
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,321
So clueless.

810
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:30,201
What’s wrong?

811
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:33,961
I don’t like you getting close to other men.

812
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:39,281
You mean Su Wen?

813
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,481
You don’t trust me, do you?

814
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
It’s not that I don’t trust you.

815
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:48,721
It’s just

816
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,561
I get annoyed when other men look at you.

817
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:53,361
When you talk to other men,

818
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,601
I get even more upset.

819
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:02,681
I'm super jealous by nature.

820
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,681
I wish I could be with you
twenty-four hours a day.

821
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,080
I won't let any man get close to you.

822
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:10,881
You're so possessive.

823
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:14,401
Isn't Jun Lin Tian Xia famous
for being domineering?

824
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:16,881
Su Wen

825
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:19,641
I don't mind you giving a lecture there.

826
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:21,721
But you

827
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,561
have to tell me in advance.

828
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,281
Okay.

829
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:28,041
I'll do as you say.

830
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:49,681
Baby.

831
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:51,401
Let's drink.

832
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:54,921
What are you looking at?

833
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,361
A game.

834
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,521
I thought you were working.

835
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:01,961
Turns out you're gaming.

836
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:04,281
What are you doing?

837
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,201
What am I doing?

838
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:08,041
Su Wen

839
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:10,081
Do you want the game or me?

840
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:11,441
The game.

841
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:13,161
Say that again.

842
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,801
Ask me ten times,

843
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:15,841
I'll still choose the game.

844
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:21,521
Give me the key.

845
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,920
You're breaking up with me over a game?

846
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:26,921
It's not about the game.

847
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:28,641
It's about respect.

848
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:33,921
Alright.

849
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,281
I was wrong this time.

850
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,601
I won't do it again.

851
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:39,881
Don't be mad, okay?

852
00:37:41,681 --> 00:37:42,321
Toward you,

853
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,081
I don't feel anything anymore.

854
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:48,681
Okay.

855
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,241
Su Wen

856
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,481
You don't understand love at all.

857
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,441
Treating me like this,

858
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,641
you'll never have a good relationship.

859
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:08,201
Wen Cheng looks pretty handsome on TV.

860
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:10,441
He looks different from usual.

861
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:11,121
Right?

862
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,281
Hey, did you guys watch Wen Cheng's

863
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,641
latest episode?

864
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:17,121
Of course.

865
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,001
Wen Cheng even quoted me

866
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,441
on the show.

867
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:20,481
So this time,

868
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:21,761
I'm going to seize the chance.

869
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,201
What do you think I should do

870
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,400
to win his heart?

871
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:26,601
Asia

872
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:27,841
You're interested in him?

873
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah.

874
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:30,721
Water Fairy

875
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:31,921
Help me out, please.

876
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:35,601
How can I help you?

877
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,761
I'm not close to him.

878
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:39,521
How come?

879
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:40,761
You two seem pretty friendly.

880
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:42,641
Do you know

881
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:43,801
his zodiac sign?

882
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,081
Where does he live?

883
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:47,281
What kind of girls does he like?

884
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:49,041
What are his hobbies?

885
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:50,001
Blossom

886
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:50,921
Doraemon

887
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,041
Let's go grind dungeons.

888
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:53,561
Sure, let's go.

889
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:30,921
Darn it.

890
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,481
Why are you taking advantage
of me now?

891
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,321
I thought you'd thank me
for saving you.

892
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:46,721
Didn't expect you to be ungrateful.

893
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,201
You...

894
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:48,521
Next week,

895
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:49,761
I want to ask Wen Cheng
to see a movie.

896
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,481
Can you help me ask him?

897
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:53,881
Why don't you ask him yourself?

898
00:39:58,401 --> 00:39:59,561
I'm shy.

899
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:01,321
Like last time at dinner,

900
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:02,201
he teased you,

901
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:04,001
but gave you all the shrimp.

902
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:05,521
He didn't eat any himself.

903
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,401
A good guy like that,

904
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:08,761
I have to seize the chance.

905
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,601
I'll help you ask.

906
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:20,441
But I can't promise he'll go.

907
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:22,641
Yay!

908
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:23,881
Love you the most!

909
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:33,201
Why are you acting so weird today?

910
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:34,641
It's all because of you.

911
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:36,201
Are you free next week?

912
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:40,721
If you want to ask me out,
just say it.

913
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:43,321
It's not me asking you out.

914
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:44,521
Li Xiaoya wants to see a movie
with you.

915
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,241
Oh.

916
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:52,521
Sure.

917
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:58,681
You agreed!

918
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:01,800
So?

919
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:02,961
You don't want me to go?

920
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:04,561
Why wouldn't I?

921
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:05,481
Go if you want to.

922
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:06,481
I'm logging off.

923
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,721
Looks like you're pondering
some big truth.

924
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,681
Stop filming.

925
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:56,681
You're making me uncomfortable.

926
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,481
Planner Yao

927
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:01,721
I didn't mean for you to notice.

928
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:02,801
See, I switched to a telephoto lens.

929
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:04,241
So I could stay far away.

930
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:05,961
If I noticed you,

931
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,961
you weren't far enough.

932
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,241
Sorry, Planner Yao.

933
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:10,881
But as a photographer,

934
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:11,681
what I want is

935
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:12,841
that kind of

936
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,961
unretouched shot.

937
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,081
I'll leave the judging to you.

938
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:30,041
But watch out for the timing.

939
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:31,481
No problem.

940
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:32,961
Alright, thanks.
