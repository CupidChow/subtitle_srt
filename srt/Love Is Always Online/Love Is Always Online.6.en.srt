1
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,841
You finally called.

2
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,480
Ah.

3
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,841
I was a bit busy just now.

4
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:49,801
What's wrong?

5
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,361
Sorry.

6
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,001
I haven't contacted you these days.

7
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:57,241
It's fine.

8
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,641
Take care of your own things.

9
00:01:59,161 --> 00:01:59,841
I have something to do.

10
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:02,281
I need to make it up to you.

11
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:04,841
Make it up?

12
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:07,001
What do you need to make up for?

13
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,161
You didn't do anything wrong.

14
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:09,441
I did.

15
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,801
I shouldn't have let you be there alone.

16
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:16,601
But...

17
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,560
You made mistakes too.

18
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,441
I did?

19
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,321
What did I do?

20
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,201
Hello?

21
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:52,241
Why are you here?

22
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,681
I don't know.

23
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,521
It's not my business.

24
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,441
Let's go.

25
00:02:58,481 --> 00:02:59,281
We should leave quickly.

26
00:02:59,321 --> 00:02:59,921
Hurry up.

27
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:00,801
Go down.

28
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:12,881
From the moment we met,

29
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,601
I was already a CEO.

30
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:17,681
You should know

31
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:18,961
I don't care about those people.

32
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,521
Especially women who use designer bags

33
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,681
to boost their own status.

34
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:22,681
I don't want to date them.

35
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,641
You're not like that.

36
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:27,161
So you should trust me.

37
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,121
Maybe

38
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:39,961
we need more time

39
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:41,521
to get to know each other.

40
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:43,361
When I first met you,

41
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:44,441
you were Jiang Anlan.

42
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:46,961
But for me,

43
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,041
I still need time to adjust.

44
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,401
Can you let me think about it more?

45
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:58,761
Okay.

46
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:00,721
I'll wait for you.

47
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:50,561
Boss.

48
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:52,361
Come in.

49
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,521
Here are some contracts.

50
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,401
Please take a look.

51
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:05,801
They all agreed.

52
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:06,401
Yes.

53
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,561
Especially Jiang Hai.

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,480
You know

55
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,321
these past few months,

56
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,961
Jiang Hai has been our biggest target.

57
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,801
He finally accepted our terms.

58
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:13,801
Congratulations, boss.

59
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,441
While I was away,

60
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,881
you all did pretty well.

61
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,240
Boss.

62
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,161
Boss.

63
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,201
Welcome back, boss.

64
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,361
While you were on leave,

65
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,841
everyone knew you worked hard.

66
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,401
And that you got sick because of the company.

67
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:35,361
So we worked even harder.

68
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:36,401
To be

69
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:37,561
your strongest support.

70
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,121
Don't think

71
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,361
I'll give you all a break.

72
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:47,521
Get back to work.

73
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:52,361
You too.

74
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:54,281
I'll get busy now.

75
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:26,601
Are you feeling better?

76
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:27,841
Much better.

77
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,881
No need to send more supplements.

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,920
No need.

79
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:33,521
There's already too much at home.

80
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,881
There's a company meeting today.

81
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,761
Prepare your proposal well.

82
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:40,681
If there's any result,

83
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:41,961
send me a message.

84
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:43,041
Okay.

85
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:44,521
I'll wait to celebrate with you.

86
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:45,641
Mm.

87
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:51,561
Vice President.

88
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,281
Meeting's starting.

89
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,081
Okay.

90
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,361
This needs to be settled right away.

91
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:01,881
Can't wait.

92
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:02,361
Okay.

93
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:02,801
Okay.

94
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:03,441
Got it.

95
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:07,601
An Cheng.

96
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,401
Jiang Anlan

97
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,281
didn't come to the meeting today.

98
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:11,721
He had something to do today.

99
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,481
All his opinions are in the proposal.

100
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:17,041
We have high hopes for this project.

101
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,961
The analysis must be thorough.

102
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:20,961
An Cheng's attention to detail

103
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:21,881
is of course not a problem.

104
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,081
Plus Jiang Anlan's

105
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,081
unconventional thinking.

106
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:27,801
Mm.

107
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,001
It's worth looking forward to.

108
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:31,201
Take your seats.

109
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:32,921
Sit down.

110
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,921
Let's look at the risk assessment first

111
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,961
and investment returns.

112
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,761
The sample survey collected

113
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:42,961
data since the company was founded.

114
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:50,761
Yao Yuan

115
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,001
Look at you, all lost and down.

116
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,241
Still haven't made up with Jiang Anlan?

117
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,321
It's not that bad.

118
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:01,321
Oh, right.

119
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,041
Have you recently

120
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,281
found any temp jobs to recommend?

121
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,201
Could you introduce me to one?

122
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,041
The place where I work

123
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:06,801
is actually short-staffed.

124
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:07,761
Want me to ask for you?

125
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:08,681
Hey.

126
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,001
What kind of job is it?

127
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:11,481
It's the restaurant at a hotel.

128
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:12,641
They're really short on temps.

129
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,481
Forget about Jiang Anlan for now.

130
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,761
Who knows,

131
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,121
we might run into some executives on business trips.

132
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:19,721
Maybe they'll even chat us up.

133
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:20,961
You know me, right?

134
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,081
Yeah, I know.

135
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,361
Let me put it another way.

136
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:26,121
Let your worries fade away

137
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:28,041
with your sweat as you work hard.

138
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:29,641
Alright.

139
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,601
Come on, work with me.

140
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:36,801
Yao Yuan

141
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:39,601
Sorry about this.

142
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:40,521
I really didn't know

143
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,720
they only needed one person.

144
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,201
I asked the manager to split the gardener job with me,

145
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,201
but he said

146
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,601
I've worked as a waitress before,

147
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:47,481
so he trusts me more.

148
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:48,561
It's fine.

149
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,161
Getting some sun is good anyway.

150
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:51,961
But...

151
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:52,801
Darn it.

152
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:54,401
It's really okay.

153
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:56,081
I'm earning more than you, actually.

154
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:56,921
It's a good deal.

155
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,561
Alright, alright.

156
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,401
It's not like we're going to war.

157
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:04,121
Digging won't kill anyone.

158
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,241
Let's get to work.

159
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:36,881
Hey, girl.

160
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,001
Your phone's ringing.

161
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:40,641
It's fine.

162
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,361
With arms so thin,

163
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,681
I didn't expect

164
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,921
you'd be so willing to work.

165
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,160
Is that your boyfriend calling?

166
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:52,801
No, it's not.

167
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,041
Darn it.

168
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,441
Someone as pretty as you

169
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,081
shouldn't have trouble.

170
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:00,121
Why do you make yourself

171
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:01,161
work so hard?

172
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,521
Money you earn yourself

173
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
feels more secure to spend.

174
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,321
At least he

175
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,921
called you all morning.

176
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:20,401
What about you?

177
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,521
Just ask him

178
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,680
if he needs anything.

179
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,641
It's just polite.

180
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,361
If I answer,

181
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,481
he'll ask what I'm doing.

182
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,561
I'll say I'm working.

183
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,121
Then he'll ask why I'm working.

184
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,241
I'll say I need to earn money.

185
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,641
So then,

186
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,281
is he supposed to give me money?

187
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,841
Nothing wrong with him giving you money.

188
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,481
Just think of it

189
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,481
as wealth redistribution.

190
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,361
I really want to introduce my son

191
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,561
to you.

192
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:52,561
Actually, I quite enjoy

193
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:53,761
doing this kind of work.

194
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:57,481
Looking at all these flowers and plants

195
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:00,081
really lifts my mood.

196
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:04,121
Looks like my son

197
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:04,881
doesn't stand a chance.

198
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,241
Don't worry.

199
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:13,761
Life

200
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:14,801
always finds a way.

201
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,241
See these flowers and plants?

202
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,001
No matter how tightly you press them down,

203
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,761
one day they'll break through the soil.

204
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,161
It's just outputting pixels.

205
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:39,681
It's the image generated by values.

206
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:40,801
It's the pixel value.

207
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:42,921
Sister Yao

208
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:46,761
Do you want to go

209
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:47,961
to Su Wen's photo exhibition lately?

210
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:50,281
I feel like your mood

211
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:51,321
has been a bit...

212
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:54,281
Zhang He means

213
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,441
you've been in a great mood lately.

214
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:57,361
Yeah, that's right.

215
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,681
Want to go to the exhibition with us?

216
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,081
Yeah.

217
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,521
I want to go too.

218
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,440
But those tickets

219
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:03,321
just went on sale,

220
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:04,281
and were sold out instantly, right?

221
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,081
Hey, Sister Yao,

222
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:08,401
I happen to have a friend

223
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,081
who can't make it.

224
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,001
So you

225
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:10,881
should come with us.

226
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:11,961
Please?

227
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,721
Just come with us.

228
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:14,921
We'll be so bored if you don't go.

229
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,961
No one will tell us fun stories.

230
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,121
Yeah, even though it's my whole month's food money.

231
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:19,961
Get outta here.

232
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,041
Talking about money is so tacky.

233
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,081
Why are we even going?

234
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,401
To cultivate our taste.

235
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,561
Look at Sister Yao,

236
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:26,521
then look at yourself.

237
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,201
Alright, I'll go.

238
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:30,721
How much is it?

239
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:31,441
I'll transfer it to you.

240
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:32,881
Okay.

241
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,521
Let's talk then, Sister Yao.

242
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:36,601
Darn it.

243
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,401
You guys keep chatting.

244
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,321
I have to go to work.

245
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:40,521
See you tomorrow, Planner Yao.

246
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
Bye, bye.

247
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:53,761
All along,

248
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,201
I've really liked your work.

249
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:57,401
But this exhibition

250
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:58,761
is quite expensive.

251
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:00,801
For those who love your work

252
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:02,601
but can't afford tickets,

253
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:03,841
it's a real shame.

254
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:09,521
I've already planted for you

255
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,360
nine hundred ninety.

256
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:18,081
Baby.

257
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,081
Ah.

258
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:19,841
Be good.

259
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:20,601
Eat by yourself.

260
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,121
What's wrong?

261
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:22,921
I'm busy.

262
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,841
I'll eat later.

263
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:24,761
Hmph.

264
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:25,961
Eat on your own.

265
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,521
Ticket price reflects

266
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,840
an artist's value.

267
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,641
If you really think so,

268
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,800
then world-famous paintings

269
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,161
should be in parks

270
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,161
for everyone to enjoy,

271
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:44,521
not in museums, right?

272
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,801
I mean no offense.

273
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,881
I just hope you don't forget

274
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,721
your original intent as an artist.

275
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,761
Why is it always about money?

276
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,041
There's no value at all.

277
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,801
You know my intent?

278
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:11,281
Who is it?

279
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:13,921
Don't know them.

280
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:15,241
Alright.

281
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,240
Ah.

282
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:16,961
Ah.

283
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,400
Is it tasty?

284
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,361
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

285
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,041
Who is this?

286
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,441
Him.

287
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:36,681
His name is Jiang Anlan.

288
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,681
You want to see this photo exhibit, right?

289
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:44,441
Yeah.

290
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,121
Then why are you just standing here?

291
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,361
So many photos over there, not looking.

292
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,921
Why are you following us around?

293
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:50,321
Got it.

294
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:51,961
Let's go.

295
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:02,641
Have you decided?

296
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,561
Not yet.

297
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:09,521
Then stop thinking about it.

298
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,401
Why are you here?

299
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,201
This exhibit

300
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,121
was organized by me for Su Wen.

301
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,761
I'm his sponsor.

302
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,281
You're the one who discovered him.

303
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:23,841
What do you mean, discovered?

304
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:25,841
Once, he

305
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,481
said in an interview

306
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:30,121
he was a magazine photographer,

307
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:32,281
shooting ads.

308
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:33,881
But someone appreciated him,

309
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,921
gave him a year

310
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,001
to do nothing else,

311
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:37,281
just focus on photography.

312
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:41,121
What's with that look?

313
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,361
Isn't that how it was?

314
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:43,641
Yes.

315
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,481
But it's not as dramatic as you say.

316
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,241
It's not just helping him.

317
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:48,881
It's helping myself too.

318
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,001
It's an investment, after all.

319
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:53,601
But

320
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:55,001
My lady,

321
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,241
you know other men so well,

322
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:58,241
I'm a little upset.

323
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:17,841
Where are you?

324
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:19,721
I'm either heading to the expo

325
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:21,161
or on the way there.

326
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,281
Which road?

327
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,161
How much longer?

328
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,001
You'll see me when I arrive.

329
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:28,121
Is this the time for wordplay?

330
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,921
Don't you know artists nowadays

331
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,761
can't multitask easily?

332
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,241
If I talk to you,

333
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,201
I have to stop walking to do it.

334
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:40,961
Hello?

335
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,121
What are you doing?

336
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:43,761
Answer me.

337
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,281
I don't like your slow replies.

338
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:48,761
Tell Jiang Anlan

339
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:50,401
I'm not coming.

340
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:51,521
What?

341
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:18,721
Hello.

342
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:20,481
I'm Su Wen, a photographer.

343
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,041
I specialize in capturing

344
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,441
life's beautiful moments.

345
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Would you

346
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,321
be my model?

347
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,001
Beautiful moments, huh?

348
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Photographing your ex on the street

349
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,361
and not recognizing her,

350
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,441
that's pretty beautiful.

351
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,041
Ah.

352
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,121
Oh.

353
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,201
You were at Old Wu's birthday party,

354
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,241
the one selling jewelry.

355
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,160
We met at a bar.

356
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,921
You tricked me with magic.

357
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:48,161
Made me give up on that

358
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,721
super popular relationship expert.

359
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,561
And you dumped me in seven days.

360
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,201
Now you don't recognize me, huh?

361
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,441
Hey, hey, hey.

362
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:57,361
Two hits are enough.

363
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,441
It's been so long.

364
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:00,521
People

365
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:01,921
should look forward.

366
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:06,801
You jerk.

367
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:13,801
Hey.

368
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:14,881
Bye.

369
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,760
Boss.

370
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,320
Su Wen hung up on me.

371
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:26,601
Again.

372
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,760
What's wrong?

373
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,601
Su Wen's not coming.

374
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:33,761
Isn't this his exhibit?

375
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:35,641
He says I discovered him.

376
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,281
But I only like his work.

377
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:38,441
I really dislike him.

378
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,641
But the work is made by the person.

379
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:41,881
So now when I see his work,

380
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:42,881
I just get angry.

381
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:46,561
Stay here.

382
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:48,881
I have to go on stage and speak for him.

383
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:01,281
Hello, everyone.

384
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,401
I'm Jiang Anlan.

385
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,361
Su Wen really wanted to be here today.

386
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:13,041
But as everyone knows,

387
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,081
an artist

388
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
often has a heart

389
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,481
that refuses to be restrained.

390
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,001
Their lives,

391
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,561
usually take a path

392
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,441
ordinary people can't reach.

393
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,801
I think that's why he can create

394
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:28,601
so many outstanding works.

395
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:30,561
So today,

396
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,641
I'll be opening on his behalf.

397
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:35,721
Three years ago,

398
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,361
I happened to see in a magazine

399
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,281
an ad he shot for a sports drink.

400
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,881
On a beach,

401
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:45,921
a striking model held the drink

402
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:48,481
and gave a radiant smile to the camera.

403
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,441
I thought it was an image that

404
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,161
would delight anyone who saw it.

405
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:56,041
But behind the model,

406
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,081
on the sand lay

407
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,640
a carelessly discarded plastic bottle.

408
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,201
That bottle in the shot

409
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,321
looked extremely out of place.

410
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:06,561
But it also highlighted a satire of fashion

411
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:07,881
and a concern for the environment.

412
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:10,681
I'm glad I could see what he

413
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,601
wanted to convey

414
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,841
through his work to everyone.

415
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,881
Actually, maybe he

416
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,121
isn't what you imagine

417
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:19,601
an artist should be.

418
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,921
Testing, one two three.

419
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:24,521
Testing.

420
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,041
Let's give a warm welcome

421
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,201
to photographer Su Wen.

422
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:33,321
Hello, everyone.

423
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:34,681
I'm Su Wen.

424
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:36,881
But

425
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:37,721
I still want to clarify

426
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:39,881
about that plastic bottle.

427
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:41,761
The reason I didn't edit it out

428
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,001
was because the company

429
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,761
only paid me half my fee.

430
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:46,921
I was so mad,

431
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,561
I sent it off halfway through editing.

432
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:52,841
What,

433
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,561
my joke

434
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:55,241
wasn't funny?

435
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,080
But I won't deny

436
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:00,761
that as a photographer,

437
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,961
I have a certain instinct.

438
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:03,561
I know what belongs

439
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,001
in this world,

440
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,961
and what

441
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:08,401
should never happen.

442
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,601
Some beauty in this world,

443
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,641
I even think capturing it

444
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:14,721
is a kind of blasphemy.

445
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:17,161
What your eyes see

446
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:19,241
is what's real.

447
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,481
Just like

448
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:23,521
this young lady.

449
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:25,921
Who are you talking about?

450
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:29,321
But

451
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,320
I still want to try to capture that beauty.

452
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,361
I want more people to see it,

453
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,721
to spread it even further.

454
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,481
Mr. Su, Mr. Su!

455
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:42,281
We haven't finished shooting yet.

456
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:43,201
Don't block us.

457
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:53,361
Aren't you going to help him?

458
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,801
No way, I'm not going.

459
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:56,681
Serves him right.

460
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:00,081
But what if he gets mad?

461
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,561
If he blows up later,

462
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:03,961
your investment...

463
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:13,201
Everyone,

464
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,681
that's enough, that's enough.

465
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:18,161
Su Wen should shoot with Boss Jiang.

466
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:19,241
That's how the shot looks best.

467
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:22,281
Yeah, take a few more photos.

468
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,320
Take more shots.

469
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,281
Might not get another chance.

470
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:29,801
True.

471
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:32,161
Business moves fast.

472
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:34,641
The new always replaces the old.

473
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,321
I'm still standing strong in photography.

474
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:40,841
Jiang has drifted off to who knows where.

475
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:43,801
I mean,

476
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,001
maybe you need a new sponsor.

477
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,281
I mean,

478
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,681
maybe I don't need a sponsor anymore.

479
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,640
Planner Yao.

480
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:14,401
Sis, sis!

481
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,161
This is so much fun.

482
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:16,361
Yeah, I think today's buffet

483
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:18,161
is the fanciest I've ever seen.

484
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:19,081
It's amazing.

485
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:22,161
What do you think of this piece?

486
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:23,921
It's pretty good.

487
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,201
The kid's smile is so bright.

488
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:26,801
I think so too.

489
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:27,601
Especially

490
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:28,641
the child's smile

491
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:29,761
with those flowers

492
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:30,961
is a perfect match.

493
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:34,161
I just think the smile is too bright.

494
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:36,681
What do you mean?

495
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:39,561
It just feels like

496
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,161
she's posing,

497
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:43,441
not really wanting to smile.

498
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,321
No way.

499
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:47,801
I think

500
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,521
if a handsome photographer shot me,

501
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,241
I'd be grinning ear to ear too.

502
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:55,081
Still, I feel

503
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,440
compared to his earlier works,

504
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:57,761
it's less authentic.

505
00:23:58,961 --> 00:23:59,721
He was never

506
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:00,881
a truly genuine person.

507
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:09,801
Maybe she didn't eat enough?

508
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:10,801
Let's go, let's go.

509
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:11,641
I'm full.

510
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,080
Where are we going?

511
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:18,521
I won't leave you again today.

512
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:25,681
So,

513
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:27,601
feels pretty good, right?

514
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:30,881
The atmosphere is nice.

515
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:32,521
The setup is great too.

516
00:24:34,321 --> 00:24:35,761
I just don't know

517
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,240
when art

518
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:39,281
became so out of reach.

519
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,280
What do you mean?

520
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,121
Look at the people here—

521
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:49,481
how many truly care

522
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,841
about these artworks?

523
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:53,321
Maybe what they want

524
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:55,601
is just to be in this setting.

525
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:02,361
Actually, I think it's a bit of both.

526
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:05,401
They understand what it means to be here.

527
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,401
There are many ways to show your status.

528
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,121
But they all chose the photo exhibition.

529
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,520
I guess it's because of photography—

530
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:13,721
they still have some passion for it.

531
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:17,121
But art is pure.

532
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,841
It's a pursuit of life and beauty.

533
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,121
It's not for the wealthy

534
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:24,361
to use as a tool to show off their status.

535
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:26,441
Then next time, I'll hold one in the park—

536
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:27,681
a free exhibition, how about that?

537
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:29,881
You'd really do it just because I said so?

538
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:30,961
Of course.

539
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:32,561
I'd hold an exhibition just for you.

540
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,201
Who is this?

541
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:37,081
Why don't you introduce me?

542
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:38,881
My girlfriend.

543
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:39,761
Yao Yuan.

544
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:41,841
You have a girlfriend now?

545
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:42,681
Yeah.

546
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,241
You really have your work cut out for you.

547
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:53,761
Dealing with someone as tough as Jiang—

548
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:55,801
it's not easy.

549
00:25:58,521 --> 00:25:59,081
Miss Yao.

550
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,841
Since you're here,

551
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:02,881
why don't you tell us—

552
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,201
how do you feel about my work?

553
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:05,321
Any thoughts?

554
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,241
I prefer your earlier works.

555
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:11,401
Why is that?

556
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:15,841
The pieces in this exhibition—

557
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,281
I don't see

558
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:21,201
Su Wen's passion as an artist.

559
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,641
I only see Su Wen, the celebrity.

560
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:25,921
Using his skills

561
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:27,281
to please the audience.

562
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,560
Isn't creating art about making people happy?

563
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:34,081
But you should be happy too.

564
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,081
When you took these photos,

565
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,960
were you happy?

566
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:39,721
When you shot that

567
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:41,441
photo of the smiling child,

568
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:43,081
did you smile too?

569
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,320
I still prefer

570
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,680
your earlier works.

571
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:53,361
They feel sincere to me.

572
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:57,001
Not so much flashy packaging.

573
00:26:57,801 --> 00:26:58,961
But they touch people more deeply.

574
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:01,721
Oh.

575
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:02,641
So you're the one

576
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:04,521
who commented under my Weibo post.

577
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:07,641
Miss Yao.

578
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,441
Seems you have some insight into art.

579
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,600
Of course.

580
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:15,521
She's a top-notch exhibition planner.

581
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:18,841
She's serious this time.

582
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:24,161
Su Wen.

583
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:28,761
Jiang, help me out here.

584
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:32,521
You, come out here.

585
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:36,401
Everyone, let's judge this!

586
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:38,561
Su Wen pretended to shoot photos

587
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,681
to trick me into dating him.

588
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:41,921
He said I'd be famous as his model.

589
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,040
And now?

590
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:46,121
Are you upset about being lied to,

591
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:47,721
or that you didn't get famous?

592
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,001
If it's about not being famous,

593
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:51,641
you can't blame him for everything.

594
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:52,961
Maybe reflect on yourself too.

595
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:54,801
Who are you, anyway?

596
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,561
Does this concern you?

597
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,161
I'm his boss.

598
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,281
Do you think I have the right to speak for him?

599
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,761
You're all in cahoots.

600
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,721
When have you ever seen

601
00:28:03,761 --> 00:28:05,321
a snake and a rat in the same nest?

602
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:05,801
You—

603
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:07,961
Then tell me,

604
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:10,121
why did he promise me before shooting

605
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,881
that I'd get famous just by undressing?

606
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:19,881
That's obviously not true.

607
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,721
That's called slander.

608
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:26,961
I trust Su Wen.

609
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,921
Because he once said,

610
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,401
even for art,

611
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,920
you shouldn't sacrifice too much.

612
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,521
Even for fashion magazines,

613
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,881
he won't shoot overly exposed models.

614
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,321
Don't believe her, everyone.

615
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,200
She's making it all up.

616
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:50,041
She and I

617
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:51,601
only talked on WeChat.

618
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,361
I still have the chat logs.

619
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:55,681
Do you want to see them?

620
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,161
Yes!

621
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,441
What's going on here?

622
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:03,641
Hey, don't damage the artwork!

623
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:08,961
Touch her and you'll be in trouble.

624
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:09,641
Security!

625
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:10,681
Please leave the venue.

626
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:12,041
What are you doing?

627
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:13,841
Su Wen, you bastard!

628
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:14,641
I'm not done with you.

629
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:15,321
Bye.

630
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:29,321
So handsome!

631
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:31,161
How can someone be this handsome?

632
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:34,561
Can you two keep it down?

633
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,761
It's a closed space.

634
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:37,441
People can hear you.

635
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,321
None of your business.

636
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:41,441
Is the air conditioning okay?

637
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:42,001
My lady.

638
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:43,081
What?

639
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:43,601
My lady.

640
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:45,881
Planner Yao.

641
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:49,161
The rumor about your marriage is true.

642
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:51,241
So jealous, so jealous!

643
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:52,481
How did this happen?

644
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:54,201
It's not what you think.

645
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:56,041
It is exactly what you think.

646
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,481
What happened with Su Wen today—

647
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:24,961
did it scare you?

648
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,561
Maybe I expected too much.

649
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,481
But in this era,

650
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,641
with commercial operations,

651
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:36,521
artists do change a bit.

652
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:37,681
I can understand that.

653
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:39,561
Well,

654
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:41,921
our investors will pay more attention next time.

655
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,001
Promise me—

656
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:50,921
no matter what happens,

657
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:52,641
you can't ignore my calls.

658
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:53,881
And don't avoid me anymore.

659
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,081
I'm heading back now.

660
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:05,241
No.

661
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:06,801
You haven't answered my question.

662
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:07,801
I'm not letting you leave.

663
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,241
It's fine now.

664
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:17,561
All right.

665
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,041
Many friends who came today

666
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:23,841
all know you're my girlfriend now.

667
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:26,441
I want to send them wedding invites right away.

668
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:31,121
We got married in the game,

669
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:32,921
not in real life.

670
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:35,441
My lady.

671
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:38,921
As long as it's something Jiang Anlan decides,

672
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:39,961
whether it's real or not,

673
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,281
I'll make it real.

674
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,881
And I'm serious about you.

675
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:46,641
I like you.

676
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,041
I like the way you talk.

677
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,521
I like everything about you.

678
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,601
I'm heading back now.

679
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:28,361
You're back.

680
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:29,401
Ah.

681
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:31,161
I saw everything.

682
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,521
Jiang Anlan brought you back, right?

683
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,561
We just happened to meet at the photo exhibit.

684
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:38,401
Then he gave me a ride home.

685
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:39,481
Just happened to.

686
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:41,521
Or was it really just happened to?

687
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:43,721
You two made up?

688
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:45,121
I...

689
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,281
Your hesitation means you agree.

690
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:51,121
When someone is

691
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:52,441
completely lost over another,

692
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,001
that's love.

693
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,881
You're this upset,

694
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,521
and still say you don't care about him.

695
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:01,521
When was I ever lost over him?

696
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,801
Look at your eyes.

697
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:04,961
Those dark circles

698
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:06,321
are as dark as a panda's.

699
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:07,321
Really?

700
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:08,761
Go see for yourself.

701
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:13,521
Um...

702
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:14,921
You have to play the game with me later.

703
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:16,481
Okay.

704
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,201
Why are you here?

705
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,681
Guild Leader told us to take turns guarding Baihua Tang.

706
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,401
So others won't bully you.

707
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:32,121
Or Baihua Tang.

708
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:34,561
Is it really the Guild Leader's order,

709
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,041
or are you just here to see pretty girls?

710
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:43,081
You really have issues, woman.

711
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,521
Can't help shooting arrows, huh?

712
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:45,681
I just love shooting you.

713
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,561
If you dare, get the Guild Leader to catch me.

714
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:51,641
Stop messing around.

715
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,121
Sister-in-law, you're online!

716
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:02,641
Here to grind dungeons with Water Fairy.

717
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:06,441
Take this, keep it safe.

718
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,681
Isn't this the Health Potion?

719
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,280
It's too expensive.

720
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:12,041
I can't accept it.

721
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:14,201
He earned it through tough competitions.

722
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,280
You have to take it.

723
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:16,121
Otherwise,

724
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:17,481
I'll be kicked out of the guild.

725
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:26,081
Sister-in-law.

726
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,201
You're going to grind dungeons?

727
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:28,121
I'll go with you.

728
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:29,521
Guild Leader said

729
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:30,801
if you grind dungeons,

730
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:31,841
someone must go with you.

731
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:33,481
Or you'll be kicked out of the guild.

732
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:35,161
No need.

733
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:36,161
I'm tired.

734
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:36,961
Maybe another day.

735
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:48,761
Yao Yuan.

736
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:49,881
I'm tired.

737
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,001
I don't want to play anymore.

738
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:52,201
I'm logging off now.

739
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,720
See, you drove everyone away.

740
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,481
Not my fault.

741
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:16,681
Let me practice a bit.

742
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:29,641
Don't you get tired of playing like this all day?

743
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:31,721
Can't hurt you in real life,

744
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,761
so I'll kill you a thousand times in the game.

745
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:36,801
You sisters both have quite the temper.

746
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:39,801
Who could stay calm around you guys?

747
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:41,441
Only saints have that much patience.

748
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,721
I have to be fair here.

749
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,641
Our Guild Leader seems hard to get along with,

750
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:47,241
and in real life, he really is.

751
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:48,001
But...

752
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,401
he's truly sincere to Ruo Wei Jun Gu.

753
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:50,561
Absolutely genuine.

754
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:52,481
How do you know?

755
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,321
Because he doesn't make promises easily.

756
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:56,561
But once he does,

757
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:57,441
he always keeps them.

758
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:01,881
Did someone pay you to say that?

759
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,440
No one could pay me

760
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:07,121
to say something I don't mean.

761
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:09,601
I just want Jiang Anlan to settle down.

762
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:14,361
I want my sister to be happy too.

763
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:16,441
I've got an idea

764
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:18,441
to speed up their relationship.

765
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,401
Solve our worries once and for all.

766
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,001
Spit it out, stop keeping us guessing.

767
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,641
Why don't we set them up?

768
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,281
Get them drunk and let things happen.

769
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,321
After one night,

770
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:29,161
it'll be a done deal.

771
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,801
Can't let good food go to waste.

772
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:32,761
So we just go along with the plan.

773
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:45,441
What is the PR department doing?

774
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,761
Don't you know the media is releasing news?

775
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,081
By the time you go to confirm,

776
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:51,121
the news is already out.

777
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,681
Then what do I need you all for?

778
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,480
Or should I just fire all of you?

779
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,760
Find out everything about that model.

780
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:02,761
If she keeps talking nonsense,

781
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:04,921
get evidence and force her to apologize.

782
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,401
If it really is Su Wen's fault,

783
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:09,401
make Su Wen apologize.

784
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,481
Do you really want to get fired?

785
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,560
Get him a few charity projects.

786
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,041
Go to the mountains, shoot a calendar, raise funds.

787
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,920
Clean up his image right away.

788
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,001
Got it?

789
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,961
Donate the money raised to rural areas.

790
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:24,641
But for the calendar,

791
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:25,641
it still needs pretty girls.

792
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:27,601
Who let you in?

793
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,321
My life

794
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:30,521
has always been my own to decide.

795
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:32,601
Fine.

796
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,321
Cancel everything from the meeting just now.

797
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,041
He wants to decide for himself,

798
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:36,921
so let him handle it himself.

799
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:37,681
Don't be impulsive.

800
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,121
Once someone makes a wrong decision,

801
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:40,121
it could ruin their whole life.

802
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:41,121
That's true.

803
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:42,481
It's obvious in your case.

804
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,800
Whatever you say, I'll do.

805
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:44,601
Is that enough?

806
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:45,841
Please, help me out.

807
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:47,921
I'm about to be driven crazy by the media.

808
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:49,001
I've only ever photographed others.

809
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,321
No one's ever photographed me.

810
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:50,921
Charity.

811
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:51,441
Are you in or not?

812
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:51,841
I'm in.

813
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:52,961
But

814
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:54,401
we still need a pretty girl calendar.

815
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:55,921
People like beautiful things.

816
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,161
Even if everyone's taste is different,

817
00:37:58,281 --> 00:37:59,161
I just don't get it—

818
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:00,481
why do so many people like you?

819
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:01,641
If there's nothing else, go home.

820
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:02,601
What about the charity?

821
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:04,481
I think your idea is great.

822
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:05,881
Let's shoot a pretty girl calendar.

823
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,921
All proceeds go to rural children.

824
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:10,681
How about it?

825
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,561
I think Yao Yuan would be a great model.

826
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:21,561
Smart and beautiful.

827
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:22,961
No way.

828
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,720
Just a few photos.

829
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,921
Everyone can admire the beauty.

830
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,201
Who's admiring with you?

831
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,200
Why are you so stingy?

832
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:31,521
Maybe she wants to be photographed.

833
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:32,841
You're stopping her.

834
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,121
It's a chance to shine.

835
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,120
You're being bossy.

836
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:35,961
It's selfish.

837
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:37,641
Believe it or not, I'll end you right now.

838
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,401
Even if I risk my life,

839
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:41,441
I have to photograph her.

840
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:43,041
I know her name.

841
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:44,601
And what she does.

842
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:45,961
What kind of society is this now?

843
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:47,801
Baidu can find anything.

844
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,201
I'm going to enjoy

845
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,640
the convenience of technology.

846
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:55,441
Li Ao.

847
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:57,041
Send him to the mountains right away.

848
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:58,561
Let him shoot all four seasons there.

849
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,000
Book a flight.

850
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,481
Didn't expect him to be like this.

851
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:13,321
Class is starting.

852
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:15,841
Really didn't expect it.

853
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:18,961
Class is starting, everyone.

854
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,961
Everyone's having a lively chat today.

855
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,121
What are you all talking about?

856
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:34,881
Did you see the news about Su Wen?

857
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,200
Yes, I did.

858
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:39,041
Are all artists like that,

859
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:39,961
acting the same way?

860
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:40,921
Thinking they're

861
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,200
especially carefree.

862
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,160
But what do you call that?

863
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,601
That's called being a playboy.

864
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:45,721
It's really a waste of

865
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:46,881
all the support we've given him.

866
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:48,001
Don't you all agree?

867
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:49,121
Yes.

868
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,241
Everyone, calm down for a moment.

869
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:53,401
Sometimes,

870
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,441
when we look at someone,

871
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:55,481
we can't just judge by appearances.

872
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,161
Often,

873
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,120
what you see on the outside

874
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:00,041
is very different from their heart.

875
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,521
There's a big gap between the two.

876
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,801
So, teacher, you mean

877
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:05,281
Su Wen is actually devoted?

878
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:08,801
Student in the back,

879
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,001
please turn off the lights.

880
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,721
Let's take a look at today's painting.

881
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:14,481
It's quite fitting.

882
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,681
It happens to show you

883
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,000
something you want to know.

884
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:19,681
This painting

885
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,000
is by Van Gogh.

886
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,321
The Potato Eaters.

887
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:24,681
You can see in the painting,

888
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:27,001
a family under dim light

889
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:27,961
having dinner.

890
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,640
They're eating potatoes they grew themselves.

891
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:32,321
But if you look closely,

892
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:34,481
the real focus of this painting

893
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:36,561
is above their heads,

894
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,481
on that oil lamp.

895
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,840
While they're eating,

896
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:42,401
everyone's expression is very calm.

897
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:44,761
Van Gogh once said

898
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,481
he painted this

899
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:47,521
to express

900
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:49,681
ordinary people working for themselves.

901
00:40:50,521 --> 00:40:52,761
He didn't want to criticize society.

902
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:53,841
He just wanted

903
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,001
to show

904
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,561
the daily efforts of ordinary people.

905
00:40:58,601 --> 00:40:59,361
Sometimes,

906
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:02,041
we only see what we want to see,

907
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:03,481
what we hope to see,

908
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,961
and ignore the true nature of things.

909
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:08,921
Next time you want to ask someone

910
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:10,081
why they did something,

911
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:11,641
first ask yourself

912
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,801
if you've added your own ideas

913
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:15,801
and your own

914
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,481
judgments and biases to them.

915
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,081
But that person

916
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:21,961
doesn't even get a chance to respond.

917
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,561
She's not in the office right now.

918
00:41:28,281 --> 00:41:29,361
Wait, she's back.

919
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:30,961
Su Wen.

920
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:33,121
Su Wen.

921
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,761
Hello?

922
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,001
Hi.

923
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:39,521
Su Wen.

924
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,441
Pretty face, sweet voice.

925
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:43,921
Life really isn't fair.

926
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:46,601
How did you find me?

927
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:48,121
That's not important.

928
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,441
I'm calling to thank you.

929
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,881
You trusted me at the photo exhibit

930
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:53,121
and protected my work.

931
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,040
It's fine. The work is innocent.

932
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:00,361
So, if I had been hit that day,

933
00:42:00,761 --> 00:42:01,481
you wouldn't have helped?

934
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,001
Even if I wanted to,

935
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,241
someone else would step in before me.

936
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,481
Actually,

937
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,601
I have a favor to ask.

938
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:14,121
What is it?

939
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,801
You know, on the day of the exhibit,

940
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:17,761
things got pretty chaotic.

941
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:19,361
My boss definitely wasn't happy.

942
00:42:19,561 --> 00:42:20,841
I want to do something

943
00:42:20,881 --> 00:42:21,881
to cheer him up.

944
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:22,681
Me?

945
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,080
Yeah.

946
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,921
What does he like?

947
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:26,881
Besides you, of course.

948
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,121
Just kidding.

949
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:32,841
I mean, what are his interests?

950
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:33,961
So I can cater to his tastes.
