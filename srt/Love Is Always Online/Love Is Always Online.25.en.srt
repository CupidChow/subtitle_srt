33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,380
Wenqian,

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,300
well,

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
how could you do such a thing?

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,620
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,220
I'm his aunt and I care about him.

38
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,340
Is that wrong?

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,300
Caring is one thing,

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,220
but

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,900
you can't use money to force them apart.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,500
Her uncle is just after money.

43
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,820
Besides, he's Yao Yuan's family.

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,740
He could've reasoned with her.

45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,540
If Anlan finds out about this,

46
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,300
he will be furious.

47
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,580
I was doing this to help him.

48
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,980
Dad.

49
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,140
How could you do this?

50
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm just doing this

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,940
for Anlan's happiness.

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,900
Even if the Jiang family doesn't accept her,

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,780
you can't settle it with money.

54
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,380
That's so disrespectful.

55
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,020
You're trampling on their dignity.

56
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,620
Dad, you don't know

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,620
how realistic girls are these days.

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,420
Anlan has never dated before.

59
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,700
I was afraid he'd be scammed,

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
so I tested her.

61
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,620
And what did you get?

62
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,900
Her uncle didn't take the money,

63
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,740
but maybe he just wants a higher price.

64
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,340
You are being irrational.

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,300
I…

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,100
You are disgracing the Jiang family.

67
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,060
Dad,

68
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,380
I know I was wrong.

69
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,820
Grandpa, please don't be angry.

70
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,780
That's right, Dad.

71
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,300
Your health is what matters most.

72
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,540
I'll take care

73
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,020
of this matter.

74
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,180
Fine.

75
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,380
Don't make it look like

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,940
the Jiang family

77
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,740
pushes people around.

78
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,740
Understood.

79
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,140
Why didn't you back me up just now?

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,220
Dad was so angry.

81
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,060
What was I supposed to say?

82
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,380
Nothing I said would have helped.

83
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,580
So you just watched me become the target?

84
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,420
Is that it?

85
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,580
Wenqian,

86
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,460
you were in the wrong this time.

87
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,420
Whatever.

88
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,900
I won't meddle anymore.

89
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,740
Ridiculous.

90
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,140
Your aunt

91
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,620
was indeed too impulsive about this.

92
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,660
Ancheng,

93
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,860
please look out

94
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,860
for Anlan more these days,

95
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,700
okay?

96
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,300
Mm.

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,050
I can't believe your aunt did that.

98
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,700
It's so outdated.

99
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,740
Everyone has different values.

100
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,260
What's your plan?

101
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,380
I don't care if they agree or not.

102
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,070
My life is not for others to decide.

103
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,670
I will not leave Yao Yuan.

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
That's the spirit. I'm with you.

105
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,700
Buddy, I've got a simple idea for you,

106
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,540
but it's effective.

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,180
You're not suggesting

108
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,900
to make a done deal, are you?

109
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,820
You catch on quick.

110
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,900
Whether it's in TV dramas

111
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,260
or real life,

112
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,620
this move works every time.

113
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,620
I won't give up.

114
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,620
I have to make those

115
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,260
who oppose us see that

116
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,140
my wife

117
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,900
can only be Yao Yuan.

118
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,620
True. If you get married,

119
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,540
your family

120
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,400
can't use such tactics

121
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,820
to separate you.

122
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,700
I support you.

123
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,220
Since you're getting married,

124
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,970
do you want me

125
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,220
to plan a surprise proposal?

126
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,180
I suggest

127
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,140
renting the tallest building in the city

128
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,740
and setting off fireworks at night.

129
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,580
Romantic, right?

130
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,460
Too cliché.

131
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,460
How about an island vacation?

132
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,590
We could have a small party on the beach.

133
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,060
Singing and dancing all night.

134
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,220
With the right music, venue,

135
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,500
and vibe,

136
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,700
she would be moved.

137
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,620
That's also cliché.

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,860
TV shows have overused that.

139
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,660
There's no surprise in that.

140
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,520
How about Disneyland?

141
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,980
Dress up as Buzz Lightyear,

142
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,540
walk towards her

143
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,620
in the parade.

144
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,940
Then break out into a dance,

145
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,540
and kneel to propose.

146
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,580
Now that is a surprise.

147
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,220
The Boss dancing in a mascot suit to propose?

148
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,020
Impossible.

149
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,940
That's exactly why it's a surprise.

150
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,660
What do you say, Anlan?

151
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,700
Whose idea is better?

152
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,860
All terrible.

153
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,700
Forget it.

154
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,860
We won't find an answer

155
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,700
this way.

156
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,140
What are you guys talking about?

157
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,860
I ordered your orange juice.

158
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,340
What's going on?

159
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,300
What's so urgent?

160
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,680
I wanted to see you,

161
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
and there's a big reason too.

162
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,700
Someone needs your advice.

163
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,740
I want to propose to Yao Yuan.

164
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,700
Propose?

165
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,380
Oh my god, that's amazing.

166
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,660
Yuan will definitely be so happy.

167
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,540
Do you think she will say yes?

168
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,860
Jiang Anlan, I never expected
to see you in this position.

169
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,420
Don't worry, she'll say yes.

170
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,180
Though I don't know

171
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,980
what kind of proposal she likes,

172
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,940
the key is

173
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,220
who it's from.

174
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,380
Yuan just wants simple happiness.

175
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,640
If she refuses, I'll drag her to the altar.

176
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,140
Boss, are you planning to bring your game
moves

177
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,620
into real life?

178
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,980
Yuan,

179
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,140
Anlan's aunt came to see me today.

180
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,620
She offered me money

181
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,780
to convince you to leave Anlan.

182
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,900
But don't worry,

183
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,420
I didn't take a single cent.

184
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,540
I may be useless,

185
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,140
but I'd never your happiness

186
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,860
for money.

187
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,780
Thank you, Uncle.

188
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,460
Yuan,

189
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,260
did I ruin things for you?

190
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,060
If I hadn't been careless

191
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,380
and scalded Anlan's mother,

192
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,220
maybe things wouldn't be like this.

193
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,940
No, Uncle.

194
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,220
Don't overthink it.

195
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,220
Maybe it's because

196
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,500
I was sick

197
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,180
and didn't go to his father's birthday party.

198
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,740
Or maybe,

199
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,180
none of those are the real reasons.

200
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,380
Yuan,

201
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,780
I knew you'd be upset hearing this.

202
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,060
I truly want you to be happy.

203
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,100
But if you aren't happy with him,

204
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,300
I won't support this relationship.

205
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,340
(Lord of All)

206
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,140
Hello.

207
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,180
You knew?

208
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,820
Yeah.

209
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,380
Don't worry.

210
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,260
I'll take care of it.

211
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,940
Let's face it together.

212
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,650
But I have to go on a business trip

213
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,380
for a couple of days.

214
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,250
See you when I get back.

215
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,420
You're going on a business trip?

216
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,220
Just two or three days.

217
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,980
Call me if you miss me.

218
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,610
I won't turn off my phone.

219
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,740
And if you don't miss me,

220
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,220
you still have to call me.

221
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,730
Because I'll miss you.

222
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,660
Then why can't you call me?

223
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,220
No reason.

224
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,820
You must call me.

225
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,730
So you don't overthink it.

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,820
Anlan,

227
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
we have to stay together, okay?

228
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,700
Don't worry.

229
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,020
We won't be apart.

230
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,620
Thanks for helping me out last time.

231
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,940
I hate owing people favors.

232
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,100
This meal's on me.

233
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,500
You paid me back, so it's not a favor.

234
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,620
It's on me.

235
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,940
But that doesn't seem right.

236
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,780
Don't argue with me.

237
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,820
It's just a meal.

238
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,860
Besides, I picked the restaurant.

239
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,220
So I've got this.

240
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,380
Ancheng, you're really a nice guy.

241
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,180
Unlike some people

242
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,660
who fake being rich

243
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,380
but have no money

244
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,620
in their pockets.

245
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,580
Please enjoy.

246
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,420
Thank you.

247
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,490
This salmon here is good.

248
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,660
Try some.

249
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,930
Hmm.

250
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,780
Delicious.

251
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,540
Ancheng,

252
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,940
you're so thoughtful.

253
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,660
Your girlfriend must be very happy.

254
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,660
I'm single.

255
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,020
No way.

256
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,400
You're so outstanding.

257
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,460
Maybe your standards are too high.

258
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,620
Aren't you the same?

259
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,180
I guess

260
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,940
I just haven't met the right one yet.

261
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,740
It would

262
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,060
be so nice if I could find a guy

263
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,300
who takes good care of me,

264
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,340
just like Anlan does

265
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,540
for Yao Yuan.

266
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,060
He is quite caring.

267
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,220
Are things

268
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
going well for them?

269
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,140
Pretty well.

270
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,820
They are always on the phone.

271
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,620
Couples in love

272
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,460
are so enviable.

273
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,180
I wonder when I can

274
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,840
have a proper romance.

275
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,990
Do you want to date that badly?

276
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,420
Of course.

277
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,220
At my age,

278
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,060
I'm in my prime.

279
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,660
If I don't date soon, I'll just wither away.

280
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,740
What a waste of good years.

281
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,980
So I won't let other people's opinions

282
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,940
stop me.

283
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,740
Youth only comes once.

284
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,460
I just want to date.

285
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,540
Am I holding back the society

286
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
or something?

287
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,900
Please enjoy.

288
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,940
Eat more.

289
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,780
Mm.

290
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,500
Want a ride home?

291
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,700
No, it's okay.

292
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,740
I'll go get groceries.

293
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,780
Alright then.

294
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,620
I'll head out first.

295
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,490
Hmm.

296
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,200
Bye.

297
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,380
(Xinran, let me tell you…)

298
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,300
Forget it.

299
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,860
It'd be awkward
if it ends up going nowhere.

300
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,700
Better to wait until it's official.

301
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,740
What should we eat today?

302
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,180
I'll let you choose.

303
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,980
So we'll have whatever I want?

304
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,290
As long as you're happy.

305
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,900
Look at that kid, isn't he adorable?

306
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,860
That's because you saw him happy.

307
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,380
You didn't see him causing a fuss.

308
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,220
You don't like kids?

309
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,540
I...

310
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,060
I'm not really drawn to kids.

311
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,140
But kids are so adorable.

312
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,820
Once we get married,

313
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,420
our kids will definitely be cute.

314
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,820
Marriage

315
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,700
needs careful consideration.

316
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,100
We have to check zodiac signs and
birth dates,

317
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,210
and plan thoroughly.

318
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,300
We both agree on that.

319
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,980
Look at Anlan and Yao Yuan,

320
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,420
they're already having a tough time.

321
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,540
When marriage is on the table,

322
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,730
the problems just pile up.

323
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,380
Marriage is complicated, right?

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,170
But there's no way around it.

325
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,660
Luckily, my family's open-minded,

326
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,980
so I can decide for myself.

327
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,660
We're still in the heat.

328
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,980
Don't let their problems

329
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,060
stress us out.

330
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,780
That's right.

331
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,900
I'm back, dear.

332
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,400
Are you all dressed up?

333
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,100
I'll come pick you up for dinner.

334
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,420
Okay.

335
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,460
(Okay.)

336
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,900
Here's your cake, enjoy.

337
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,740
This is...

338
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Today's my birthday.

339
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,580
Ah?

340
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,500
Your birthday?

341
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,660
Why didn't anyone tell me?

342
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,940
No one told me at all.

343
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,070
I didn't even get you a gift.

344
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,020
It's okay.

345
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,300
You can fulfill my wish.

346
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,340
Happy birthday to you.

347
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,860
This is all I can do.

348
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,860
I just made a wish.

349
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,420
Want to know what it is?

350
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,900
What wish?

351
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,000
Tomorrow,

352
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,420
no matter what I ask for,

353
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,660
you can't say no to me.

354
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,260
Alright.

355
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,100
I promise.

356
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,580
Back in college,

357
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,900
I saw you riding a bike to school.

358
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,560
I wanted to join you so many times.

359
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,820
Really?

360
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,820
I had no idea.

361
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,300
Am I the first guy

362
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,440
to ride a bike with you?

363
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,700
Guess.

364
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,580
But I'm definitely the last.

365
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,260
What if our future kid

366
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,540
wants to ride with me?

367
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,500
Then I'll tell him,

368
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,380
that's a special dad-only privilege.

369
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,060
How do you know it'll be a son?

370
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,030
What if it's a daughter?

371
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,340
A daughter works too.

372
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,580
Get out.

373
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,180
Why am I discussing this with you?

374
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,350
♪Endless conversations to share♪

375
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,520
♪A perfect secret to preserve our love♪

376
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,190
♪You're just like the sun♪

377
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,860
Is this it?

378
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,060
Yeah.

379
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,900
Wow.

380
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,740
The cotton candy is so popular.

381
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,940
It sure is.

382
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,190
Almost thirty years now.

383
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,420
When I was five,

384
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,940
my family celebrated my birthday.

385
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,140
We passed by this stall,

386
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,820
(Cotton Candy)
and my mom bought two.

387
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,300
One for me, one for my brother.

388
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,500
Red one? Okay.

389
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,820
The owner back then, who is this granny now,

390
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,540
found out it was my birthday.

391
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,940
She made me

392
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,900
a big Ultraman cotton candy.

393
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,420
I shared it with my whole family.

394
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,100
I spent about an hour eating it,

395
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,460
bite by bite,

396
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,060
getting sticky all over my clothes.

397
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,060
Thinking back,

398
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,220
that was really a beautiful day.

399
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,220
Later, my parents got busy with work,

400
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,100
and we never had that chance again.

401
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,780
After that, every birthday I spent here,

402
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,100
I came here for cotton candy.

403
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,820
Hearing you say that,

404
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,820
this cotton candy must be delicious.

405
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,060
You'll like it.

406
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,860
Granny.

407
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,020
I'm sorry.

408
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,860
I'm not

409
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,980
making anymore

410
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,100
today.

411
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,780
No more? Sold out?

412
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,620
No.

413
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,300
My husband

414
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,860
twisted his ankle.

415
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,500
He can't cook for himself.

416
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,220
I have to go home and cook for him.

417
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,380
Granny,

418
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,420
do you remember him?

419
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
He has come to buy cotton candy

420
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,020
every birthday

421
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,260
since he was five.

422
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,140
I remember now.

423
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
It's you, young man.

424
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,340
Yes.

425
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,060
And

426
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,220
what was your name again?

427
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,420
Anlan.

428
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,340
Oh,

429
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,260
Anlan.

430
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
It's Anlan.

431
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,300
I'm getting old.

432
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,220
My eyes aren't what they used to be.

433
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,420
Granny,

434
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,500
your cotton candy is very important to him.

435
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,260
Could you please make just one more for us?

436
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,980
Well...

437
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,620
Let her go back.

438
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,040
I'll just come again next year.

439
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,540
How about this?

440
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,820
You leave the stall to us.

441
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,220
We'll make some and return it to you later.

442
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,060
Is that okay?

443
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,700
This...

444
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,700
We won't take it away. I promise.

445
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,020
Okay?

446
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Well...

447
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,260
you two look after it for me.

448
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,340
- I'll be back in a while.
- Great.

449
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,980
Have fun.

450
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,060
Be careful.

451
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,740
I'm really bad at this, aren't I?

452
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,380
Maybe you should use less at once.

453
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,380
Dear,

454
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,580
your artistic talent

455
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,500
really shines through.

456
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,220
I don't think I'm as good as you.

457
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,420
You spin it, and I'll add the sugar.

458
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,620
Sure.

459
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,220
I want cotton candy.

460
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,660
You want some cotton candy?

461
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,660
Coming right up.

462
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,780
Give it to him.

463
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,140
It's a bit ugly though.

464
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,780
It's okay.

465
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,060
Here.

466
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,220
Eat up.

467
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,620
I want cotton candy.

468
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,580
Okay, everyone gets some.

469
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,660
Be patient.

470
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,540
Is blue okay?

471
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,820
Yes.

472
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,190
I want one. Give me one.

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,300
Anlan,

573
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,220
why did you suddenly propose to me?

574
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,180
Suddenly? Not really.

575
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,060
I've thought this through carefully.

576
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,810
I want to give you a guaranteed future.

577
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,380
I want to legally have you and protect you.

578
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,740
No one will ever hurt you.

579
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,980
Dear,

580
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,460
from now on,

581
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,020
I'm truly yours.

582
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,900
Stop it.

583
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,180
- Go do the laundry.
- You do it.

584
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,340
I'm not doing it.

585
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,700
Lord of All issues a quest.

586
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,500
To celebrate the official proposal
to For Thy Sake,

587
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,900
any friends who get married this month

588
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,480
and present a wedding invitation

589
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,140
will receive

590
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,580
200 gold each.

591
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,260
Isn't Lord of All

592
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,300
already married to For Thy Sake?

593
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,620
That was just in the game.

594
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,860
I just heard from Tianxia Gang

595
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,940
that they have

596
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,300
actually gotten engaged in real life.

597
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,180
Ace really nailed it.

598
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,660
An online romance that turned real.

599
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,780
Impressive.

600
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,700
(Quest from Lord of All)
The Ace is so romantic.

601
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,140
Setting such a high bar.

602
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,980
I'll probably never get married.

603
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,540
Jiang Anlan,

604
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,820
looks like you really beat me.

605
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,220
For real?

606
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,780
Of course.

607
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,890
Something this big can't be a joke.

608
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,020
Boss.

609
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,860
Morning.

610
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,700
Master.

611
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,040
Are you really getting married?

612
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,100
Are you marrying Miss Yao?

613
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,380
He's wearing a wedding ring.

614
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,580
Do you think it's true?

615
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,900
Jiang.

616
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,780
I heard she said yes.

617
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,860
If you want to congratulate me, go ahead.

618
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,780
Jiang,

619
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
let me ask you.

620
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,940
Is it really right

621
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,100
to marry her now?

622
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,700
What's wrong with it?

623
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,420
Your dad hasn't accepted her.

624
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,360
Marrying her under these circumstances,

625
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,110
do you think it's good for her?

626
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,300
I'm not sure if this is the best decision

627
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,660
for Yao Yuan.

628
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,540
But for me,

629
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,300
it's unquestionable.

630
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,980
I hope you treat her right.

631
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,060
If not...

632
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,060
There won't be an "if not."

633
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,900
I hope you remember what you said.

634
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,580
I will.

635
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,740
So,

636
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,100
would you take our wedding photos?

637
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,620
That's a pretty cruel.

638
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,420
But I will.

639
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,380
For Yao Yuan.

640
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,660
I feel so sad.

641
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,180
Since last night,

642
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,260
everyone in Shengshi has been celebrating

643
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,420
Anlan's proposal to Yao.

644
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,980
I really hate it.

645
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,900
I don't hate Yao.

646
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,060
I just hate this feeling.

if you need flowers,

686
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,860
just ask the gardener to pick some for you.

687
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,420
Flowers you pick yourself always look better.

688
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,380
You know me,

689
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,260
I just love flowers.

Hey, Jianing's here.

691
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,460
Jianing,

692
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,100
what's up?

693
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,060
Did someone bother you?

694
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,100
Anlan is getting married.

695
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,460
What?

696
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,500
Jianing.

697
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,780
Don't speak nonsense.

698
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,980
It's true.

699
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,180
Anlan already proposed to Yao.

700
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,020
Everyone knows about it.

701
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,060
Auntie,

702
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,380
I don't stand a chance now.

703
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,780
It's way too soon to say that.

704
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,020
He needs the family's approval to marry.

705
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,980
Jianing,

706
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,380
I think you and Anlan are the perfect match.

707
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,060
Both in family background and looks,

708
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,380
you're both top-notch.

709
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,340
But Anlan likes Yao.

710
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,660
No matter how hard I try.

711
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,300
I think

712
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,260
she must be coveting our wealth.

713
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,940
That's why she came up with this scheme.

714
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,940
Mrs. Jiang,

715
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,420
you must not go soft on her this time.

716
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,540
Auntie, please don't say that about Yao.

717
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,420
Anlan hasn't told me about this.

718
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,060
Don't jump to conclusions.

719
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,420
Let me get the full story first.

720
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,140
(Introduce her to family)

721
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,100
(Propose to her)

722
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,020
I'll be all alone at home from now on.

723
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,540
That's perfect.

724
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,060
You always say Yao Yuan is tone-deaf.

725
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,700
Now it'll be quiet.

726
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,380
I never said I liked quiet.

727
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,060
I'll come over often to keep you company.

728
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,500
Or,

729
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,100
I can just move in.

730
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,960
Forget it.

731
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,260
Your life is a mess.

732
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,610
You don't wash clothes or dishes.

733
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,940
I'd rather live alone.

734
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,700
Yuan has worked hard all these years.

735
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,800
Finally, someone is taking care of her.

736
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,940
But…

737
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,660
But what?

738
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,060
Although Anlan treats her well,

739
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,740
I'm still worried.

740
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,540
Worried about what?

741
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,350
That she'll have too much money?

742
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,500
I can help with that.

743
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,260
You're too superficial.

744
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,780
I heard Anlan's aunt is very bossy.

745
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,900
I'm worried Yuan might have a hard time.

746
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,500
Come on, Xinran.

747
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,700
Don't overthink it.

748
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,740
How could the Ace let her?

749
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,460
But he can't be with Yuan 24/7.

750
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,420
Dating is something between two people.

751
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,380
After marriage, it's about two families.

752
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,140
You know what she's like.

753
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,540
That's why I'm so worried.

754
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,980
She hates troubling others

755
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,340
and takes on everything by herself.

756
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,860
Even hurt, she says nothing.

757
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,940
You're wrong.

758
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,300
In my opinion,

759
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,220
Yao Yuan has been through a lot.

760
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,580
She looks quiet on the outside,

761
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,100
but inside she's stronger than anyone.

762
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,660
Even if she struggles in that family,

763
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,460
she'll overcome it.

764
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,180
And Yao Yuan is so likable,

765
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,810
who'd give her a hard time?

766
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,580
They will like her.

767
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,100
So weird hearing you say that.

768
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,700
I'm just brilliantly stupid.

769
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,580
Yao Yuan is really resilient.

770
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,060
You have to trust her.

771
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,900
Alright.

772
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,260
Here's to brilliantly stupid.

773
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,100
Hey,

774
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,220
isn't it inspiring that Yao Yuan

775
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,180
is marrying the Ace?

776
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,460
It shows a perfect match isn't just a dream.

777
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,940
Maybe

778
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,740
I might become her sister-in-law one day.

779
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,860
Xiaoya,

780
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,460
you're not seeing Li Ao, are you?

781
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,500
Please.

782
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,980
We got nothing going on, okay?

783
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,700
Not a chance.

784
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,580
Is it that rich playboy from your class?

785
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,700
He's not rich at all.

786
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,300
A total knockoff.

787
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,220
Good thing Jiang Ancheng saved me.

788
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,060
What?

789
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,820
Jiang Ancheng?

790
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,060
No.

791
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,300
You heard wrong.

792
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,740
Drink more. I'm off.

793
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,100
See you tomorrow.

794
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,740
Bye.

795
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,940
How... how could it be Jiang Ancheng?

796
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,060
Hey.

797
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,230
Looks like you didn't sleep well last night.

798
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,580
Sad about Master's getting married?

799
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,420
Don't feel like talking.

800
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,420
Come on.

801
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,270
Yao getting married. I'm upset too.

802
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,000
But I just slept it off.

803
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,580
Besides, you still have me.

804
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,080
It's going to be alright.

805
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,620
Why would I need you?

806
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,020
Then go find your Ancheng.

807
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,940
Don't mention him.

808
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,500
What's wrong?

809
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,900
He...

810
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,140
He said he likes me.

811
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,300
He finally said it.

812
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,620
What does that mean?

813
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,540
The whole world saw it.

814
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
You didn't?

815
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,340
I thought he saw me as a sister.

816
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,220
No man treats a sister that well.

817
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,620
What should I do?

818
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,100
Just ask your heart.

819
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,340
Ask yourself if you really like him.

820
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,540
I...

821
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,220

Pick up.

824
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,220
Answer it.

825
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,500
I'm not ready to decide yet.

826
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,020
Baby,

827
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,780
don't add so much tomato.

828
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,740
Don't call me that.

829
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,540
Sounds weird.

830
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,620
You better get used to it.

831
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,060
