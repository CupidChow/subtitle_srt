Even if you have a showdown,

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,640
you still need to know the truth.

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,160
And since you care so much,

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,800
there's no need to keep pretending.

37
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,520
Just go and ask clearly

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,040
what she really thinks.

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,520
Xinran,

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,520
what exactly do you want from Wen Cheng?

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,280
Is it you looking for me, or him?

42
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,760
I just can't stand it.

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,980
This girl is pretty cute and attractive.

44
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,560
Looks like my cousin's in trouble.

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,140
Which side are you really on?

46
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,880
Of course, I'm on Xinran's side.

47
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,060
Honestly, what we think doesn't matter.

48
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,000
What matters is Wen Cheng likes Xinran.

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,520
But it also depends on
how long Xinran holds out.

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,620
After all, no guy can

51
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,260
keep sticking to
a cold shoulder forever.

52
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,480
Even if you're right,

53
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,000
he's turned himself into a workaholic,

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,360
hosting or attending meetings all day.

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,160
He doesn't even have time to rest.

56
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,640
He's basically using work
to heal his heartbreak.

57
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,340
Using work to mend the pain?

58
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,920
Xinran did the same thing.

59
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,140
Look, they still

60
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,820
care about each other a lot.

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,960
I didn't expect this girl
to actually help out.

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,640
He's so busy with work,

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,760
maybe his team
isn't pulling their weight.

64
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,240
Don't think I don't understand.

65
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,120
Wen Cheng acts like this

66
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,940
because you weren't fully committed.

67
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,840
You can't say things like that.

68
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm just stating facts.

69
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,240
I heard Wen Cheng talking
on the phone with a friend.

70
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,440
He said once he waited for you
at your place,

71
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,880
planning to apologize
and make things right in person,

72
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,520
but he saw another guy walking you home.

73
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,920
Just drop me off here.

74
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,260
Okay.

75
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,200
Don't overthink it.

76
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,320
Oh, it's Zhou.

77
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,320
It's a misunderstanding, really.

78
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,800
Does that mean you're admitting it?

79
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,680
Listen,

80
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,760
if you don't like Wen Cheng,
just let him go.

81
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,320
Don't toy with someone
who truly cares about you.

82
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,920
Do you even have a conscience?

83
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,320
Who said I don't like him?

84
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,480
You're still young.
You don't get how adult love works.

85
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,460
Once we commit to someone,

86
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,780
no matter what problems come up,

87
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,480
we always find a way to fix them.

88
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,920
Even the silent treatment

89
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,840
is just part of understanding
and adjusting.

90
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,220
We're not like you young folks,

91
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,420
who just get together and split at will.

92
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,440
I don't believe it.

93
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,520
If you two were just arguing,

94
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,640
Wen Cheng wouldn't be this upset.

95
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,280
Could it be that

96
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,480
you think Wen Cheng likes you?

97
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,140
If Wen Cheng liked a girl,

98
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,520
he would make the first move.

99
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,180
But now, he's rejecting you.

100
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,240
There's only one reason.

101
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,160
He only has me in his heart.

102
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,320
Alright, here's some advice for you.

103
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,080
Go find the person who's right for you.

104
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Anyway,

105
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,020
don't think that

106
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,960
I'll give up on him.

107
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,800
If you keep hurting him,

108
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,160
I won't go easy on you.

109
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,040
Alright, stop looking.

110
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,120
I'll go pay the bill.

May I ask who you are?

123
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm Jiang Anlan's mom.

124
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,520
Could you please get him for me?

125
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,920
Sure, please wait here.

126
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,240
Who are you?

127
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm Anlan's mom.

128
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,160
I'm Yao Yuan's uncle.

129
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,530
Hello.

130
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,160
Um...

131
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,560
Why did you come to see me today?

132
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,680
Mrs. Jiang.

133
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,840
Yao Yuan.

134
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,240
I'll be straightforward.

135
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,380
I heard from Ancheng

136
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,960
about your uncle borrowing money.

137
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,040
So I came to check in on you.

138
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,160
Don't worry.

139
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,280
I'll make sure to pay back soon.

140
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,060
Honestly,

141
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,200
that amount

142
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,080
doesn't bother me at all.

143
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,160
It's just that...

144
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,680
I understand.

145
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,040
You're actually worried about me.

146
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,600
You're worried

147
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,300
that my sudden appearance

148
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,760
makes you feel strange

149
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,240
and nervous?

150
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,640
My family background is ordinary,

151
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,980
and I don't have much to offer.

152
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,460
You think I get close to Anlan

153
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,680
with an ulterior motive,

154
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,560
like I'm after your family's money.

155
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,800
Or maybe you even think

156
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm not worthy of him at all?

157
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,360
I can accept that.

158
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,640
Yao Yuan,

159
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,800
you're smart.

160
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,560
That's why Anlan likes you so much.

161
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,440
But marriage isn't like dating.

162
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,860
Two people liking each other

163
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,320
doesn't make a marriage work.

164
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,640
I agree with what you said.

165
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,920
Mutual love doesn't translate
to being fit for marriage.

166
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,760
But without love,

167
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,200
marriage's out of the question.

168
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm sure

169
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,520
Anlan and I truly love each other.

170
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,400
So,

171
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,120
I won't give up on him easily.

172
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,320
Here it comes.

173
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,000
Soup's here.

174
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,240
Our signature dish, the nourishing soup.

175
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,140
Mrs. Jiang, you have to try it.

176
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,980
No, no, it's fine.

177
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,340
Come on, you really should try it.

178
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,460
Here, give it a taste.

179
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,400
- You have to try it.
- No, thanks.

180
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,040
Sorry, this...

181
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,280
I'll go get a towel.

182
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,400
Oh my.

183
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,080
You got hurt just eating a meal?

184
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,220
I told you not to go to those

185
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,720
low-quality restaurants.

186
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,560
But you insisted on meeting him.

187
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm really sorry.

188
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,380
But the doctor just said

189
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,580
it's nothing serious.

190
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,700
You'll be fine in a few days.

191
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,360
You must be Yao Yuan's uncle, right?

192
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,380
Yes.

193
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,300
What?

194
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,960
Are you trying to say it's a minor injury?

195
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,520
Can you afford to pay for it?

196
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Sorry, ma'am.

197
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,960
My uncle really didn't mean to.

198
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,440
We are truly sorry.

199
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,040
Sorry doesn't fix this.

200
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,160
A rough person is always rough.

201
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,600
Both clumsy and careless.

202
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,160
You can't talk like that.

203
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,840
Is what I said wrong?

204
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,080
Look at how badly
Anlan's mother got hurt.

205
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,760
Mom.

206
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,680
How are you?

207
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm fine.

208
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,200
Doctor, is she really okay?

209
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,520
She's fine.

210
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,360
Does your mom look fine to you?

211
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,620
You've just known your girlfriend,

212
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,560
and she's hurt her badly.

213
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,680
This isn't a good sign.

214
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,080
Accidents happen. Nobody can avoid them.

215
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,240
I think Uncle and Yao Yuan
should have apologized.

216
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,160
Look at this.

217
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,120
Now you're already
on your girlfriend's side.

218
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,080
Aunt,

219
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,480
I'm just stating the facts.

220
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm also sticking to the facts.

221
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,280
Alright, alright.

222
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,960
Stop arguing.

223
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,760
You're just making a scene.

224
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,280
Okay, I'm fine now. Let's go.

225
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,800
Mom.

226
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,600
Uncle.

227
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,030
Don't take it to heart.

228
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,160
Yuan,

229
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm really sorry.

230
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,760
I'm useless. I can't do anything right.

231
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,800
Because of me,

232
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,240
you got looked down on.

233
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,560
It's okay, Uncle.

234
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,760
It's not your fault. You didn't mean it.

235
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,760
Besides, I believe

236
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,600
they're just in a fit of anger.

237
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,120
They will come around.

238
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,120
Yeah, Uncle.

239
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,960
Don't take it to heart.

240
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,240
My mom won't mind.

241
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Anlan,

242
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,680
don't worry.

243
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,120
I'll find a chance

244
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,480
to go apologize to her.

245
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,040
Alright, I'll head back now.

246
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,040
Thank you.

247
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,920
No need to thank me.

248
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,160
Thanks for not blaming us.

249
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,960
Thanks for standing up for us.

250
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,560
You're so silly.

251
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,160
Let's go.

252
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,720
Anlan is such a polite kid.

253
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,520
He actually got mad at me
because of her.

254
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,420
He wasn't being mad at you.

255
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,300
He was just really worried at the time.

256
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,040
That's no excuse to act like that.

257
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,680
Mom, Dad.

258
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,080
Mom, Dad.

259
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,900
I heard you got burned. Are you okay?

260
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,040
I'm fine. Come, have a seat.

261
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,820
The doctor said,

262
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,960
as long as I apply
the medicine daily, it'll heal.

263
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,680
How did you get burned anyway?

264
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,560
It's all because of Anlan's
girlfriend's uncle.

265
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,720
Mom, Dad, this girl
sure knows to play tricks.

266
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,560
She left Anlan completely stunned.

267
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,040
I heard Anlan's girlfriend
is pretty well-behaved.

268
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,400
She acts well when everything's fine.

269
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,540
When there's trouble,
she hides right behind Anlan.

270
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,400
And Anlan even

271
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,120
stood up for her.

272
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,960
He didn't even care
about his mom's injury.

273
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,240
Mom, don't listen to her nonsense.

274
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,880
Anlan became too impatient back then.

275
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,160
You'll know during the birthday party.

276
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,400
Our family and friends would show up.

277
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,960
She's so clueless about manners.

278
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,480
She'd embarrass us all.

279
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,440
Enough already.

280
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,880
Stop going on like that.

281
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,600
Like we don't dislike her enough.

282
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,360
It's you. What do you want now?

283
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,140
Wen Cheng, don't get me wrong.

284
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,980
I didn't come here

285
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
to argue with you.

286
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm here to apologize.

287
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,560
Say what you need to say.

288
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm in a hurry to the show.

289
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,880
Last time, I was too impulsive.

290
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,600
Yuting's already scolded me.

291
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,560
So I was thinking...

292
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,280
Oh, thanks for that.

293
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,160
Wen Cheng.

294
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,200
I wanted you to give it to Yuting.

295
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,520
She's on her menstrual period.

296
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,200
I bought her chocolate

297
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,160
in case she has stomach pain.

298
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,600
Why didn't you say that sooner?

299
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,480
If it's for Yuting, why give it to me?

300
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,160
I thought if you gave it to her,

301
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,680
she'd be really happy.

302
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,220
But I don't like her.

303
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,260
I don't wanna her get me wrong.

304
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,840
But she likes older guys.

305
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,900
She thinks older guys are mature,

306
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,160
caring and thoughtful.

307
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,800
When she's with an older guy,

308
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,160
she feels especially safe.

309
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,880
I'm not like that.

310
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,720
But she thinks you are.

311
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,340
That's just her ideal image

312
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,640
projected on me.

313
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,620
Kid,

314
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,720
you're pretty thoughtful

315
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,000
and caring.

316
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,460
Why not show this side of you

317
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,550
to Yuting?

318
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,800
Exactly.

319
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,200
Why didn't I think of that?

320
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,760
Yeah, why only now?

321
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,940
Among what Yuting said,

322
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,780
you've got everything

323
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,840
besides maturity.

324
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,320
Look, you're both cute and...

325
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,680
Thanks, Wen Cheng.

326
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,280
That really woke me up.

327
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,900
Give it your best shot.

328
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm heading out first.

329
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,200
Wen Cheng.

330
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,080
I want to ask you a favor.

331
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,320
If possible,

332
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,940
if you don't like Yuting,

333
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,920
please just reject her.

334
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm afraid she'll keep thinking
she has a chance.

335
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,920
She seems optimistic and outgoing,

336
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,800
but she's really stubborn,

337
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,240
always misplacing her effort.

338
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,320
Okay.

339
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,600
So funny.

340
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,200
Look at him, he's kinda like you.

341
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,180
Like me?

342
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,600
- Yeah.
- He's like you.

343
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,600
What the heck?

344
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,720
Like a meatball.

345
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,080
You're back.

346
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,160
What's wrong? You look upset.

347
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,620
Anlan's mom

348
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,680
went to eat at Uncle's restaurant,

349
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,000
and ended up getting burned.

350
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,420
Because of this,

351
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,800
Anlan got upset with his aunt.

352
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,120
I'm just saying,

353
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,100
your uncle really can never

354
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,600
get things done.

355
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,000
We wanted to fit into their family,

356
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,820
but now,

357
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,400
our relations got even more strained.

358
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,070
These things can't be rushed.

359
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,380
Everyone grows up differently,

360
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,690
so their views naturally differ.

361
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,840
But we forgot one key point.

362
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,080
Anlan's mom was just testing you.

363
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,060
What's done is done.

364
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,260
At least you and Anlan

365
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,210
haven't broken up over it.

366
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,290
Even if Anlan protects you,

367
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,860
if his family doesn't accept you,

368
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,280
you'll still have a hard time.

369
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,080
Winning over his mom is the key.

370
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,520
But she seems nice enough.

371
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,920
Big families always have more opinions.

372
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,520
Hey, don't scare Yao Yuan like that.

373
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,280
Why not start with Mr. Jiang first?

374
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,400
They say sons take after their dads,

375
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,840
so he'll probably like you too.

376
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,960
Thanks, you guys.

377
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,520
Thanks for what?

378
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,440
Wen Cheng just came online.

379
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,640
Why did you tell me?

380
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,920
Of course I'd tell you.

381
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,240
Go ask him,

382
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,660
if he likes you,

383
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,180
why did he flirt with other girls?

384
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,720
Alright, enough already.

385
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,480
Okay.

386
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
You guys have fun.

387
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,720
I'm heading upstairs first.

388
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,680
Anlan.

389
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,470
Mom.

390
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,640
Still hurting?

391
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,160
Not anymore.

392
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,600
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,520
I didn't handle your feelings well.

394
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,800
Come, sit down. Let's talk.

395
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,300
Okay.

396
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,080
Actually, it's okay with me.

397
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,530
But you defended Yao Yuan

398
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,840
in front of your aunt like that.

399
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,020
If she told this to your dad,

400
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,160
how do you think he would feel?

401
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,840
I wasn't thinking that far.

402
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,400
I just wanted to protect Yao Yuan.

403
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,820
Aunt doesn't know
what Yao Yuan's really like.

404
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,960
That's why she feels that way.

405
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,260
Yeah.

406
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,200
I know all of that.

407
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,380
But by making such a scene,

408
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,640
it actually backfired.

409
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,060
Forget it.

410
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,360
What's done is done.

411
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,980
In the future,

412
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,360
find another chance to make it up.

413
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,040
But

414
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,480
I actually like

415
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,160
Yao Yuan.

416
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,260
I won't just dismiss her

417
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,360
over this one thing.

418
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,870
Really?

419
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,000
What?

420
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,720
You think your mom's so unreasonable?

421
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,160
No.

422
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,200
You're the most
reasonable person in our family.

423
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,360
Now you start making amends.

424
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,360
Listen,

425
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,000
on your dad's birthday,

426
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,640
you need to behave better.

427
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,520
Don't cause any trouble.

428
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,060
We'll invite only the closest

429
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,080
and most important people that day.

430
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,400
Got it.

431
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,500
Dad hasn't come back yet?

432
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,840
He has a social event tonight.

433
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,760
He probably won't be back until late.

434
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,440
Don't bring this up with him.

435
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll talk to him instead.

436
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,190
Okay.

437
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,520
Don't worry, alright?

438
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,320
It'll be easy when we go over later.

439
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,200
Hey.

440
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,320
Fairy on the Wave.

441
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,720
Why do you look so menacing?

442
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,120
You're here to kill monsters?

443
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,280
Yeah.

444
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,780
Want to team up?

445
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,720
It'll be easier that way.

446
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,940
Women usually can't keep calm.

447
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,940
If her face turns sour, don't ask her.

448
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,160
In five minutes,
she'll tell you herself.

449
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,560
Don't hold it in.

450
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,020
It won't hurt anyone if you let it out.

451
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,580
I hate hypocrites
more than petty people.

452
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,780
What did you say? A hypocrite?

453
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,920
Will you be responsible?

454
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,640
Yeah, I saw it with my own eyes.

455
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,840
You were getting pretty close
to a pretty girl.

456
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,200
Oh.

457
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,160
Wen Ruyu.

458
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,280
That's where you went wrong.

459
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,840
How could you do something
like that and get caught?

460
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,440
How can you be so indecisive?

461
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,820
What do you mean?

462
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,980
She made the first move

463
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,920
and said she admired me.

464
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,040
So just because she showed interest,
you accepted it?

465
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,580
What about all your fans then?

466
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,720
Will you accept all of them?

467
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,120
What do you take me for?

468
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,200
Don't you know who you are?

469
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,700
You wanted us to stay friends.

470
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,800
Why are you so worked up?

471
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,660
Yeah.

472
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,640
We're just friends.

473
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,940
Guess who I am.

474
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,000
What are you doing?

475
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,760
Why are you spacing out like that?

476
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,380
Yuting.

477
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,360
We're several years apart in age.

478
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,640
But that doesn't matter.

479
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,180
Besides,

480
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,340
don't guys usually like

481
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,600
girls younger than themselves?

482
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,080
Not every guy is like that.

483
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,660
I appreciate that you admire me.

484
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,320
I get that you want
to be brave about love.

485
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,200
But I already like someone else.

486
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,480
I don't want you
wasting your energy on me.

487
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,140
Also, a quick reminder.

488
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,680
No matter if you're a guy or a girl,

489
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,480
you shouldn't get that close

490
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,880
when the other one isn't prepared.

491
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,640
It was just a casual way to say hello.

492
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,160
You think it's ordinary, but I don't.

493
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,260
People should respect each other.

494
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,280
If you feel
you can't keep your distance,

495
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,640
I'll be the one to keep it.

496
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,760
What do you mean?

497
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll ask Zhang to transfer you
out of my team.

498
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,160
So, you want me gone
just because you don't like me?

499
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
I thought it was pretty obvious,

500
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,040
but maybe I need to make it clearer.

501
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,440
I really don't like you.

502
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,620
If this keeps going,

503
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,040
we won't even be able to be friends.

504
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,000
So,

505
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,080
I guess I can't compare to Xinran.

506
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,780
Love isn't a test.

507
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,020
No one's scoring you
or comparing grades.

508
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
That's not true.

509
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,800
There has to be a score in your heart.

510
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,160
Am I not good enough somehow?

511
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,860
You're not bad at all.

512
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,120
Then why don't you like me?

513
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,080
Or do you actually dislike me?

514
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
Then I'll quit.

515
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,440
Fine, then quit.

516
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,860
If you're quitting over this,

517
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,700
I think

518
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,560
you never really wanted
this job that much.

519
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,300
Have you thought it through?

520
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,420
Are you here to work or to date?

521
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,720
Can't I do both?

522
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,720
No, you can't.

523
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,940
You're smart.

524
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,080
Don't let feelings affect your work.

525
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,720
So,

526
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,800
you think a breakup is no big deal.

527
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,660
Of course it's no big deal.

528
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,080
Besides, this isn't even a breakup.

529
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,480
No need to let it control your life.

530
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,280
And also,

531
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,400
the guy who punched me
asked me to give you this.

532
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,560
I ate the missing piece.

533
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,640
Someone who likes and values you

534
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,500
will naturally care for you.

535
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,440
Enough.

536
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,160
Don't keep telling me this.

537
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,680
People say older guys
are considerate and patient.

538
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,800
Why do you just keep nagging nonstop?

539
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,200
You're wrong.

540
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,520
Older people can be just as stubborn,

541
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,720
bossy, and nagging.

542
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,000
Being attentive and caring
has nothing to do with age.

543
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,480
Whether you love each other
is what really matters.

544
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,280
Think about that carefully.

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,800
What are you doing here?

558
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,900
Did you tell Wen Cheng something

559
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,880
so he treated me like that?

560
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,120
- I didn't.
- It's all your fault.

561
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,920
Every time you show up,
something bad happens.

562
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,700
Last time Wen Cheng got hurt,
this time I got dumped.

563
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,880
What exactly do you want?

564
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,400
Who cares about your chocolate?

565
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,560
Fine, fine, it's all my fault.

566
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,400
I treat you like this,
and you're not mad?

567
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,760
What? I'm not mad,

568
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,520
so you feel guilty about it?

569
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,100
Let's go.

570
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,460
Aren't you going to apply a face mask

571
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,600
and get your beauty sleep?

572
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,260
♪Still not enough to express my heart♪

573
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,060
♪I can show you
all the colors of the world♪

574
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,880
Honestly, I just don't get it.

575
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,880
Where exactly do I fall short of him?

576
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,720
I'm not losing to him
in height or looks, am I?

577
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,280
Honestly, I think so too.

578
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,680
And after you punched him,

579
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,520
I realized he's really not tough at all.

580
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
Plus, I've been sick of
all that dating theory stuff

581
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,980
he talks about.

582
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,520
Yeah, he talks like some boring teacher.

583
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,080
Yuting, can I ask you out again?

584
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,100
Hey, Yuting.

585
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,220
Don't bring that up now.

586
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,180
Let's talk about food.

587
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,660
One, two, three, hot pot!

588
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,440
Ah, that doesn't matter right now.

589
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,600
Just tell me
if I can win you over again.

590
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,010
♪Because we have each other♪

591
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,360

Sorry.

596
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,570
The number you dialed is unavailable.

597
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,520
He's here.

598
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,180
Jiang, did you
send someone to follow me?

599
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,520
I just walked in the door.

600
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,340
Jiang.

601
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,540
I know you're here

602
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,960
to get me back to work.

603
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,320
Who cares if you come back or not?

604
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,070
The company still needs to grow.

605
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,040
If you really can't do it,
just terminate the contract.

606
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,700
Many photographers struggle hard

607
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,160
just for a single chance.

608
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,870
Someone will replace you soon enough.

609
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,240
The world never stops for anyone.

610
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,760
I know all that.

611
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,240
Don't rub it in.

612
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,640
But I can slow down for you.

613
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,640
Think it over and let me know.

614
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,120
Decide if you want to keep
working on this case or not.

615
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,000
I won't wait for you too long.

616
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,740
You're not all that charming anyway.

617
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,120
If you leave the company,
it'll be quieter for me.

618
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,800
Jiang Anlan.

619
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,040
Thank you.

620
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,640
Whoever started the trouble
should end it.

621
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,680
Ask yourself carefully

622
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,560
what you need right now,

623
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,360
what you really care about,

624
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,440
and what you're still hoping for.

625
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,960
Give me your answer tomorrow.

626
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,840
My brother really treats Anlan well.

627
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,980
If this falls on Ancheng,

628
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,360
he'll definitely get scolded badly.

629
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,800
They're both our own flesh and blood.

630
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,400
There's no reason to show favoritism.

631
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,240
Everyone knows that.

632
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,520
My dad and brother
have always favored Anlan.

633
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,560
If Ancheng were

634
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,320
a bit slow, it wouldn't matter much.

635
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,140
But he's actually very sensitive.

636
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,600
How could he not notice?

637
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,760
Mom, Aunt.

638
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,580
- Morning.
- Morning.

639
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,760
Ancheng, did you have breakfast?

640
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,320
I'll eat on the way.

641
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,920
Mom, is your hand feeling better?

642
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,080
Much better now.

643
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,200
Let me take you to the hospital
to get the dressing changed.

644
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,520
Sounds good.

645
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,600
Ancheng, drive safe when you go.

646
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,720
Yeah.

647
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,800
I'll head out now.

648
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,600
Look at him,

649
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,880
so thoughtful and mature,

650
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,200
and capable too.

651
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,800
Why is it so hard for him
to prove himself?

652
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,220
We've always been fully committed

653
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,880
to those two brothers.

654
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,280
I believe that.

655
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,780
But if one has to inherit
the family business...

656
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,200
Come on, enough.

657
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,920
This isn't something we get to decide.

658
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,340
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

659
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,480
I don't care anymore.

660
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm not sure whether

661
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,520
what you said is true.

662
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,120
Maybe you really do love me,

663
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,760
but

664
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,760
you love yourself more.

665
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,520
I used to care,

666
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,480
because I loved you.

667
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,680
I thought you'd change for me,

668
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,560
but after all this,

669
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,160
I know you won't.

670
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,200
You're still the same.

671
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,340
Why can everyone else

672
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,660
tolerate the person they love,

673
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,960
but you demand so much from me?

674
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,640
No matter what I do, it's never right.

675
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,480
Are you really that clueless,
or are you just pretending?

676
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,520
Love isn't a cure-all.

677
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,440
In this world,

678
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,640
both people and love can change.

679
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,440
As time goes by,

680
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,400
love slowly fades away.

681
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,320
So you mean,

682
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,120
you don't love me anymore.

683
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,120
Cui Xi.

684
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,640
I can't love you anymore.

685
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,360
We can't keep going like this.

686
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,000
I think you should understand.

687
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,440
Do you want me,

688
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,600
or just...

689
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,280
I don't want to say it.

690
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,400
Let's just split.

691
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,480
We should each live our own lives.

(Project Investment Proposal)

696
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,460
How is it, Mr. Jiang?

697
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,480
Have you reviewed my proposal?

698
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,080
Yes, I have.

699
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
Did you approach

700
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,310
other companies before?

701
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,350
Why do you think it's a good fit
for Ruishi's investment?

702
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,740
You know,

703
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,880
our families have
a long-standing relationship.

704
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,980
Before, there wasn't a big

705
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,440
or suitable case,

706
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,560
but

707
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm really optimistic
about this project.

708
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,840
Have you shown it to Jiulong?

709
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,080
What?

710
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,660
Oh, yes, I have.

711
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,180
But their analysis

712
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,520
is too rigid and by the book,

713
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,700
always relying on historical data.

714
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,520
And they spouted
a bunch of technical jargon.

715
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,240
I guess you probably see it differently.

716
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,440
What did my brother say?

717
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,160
Jiang Ancheng said,

718
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,080
clothes made from waste
textile recycling materials

719
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,560
are too costly.

720
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,480
And we need to consider
how ordinary consumers

721
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,960
can accept them.

722
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,800
I think he's right.

723
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,320
Consumer acceptance really is the key.

724
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,600
You aim to raise

725
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,040
environmental consciousness,

726
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,540
but only actually focuses on profit,

727
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,320
and could even cause more pollution.

728
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,260
That's why I asked you for investment,

729
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,640
so I could keep researching.

730
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,140
But your case is still far from

731
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,360
getting a capital injection.

732
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
I agree

733
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,320
with Jiulong's analysis.

734
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,920
There's a rumor

735
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,800
that you left Jiulong

736
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,080
because you had a disagreement.

737
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,440
So I think

738
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,640
any case rejected by Jiulong

739
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,800
will probably be accepted by you.

740
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,600
You misunderstood.

741
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,540
I started my own business

742
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,680
not because I wanted to oppose
my dad or brother.

743
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,840
It's purely a personal challenge.

744
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,880
Actually, my brother's analysis
is far better than mine.

745
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,200
Whether or not Jiulong
rejects this project,

746
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,880
it still doesn't pass my review.

747
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,580
I won't take on something

748
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,760
just because my brother rejected it.

749
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,680
Your whole family

750
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,760
is too quick to judge.

751
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,520
In business,
there's no room for snap decisions.

752
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,680
I'm not saying the project is bad.

753
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,520
I also understand the market needs
to develop green consumption.

754
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,820
But I think you should focus more on

755
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,240
the core value of the project

756
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,880
before you can make money.

757
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,680
Mr. Li.

758
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,120
Don't give up on this project.

759
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,440
But stop using
these speculative methods.

760
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,720
I'm sorry.

761
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,560
Yesterday, it was all my fault.

762
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Here,

763
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,600
this is a small gift.

764
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,600
Consider it my way of apologizing.

765
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,920
Thank you.

766
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,680
What is this?

767
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,200
This is burn ointment.

768
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,760
It works really well.

769
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm a chef,

770
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,620
so I often get burned.

771
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,440
Apply it and it heals by the next day.

772
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,020
We can't just put on some

773
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,520
unknown ointment like that.

774
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,160
What to do if it gets worse?

775
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,240
I've been using it for years,
never had a problem.

776
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,800
But our sensitive skin is different.

777
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,120
Wenqian.

778
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,720
Mr. Shi, thank you for your kindness.

779
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,960
Actually,

780
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,960
my injury isn't that serious.

781
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,520
Don't blame yourself so much.

782
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,160
How could I not feel guilty?

783
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm Yuan's uncle.

784
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,620
My greatest wish

785
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,560
was to see her marry into a good family.

786
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,300
I was afraid I'd hold her back.

787
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,880
But you already have.

788
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,630
To be honest,

789
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,360
you just wanted Anlan's money, right?

790
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,880
That's not true.

791
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,100
I honestly hope

792
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,720
she should be with the one she loves.

793
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,800
If it's because of me,

794
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,120
I'd rather disappear from her life.

795
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,080
Don't say that.

796
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,720
You really shouldn't
blame yourself so much.

797
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,800
I'll apply this burn ointment

798
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,580
on time every day.

799
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,520
Thank you.

800
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
Look at this.

801
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,280
I got it.

802
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,700
We're always thinking about
replacing besties.

803
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,880
That's more of the same.

804
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,840
It can never beat what we had before.

805
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,120
So what do you think we should do?

806
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,640
We need to go against the grain.

807
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,240
They focus on youth and energy,

808
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,300
so we should focus on...

809
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,000
Frailty and weakness.

810
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,420
Are you talking about yourself?

811
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,640
No, not me.

812
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,360
I get it.

813
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,360
Usually, it's older folks
who pick the tea.

814
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,760
Actually, there's space for creation.

815
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah.

816
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,440
See that?

817
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,960
I've contributed more than you.

818
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,160
I agree.

819
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,200
Mr. Su, you're back.

820
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,380
No, no, no.

821
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,820
We're not that close.

822
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,800
Hey, Mr. Su.

823
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,080
You only realize someone's value
after they're gone.

824
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,560
Yao Yuan.

825
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,040
How have you been?

826
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,120
I should be the one asking you that.

827
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,720
Hey.

828
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,600
Shouldn't you have come to me first
when you got back?

829
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,640
In my heart, you're just number

830
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,200
one, two, three...

831
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,920
Just kidding.

832
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,040
What?

833
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,440
Didn't I just come back?

834
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,140
Boss feels really lonely

835
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,880
without your bickering.

836
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,620
So,

837
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,000
to fill the emptiness
in Jiang Anlan's heart,

838
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,140
I, Su Wen,

839
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,080
am back.

840
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,320
Jiang, I just heard your idea,

841
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,600
and I have a thought.

842
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,520
Keep your expectations in mind.

843
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,800
Tonight, we're all working late.

844
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,000
Alright.

845
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,120
Dear, thanks for your effort.

846
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,600
Everyone's worked hard.
Let's hope for a great result.

847
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,460
Though I'm reluctant to praise him,

848
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,300
I have to admit,

849
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,480
Su Wen's proposal
this time is pretty good.

850
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,760
Hearing you say that
puts my mind at ease.

851
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,360
Can you stop following us all the time?

852
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,800
I...

853
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,520
I'm here to work as a porter.

854
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,740
Let me carry it for you.

855
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,160
No need, he can help me.

856
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,340
What's wrong with having
one more porter?

857
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,320
We could even go out
to eat and walk around.

858
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,280
You still haven't given up.

859
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,620
When has the word "give up"

860
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,640
ever been in my dictionary?

861
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,980
That page must be missing.

862
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,320
Hurry and get yourself a new copy.

863
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,040
Alright, you two still
have the energy to argue now.

864
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,100
Su Wen, you should head back now.

865
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,480
Don't you have to
gather material tomorrow?

866
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,460
Go on, hurry up.

867
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,480
And you,

868
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,880
go back and start preparing
for the celebration dinner.

869
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,480
Celebration dinner?

870
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,480
I have a strong feeling

871
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,560
that our case will
definitely pass tomorrow.

872
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,240
Slow down.

873
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,640
Come inside quickly.

874
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,680
This rain just won't stop.

875
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,700
Grandma, are you okay?

876
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,780
I'm fine.

877
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,660
Quick, wipe the water off your face.

878
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,940
Yuan, sorry about that.

879
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,820
You came all this way
just to take photos.

880
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,560
Look at this rain pouring down.

881
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,680
Why would you take photos
of us old women?

882
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,100
Right, even my husband
doesn't look at me anymore.

883
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,120
Who would look at me?

884
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,460
Ma'am,

885
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,260
every cup of tea
has its own story behind it.

886
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,200
Just like my grandma,

887
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,840
who worked in the tea plantation
to raise her kids.

888
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,000
Each of you

889
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,800
has someone you want to protect.

890
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,760
Every single tea leaf here

891
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,060
is

892
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,780
being picked that kind
of grateful feeling.

893
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,320
It has a different kind of meaning.

894
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,520
So we hope to use photography

895
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,560
to tell this story.

896
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,480
Every sip of tea
carries a special meaning.

897
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,520
Now that you mention it,

898
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,920
I actually remember something.

899
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,280
When I was a kid,

900
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,560
the thing I wanted to protect most
was this tea plantation.

901
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,720
I recall one summer,

902
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,680
an unknown pest invaded,

903
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,120
devouring the entire tea plantation.

904
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,880
Back then, every household mobilized

905
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,760
to protect this tea plantation.

906
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,120
I also remember it.

907
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,720
I was in middle school at the time.

908
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,120
The first thing after school

909
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,960
was rushing home to fight the pests.

910
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,280
Yeah, exactly.

911
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,120
Back then,
one didn't need to say anything

912
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,240
to impress a girl.

913
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,460
Just head over to her tea plantation

914
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,560
and help out with picking off the bugs.

915
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,960
Exactly.

916
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,920
My husband won over my parents

917
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,600
back at that time.

918
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,320
Now we spray the pesticides,

919
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,280
so we don't need to
work so hard picking bugs.

920
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,660
But it's lost a bit
of the personal touch.

921
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,800
It's fine, it's fine.

922
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,600
At least when it comes to harvesting,
it still takes manpower.

923
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,200
Look here,

924
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,960
one bud with two leaves.

925
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,560
If you split these two leaves apart,

926
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,700
you'll see the bud

927
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,200
is actually connected.

928
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,360
So,

929
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,240
two people with no connection at all

930
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,040
can still form a bond over a cup of tea.

931
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,560
