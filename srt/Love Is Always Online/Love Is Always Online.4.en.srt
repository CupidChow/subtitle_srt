It really is you.

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,780
The manager just told me

35
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,660
that you were here too.

36
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,100
What brings you here?

37
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,120
I've booked lunch
with my parents.

38
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,100
I got here first.

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,020
Anlan,

40
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,460
do you want to come over later

41
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,580
and say hi to them?

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,860
They talk about you all the time.

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,020
Say hi?

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,020
Your new secretary?

45
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,220
My love.

46
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
Hi, I'm Fang Jianing.

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,860
You can call me Jiajia.

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,580
Hello, I'm Yao Yuan.

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,340
Oh, Sister Yao.

50
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,660
We've known each other
for a long time.

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,860
Except for me,

52
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,900
I've never seen Anlan brings
another woman here.

53
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,300
You must be really special.

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,020
That's why he brought you here.

55
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,980
But I remember,

56
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,380
on your last birthday,

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,380
we came in a group.

58
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,020
It wasn't just you.

59
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,340
Please don't create

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,580
any unnecessary
misunderstandings, okay?

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,100
My birthday is on next week.

62
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,940
You remember, right?

63
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,240
I'm thinking about

64
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,900
hosting a birthday party
at Moonlight Hotel.

65
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,980
Let's all have some fun together.

66
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,620
What do you think?
Will you come?

67
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,580
I'm busy.

68
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,980
I'll send someone
to deliver the gifts.

69
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,700
Sister Yao,

70
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,220
you wouldn't reject me too, would you?

71
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,660
Do you have nothing better to do?

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,860
You just have
to mess with my date.

73
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,060
The birthday girl has the say.

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,940
Your friend is my friend.

75
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,540
How could I not invite her?

76
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,660
Sister Yao.

77
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,460
You wouldn't turn me down, right?

78
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,180
Come on, join us.

79
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,860
If you come, Anlan will too.

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,880
I want him to come.

81
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,140
Okay, sure.

82
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,300
Really?

83
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,420
That's great!

84
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,380
Then we'll see you there.

85
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,580
Bye.

86
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,460
See you.

87
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
Thanks for treating me
to lunch today.

88
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,220
I had a great time.

89
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,580
If so,

90
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,380
shouldn't your husband

91
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,540
get some kind of reward?

92
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,660
Next time, it's my treat.

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,340
No way.

94
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,060
From now on,
I'm paying for every meal.

95
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,540
I don't want this reward.

96
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,660
Then what do you want?

97
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,900
Lord of All.

98
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,140
You're neglecting your Tianxia Gang,

99
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,940
but flirting with our leader.

100
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,380
Is that really appropriate?

101
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
Hey, if Baihua Hall

102
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,100
needs any equipment, just ask.

103
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,740
Deal.

104
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,860
I'll accept your bribe.

105
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,980
I didn't see anything.

106
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,500
Bye.

107
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,260
I'm heading back too.

108
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,940
Madam.

109
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,140
Keep me in mind.

110
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,100
Sure.

111
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,460
Boss, just a reminder.

112
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,860
Don't forget
your family gathering later.

113
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,860
Just tell them I have a stomachache
and I can't make it.

114
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,740
Last time you said that,

115
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,860
your family sent an ambulance
straight to our door.

116
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,500
Then there's no other way?

117
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,300
Other way?

118
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,140
Yes, there is.

119
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,740
That is,

120
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,780
stop making excuses,

121
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,980
and just go.

122
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm heading out.

123
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,540
Go away.

124
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,660
Big Brother,

125
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,740
this time,

126
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,060
when are you leaving again?

127
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,740
I can't stay long.

128
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,060
I have to fly back next week.

129
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,100
Stay a few more days.

130
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,220
Why the rush?

131
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,060
Well.

132
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,540
I'd like to stay a few more days.

133
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,820
To spend time with Mom and Dad.

134
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,100
Brother, I need to talk to you about
something serious.

135
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,220
These two cubs.

136
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,620
Hello, everyone.

137
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,740
Anlan, you're finally home.

138
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,020
Mom missed you so much.

139
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,740
Didn't we just see
each other last month?

140
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,700
That was two months ago.

141
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,740
You're just like your dad.

142
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,220
Always too busy to keep track of time.

143
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,380
Anlan.

144
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,860
I've heard your business

145
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,380
has been going really well lately.

146
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,220
Right?

147
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,530
Mom and Dad are here.

148
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,460
Anlan.

149
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,340
Come on, everyone, be seated.

150
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,860
It's so good to have you back.

151
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,540
Grandma missed you a lot.

152
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,340
Tell the kitchen

153
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,460
to make more dishes.

154
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,940
Grandma, please sit down.

155
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,780
Sure, okay.

156
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,150
Come on.

157
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,940
Ancheng.

158
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,220
Mr. Zhou called me.

159
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,420
He thanked you for the red wine.

160
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,500
He praised you for being so thoughtful.

161
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,780
My pleasure.

162
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,460
Anlan.

163
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,740
Your company,

164
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,380
when will it go public?

165
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,620
No plans for that yet, Grandpa.

166
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,140
Oh.

167
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,180
I think it's time

168
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,660
to get Anlan back

169
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,740
to help with the family business.

170
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,380
He's left the family business

171
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,340
for his own startup.

172
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,100
Oh, by the way.

173
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,540
There's a rumor

174
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,180
going around out there

175
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,860
that the father and son
aren't getting along.

176
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,220
Talking about the family business,

177
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,220
Ancheng is attending to it.

178
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,180
Anlan has always been

179
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,100
like his dad,

180
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,260
independent

181
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,460
and ambitious.

182
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,260
Now he's got his chance,

183
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,740
who could stop him?

184
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,900
He might even surpass Wenhua.

185
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Who knows?

186
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,700
We're finally having
a family get-together.

187
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,620
Let's not talk about work.

188
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,620
Come on, cheers.

189
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,620
Yeah.

190
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,060
Cheers.

191
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,330
Mom, Dad.

192
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,180
Yeah.

193
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,100
You should more focus on

194
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,620
when they are getting married?

195
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,700
They're both so outstanding.

196
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,980
Don't worry, everyone.

197
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,420
When we find the right person,

198
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,500
we'll definitely let you know.

199
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
About this,

200
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,460
I think we should decide for ourselves.

201
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
You always say that.

202
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,380
Good opportunities don't wait around.

203
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,900
Hey. Sister-in-law,

204
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,300
Liu Heng has a daughter.

205
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,460
She's about to finish her studies
and return home.

206
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,660
What's wrong with you?

207
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,220
Stomachache.

208
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,460
But why did you cough?

209
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,300
All good.

210
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,980
- It's all good.
- Come on.

211
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,300
No more talks,
so I can digest my food.

212
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,460
Let's eat, everyone.

213
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,740
Come on, dig in.

214
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,260
Mom, Dad, have some more.

215
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,300
Mom, try this.

216
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,340
(Lord of All)

217
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,780
I've started learning painting, teacher.

218
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,020
It looks great.

219
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,580
The colors are so vibrant.

220
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,180
You usually prefer darker tones, no?

221
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,300
I switched to a new set of paints.

222
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,260
Can't I try something new?

223
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,540
I don't buy it.

224
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,860
I know what's going on.

225
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,340
You must be inspired by love.

226
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,140
That's why your paintings
are so romantic

227
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,140
and warm.

228
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
This is what they call

229
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,260
"The look reflects the heart."

230
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,380
Sis.

231
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,460
Is this the right way
to use this phrase?

232
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,820
Ugh, I don't care.

233
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,780
Let's go eat right now.

234
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,860
Come on, let's go.

235
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,340
Let's hurry up and eat.

236
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,300
I'm starving to death.

237
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,180
Hurry up, hurry up.

238
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,020
Let's go, let's go.

239
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,380
Great God always takes you out
for fine dining.

240
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,860
Can you still tolerate this?

241
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Why wouldn't I?

242
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,820
Still rice.

243
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,900
Still food.

244
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,750
It all goes into the stomach.

245
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
It's all the same.

246
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,900
Hey, honestly,

247
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,780
do you want to take things further

248
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,860
with Great God?

249
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,140
Someone like him

250
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
with money

251
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,380
and a good look

252
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,700
and the genuine care for you

253
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,780
is hard to come by.

254
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,380
I think you should

255
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,260
hold onto this

256
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,220
VIP golden ticket.

257
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,740
I'm not materialistic.

258
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,620
If I'm with him,

259
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,220
it's not because of his money.

260
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,340
Just eat.

261
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,300
Flower arranging takes patience.

262
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,540
Look at you,

263
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,860
what a mess.

264
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,700
You need a central theme.

265
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,620
Everything else

266
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
is just decoration.

267
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,980
Auntie,

268
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,060
have you heard about

269
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,780
when Anlan plans to get married?

270
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,340
You know Anlan,

271
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,940
he does things at his own pace.

272
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,340
No one can force him.

273
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,860
If he doesn't want to do something,

274
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,180
no one can change his mind.

275
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,660
So, Auntie, do you think

276
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,060
Anlan and I are a good match?

277
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,940
I think you are.

278
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,780
But Anlan has to feel the same way.

279
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,620
Right?

280
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,740
That's true,

281
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,620
but if you like me,

282
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,580
could you put in a good word for me

283
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,980
in front of Anlan?

284
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,300
If you mention me more,

285
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,580
he'll know how good I am.

286
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,380
Sure.

287
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,660
I'll definitely speak well of you.

288
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,380
But you know

289
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,460
what Anlan is like.

290
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,660
Don't get too clingy with him.

291
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,620
But if I don't,
it might be too late.

292
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,820
What?

293
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,820
Never mind.

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,860
So,

295
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,700
(Celebrities Speak)
wealthy and powerful people

296
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,940
are more likely to fail than
the average person in a relationship.

297
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,480
Especially when their partner

298
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,980
comes from a different background.

299
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,850
Why do wealthy marriages often fail?

300
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
Because everyone holds onto

301
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,790
beautiful illusions.

302
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,860
At first, you might mistakenly believe,

303
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,660
you're the prince
who turned into a frog,

304
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,980
or the sparrow
that makes it to the top branch.

305
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,820
But over time,

306
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,420
the differences between you

307
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
become more and more apparent.

308
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Wen Cheng

309
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,500
will say anything to make money.

310
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,900
He's spouting nonsense

311
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,100
about sparrows and frogs.

312
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,620
He's also single

313
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,700
and yet he talks like
some kind of expert.

314
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,900
(Li Ao)

315
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,020
Wen Cheng's spouting nonsense again.

316
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,180
Fairy tales don't come true.

317
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,780
Love still has to face
real-world pressures.

318
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,820
(Celebrities Speak)

319
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,660
Ladies,

320
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,820
in the end,
frogs don't turn into princes

321
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,540
and sparrows remain sparrows.

322
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,980
So the sweeter a guy's words,

323
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,260
the more cautious you should be.

324
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,620
(Wen Cheng)

325
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,320
Hello.

326
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,220
Where are you?

327
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,860
Sugar?

328
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,740
Guess.

329
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,000
You're the one who claims
to understand rich guys best.

330
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,380
Oh, stop it.

331
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,960
The show needs to be entertaining.

332
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,620
I was not filming a documentary.

333
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,660
If Yao Yuan watches your show…

334
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,220
Don't worry.

335
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,580
She is an educated person.

336
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,300
She wouldn't watch that silly thing.

337
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,780
Even if Sister-in-law doesn't watch it,

338
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
she might hear something.

339
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
Her cousin

340
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,580
seems like the gossipy type.

341
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,340
And seeing you on stage

342
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,940
speaking so vividly,

343
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,780
it must be about someone close.

344
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,660
Putting it together,
it's obvious that…

345
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,860
Don't try to stir up trouble.

346
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,780
It's definitely not about her.

347
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,100
Then who is it about?

348
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,700
Su Wen.

349
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,580
The production team
wanted to use my words

350
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,620
on a special about Su Wen.

351
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,100
I heard

352
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,540
he's trying to pursue
our CEO's daughter.

353
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,180
Probably wanted to screw him up,

354
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,670
so he won't succeed.

355
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,830
Su Wen might not come from
a wealthy family,

356
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,650
but he's handsome and well-educated.

357
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,260
These people

358
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,300
are unbelievable.

359
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,460
What does this have to do with you?

360
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,540
I'm the love expert.

361
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,700
I've never failed before.

362
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,820
The only time I misjudged someone,

363
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,780
it was because of him.

364
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,020
- Come on, come on.
- Have a drink.

365
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,860
Cheers.

366
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,180
Xiaoning,

367
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,220
let me show you a magic trick.

368
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,060
Sure.

369
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,340
Watch closely.

370
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,000
Impressive, right?

371
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,220
What are you doing here?

372
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,660
I heard all the beauties
in the city are gathered here.

373
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,700
So I came to check it out.

374
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,340
Didn't expect

375
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,180
that it's true.

376
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,060
Hey, isn't he…

377
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,900
Su Wen?

378
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,600
He's even more interesting
than his work.

379
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,180
Let me introduce…

380
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,060
Su Wen.

381
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,900
A photographer.

382
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,220
Mind if we sit here?

383
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,140
Not at all.

384
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,780
Hi there.

385
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,900
Let's drink.

386
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,140
He was there that day.

387
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,790
How could he not know
I was pursuing Xiaoning?

388
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,350
Even Li Ao could tell.

389
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,020
The point is,

390
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,740
I'd been chasing Xiaoning
for half a year.

391
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,780
He only took one night

392
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,860
to steal her from me.

393
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,380
So how long were they together?

394
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,900
Seven days.

395
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,940
What, did he think he was a cicada?

396
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,100
I really can't stand that kind of guy.

397
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,680
A man who isn't loyal in relationships.

398
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,700
That's why I say,

399
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,300
someone like him

400
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,900
who has the attention
of so many women,

401
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,980
a golden boy,

402
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,540
just doesn't know
how to treat a woman right.

403
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,700
Sigh.

404
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,500
What's between you and Su Wen

405
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,580
is not my concern.

406
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,060
Just don't let it affect
me and Yao Yuan.

407
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,900
Seriously, didn't you learn anything

408
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,860
from my story?

409
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,100
Guys like Su Wen
are all over the place.

410
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,460
And your Madam is so beautiful.

411
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,700
You should keep an eye on her,

412
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,380
or you'd follow in my footsteps.

413
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,300
No one can beat me.

414
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,420
Hmph.

415
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,270
In terms of objective conditions,

416
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,410
that's true.

417
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,060
But love is very subjective.

418
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,940
Otherwise,
why are there so many beauties

419
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,140
walking around with beasts?

420
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,460
In terms of objective conditions,

421
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,820
that's true.

422
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,380
But love is very subjective.

423
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,180
Otherwise,
why are there so many beauties

424
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,540
walking around with beasts?

425
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,220
He rose to fame by capturing

426
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,180
the daily lives of ordinary people.

427
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,500
I think

428
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
he must be an attentive

429
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,860
and caring man.

430
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,460
So, is it because of him

431
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,700
that you got into photography?

432
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,870
No.

433
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,980
It's just something I enjoy.

434
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,220
Don't you think people are forgetful?

435
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,620
I often wonder

436
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,860
what's the most important moment

437
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
for a person?

438
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,060
So many things happen every day,

439
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,140
affecting our moods.

440
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,340
We tend to remember

441
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,700
the unhappy and unpleasant things.

442
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,660
But we often forget

443
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,700
that the happiest moments

444
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,580
are actually the simplest stuff.

445
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,140
I think a camera is a great tool.

446
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,780
It helps us capture these moments,

447
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,500
so we won't forget them.

448
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Hearing you say that,

449
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,940
I feel like learning photography too.

450
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
But it's undeniable

451
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,340
that Su Wen does have

452
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,620
some influence on me.

453
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,020
(First date at a Western restaurant
to show her importance.)

454
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,020
(Stay by her side constantly, making her used
to your presence.)

455
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,790
(The plan didn't mention a rival in love.)

456
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,180
(Lord of All)

457
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,980
Hello.

458
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,220
Where do you want to eat after work?

459
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,100
I can't.

460
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,110
My camera's broken.

461
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm heading to Geek Bus to get it fixed.

462
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,380
Perfect, I'm going there too.

463
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,420
Weren't we supposed to…

464
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,620
See you soon.

465
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,300
I've replaced the part for you.

466
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,700
The shutter should work now.

467
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,540
Thanks.

468
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,100
Smiles.

469
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,140
You two have fun.

470
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,420
Hi.

471
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,300
Whether in the game or in real life,

472
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,260
you always got bad moves.

473
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,540
What are you doing here?

474
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,740
None of your business.

475
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,100
Our light bulb burned out.

476
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,020
I came to buy a new one.

477
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,180
You can even fix lights?

478
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,020
What's wrong?

479
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,530
You can't be like this.

480
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,430
You'll never get a boyfriend.

481
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,020
Even if you know how,

482
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,860
you should pretend you don't.

483
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,380
So the only skill

484
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,660
you men can boast about

485
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,780
is of no use?

486
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,720
Do you have to build your confidence

487
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,960
by helping women

488
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,900
who can't even change a light bulb?

489
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,380
Look,

490
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,830
this girl is just too real.

491
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,500
Love needs a little bit lies.

492
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,820
What's a perfect match?

493
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,140
It's an illusion.

494
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,440
There's no such thing
as a perfect match.

495
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,900
You like animals, and he happens to be an
animal rights activist.

496
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,540
You think you're a perfect match?

497
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,460
No.

498
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,420
It's because you keep
posting about your cat

499
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,800
on your social media every day.

500
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,980
He's just playing to your interests.

501
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,420
Well said, well said!

502
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,820
This is a good bit.

503
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,610
It's way better than your analogies

504
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,420
like frogs,

505
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,620
sparrows,

506
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,460
and such.

507
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,300
So, what I'm saying is,

508
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,180
love is a product

509
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,020
of careful calculation.

510
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,140
The more he loves you,

511
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,380
the more he molds himself

512
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,340
to fit your expectations.

513
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,420
When they don't like you,

514
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,900
they just turn back into

515
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,020
that mess they used to be.

516
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,620
You're no different.

517
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,980
In front of someone you like,

518
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,860
you put on an act too.

519
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,620
There's no perfect match.

520
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,700
Love is finding

521
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
a pair of shoes that doesn't fit,

522
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,180
but you squeeze your feet

523
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,260
into them anyway.

524
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,100
And over time,

525
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,180
you get used to it.

526
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,700
That's how people grow old together.

527
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,780
I don't like this bit.

528
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,340
Can you be consistent
in your theories?

529
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,740
What's wrong with it?

530
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,940
It's too pessimistic.

531
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,740
I just want you to see the reality.

532
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,940
If you want to stay optimistic,

533
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,530
just pretend
you can't change a lightbulb.

534
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,580
I'm not a fan of that attitude.

535
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,460
You must've never worn ill-fitting shoes.

536
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,020
Within an hour,

537
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,940
your heels would be torn and bleeding.

538
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,780
Then you'd be sticking on band-aids,

539
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,620
thinking,

540
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,780
"These shoes just aren't for me."

541
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,900
"I'll never buy shoes like these again."

542
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,900
Love is the same.

543
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,980
It cannot be forced.

544
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
If you love someone,

545
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,420
you love everything about them.

546
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,620
We shouldn't force ourselves

547
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,220
to be what others want us to be.

548
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,740
Instead, we should

549
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,460
accept your love for who they are.

550
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,220
Even walking barefoot is fine,

551
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,580
as long as the person by your side

552
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,580
is the right one.

553
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,820
That's what love is.

554
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,180
Let's go.

555
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,340
Let's take a walk.

556
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,660
Sure.

557
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,220
What do you feel like eating?

558
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,820
I'll take you back after dinner.

559
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,020
What should we eat?

560
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,780
Let me think.

561
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,940
The heel broke.

562
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,500
Here we go.

563
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,620
Put me down, hurry!

564
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,220
I'm so grateful for these shoes.

565
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,580
Feeling better?

566
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,420
Much better.

567
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,020
Miss, the shoes are here.

568
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,940
Please try them on.

569
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,260
Madam, please try these.

570
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,020
- I'll do it.
– Let me.

571
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,860
Go help other guests.

572
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,260
I don't usually wear high heels.

573
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,980
Madam, you've been walking in
uncomfortable shoes

574
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,020
with me all day.

575
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,380
Consider this my apology.

576
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,380
Plus, you can wear them

577
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,380
for Fang Jianing's birthday party.

578
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,660
Alright.

579
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,660
Madam.

580
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
These shoes really
match your elegance.

581
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,020
So,

582
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
when you wear these shoes,

583
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,860
it'll be like I'm by your side.

584
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,700
No one can get close to you.

585
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,300
Mr. Jiang,
what are you looking for today?

586
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,540
I can help.

587
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,940
We'll just browse on our own.

588
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,700
Pick a tie for me.

589
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,740
Oh,

590
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,580
me?

591
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,480
Hmm.

592
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,730
You study painting.

593
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,900
You must have great taste.

594
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,710
You usually wear dark-colored suits.

595
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,740
A dark tie

596
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,060
would make you look too serious.

597
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
What?

598
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,380
Do I seem serious to you?

599
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,700
Sometimes.

600
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,100
But most of the time,

601
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,420
you're more like a kid.

602
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,380
You should try this one.

603
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,700
It looks smart.

604
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,100
Somewhere between gray and purple.

605
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,980
It'll make you look

606
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,860
both chill and yet composed.

607
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,620
How about this one?

608
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,860
I think it suits you perfectly.

609
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,300
This smiley face

610
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,460
can soften your sternness.

611
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,100
What's wrong?

612
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,700
What, do I look like
a stone-faced killer?

613
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,540
Not at all.

614
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,260
Come.

615
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,380

Your smile is just like his.

622
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,980
It's not the same.

623
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,220
Should we finish what we were

624
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,540
about to do earlier?

625
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,820

You're distracting me
from watching TV.

636
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,980
You're really scary.

637
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,220
Fine.

638
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,180
Cousin, has your relationship
with Jiang Anlan

639
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,380
driven you crazy?

640
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,380
You're crazy.

641
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,260
Wow, Jiang Anlan is really something.

642
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,340
Tell me,

643
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,660
who is this Yao Yuan?

644
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,620
What kind of person is Yao Yuan?

645
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,060
Why are you asking me?

646
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,220
Who else would I ask?

647
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,180
You know everything about Jiang Anlan.

648
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,340
Yao Yuan's Weibo only talks about art.

649
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,780
She never shares her personal thoughts.

650
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,100
What does she actually do?

651
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,940
What's her background?

652
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,300
She's an art exhibition planner.

653
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,940
Her life is simple.

654
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,380
There's nothing
gossip-worthy about her.

655
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,750
Is that all you wanted to know?

656
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,690
Art exhibition planner.

657
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,660
Right.

658
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,780
Impressive, isn't it?

659
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,100
Someone like her
who has a pretty face,

660
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,700
a rich inner world,

661
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,900
and also manners

662
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,480
would never interrupt someone's dinner,

663
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,100
or pry into others' personal lives.

664
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,380
You…

665
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
Long time no see.

666
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,780
Let's catch up another time.

667
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,660
This diner

668
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,580
is too small for you.

669
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,940
I did it for Jiang Anlan, not you.

670
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
This isn't enough.

671
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,340
Already round two!

672
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,940
Sir.

673
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,900
More, please.

674
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,740
Coming right up.

675
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,300
Get in the car.

676
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,820
My princess.

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,820
♪Teasing you, arguing with you♪

678
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,630

00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,580
Li Ao.

682
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,260
Huh?

683
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,700
(Police)

684
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,460
What are you doing?

685
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,860
Return the horse to the zoo, now.

686
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,060
Do you hear me?

687
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,980
Take the horse back to the zoo, hurry up.

688
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
Who are you?

689
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,300
I'm the Lord of All, Madam.

690
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,740
This piece of work

691
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,380
won Su Wen's first award

692
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,940
at the World Photography Exhibition.

693
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,700
It may look quite ordinary,

694
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,300
but if you pay close attention,

695
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,940
in the middle of the photo

696
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,260
where you see the smoke,

697
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,300
there is a person.

698
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,420
That person

699
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,500
is the highlight of this piece.

700
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,580
The photographer used natural lighting

701
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,540
with the smoky atmosphere

702
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,380
to conceal

703
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,300
what he truly wanted to express.

704
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,860
But it makes people even more curious

705
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,500
about what this piece is really saying.

706
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,180
If you can't see clearly, come closer.

707
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,020
Take a better look.

708
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,380
An old man.

709
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,580
Yes.

710
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,060
This is why Su Wen became famous.

711
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,740
His works

712
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,940
are beautiful yet tinged with irony.

713
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,860
While we appreciate the work,

714
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,020
we also become bystanders
to others' pain.

715
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,580
Sister Yao,

716
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,880
what's going on between
you and the Great God lately?

717
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,500
Nothing, why?

718
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,340
Oh.

719
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,740
You looked so happy before,

720
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,220
so I wasn't really worried.

721
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,580
But today, you seem a bit out of it.

722
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
Like something's bothering you.

723
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,980
I'm not bothered by anything.

724
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,900
It's just that

725
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,780
today's lecture was about this photo,

726
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,900
and I guess
I'm still caught up in that mood.

727
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,300
Oh.

728
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,040
But you've also said,

729
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,210
sometimes when we look at a piece of art,

730
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,220
we might project our own

731
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,310
inner state onto it.

732
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,380
No, everything is fine between us.

733
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,140
That's good to hear.

734
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Otherwise,

735
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,270
I wouldn't dare hit him.

736
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,290
Well, I wouldn't stand a chance anyway.

737
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,260
The Gang Leader wants to see you.
Come here immediately.

738
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,100
Great God?

739
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,700
Hey, Master.

740
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,700
I've always wanted to ask you something.

741
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,230
We're not that far apart in age, right?

742
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,940
Can you share some tips with me?

743
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,900
How did you build such a big company?

744
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,220
You can start working here
after graduation.

745
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,700
Really?

746
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,010
As long as you keep performing well,

747
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,220
and don't cause any trouble.

748
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,860
Oh, what trouble could I possibly cause?

749
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,700
Don't worry about it.

750
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,780
Take this to Yao Yuan for me.

751
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,580
Master wants it given to Madam.

752
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,700
What did the Lord of All give you?

753
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,060
You've even started a side job.

754
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,260
Being a courier, huh?

755
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,780
Stop saying Master or Madam.

756
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,900
Those who have no clue

757
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,390
might think we're from another era.

758
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,100
Yes, Sister-in-law.

759
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,220
Open it quickly.

760
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,940
Right now?

761
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,660
Of course, let's see what's inside.

762
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,060
It's definitely something good.

763
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,460
If it's food,

764
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,570
everyone gets a share.

765
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,300
If you don't like it,

766
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,740
I'll take it back for you.

767
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,860
I'm a professional courier.

768
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,380
Open it.

769
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,300
Then give us some privacy.

770
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,140
Alright.

771
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,940
Hurry up and open it.

772
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,740
Oh my God.

773
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,140
I couldn't afford this even
with three months' salary.

774
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,820
It pairs perfectly with those shoes.

775
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,460
The Great God really has an eye for style.

776
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,700
This gown was made just for you.

777
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,140
But for a gown,

778
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,220
shouldn't you try it on to be sure?

779
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,140
How does the Great God know your size?

780
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,220
In this world, only I

781
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,700
can buy a dress that fit you perfectly

782
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,580
without you trying it on.

783
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,100
But this Great God…

784
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,900
How far have you two gone?

785
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,540
Nowhere.

786
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,060
Then how does he know your size?

787
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,660
Did he measure with his hands
or a tape?

788
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,820
How did he know?

789
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,460
I don't know.

790
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,540
Hey, this is the school.

791
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,380
Stop it.

792
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,860
Something urgent?

793
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,540
Right.

794
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,380
I need to buy clothes.

795
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,620
But I don't know the size.

796
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,120
I don't look busy.

797
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,890
That's because I live at my own pace.

798
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,460
It doesn't mean I have nothing to do.

799
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,250
Why would I know anything about size?

800
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,380
Where's Li Ao?

801
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,940
Shouldn't he know all your sizes?

802
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,300
Do you really think
I'm buying clothes for myself?

803
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,860
If I didn't know the size,

804
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,660
I'd just buy every size available,

805
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,980
and try them on one by one.

806
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,100
I'm buying one for Yao Yuan.

807
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,780
That's easy.

808
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,690
Just do as you said.

809
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,420
Buy every size.

810
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,830
To show your wealth and thoughtfulness.

811
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,790
I'm sure she'd be impressed.

812
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,780
You think Yao Yuan is that shallow?

813
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,420
Of course not.
Sister-in-law is different.

814
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,860
What she wants

815
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,700
is definitely one in a million.

816
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,740
You can't just take a wild guess.

817
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,780
Have you ever put your arm
around her shoulder?

818
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,300
A bit narrower than yours.

819
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,780
What about her waist? Have you?

820
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,940
Alright, alright. That's enough.

821
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,900
This isn't getting us anywhere.

822
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,180
Come with me.

823
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,700
Hey.

824
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,740
Please have a seat for a moment.

825
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,380
We'll pick out some
for you to consider.

826
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,860
How does Sister-in-law's figure
compare to hers?

827
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,180
About the same height.

828
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,860
And

829
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,940
her?

830
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,140
A bit slimmer than her.

831
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,940
Xiaowen.

832
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
Bring a few more evening gowns
in different styles.

833
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,780
Sure.

834
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,900
Your girlfriend has such a perfect figure.

835
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,020
Of course.

836
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,420
It's alright.

837
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,300
No, no, no.

838
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,740
Too little fabric on the back.

839
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,340
Too much of an eye-catcher.

840
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
Get another one.

841
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,820
Okay.

842
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,020
How about this one?

843
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,540
Uh, this...

844
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,220
Isn't it too exposed?

845
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,020
A good figure needs exposure.

846
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,460
A good figure
isn't for others to gawk at.

847
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,180
Nothing too short
or with big opening.

848
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,540
Try another one.

849
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,380
Alright.

850
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,660
Sorry about that.

851
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,700
This guy who seems
to have had countless girlfriends

852
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,780
is actually inexperienced.

853
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
Could you help me find

854
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,620
something elegant but not revealing,

855
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,740
that shows sophistication

856
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,620
yet isn't tacky?

857
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,220
Sure, one moment please.

858
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,620
Are you really bringing Yao Yuan

859
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,780
to Fang Jianing's birthday party?

860
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,020
Not worried?

861
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,300
I got it.

862
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,220
No worries.

863
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,900
Besides,

864
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,580
it's a good chance
to introduce her to everyone

865
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,500
that she's my girlfriend.

866
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,220
What do you think of this one?

867
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,380
Elegant with a hint of allure,

868
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,220
yet not revealing.

869
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,980
Thank you.

870
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,950
Wow,

871
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,620
you look stunning.

872
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,540
I've always known you were beautiful
since we were kids,

873
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,420
but I never expected

874
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,780
that you could be this stunning.

875
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,900
Let me add the finishing touch for you.

876
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,180
Sit down, princess.

877
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,220
Once we're done with your makeup,

878
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,860
you'll be an angel.

879
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,740
Then you'll fly right
to the Great God.

880
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,140
You two will be like a match
made in heaven,

881
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,580
living freely above the clouds.

882
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,260
Oh, by the way.

883
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,180
Given that Fang Jianing

884
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,340
is throwing her birthday party
at the Moonlight Hotel,

885
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,230
she must be rich.

886
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,060
Like attracts like, you know.

887
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,220
Everyone attending her party

888
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,540
must be from wealthy families.

889
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,100
Won't you feel out of place?

890
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,540
After all, the way rich people think

891
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,540
is different from average people.

892
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,860
What's wrong with being different?

893
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,980
The Great God still

894
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,720
is completely devoted
to our Yao Yuan.

895
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,100
That's true, but,

896
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,890
you never know about others.

897
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,660
Why care about others?

898
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,100
She's dating the Great God.

899
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,460
As long as he treats her well, right?

900
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,140
Alright,

901
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,460
are you sure she's going
to a birthday party?

902
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,580
Not a Peking opera performance?

903
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,620
Goodness,
she'll scare people with that makeup.
