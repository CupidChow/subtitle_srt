I've seen much bigger spiders before.

Thanks.

37
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,300
The attack attribute

38
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,320
of your weapon is too low.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,840
How about

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,120
I give it to you?

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,100
No need.

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,040
I'm just here to watch.

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,440

Why did you come to Shengshi?

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,600
My brother said it's pretty fun.

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,640
Also, a chance to make friends.

Mr. Right

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,240
in your heart?

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,360
Oh, I'm right.

52
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,120
Well,

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm a cute single guy.

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,680
Consider me.

55
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,560
Everyone uses fake names in the game.

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,680
Who knows if your identity is real?

57
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,160
You saw how agile I was just now.

58
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,000
That shows in real life,

59
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm pretty good, too.

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,900
Actually,

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,560
I don't really like fighting.

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,840
How about we

63
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,160
go out for a walk?

64
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,360
What about

65
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,720
Ziyun Mountain?

66
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,980
Sure.

67
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,880
Well.

68
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,840
When will you be online next?

69
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,600
Probably on weekends.

70
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,030
Weekends?

71
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,900
Yeah.

72
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,280
What time will it be?

73
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,560
Sorry.

74
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,000
I know it's been tough on everyone.

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,640
So,

76
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,020
starting today,

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,370
all active employees

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,000
will take rotational leave.

79
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,980
Rotational leave?

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,960
What does that mean?

81
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,390
Are we being put on unpaid leave?

82
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,340
Are you okay with unpaid leave?

83
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,280
Of course.

84
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,020
I'm willing to stand
with the company through this.

85
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,020
Master,

86
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,960
but how long

87
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,160
will the unpaid leave last?

88
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't worry.

89
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,800
Everyone

90
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,920
will be on paid leave.

91
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,600
Since the funding is in place,

92
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,340
every department

93
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,320
must go all out now.

94
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,920
Sorry for exhausting you earlier.

95
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,420
I want everyone to take rotational leave

96
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,700
to recharge and regain strength,

97
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,760
so we can face the challenges ahead.

98
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,200
Also,

99
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,660
I've reflected on myself
during this period.

100
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,500
At its core, this crisis

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,920
was due to my misjudgment.

102
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,040
In the future,
I want you to question me,

103
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,200
challenge me,

104
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,100
and even overturn my decisions

105
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,280
from different angles.

106
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,240
I trust you,

107
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,560
and I believe you deserve that trust.

108
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,920
To improve internal order

109
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,120
and boost efficiency,

110
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,500
I plan to start by adjusting
employee performance.

111
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,160
I'll introduce
the 360° Evaluation System.

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,300
The employee being evaluated

113
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,880
can not only rate themselves

114
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,290
but also receive evaluations

115
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,540
from their superiors,

116
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,600
colleagues, subordinates,

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,420
and clients

118
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,020
through a 360° multi-dimensional review.

119
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,280
Good.

120
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,960
I agree.

121
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,400
By combining all these perspectives,

122
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,780
we can actually get

123
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,560
a more comprehensive and objective

124
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,040
employee performance score.

125
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,200
In the long run,

126
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,420
this will also help employees grow.

127
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,160
I agree as well.

128
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,840
Ancheng,

129
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,920
it seems the decision to make you GM

130
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,120
was the right one.

131
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,760
Directors, thanks for your support.

132
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,880
Jiulong needs to make some changes.

133
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,180
Employees should take the initiative

134
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,680
to do more for the company

135
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,400
through motivation and learning.

136
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,620
This proposal is worth considering.

137
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,960
Since everyone

138
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,240
has expressed agreement,

139
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,920
I'll accept the majority decision.

140
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,160
I've been on the board
for over a decade,

141
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,380
yet he sent a letter

142
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,820
asking me to step down immediately,

143
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,000
claiming that my performance score
was too low

144
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,400
and that I was ineffective.

145
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,480
After all these years,

146
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
you've always

147
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,960
supported Ancheng's rise,

148
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,040
but he changed so much

149
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,800
after becoming the GM,

150
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,320
showing no loyalty to the past.

151
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,560
This time, he went too far.

152
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,760
He's also taken out lots
of my trusted people.

153
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,680
Even if I have to quit the board,

154
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,680
I'll drag Ancheng down with me.

155
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,660
I've heard from reliable sources

156
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,840
that he plans to go after you next.

157
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,060
This...

158
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,940
How could he?

159
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,880
No way.

160
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,780
You don't believe it?

161
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,760
Why else could he have

162
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,380
taken out so many
of your trusted people?

163
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,080
Besides, I've heard

164
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,280
he talked to each of them
for a long time.

165
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,040
I've supported him all along,

166
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,400
and I know all his dealings.

167
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,520
He wouldn't do that.

168
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,580
So, I advise you

169
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,040
to strike first

170
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,600
before he exposes your secrets.

171
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,560
Think about the projects he's handled.

172
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,840
Any quid pro quos
with the clients and suppliers?

173
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,640
And the Yao capital withdrawal.

174
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,600
If you want to keep your position,

175
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,360
you should know what to do next.

176
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,440
Mom.

177
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
Are you still feeling chest tightness
or palpitations?

178
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,400
What do you think?

179
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,120
If you bring me

180
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
some good news,

181
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,640
my chest

182
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,400
would immediately feel better.

183
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,720
Mom,

184
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,200
I came back to tell you

185
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,260
that I don't want
to get married in secret.

186
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,360
You still want to marry her?

187
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,640
Mom,

188
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,240
I don't want to choose
between family and Yao Yuan.

189
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,360
I truly want to marry Yao Yuan.

190
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,340
We just want a simple wedding,

191
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,840
hoping for the family's acceptance.

192
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,960
Mom, do you believe me?

193
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,660
I do believe you, but...

194
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,320
Then trust my judgment.

195
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,080
If I can make my life better,

196
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,320
I have the right to choose my happiness.

197
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,400
Mom,

198
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,160
we're grown now.

199
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,980
We have to take responsibility

200
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,360
for our choices.

201
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,800
We'll prove it to you.

202
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,800
Hi, General Manager.

203
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,140
(Jiulong Group)

204
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,240
Hi, General Manager.

205
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,420
With such a big reform,

206
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,780
it'd surely upset the higher-ups.

207
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,540
He might end up being

208
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,800
the shortest-serving GM.

209
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,480
Chairman.

210
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,200
Come to my office now.

211
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,880
Okay.

212
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,580
Chairman,

213
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,520
you wanted to see me?

214
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,880
I received
a whistleblower letter about you.

215
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,640
Are you interested in it?

216
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,320
The letter says

217
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,540
your investments
over the years were based

218
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,120
on personal interests and connections.

219
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,200
Not only were you biased,

220
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,880
but you also accepted
benefits from clients,

221
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,540
which could be seen as kickbacks.

222
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,720
Chairman,

223
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,000
on major projects,

224
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,700
I did use conditional exchanges

225
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,880
as leverage in negotiations.

226
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,020
But I'd never accept or offer bribes.

227
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,940
That's a criminal act.

228
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,080
I'd never do that.

229
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,920
Let's put bribes aside.

230
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,480
Do you dare say to my face

231
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,080
that every project you worked on

232
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,580
is about maximizing
the company's profits

233
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,160
without any selfish motives at all?

234
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,200
I dare say so.

235
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,360
Then why did you decide

236
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,880
to cancel the investment

237
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,200
of Yao Yuan's parents
to win over Mr. Li?

238
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,860
You even let Mr. Li

239
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,000
use similar technology
to take over the whole market.

240
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,860
That capital withdrawal

241
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,060
was a conclusion reached
after professional analysis.

242
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,940
- I just...
- You traded with Mr. Li.

243
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,240
If you invested in Mr. Li's company,

244
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,240
he'd introduce projects to you,

245
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,440
improving your performance,

246
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,360
so you could become the GM.

247
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,000
Ancheng,

248
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,060
I've taught you to work with strategy.

249
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,720
Rationality comes first.

250
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,560
Once selfish desires
take root in your heart,

251
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,400
can you still
analyze problems rationally?

252
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,560
Didn't you justify the withdrawal

253
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,080
to secure your promotion?

254
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,680
Based on the data,

255
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,520
pulling out was the safer option.

256
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,080
But in terms of long-term planning,

257
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,960
I honestly can't say

258
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,700
that the decision
was completely rational.

259
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,760
Then admit you were wrong.

260
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,660
The company is already questioning
your decisions,

261
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,400
even doubting your abilities.

262
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,720
Here's what we'll do.

263
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,320
To stop this from escalating,

264
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,360
take a few days off.

265
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,880
Hi, General Manager.

266
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,020
Mr. Xie,

267
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,600
now you can finally enjoy retirement.

268
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,760
Exactly.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,140
After venting my frustration,

270
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm feeling so much better now.

271
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,600
Chen,

272
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,020
I took another look

273
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,660
at the revised plan from the Yao couple.

274
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,760
If we give them a year or two,

275
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,080
they could still turn things around.

276
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,740
Those are just your predictions.

277
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,180
Numbers

278
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,320
are what really hold weight.

279
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,000
Since we've rejected it,
let's stick to that.

280
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,360
Why bother?

281
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,480
I just think...

282
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,960
Don't forget

283
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,380
that Mr. Li's offer is better

284
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,240
and more conducive to the company.

285
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,000
Also,

286
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,500
he could surely give you a boost

287
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,320
to your promotion.

288
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,360
Trust me.

289
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,360
In terms of return on investment,

290
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,480
partnering with Mr. Li

291
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,520
has a promising future.

292
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,960
It'll be a win-win situation.

293
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,640
Why can't I have Dad's house?

294
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,920
Just go along with what he wants.

295
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,440
Let him give it to your brother
if he wants.

296
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,300
Just because I'm the younger one?

297
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,480
When Dad lost his job

298
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,400
or when he was sick,

299
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,140
I was the one taking care of him.

300
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,480
Why?

301
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,480
Stop arguing.

302
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,120
He must have his reason.

303
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,140
Don't make things messy.

304
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,080
Stop fighting.

305
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,100
How strange.

306
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,020
Our argument doesn't concern you.

307
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,960
I'm talking about you.

308
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,400
Why can't he fight for it?

309
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,780
Why do the kids
who meet everyone's expectations

310
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,960
have no right to claim
what they deserve?

311
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,700
Why don't you understand

312
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,160
their efforts and hopes?

313
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,760
Why force them to compromise

314
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,600
by your standards?

315
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,640
What have you compromised for them?

316
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,200
This...

317
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,360
What a strange man.

318
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,240
Bye.

319
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,414
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

320
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,360
Bye.

321
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,620
(Jiulong Group)

322
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,320
Every new employee

323
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,240
in the company

324
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,540
knows how

325
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,320
to assess potential rivals.

326
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,160
You tell me you misjudged them?

327
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,440
What exactly did you get right?

328
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,040
Don't call me dad at the company.

329
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm the Chairman.

330
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,480
Mixing business with personal
is your biggest mistake.

331
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,240
Why did Anlan get splashed
with water for no reason?

332
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,440
Don't just focus on the GM position.

333
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,480
You're still Anlan's brother.

334
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,360
(Ancheng,)

335
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,640
(am I being too hard on you?)

336
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,520
Mr. Jiang.

337
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,760
Mr. Jiang?

338
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,200
Mr. Lin,

339
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,680
Mr. Jiang isn't at the office again.

340
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,900
The files needing his approval

341
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,080
are still on his desk.

342
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,240
Should we ask the Chairman directly?

343
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,300
Clients are pressing for updates.

344
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm barely keeping up.

345
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,280
We can't delay this any longer.

346
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,360
You're not the only ones.

347
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,560
I have three urgent files waiting, too.

348
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,480
Chairman.

349
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,880
Please come in.

350
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,040
Chairman.

351
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,420
Mr. Jiang Ancheng

352
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,980
hasn't been at the office for two days.

353
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,200
Oh.

354
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,560
He's on vacation.

355
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,540
I see.

356
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,280
No wonder
we couldn't get through to him.

357
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,940
But

358
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,980
why didn't he appoint someone
to act in his place?

359
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,240
That's not like him at all.

360
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,420
Anything urgent
that needs his attention?

361
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,500
There are some urgent matters.

362
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,280
I'll handle them.

363
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,520
Thank you, Chairman.

364
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,020
Also,

365
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,140
I need to report the progress

366
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,100
on our investigation that you asked for.

367
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,080
Chairman, you wanted to see me?

368
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,200
You're really bold.

369
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,800
Who gave you that authority?

370
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,160
You've learned to be corrupt now?

371
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,600
You think having a little power

372
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,360
means no one can expose you, right?

373
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,900
Chairman, I...

374
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,840
See for yourself.

375
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,080
It's all in black and white.

376
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,120
The evidence is rock solid.

377
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,080
We noticed you a while ago.

378
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,260
A month ago, I sent people

379
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,820
to gather all the evidence against you

380
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,060
under the pretense of an audit.

381
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,520
Do you still want to deny it?

382
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,400
Chairman, this...

383
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,700
I know I was wrong.

384
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,980
I don't want to end up in jail.

385
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,280
That isn't up to you.

386
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,020
The police are already downstairs.

387
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,360
You're fired.

388
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,200
Get out.

389
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,080
Get out!

390
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,380
You scared me to death.

391
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,660
You walk around so quietly.

392
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,920
I wanted to surprise you.

393
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,640
You made all this?

394
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,720
Of course.

395
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,080
Let's just order takeout.

396
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,320
You don't believe me?

397
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,800
Of course, I do.

398
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,640
Looks like

399
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,480
you're ready to get married.

400
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,940
When my cooking's better,

401
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,300
I'll invite both our families over

402
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,600
to taste the dishes I make.

403
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,560
Sounds good.

404
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,320
Here's a call.

405
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,300
Hello?

406
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,240
Anlan,

407
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,760
have you heard?

408
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,660
Ancheng...

409
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,540
Don't rush. Take your time.

410
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,760
What happened to my brother?

411
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,060
Someone reported Ancheng

412
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,080
for bribery

413
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,020
and unclear project accounts.

414
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,180
They also blamed him

415
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,280
for the death of Yao's parents.

416
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,640
Mr. Jiang told him not to work.

417
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,880
He must be under a lot of pressure.

418
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,660
I've tried every way I could,

419
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,080
but I just can't reach him.

420
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,480
I don't believe Ancheng would do this.

421
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,440
Anlan, please help him, okay?

422
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,740
You have to help him.

423
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,860
Jianing, don't cry.

424
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,700
My brother is not an impulsive man.

425
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,200
He probably just wants to calm down.

426
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,240
I'll try to find him, okay?

427
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,200
What's wrong?

428
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,520
I have to call my brother.

429
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,530
Hello.

430
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,960
The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

431
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,990
Sorry...

432
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,120
His phone is off.

433
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,960
What's going on?

434
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,820
My brother got reported.

435
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,760
Dad is really angry

436
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,480
and wants to kick him
out of the company.

437
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,000
Ancheng

438
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,300
has always been strong-willed.

439
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,000
Hearing your dad say that about him,

440
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,340
he surely can't accept it.

441
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,360
Besides,

442
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,160
those opposing him

443
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,700
are even using your parents

444
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,120
as leverage against him.

445
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,960
Why do they have to dig up my old wounds

446
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,240
during internal conflicts?

447
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,720
Can you forgive my brother?

448
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,080
Anlan,

449
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,000
when I wanted to reconcile with you,

450
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,580
I had decided

451
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,960
not to blame anyone.

452
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,160
I don't want this hanging over us

453
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,120
for the rest of our lives.

454
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,280
Thank you.

455
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,000
I can't have dinner with you today.

456
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,980
I need to ask Li Ao and Wen Cheng

457
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,280
to bring my brother back with me.

458
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,900
I'll go with you.

459
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,800
Just stay quietly at home.

460
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,300
If my brother shows up here,

461
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,900
you have to keep him here.

462
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,200
Go now.

463
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,760
Have you been able

464
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,180
to reach him?

465
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,420
I've called him several times,

466
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,500
but he just won't pick up.

467
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,660
Come on, I believe Ancheng

468
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,940
won't just disappear

469
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,520
without a trace.

470
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,060
Ah.

471
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,000
Wenhua,

472
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,720
send more people out to look for him.

473
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,000
Mom,

474
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,480
he's not a kid anymore.

475
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,260
Nothing serious will happen.

476
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,480
It's all because of you.

477
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,380
You're too hard on him.

478
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,920
You put too much pressure on him.

479
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,400
If it weren't for you,

480
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,040
Ancheng wouldn't just disappear.

481
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,580
He's probably hiding somewhere,
feeling guilty.

482
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,000
No need to point fingers now.

483
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,720
What's done is done.

484
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,360
Does blaming me help?

485
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,920
Honestly, he should take

486
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,720
most of the responsibility.

487
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,780
That is unfair

488
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,100
to Ancheng.

489
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,540
Then tell me what is fair.

490
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,600
Enough.

491
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,360
We've searched everywhere.

492
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,560
Ancheng, where are you?

493
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,180
Boss.

494
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,640
Any news?

495
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,920
The Equestrian Club
said he never showed up.

496
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,900
The gym said Ancheng had a reservation.

497
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,760
But no one saw him there.

498
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,540
Zhang He is with me at his place.

499
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,320
He hasn't come back.

500
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,040
Jianing.

501
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,660
Don't panic; don't cry.

502
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,880
Nothing will happen to him.

503
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,280
But I can't figure out

504
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,080
where he is.

505
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,780
Master, let's keep searching.

506
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,880
Stay in touch.

507
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,560
Thank you all.

508
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,400
Ancheng must be really upset.

509
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,480
He's been bottling everything up.

510
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,720
Do you know?

511
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,120
Even if the whole family

512
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,720
has always compared him to me

513
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,980
and set unrealistic expectations

514
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,040
for him,

515
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,080
he still loves me

516
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,840
and supports me a lot.

517
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,520
Whenever we argue,

518
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,760
he's always the first to give in.

519
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,600
That has never changed.

520
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,640
Ancheng.

521
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,420
I was in a meeting.

522
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,480
What do you need?

523
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,980
There's a competition.

524
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,440
You have to be on my team.

525
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,560
A competition?

526
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,900
Why not ask Wen Cheng?

527
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,740
I did,

528
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,640
but he said a junior girl
is heartbroken.

529
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,580
He needs to comfort her.

530
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,760
So, here I am.

531
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,020
What competition?

532
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,640
Go for it!

533
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,700
You called me here to drink beer?

534
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
Of course not.

535
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,160
I'm here for the prize.

536
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,860
Hurry up, you must win.

537
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,260
Right now, two teams

538
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,380
are way ahead of the others.

539
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,360
(Beer Drinking Contest)
Applaud for them!

540
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,980
Ancheng, go for it!

541
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,660
Come on!

542
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,120
Go for it!

543
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,920
- They might be dark horses.
- Nothing

544
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,420
- They're skinny,
- has been decided.

545
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,450
but their pace is steady.

546
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,420
- They won't last long.
- Only one team can win.

547
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,920
The last cup has 1,000 cc

548
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,080
and requires teamwork.

549
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,400
I got this.

550
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,440
Come on, let's cheer them on!

551
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,460
Go for it!

552
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,310
Can you handle it?

553
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:28,260
Go for it!

554
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,800
Let me.

555
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,300
Another team dropped out.

556
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,900
Only the last two teams remain.

557
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,300
Our champion is about to be decided.

558
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,240
Go for it!

559
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,560
You got this!

560
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,540
Congrats to the Brother Team.

561
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,880
They've won!

562
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,340
Nice!

563
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,620
You can really hold your liquor.

564
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,600
You're so heavy.

565
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,820
Try to walk straight.

566
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,420
I drank so much; surely, I'm heavy.

567
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,300
Ancheng.

568
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,160
Did we win?

569

how could we lose?

571
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,790
Awesome!

572
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,920
Finally, we've won the Bolonor Cup

573
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,380

574
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,810
What do you mean?

575
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,440
It's won for us.

576
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,600
Ancheng, if Dad knew we drank this much,

577
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,880
he'd surely punish us.

578
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,660
Just don't tell him.

579
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,920
Alright, it's a secret.

580
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,240
He doesn't like drinking at all.

581
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,220
That night, he drank

582
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,360
so much beer for me.

I couldn't find you anywhere.

I'm really worried.

It doesn't matter anymore.

But still,

620
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,680
I just can't beat Anlan.

621
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,800
I'm the eldest son.

622
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,640
From the moment I was born,

623
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,720
my responsibilities were set.

624
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,680
So what if I became the GM?

625
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,640
No one really cares

626
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,040
whether I like that position.

627
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,840
At the moment

628
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,520
I was appointed,

629
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,840
I didn't feel happy at all.

630
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,880
Was I just numb,

631
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,880
or was I

632
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,360
feeling guilty?

633
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,040
I had no idea.

634
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,080
This was the first time
you shared your feelings with me.

635
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,200
Am I really that bad?

636
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,320
I often make choices

637
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,880
that even I don't understand.

638
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,320
I do things

639
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,530
that don't feel like me.

640
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,240
Which one is the real me?

641
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,340
Maybe Jiang Ancheng doesn't even exist

642
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,880
in this world at all.

643
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,800
You can find yourself again.

644
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,920
You used to wrap yourself up
too perfectly.

645
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,120
I know you've always been kind to me,

646
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,680
but I always felt a distance between us

647
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,840
until recently.

648
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,760
Though things lately haven't been great,

649
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,480

give me the couple bracelet again.

Ancheng,

00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,720
these days must be tough on you.

678
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,960
I was doing fine.

679
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,840
I've put too much pressure on you.

680
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,960
Do you hate me?

681
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,520
You only want what's best for me.

682
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,560
These are things I have to go through.

683
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,160
Actually, you've been very mature.

684
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,600
You've borne every bit of pressure

685
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,680
from everyone at home.

686
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,440
I've been thinking quietly these days.

687
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,200
I should apologize to you.

688
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,240
I forced onto you

689
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,440
both what you wanted,

690
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,480
and what you didn't.

691
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,360
I'm truly sorry.

692
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,280
Dad,

693
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,400
please don't say that.

694
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,680
You're only so strict with me

695
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,720
because you want me to be a leader.

696
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,640
I understand all of that.

697
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,400
Maybe you think

698
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm too lenient with Anlan.

699
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,360
But my love and hopes for you and Anlan

700
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,720
are the same.

701
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,920
Anlan,

702
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,360
he's like a wild horse
on the African plains.

703
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,460
You have to let him be free

704
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,640
and let him run.

705
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,200
And you

706
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,520
are like me when I was young.

707
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,560
I want to keep you close,

708
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,040
quietly watching you grow up.

709
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,920
Dad.

710
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,200
Actually,

711
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,760
a father

712
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,160
is not afraid of the child falling.

713
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,520
What worries him is

714
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,120
how the child gets back up

715
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,800
after falling.

716
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,840
Just like this time.

717
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,000
Once I become harsh on you,

718
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,800
you can't handle it.

719
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,880
I'm too fragile,

720
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,680
not strong enough.

721
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,120
Sorry for making you worry.

722
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,680
Ancheng,

723
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,360
I want to tell you something.

724
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,180
Don't care too much
about what others think.

725
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,480
I believe after this,

726
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,680
you'll grow more mature.

727
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,960
Sometimes,

728
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,960
you have to dare
to speak your true thoughts.

729
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,200
After some time to reflect,

730
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,640
Dad,

731
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,680
I've decided to resign.

732
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,120
I'm planning to move out.

733
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,440
Just like you said,

734
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,600
I'm already an adult.

735
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,000
I have the right to choose
the life I want.

736
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,280
Whether I'm working hard for myself

737
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,720
or dedicating myself to others,

738
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,160
it's all part of my growth.

739
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,160
The doubt,

740
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,680
jealousy,

741
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,480
confusion,

742
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,880
and even repression

743
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,040
inside me

744
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,240
will all become my nourishment.

745
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,040
So, this time,

746
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,320
I want to live for myself.

747
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,320
I'm surprised.

748
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,160
I didn't expect you to say that.

749
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,120
I'm truly surprised.

750
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,960
But more than anything, I'm moved.

751
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,200
You've grown up.

752
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,040
It's time for me to let go.

753
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,880
Okay.

754
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,480
From now on,

755
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,560
I'll support every decision

756
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,160
you make.

757
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,720
