33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,790
Sounds good.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,980
Let's tackle the mission first.

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,260
I really want that Sun-Moon Bow.

36
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,940
Hurry up, let's go finish the mission.

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,340
For Thy Sake, you're here too.

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,940
I was just looking for you
for the mission.

39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,900
Didn't you just

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,740
go through a breakup?

41
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,940
Why are you back online?

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,020
My ex came to see me today.

43
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,310
He said he regrets it and

44
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,820
wants me to give him another chance.

45
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,100
You didn't agree, did you?

46
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,730
It's obvious he's just fooling you.

47
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,660
I know that isn't a good idea.

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,540
But he seemed really sincere.

49
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,540
And I started remembering how happy

50
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,380
we were back then.

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,580
I told you, you're too easily swayed.

52
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,940
Learn from Xinran.

53
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,220
No matter how Zhuang Wei fusses,

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,180
she stays unmoved.

55
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,540
Hey.

56
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,380
Are you really

57
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,850
reconsidering?

58
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,350
Don't do that.

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,660
Don't forget what happened

60
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,940
when I got back with my ex.

61
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,980
I know.

62
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,260
He even packed up the toothpaste.

63
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,180
Not just the toothpaste,

64
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,300
he even took the remaining tissues.

65
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,300
Never get back to your ex.

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,980
Can you two stop already?

67
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,580
Every time we meet,
it's all about this thing.

68
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,980
Is it that hard to just play a game?

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,460
Alright.

70
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,140
We're here to complete the mission.

71
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,660
Yeah.

72
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,540
Let's head to the Tianxia Gang.

73
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,340
Why the Tianxia Gang?

74
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,780
There are four of us, right?

75
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,980
Perfect for the mission.

76
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,500
We could use a few extra shields.

77
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,840
Wander Wherever seems good.

78
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,660
Isn't that what I'm here for?

79
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,360
It's better to have
someone else take the hits.

80
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,260
But the mission
only allows four people in.

81
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,100
Why bring so many shields?

82
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,300
I'll find someone skilled.

83
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,150
Someone who can heal us.

84
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,180
Aren't you

85
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,420
talking about Wen Cheng?

86
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,700
Alright, let's do it.

87
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,740
Hey.

88
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,620
What brings you here?

89
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,820
We want to borrow some people

90
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,100
to tackle the mission.

91
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,220
Didn't expect here to be so quiet.

92
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,540
Boss is working overtime.

93
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,300
Wen Cheng's been
in a bad mood lately, barely online.

94
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,940
Why is he in a bad mood?

95
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,660
Because he...

96
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,600
He got mud on his pants.

97
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
Just wash it off then.

98
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,580
He already did.

99
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,940
Still wearing a sour face.

100
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,180
Is mud really that hard to clean?

101
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,540
It is.

102
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,300
Like some feelings.

103
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,500
Can't let go no matter how you try.

104
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,420
What are you talking about?

105
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,300
I don't get it.

106
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,460
What's wrong with all of them?

107
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,480
Always talking about

108
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,340
going back to exes.

109
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,220
Can't believe it.

110
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,380
I don't think that's what they mean.

111
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,780
You're just being too sensitive.

112
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,620
Be honest with me.

113
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,660
Why is he in a bad mood?

114
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,140
Actually,

115
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,020
it's because of you.

116
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,740
How did I upset him?

117
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,470
He said you can't let go of
your connection with Zhuang Wei.

118
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,540
Zhuang Wei is clearly a jerk.

119
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,420
Those were Wen Cheng's exact words.

120
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm just passing them along.

121
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,100
Zhuang Wei is obviously a jerk.

122
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,140
But you act like you're blind to it

123
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,980
and can't see.

124
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
Don't glare at me.

125
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,620
He's the one who said all this.

126
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,060
If you two have issues,
just talk face to face.

127
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,160
Why drag me into the middle?

128
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,870
Why would he be upset because of me?

129
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,230
For the same reason as

130
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,860
you worry about him.

131
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,450
I'm not worried about him.

132
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,300
I'm tired.

133
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,260
I'm logging off.

134
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,140
Xinran, I'm heading upstairs.

135
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,300
Okay.

136
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,780
Is the signal acting up?

(Lord of All)

138
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,620

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,620
Yeah.

140
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,900
I miss you.

141
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,260
If Xinran and Wen Cheng

142
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,980
keep this up,

143
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,380
I think their feelings
will just fade away.

144
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,860
They're both too stubborn.

145
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Neither admits they need the other.

146
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,100
They think caring means losing.

147
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,020
So what should they do?

148
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,980
They need to realize,

149
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,900
love isn't about winning or losing.

150
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,130
It's about both winning together.

151
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,020
The one who speaks first

152
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,220
isn't the weaker one.

153
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,860
It's about being willing to take risks.

154
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,380
That's what makes someone brave.

155
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,660
You're quite the talker.

156
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,340
Isn't that just common sense?

157
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,180
If Wen Cheng were half as brave as me,

158
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,260
they'd be celebrating their
one-month anniversary by now.

159
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,700
Guess I should thank you then.

160
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,580
Thank you

161
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,620
for being so brave with me.

162
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,540
Of course.

163
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,200
You should get some rest now.

164
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,740
Stop thinking about them.

165
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,180
If they're meant to be,

166
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,180
they'll be together eventually.

167
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,660
Hmm.

168
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,020
Worrying won't help anyway.

169
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,030
Good night.

170
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,700

Okay. Where are you going?

177
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,340
So formally dressed?

178
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,820
Are you meeting his parents?

179
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,700
What parents?

180
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,700
Uncle's restaurant just opened.

181
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,260
He wants me to cut the ribbon

182
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,500
and grab a meal there too.

183
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,380
This isn't another scam, is it?

184
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,460
It's already open.

185

he'll get tricked again.

Everyone deserves a second chance,

190
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,100
especially when it's family.

191
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,020
Alright, then go ahead.

192
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,940
I'll bring some friends over
to support him.

193
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,540
I knew you were still soft inside.

194
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,820
Don't forget to reach out to Wen Cheng.

195
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,620
Ugh.

196
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,060
Why did you have time

197
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
to ask me out for breakfast?

198
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,230
I just thought we

199
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,540
haven't seen each other in a while.

200
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,980
Come on.

201
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,900
I figured it was about

202
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,660
Jianing starting at my company, right?

203
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,780
You know how it is.

204
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,340
Jianing

205
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,540
hasn't done anything.

206
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,060
She can't handle criticism,

207
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,100
especially from you.

208
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,100
I hope you'll go easy on her

209
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,460
for my sake.

210
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,580
Give her more chances.

211
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,860
If I really treated her differently

212
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,180
like what you said,

213
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
I'd be harming her.

214
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,540
Have you forgotten?

215
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,060
When you first started
your internship here,

216
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,020
because of your background,

217
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,580
everyone

218
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,700
looked at you differently.

219
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,660
Do you want Jianing
to go through the same?

220
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,820
You're right.

221
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,180
Don't worry.

222
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,020
I'll treat everyone equally.

223
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,020
If she does well, I'll reward her.

224
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,860
If she doesn't,

225
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,780
I'll have to criticize.

226
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,620
Though I'm strict,

227
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,620
I believe it's

228
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
for her own good.

229
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,460
I'm counting on you to help Jianing.

230
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,780
This meal's on me.

231
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,900
I hope she can understand

232
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,780
what you've done for her.

233
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,380
Ancheng,

234
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,020
lately,

235
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,900
how's it going with Jianing?

236
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,700
It's alright.

237
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,620
How about your job?

238
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,460
Is it going smoothly?

239
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,620
Just the usual.

240
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,740
Excuse me.

241
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,260
How's the food so far?

242
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,020
Mr. Shi,

243
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,300
your dishes are amazing!

244
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,740
Absolutely.

245
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,820
I never eat carrots,

246
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,220
but I could eat a whole pound
of the ones

247
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,060
in your braised brisket.

248
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,380
Thank you, thank you.

249
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,660
I personally check all the ingredients.

250
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,420
Last time, I found

251
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,180
worms in some carrots,

252
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,060
so I threw out

253
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,180
the entire batch,

254
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,780
just to make sure you all eat well.

255
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,500
Please enjoy, take your time.

256
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,140
Yuan,

257
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,620
is the food enough?

258
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
It's great, no need for more.

259
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,860
Uncle.

260
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,100
I heard you say earlier,

261
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,180
some of that batch had issues,

262
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,100
so you discarded all of them?

263
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,060
Isn't that a bit wasteful?

264
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,100
I only want the customers

265
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,980
to eat healthily.

266
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,620
Boss.

267
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,020
Perfect timing.

268
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
Let me introduce you.

269
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,420
This

270
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,380
is my niece,

271
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,220
Yao Yuan.

272
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,300
He's our store manager.

273
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,660
I spent a fortune to poach him

274
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,020
from a high-end restaurant.

275
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,500
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

276
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,060
What's up? Need something?

277
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,260
Boss, over there.

278
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,180
We just got a new batch of potatoes.

279
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,900
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

280
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,460
Anlan.

281
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,660
Anlan.

282
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,180
Today's my first day at work.

283
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,580
Could you show me around

284
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,980
so I'd get familiar with the place?

285
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,900
Didn't you intern here before?

286
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,380
You even learned to make coffee
and use the printer.

287
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,100
How could you not know this place?

288
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,380
Oh.

289
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
It's a different department.

290
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,100
I get shy in new environments.

291
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,980
I need a familiar face to feel at ease.

292
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,540
You.

293
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,360
Take her to the planning department.

294
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,980
Master.

295
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,900
No problem at all.

296
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,000
I said someone familiar.

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,920
Don't worry.

298
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,410
He can get along with anyone.

299
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,860
Please go ahead.

300
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,900
Anlan.

301
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,940
I knew you wouldn't want me to go.

302
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,420
You're overthinking it.

303
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,980
I'm assigning your first task.

304
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,260
Sure, mission accepted.

305
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,300
One of our partner companies

306
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,900
is about to launch a new makeup line.

307
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,140
Go interview young people on the street

308
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,500
and see what their views are

309
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,460
on cosmetics.

310
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,860
Got it.

311
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,180
What kind of task is it?

312
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,220
Why do I not have

313
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,060
any assignments?

314
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,420
How come I didn't know?

315
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,280
Slow down, slow down.

316
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,300
Hey, don't follow me.

317
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,260
No, no.

318
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,220
Don't I have any assignments?

319
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,460
I'm going to look for some info.

320
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,620
Don't follow me.

321
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,940
No need, no need.

322
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,100
When will you learn to be polite?

323
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,180
When you stop asking that, I guess.

324
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,020
You wanted to see me?

325
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,380
Chance has changed his mind.

326
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,820
He wants you back to shoot a cover.

327
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,700
Do you want to?

328
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,180
Of course I don't.

329
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,300
Okay.

330
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,140
So I refused him for you.

331
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,060
I won't let my people

332
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,620
be ordered around like this.

333
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,200
But I still want to ask you.

334
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,340
You've been down lately.

335
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,780
Is it because you lost your job

336
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,380
or because the one took your job

337
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,220
was your ex-girlfriend?

338
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,460
How did you find out?

339
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,340
The whole industry knows.

340
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,180
Someone's bound to tell me

341
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,740
anything related to you.

342
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,540
Do you think she did it unintentionally?

343
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,780
I want to believe she didn't mean it.

344
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,980
But even if she did it on purpose,

345
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,380
I don't really care.

346
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,700
Honestly, I'm kind of glad

347
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,260
that I can help her.

348
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,660
Jiang,

349
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,260
do you think I'm crazy?

350
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,260
Decline any future cases

351
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,100
related to her for me.

352
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,740
Out of sight, out of mind.

353
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,660
Do you really think

354
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,060
that will solve anything?

355
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,700
Even if you don't see her,

356
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
she's still on your mind.

357
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,620
That's even worse.

358
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,740
Let's go.

359
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,540
Where to?

360
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,540
Get some fresh air.

361
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,980
Hey, Jiang.

362
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,820
Yeah.

363
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,660
Coming to the river now usually means

364
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,740
we're either confessing or fighting.

365
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,700
You just treat me to a popsicle?

366
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,380
Do you still have feelings for Cui Xi?

367
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,940
Feelings?

368
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,140
Honestly, I'm not sure.

369
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,380
Does love turn to hate,

370
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,460
or hate turn back to love?

371
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,060
Maybe it's both love and hate at once.

372
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,740
Human emotions are complicated.

373
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,860
If you feel this emotion

374
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,220
is affecting your work,

375
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,060
tell me.

376
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,100
I'll help you resolve it.

377
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,060
Whether you like someone or not,

378
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,060
don't go bothering Yao Yuan anymore.

379
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,020
I wondered why you were so nice today.

380
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,780
It's because you looked so pitiful.

381
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,820
Jiang.

382
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,460
You're the kind of person

383
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,820
who seems annoying at first glance,

384
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,460
but deep down, you're quite endearing.

385
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,720
Having a boss like you

386
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,300
is pretty fortunate.

387
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,100
Then hurry up and

388
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,060
earn me a few more popsicles.

391

and online surveys

392

by medium.

Oh dear.

394
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,180
Who actually cares about this?

395
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,380
You're way off here.

(Market Survey Report Writing Tips)
What you found online

398
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,900
will only mess things up.

How do you know?

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,740
I've done a few odd jobs before.

401
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
So I have some experience.

If you don't need my help,

403
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,460

How about you come with me?

406
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,820
You just need to watch over me.

Come on.

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,100
- What?
- Let me show you how.

415
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,340
No need.

416
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,780
Hello, I'm with Ruishi.

417
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,700
Sorry to bother you.

418
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
I'm a Ruishi employee.

419

We don't need it.

Sorry, I'm with Ruishi.

Hello, I'm from Ruishi.

422
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,430
No, no.

423
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,740
The phone never even rang.

Stop pretending.

425
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,740
Come on, give it here.

and who will leave.

Seriously?

432
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,380
Look over there.

433
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,860
Hello.

434
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,140
Can I ask you to fill out a quick survey?

435
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,500
I don't really want to.

436
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,340
There's someone there.

00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,180
This will definitely work.

Hi.

439
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,380
Do you have a few minutes

440
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,620
to answer a few questions?

441
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,460
Because I think your makeup today

442
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
is especially beautiful.

443
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,580
So I want to ask you

444
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,540
beauty-related questions,

445
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,180
is that okay?

446
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,740
Sure, now's fine.

447
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,260
Great!

448
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,260
I've been standing there forever
without anyone stopping.

449
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,900
Come on, take a look.

450
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,980
Just these few questions.

451
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,020
Okay.

452
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

453
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,180
Thank you so much.

454
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,260
Bye.

455
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,940
Bye.

456
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,540
See that?

457
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,220
Don't worry.

458
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,940
The more time you spend on it,

459
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,340
you'll get as good as me.

460
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,900
Hey, where exactly are you from?

461
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
I'm still a student.

Hey, Zhang He,

463
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,820
let me take you out to eat.

464
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,980
Consider it a thank you.

465
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,860
You want to treat me to dinner?

466
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,820
No need, but...

467
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,300
Come on, let's go.

468
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,440
Then we'll get back to work.

469
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,500
Alright.

(Heart Is Rotting)

471
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,580
Mr. Wen Cheng.

472
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,980
Can you tell me

473
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,020
why the man I like have kissed me

474
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,620
but we still never ended up together?

(Xinran)

476

(Ghosts of Exes)
Made me cry. Highly recommended.

477
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,900
This...

478
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,660
Yao Xinran can't still be thinking
about Zhuang Wei, can she?

479
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,380
Hello.

480
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,700
What do you mean by sharing that?

481
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,180
Are you still thinking about Zhuang Wei?

482
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,940
What are you talking about?

483
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,020
Who's thinking about him?

484
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,500
If not, don't post such vague stuff.

485
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,340
Gotta go.

486
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,300
Is he nuts?

487
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,940
Really like a ghost,

488
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,780
haunting me.

489
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,860
You're just begging for a scolding,

490
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,740
okay?

491
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,580
You deserve it.

492
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,140
It's me, Zhang.

493
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,460
Zhang? Oh, it's you.

494
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,220
I thought you were a scammer.

495
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,180
I was ready to scold you.

496
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,100
What's going on?

497
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,340
What do you need from me?

498
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,140
Wanting me to come back, huh?

499
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,340
Cheng,

500
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,820
can you come over for a sec?

501
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,540
Cheng, you finally showed up.

502
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,980
I've been waiting for you.

503
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,580
What exactly do you want?

504
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,460
Here's the deal.

505
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,380
Last time, you and your friend Yao Xinran

506
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,340
went on the show together.

507
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
It went really well.

508
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,460
Our investors

509
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,500
really liked that.

510
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,780
They said

511
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,350
they want you and Yao Xinran

512
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,540
to do a special episode or something.

513
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,460
Are you willing?

514
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,780
How could you bear to fire Ashley?

515
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,020
Sometimes you have to.

516
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,340
The higher-ups said

517
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,420
she has no click-through rate.

518
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,440
If I don't fire her,

519
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,420
I'll be the one getting fired.

520
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,860
Look at you.

521
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,780
Just for a pretty face,

522
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,940
you would risk everything.

523
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,660
Good thing you realized it

524
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,100
and called me back.

525
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,700
Cheng, you were right to scold me.

526
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,860
I can't do this without you.

527
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,700
Is that okay?

528
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,940
Listen,

529
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,620
don't think I'll always come back.

530
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,300
If I didn't still care about this show,

531
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,660
I'd still have a smooth life

532
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,220
somewhere else.

533
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,620
I know that, Cheng.

534
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,500
Please tell me.

535
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,140
What will make you come back?

536
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,860
It's simple.

537
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,980
First,

538
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,420
this place is far,

539
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,180
so I need a dedicated car
for all my trips.

540
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,220
Second, before and after filming,

541
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,060
I want a cup of black coffee, no sugar.

542
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,380
Third,

543
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,060
my suits must be sponsored by brands.

544
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,780
Fourth, I want two assistants

545
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,460
for back massages and shoulder rubs.

546
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,300
How about that?

547
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,420
This is... really...

548
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
I'm just kidding.

549
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,540
What I want is

550
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,220
your absolute respect from now on.

551
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,340
Got it, Cheng.

552
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,740
(Celebrity Insights)

553
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,460
This is bad.

554
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,100
I just snapped at her.

555
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,620
How do I even bring it up now?

556
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,780
What's wrong?

557
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,700
Why are you sighing?

558
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,220
Being so quiet isn't like you.

559
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,700
Is it about your love life again?

560
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,020
The ex-girlfriend you

561
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,980
stargazed with?

562
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,380
She's not the type
to think about others much.

563
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,140
Yet you still care about her a lot.

564
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,250
Do I?

565
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
If you didn't care,

566
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,900
you wouldn't be so troubled.

567
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,540
Su Wen,

568
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
sometimes,

569
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,500
people depend on others

570
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,780
because the other person

571
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,380
also is dependent.

572
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,940
Although she was wrong,

573
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,220
think about it this way,

574
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,220
you actually allowed it,

575
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,060
didn't you?

576
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,340
Just like Anlan,

577
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,430
he was always very proactive with me,

578
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,980
but that's because I liked it.

579
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,570
You used your relationship with Jiang

580
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,670
to comfort me?

581
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,380
I just want to tell you,

582
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,620
I hope you

583
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,620
find the right person.

584
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,660
As expected, Yao Yuan knows me best.

585
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,620
Yao Yuan,

586
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,060
can I hug you at Shengshi?

587
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,540
Su Wen, can't you behave?

588
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Why do you always eavesdrop on us?

589
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,500
It's so rude.

590
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,980
If you love whispering,

591
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,100
today I'll let you whisper all you want.

592
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,740
(For Thy Sake, Lord of All, Admiration)

593
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,740
(Ruishi Investment Advisor)

594
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,880
Why are there so many?

595
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,340
Ancheng, why are you here?

596
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,660
You didn't answer the phone.

597
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,820
I guessed you were working,

598
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,300
so I brought food over.

599
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,620
Fruit salad, right?

600
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
Put it here.

601
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,940
I knew you were the best, Ancheng.

602
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,900
It's so late already.

603
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,500
I'm starving.

604
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,380
Is it good?

605
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,220
Hmm.

606
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,660
I haven't had this salad in ages.

607
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,320
What were you working on?

608
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,380
Typing up some data.

609
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,820
I spent the whole day

610
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,460
doing market research.

611
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,020
My legs are about to give out.

612
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,380
That tiring?

613
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,860
Hmm.

614
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,980
But even so,

615
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,380
I think market research

616
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,220
is really fascinating.

617
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,900
How so?

618
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,940
This morning,

619
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,940
I met a guy who was two meters tall,

620
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,420
tall and strong.

621
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,700
And you know what?

622
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,860
He turned out to be
a kindergarten teacher.

623
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,780
Oh, and also,

624
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,060
there was a girl

625
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,980
dressed in designer brands.

626
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,300
But her salary

627
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,820
was less than half the average.

628
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,860
It's really strange.

629
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,020
She really likes spending.

630
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460
Sounds pretty interesting.

631
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,900
Maybe next time,

632
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,060
you can take me with you.

633
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,420
Sure.

634
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,220
But,

635
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,660
Ancheng, your face looks so serious.

636
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,320
It might scare people away.

637
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,780
Alright, Ancheng,

638
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,060
you can head back.

639
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,660
I still have lots of files to type.

640
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,620
Don't you want me to help?

641
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,700
No need.

642
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,340
This is a task from Anlan.

643
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,580
I want to finish it myself.

644
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,860
You're so serious

645
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,780
about Anlan.

646
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,820
Of course.

647
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,500
This time, I have to make Anlan

648
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,980
see me in a new light.

649
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,540
Alright then,

650
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,060
go back to work.

651
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
I'm heading back now.

652
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,820
Thank you, Ancheng.

653
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,620
How can I convince her?

654
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,500
Confucius once said,

655
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,500
people should be taught
according to their abilities.

656
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
I don't think you're
doing great as a planner.

657
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,700
Maybe you should switch to hosting.

658
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,580
You might find a whole new path.

659
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,900
Don't you think?

660
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,540
That might have been a bit harsh.

661
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,100
Yao Xinran, I'm begging you.

662
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,780
I'll treat you to every meal.

663
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,960
I'll follow you anywhere.

664
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,540
Please, do me a favor and save my show.

665
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,380
No, that's too over the top.

666
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,300
Yao Xinran, our show

667
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,140
is meant to help so many lost women.

668
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,980
Do you realize that?

669
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,340
What's he doing?

670
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,660
If you agree,

671
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,030
- I don't know.
- you'd be doing a good deed.

672
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,260
Ignore him.

673
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,100
Let's go.

674
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,660
You two.

675
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,460
Help me out.

676
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,420
What are you three doing?

677
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,860
Sitting so upright, like in class.

678
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,340
Xinran, here's the thing.

679
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,740
Your show's ratings
were great last time.

680
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,940
Today, Zhang, the producer, told me

681
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,260
he wants you and me
to do a special episode.

682
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,740
A special episode?

683
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,580
I'm not interested.

684
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,580
Xinran.

685
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,340
Don't reject it so quickly.

686
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,260
Last time the show

687
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,460
went really well, didn't it?

688
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,340
I think you've got a talent for it.

689
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,700
You might just go viral.

690
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,580
Xinran.

691
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,700
Don't underestimate yourself.

692
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,140
Wen Cheng's been hosting for so long,

693
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,740
I've never seen anyone discuss him.

694
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,420
The main person's chill,
but everyone else is losing it.

695
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,260
Wen Cheng.

696
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,060
Why do you always make us

697
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,660
speak up for you?

698
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,740
Take the initiative.

699
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,940
I'll step aside with Yao Yuan for now.

700
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,100
You two talk alone.

701
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,940
What exactly do you want me to do?

702
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,180
Kneel down

703
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,060
and beg you?

704
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,780
I'm going back to my room now.

705
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,220
Wait, wait, don't go.

706
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,500
Let's go watch a movie.

707
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,580
Okay.

708
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,620
Let's go.

709
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,060
Yao Xinran, please.

710
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,470
Just come on my show.

711
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,420
Wen Cheng.

712
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,260
Look at you.

713
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,900
If you're gonna kneel,
do it properly with both knees.

714
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,180
One knee down without a ring?

715
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,180
No wonder Xinran got upset.

716
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,300
Where are you going so late?

717
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,420
Somewhere we won't be in your way.

718
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,260
Yuan.

719
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
Why is your face blushing?

720
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,460
Is it?

721
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,300
It's just stuffy in here.

722
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,830
I'm going to get some fresh air.

723
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,140
See you.

724
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,180
Sort out your own issues.

725
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,140
Hey.

726
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,660
They just left like that?

727
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Just agree to it.

728
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,500
Or name your terms.

729
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,820
Whether it's a private car service,

730
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,220
coffee delivery, or double the pay.

731
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,540
None of those conditions work?

732
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,580
Do I have to carry you into the studio

733
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,500
so you can agree?

734
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,780
Okay.

735
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,780
That's it?

736
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,140
You don't want double pay,
but you want me to carry you?

737
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,450
Let me think about it again.

738
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,340
Why is the power out?

739
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,700
Sorry, I'll get the door.

740
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,180
Wow, you've had way too much to drink!

741
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,020
I miss you.

742
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,300
I've always regretted it.

743
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,900
If it wasn't for my career,

744
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,780
I wouldn't have been with Nana.

745
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,060
When I saw you that day,

746
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,900
I decided I didn't
want any regrets in life.

747
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,300
It's already over between us.

748
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,100
It's over, do you hear her?

749
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,260
Mr. Zhuang, Xinran has made it clear.

750
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,660
The two of you are done.

751
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,300
And she has a boyfriend now.

752
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,740
It's me.

753
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,190
Boyfriend.

754
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,300
- Sorry to bother.
- Bye, bye.

755
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,420
Okay.

756
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,300
Goodbye.

757
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,380
Going home.

758
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,580
Alright, don't come back.

759
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,780
Bye.

760
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,700
He's drunk. It's not safe
for him to walk alone.

761
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,290
Don't go. He brought it on himself.

762
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,740
No.

763
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,820
What are you doing?

764
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,340
I'm waiting for Yao Xinran.

765
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,930
Where did she go?

766
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,220
Why did she leave you here alone?

767
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,070
She went to take Zhuang Wei home.

768
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,180
How long has it been?

769
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,640
Does he live at the ends
of the earth or something?

770
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,060
Zhuang Wei came?

771
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,010
Not just here,
he took your sister with him.

772
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,100
No.

773
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,330
Why should I just wait around?

774
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,060
That woman might have

775
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,320
already forgotten I'm still here.

776
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,580
Yuan, please tell Yao Xinran,

777
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,500
I have never

778
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,070
waited for any girl for more than

779
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,940
two hours in my life!

780
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,750
I'm done waiting.

781
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,020
Wen Cheng seems to be
really serious this time.

782
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,580
I support him.

783
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,820
But why is Xinran taking so long?

784
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,940
Xinran, you're back.

785
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,100
Are you okay?

786
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,670
I'm exhausted.

787
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,090
Zhuang Wei drank too much.
He couldn't even walk straight.

788
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,150
He looked so pitiful.

789
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,770
I couldn't just leave him like that.

790
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,420
Xinran.

791
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,820
Can you tell the difference
between sympathy and love?

792
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,140
I'm tired. I'm going to rest.

793
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,980
Hey.

794
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,300
Xinran.

795
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,220
You can't keep doing this.

796
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,740
You finally got out of it.

797
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,820
Don't go back to it again.

798
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,380
What about Wen Cheng?

799
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,290
What will he do?

800
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,820
What do you mean?

801
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,460
He waited here for you all night.

802
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,460
He asked me to tell you

803
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,860
he's never waited
for a girl like this before.

804
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,740
He waited for me?

805
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,900
Hmm.

806
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,010
I can tell he really likes you.

807
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,290
And you still took
your ex-boyfriend home.

808
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,950
How does that make him feel?

809
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,550
He even said he likes me?

810
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,740
He didn't say that.

811
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,940
I said it.

812
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,800
Why don't you ask him
what he's thinking?

813
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,380
Probably nothing good.

814
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,100
Anlan,

815
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,300
I did a really thorough
market research this time.

816
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,740
I interviewed everyone,
men, women, old, young.

817
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,500
I even tried every cosmetic product

818
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,460
on the market,

819
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,660
and analyzed their pros and cons.

820
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,340
It took me three days
and nights to finish this.

821
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,500
Not bad.

822
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,740
Given your abilities,

823
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,820
this is already quite impressive.

824
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,620
Anlan,

825
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
don't I deserve some kind of reward?

826
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,300
At least treat me to a meal.

827
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,220
As an employee,

828
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,740
completing tasks assigned by your boss

829
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,700
is just part of the job.

830
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,020
Anlan,

831
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,780
so what's next?

832
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,220
What should I do next?

833
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,580
Li Ao will explain it to you.

834
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,380
Anlan, hey.

835
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,860
The rest of the work is teaching us

836
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,300
to know ourselves and the enemy.

837
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,300
Since you've already done the analysis,

838
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
what you need to do next

839
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,780
is turn weaknesses into strengths.

840
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,780
Make them our bargaining
chips in negotiations.

841
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,540
We have a client at our company,
a real tough one.

842
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,980
A previous specialist

843
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,420
went several times but got nowhere.

844
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,300
This time, you give it a try.

845
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,140
See if you can nail it.

846
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,940
Alright, no problem.

847
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,940
Whether it's a tough client or a saint,

848
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,380
they won't escape my grasp.

849
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,100
Good, get to work.

850
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,700
Hey, hey, hey!

851
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,540
Where are you going?

852
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,300
I'm going to meet Mr. Jiang
from Faith Enterprises.

853
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,220
You're going alone?

854
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,060
I can definitely handle it by myself.

855
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,700
This is a task Anlan gave me.

856
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,710
I have to do it well.

857
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,190
Even senior managers
couldn't handle him.

858
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,900
I suggest you wait until
Master finishes his date

859
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,740
to ask for advice.

860
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,300
How do you know he's on a date?

861
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,260
I know all about
his schedule with Miss Yao.

862
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,260
He.

863
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,660
We're best friends, right?

864
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,460
Even closer than best friends.

865
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,580
So, from now on,

866
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,660
let's share everything.

867
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,860
No problem!

868
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,820
Today I had a rice ball
and drank some milk.

869
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,300
Not that kind of stuff.

870
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,340
I mean,

871
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,660
things like Anlan
and Miss Yao's schedules.

872
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,940
How could I possibly tell you

873
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,780
Master's schedule?

874
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,300
Master has been so good to me.

875
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,220
Doing this would be a betrayal.

876
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,940
You don't have to betray him.

877
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,980
This is just concern.

878
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,700
I don't care.

879
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,420
Just take a few more photos of Anlan

880
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,700
for me when you can.

881
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,380
Your way of showing concern
is really unique.

882
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,860
Should I send you
some of my selfies too?

883
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,220
No need for yours. I'm leaving now.

884
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,500
Hey, hey.

885
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,060
My selfies can ward off evil spirits.

886
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,620
You're drinking alone?

887
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,020
I'm letting you eat and stay here,

888
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
and I have to wait on you too?

889
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,380
Get it yourself.

890
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,820
You're free today?

891
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,180
Hmm.

892
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,660
All city hotels are fully booked?

893
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,740
How could they all be full?

894
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,860
I chose not to leave.

895
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,540
This home feels so familiar and warm.

896
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,220
Even though we're more
like roommates now,

897
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,940
I still like having you around.

898
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,020
You might like it, but I don't.

899
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,180
Do you really just see me as a friend?

900
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,700
A friend?

901
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,780
Do you have feelings for Yao Yuan?

902
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,100
That's shameless.

903
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,100
She has a boyfriend.
Are you trying to intrude?

904
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,780
Hearing that from you

905
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,860
is kind of ridiculous.

906
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,340
Aren't you the one
who intrudes when you want,

907
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,960
and takes what you want?

908
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,780
Hey.

909
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,180
We agreed not to bring that up.

910
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,500
What can I do to make it up?

911
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,020
Quit photography?

912
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,860
Let's go eat the noodles on the left.

913
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,350
- It's so good.
- That one's not tasty.

914
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,900
The stir-fried rice
on the right is delicious.

915
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,100
No, the noodles are amazing.

916
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,500
Hey, hey, you two, you two.

917
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,820
Why don't you ask me what I want to eat?

918
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,980
You don't matter.

919
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,860
What are you doing here?

920
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,100
We haven't dined together in ages.

921
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,140
What do you feel like eating?

922
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,180
I'll take you out today.

923
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,900
Let's go.

924
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,380
Then let's still go for the noodles.

925
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,300
No, the stir-fried rice.

926
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,780
- Noodles.
- Stir-fried rice.

927
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,460
- Noodles.
- The stir-fried rice is better.

928
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,940
(Jianing)
The noodles are better.

929
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,340
(Remember our promise.)

930
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,940
Uncle.

931
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,750
Yuan, here you are.

932
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,380
Anlan, you're quite the rare guest.

933
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,640
Come on in, please.

934
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,300
- Anlan.
- Yeah?

935
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,300
How's the food tasting?

936
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,330
It looks great already.

937
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,660
But I took a glance at your menu.

938
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,260
Are your expenses and revenue balanced?

939
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,410
That's the charm of our place,
delicious and affordable.

940
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,060
Let me make you my signature dish.

941
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,100
Braised pork. Just wait.

942
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,940
Alright.

943
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,820
This is really nice.

944
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,020
I feel like my uncle

945
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,580
is close to realizing his dream.

946
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,120
His cooking skills are truly unmatched.

947
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,660
But honestly,

948
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,090
I'm a bit concerned about
how he's running things.

949
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,780
Look,

950
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,020
the staff-to-customer ratio
in this restaurant,

951
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,620
and his ingredient costs versus pricing.

952
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,510
Everything needs to be
recalculated and adjusted.

953
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,460
Plus, their cooking skills
and ingredients

954
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,200
are on par with five-star hotels.

955
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,620
So even if the price goes up by 20%,

956
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,840
customers will still pay for it.

957
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,380
We're not too familiar with all this.

958
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,500
I'll remind him. Thanks.

959
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,220
No need to thank me.

960
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,420
He's your uncle now,

961
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,620
and he'll be my uncle too.

962
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,490
Looking out for family is just natural.

963
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,660
