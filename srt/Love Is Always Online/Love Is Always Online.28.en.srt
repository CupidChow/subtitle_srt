Right?

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,260
Yao Yuan.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,160
Here comes the most important question:

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,180
Do you love him?

38
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,860
Of course.

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,820
I'd go against everyone's wishes

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,580
to be with him.

41
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,500
Darling.

42
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,340
You're drunk. Let me take you home.

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,220
I was wrong; he's not here, right?

44
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,020
You're not wrong.

45
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,860
It's me.

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,580
Let's go.

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,980
It's okay; we're home now.

48
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,060
Darling.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,900
You're drunk.

50
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,100
Good timing.

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,880
Listen, I need to say something.

52
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,220
I'm not listening.

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,140
Right now,

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,060
I feel completely dizzy.

55
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,740
I can't make out a thing.

56
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,140
It's unfair for you to talk now.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,140
Wait for me a moment.

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,940
Darling,

59
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,100
watch closely.

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,180
Now, it's fair.

61
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,980
Do you know?

62
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,940
I made those plans

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,060
because I couldn't afford to fail.

64
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,660
I couldn't accept that you

65
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,220
didn't like me, or even hated me.

66
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,220
Even if there was only a 0.1% chance,

67
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,120
I was scared I might miss something,

68
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,620
or maybe I didn't do something right,

69
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,740
and you'd stop loving me.

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,600
Since the first time
I saw you in high school,

71
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,980
you've always been in my heart.

72
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,500
I can't miss you again.

73
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,180
That's why I planned everything out.

74
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,260
It's because...

75
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,700
Because I like you a lot.

76
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,220
Maybe I'm not making any sense.

77
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,900
My feelings for you are sincere.

78
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,820
I'm not perfect.

79
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,830
In fact, when it comes to love,

80
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,330
no one is perfect.

81
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,330
Everyone is cautious,

82
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,540
nervous, and careful.

83
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,200
Those who hurt their partners

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,220
actually don't care or love them.

85
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
So,

86
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,580
is it true

87
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,060
that you've never been in love?

88
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,890
Of course.

89
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,900
But after I met you,

90
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,980
I realized

91
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,220
that all my preparations for you

92
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,820
became useless

93
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,060
the moment I met you.

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,220
I remember

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,380

96

is that you might stop liking me.

I'm gonna be late.
Why didn't you wake me?

136
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,700
What's so interesting
about brushing teeth?

137
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,220
I've been imagining this scene
for a long time.

Finally, it's happening.

139
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,680

Yeah.

141
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,620
Not just that.

142
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,780
I also imagined us

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,460
living here together,

144
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,580

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,300
Mr. Jiang,

149
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,300
your dream is beautiful.

150
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,140
But reality is harsh.

151
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,380
Today, I'll be late.

152
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,620
My boss is really strict.

153
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,210
Sure.

154
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,380
Mr. Jiang.

155
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,230
Sorry about that.

156
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,740
No coffee today.

157
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,780
It's okay; I'll grab some on the way.

158
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,260
Mrs. Jiang, we need to hurry.

159
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,460
We're about to be late.

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,920
- Hi, Mr. Jiang.
- Hi, Mr. Jiang.

161
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,860
Yao.

162
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,340
Did you and the master...?

163
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,260
What do you mean?

164
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,740
Did you go to the breakfast spot
at the alley

165
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
on the right turn

166
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,460
next to the hotel by the company?

167
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,120
How did you know that?

168
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,500
Because both of you smell

169
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,620
like their flatbread
and fried dough sticks.

170
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,870
Yao, you didn't change clothes?

171
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,860
You're wearing the same...

172
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,580
Don't worry, Yao.

173
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,340
I won't say a word.

174
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,060
Oh.

175
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,040
I haven't prepared the material

176
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,060
for the meeting later.

177
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,460
I'll go make copies.

178
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,700
Judging by her reaction,
you must be right.

179
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,020
Hey, Jianing.

180
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,680
Did you have breakfast?

181
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,620
I couldn't eat.

182
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,700
That's because your breakfast
wasn't good.

183
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,860
I'll get you something else.

184
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,700
No need.

185
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,940
It's nothing; just wait.

186
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,420
Yao Yuan,

187
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,340
have you decided
on the wedding dress style

188
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,500
when you marry Jiang?

189
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,220
Something more classic,

190
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,160
or something innovative?

191
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,620
Or maybe something

192
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,900
with strong contrast

193
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,740
and lighting effect?

194
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,260
We're having a meeting.

195
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,580
Not the time for that.

196
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,460
It's time for the meeting,

197
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,380
not Yao's wedding consultant session.

198
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,420
In this environmental plastic project,

199
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,220
we can work
with an environmental artist.

200
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,540
Using PET bottles as materials,

201
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,960
we can create street decorative art.

202
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,660
That's a great point.

203
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,500
But we need to promote
plastic decomposition and recycling,

204
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,540
not just waste recycling.

205
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,580
We could also consider

206
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,720
starting a program in schools

207
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,020
for bottle cap recycling.

208
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,740
I've thought about that, too.

209
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,660
We can collect plastic bottle caps

210
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,780
and create an environmental art wall
at school.

211
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,790
It'd help build
students' environmental awareness.

212
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
Hey.

213
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
As a student,

214
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,380
I really agree with this.

215
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,900
And I'm willing to take part.

216
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,900
Jianing, you're amazing.

217
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,900
You must've done a lot of research.

218
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,260
Lately,

219
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,460
you've made huge progress.

220
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,860
I didn't expect you
to be completely unaffected

221
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,820
by Jiang's marriage.

222
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,660
However,

223
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
your ideas

224
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,380
feel a bit rigid.

225
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
My thought is

226
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,700
to combine love

227
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,660
with the environment.

228
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,260
Yao Yuan,

229
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,460
have you thought about decomposing

230
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,260
those discarded plastic bottles
on the beach

231
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,620
to make a wedding dress?

232
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,780
Stop talking about this anymore.

233
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,900
You and Jiang really are

234
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,460
perfect model candidates.

235
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,420
Hey.

236
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,020
I think so, too.

237
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,900
Here.

238
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,700
Coffee's on me.

239
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,140
Just one cup of coffee

240
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,300
to thank me?

241
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,460
Jiang said he'll thank you

242
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,140
in person when he gets the chance.

243
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,020
He'll thank me?

244
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,220
That's surprising.

245
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,920
Then I need to think hard

246
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,320
about how to get a meal out of him.

247
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,340
But Yao Yuan,

248
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,900
if you ever argue with Jiang again,

249
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,220
you have to tell me.

250
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,340
I'll always be on your side.

251
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,580
If Jiang lets you down in any way,

252
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,620
I just...

253
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,060
Thank you, Su Wen.

254
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,340
I believe

255
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,860
someone will soon

256
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,980
see how great you are.

257
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,180
How great I am?

258
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,300
It's the first time
someone's said that to me.

259
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,300
They just don't understand you.

260
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,420
When I was sad,

261
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,820
you went with me to Grandmother's

262
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,420
and quietly stayed by my side.

263
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,740
When we worked on the proposal,

264
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,940
you kept encouraging me,

265
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,560
giving me more confidence.

266
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,820
Now that Anlan and I have issues,

267
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,980
you played peacemaker.

268
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,820
You seem

269
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,380
not to care about much on the surface,

270
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,620
but actually,

271
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,310
you're very sensitive inside.

272
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,940
That's because

273
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,780
you're only the second person
I've truly liked.

274
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,060
I can't stand seeing you suffer.

275
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,340
Yao Yuan,

276
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
if you

277
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,580
hadn't met Jiang before me,

278
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,860
would you...

279
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,260
I'd surely meet Anlan.

280
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,220
No matter when,

281
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,900
no matter where.

282
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,860
Yao Yuan,

283
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,020
is your coffee here

284
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
to remind me of my feelings?

285
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,100
It's super bitter.

286
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,700
Not really, it's fine.

287
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,540
You should try it.

288
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,320
Anlan, you wanted to see me?

289
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,260
Have a seat.

290
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,180
I heard you did well

291
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,620
in the meeting just now.

292
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Everyone helped out;
I gathered some info.

293
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,460
Have the minutes been organized?

294
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,300
Yes.

295
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,340
Good.

296
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,700
Go to Jiulong later.

297
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,100
Brief my brother on the details.

298
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,860
Can someone else go instead?

299
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,220
Why?

300
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,420
Ancheng

301
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,980
confessed to me.

302
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,020
I'm worried it'll be awkward seeing him.

303
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,500
Are you really not interested
in my brother?

304
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,940
He's always the first to think of you.

305
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,820
No matter where he is,

306
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,860
the moment you call,

307
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,500
he drops everything and rushes to you.

308
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,260
Can't you feel

309
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,540
all his effort?

310
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,420
Whether you like him

311
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,500
or not,

312
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,960
take some time
to sort out your feelings.

313
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,660
If you don't want to go,

314
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,580
I won't force you.

315
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,420
But I think this is a great chance

316
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,820
for you two to see each other
in a new light.

317
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,540
We need to know how to figure this out.

318
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,550
Like this.

319
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,020
I think if we do it this way,

320
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,960
it'll turn out better.

321
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,820
Hey.

322
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,100
Did you get scolded?

323
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,700
No, why would he scold me?

324
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,800
Then what did the master say to you?

325
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,380
Nothing much.

326
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,440
He just told me to think about how

327
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
to handle things with Ancheng.

328
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,860
Oh.

329
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,780
Actually, I think

330
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,260
Ancheng is so outstanding.

331
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,860
If I were a girl,

332
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,020
I'd like him, too.

333
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,060
Well.

334
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,180
You don't get it.

335
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,860
We're too close to each other.

336
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,900
Between him and me,

337
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,140
there's no heart-racing feeling

338
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,380
like in romance.

339
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,140
But love isn't only
about your heart beating faster.

340
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,660
Love can also be

341
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,700
steady and lasting.

342
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,940
Think about it.

343
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,060
Every time you're in trouble,

344
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,300
Ancheng is always there for you.

345
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,780
That shows he really cares.

346
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,980
So, should I apologize to him?

347
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,820
No, don't.

348
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,820
Apologizing to a man

349
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,120
can be a huge blow.

350
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,820
It's even harder to take than rejection.

351
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,860
So, tell me.

352
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,920
What is Ancheng thinking?

353
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,660
You're not him.

354
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,500
He's not you.

355
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,580
You're not me.

356
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,580
- I'm not...
- A tongue twister?

357
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,820
Actually, what I mean is

358
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,420
that guessing won't help.

359
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,020
Most guys

360
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
would like you

361
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,960
to be straightforward.

362
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,660
Even if you reject them, things will end

363
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,720
after you tell them that.

364
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,380
You can still stay friends afterward.

365
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,780
What if I avoid the topic?

366
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,580
If you do that,

367
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,580
you might lose him as a friend.

368
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,780
Why do you know so much about this?

369
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,860
Too many girls that I can't get.

370
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,620
But it's okay.

371
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,940
I believe

372
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,300
my goddess

373
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,180
will appear very soon.

374
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,460
In the grave of love,
there's always the third person.

375
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,740
The graverobbers

376
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,940
who dare to enter the grave.

377
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,020
No wonder it always ends in chaos.

378
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,060
Why do fewer people
choose to get married?

379
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,580
Because dating is much easier

380
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,460
than marriage.

381
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,740
You won't be tied down
by a piece of paper.

382
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,940
Please give this to Wen Cheng.

383
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,980
People can choose
to be together or apart.

384
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,300
Finally, please support my new book,

385
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,380
Married or Not.

386
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,420
Let's take a short break.

387
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,020
Wen Cheng,

388
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,900
Miss Yao asked me to give you this.

389
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,540
She said she had to go and left.

390
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,660
Where is she?

391
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,820
She just left.

392
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,540
Xinran, wait.

393
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,540
Didn't we agree to go eat together?

394
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,100
Why did you leave on your own?

395
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,380
Something came up.

396
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,650
Miss Yao,

397
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,580
what's going on today?

398
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,860
How did I upset you this time?

399
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,060
What do you mean?

400
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,220
Explain yourself.

401
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,260
What is my problem?

402
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,100
You should at least tell me

403
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,380
why you're upset.

404
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,780
If I have to give a reason,

405
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,180
I'd say

406
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,980
our views on marriage don't match.

407
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,540
So, that's it.

408
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,280
Maybe I was a bit over the top,

409
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,840
but it was for the show's effect.

410
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,260
So, your real thoughts aren't like that?

411
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,300
I...

412
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,880
That's just how I see it.

413
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,900
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,860
I've been meddling with your life.

415
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,540
What do you mean?

416
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,260
Ancheng.

417
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,380
Are you nervous?

418
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,300
If it's just business, I should be.

419
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,620
Don't go easy on me later.

420
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,420
I didn't expect you

421
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,280
to be the one coming today.

422
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,740
Honestly, I was scared to face you.

423
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,740
But Anlan talked me into doing this.

424
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,420
Anlan was right.

425
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,810
I needed to sort out my feelings.

426
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,980
I can't lose you as a friend.

427
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,460
Besides,

428
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,020
I don't want you to think

429
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,460
I don't want to be friends with you.

430
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
Besides the market survey earlier,

431
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,120
we've compiled info
about environmental activities

432
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,260
for your reference,

433
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
including participant analysis
and feedback.

434
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,660
We can also take this opportunity

435
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,140
to enhance the corporate image

436
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,460
of Jiulong and Ruishi.

437
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,100
Thank you, Miss Fang.

438
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,420
Your explanation was very clear.

439
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,660
You fully conveyed
Ruishi's innovative projects.

440
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,460
Does anyone have any questions?

441
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,900
Regarding the integration
of art and craftsmanship,

442
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,860
can we see

443
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,460
the detailed plan tomorrow?

444
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,900
We'll need a little time for that.

445
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,920
I'll have the project team assist you.

446
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,700
Okay, I'll fully cooperate.

447
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,380
You did better than I expected.

448
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,980
Thank you.

449
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,020
Anlan was right.

450
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,500
It feels like we're still friends.

451
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,140
Mr. Jiang, we're ready.

452
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,180
Go ahead.

453
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,100
(Li Xiaoya)

454
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,260
Hello?

455
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,020
Ancheng.

456
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,140
This is Xiaoya.

457
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,080
About what happened that day,

458
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,260
I'm really sorry.

459
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
It's okay.

460
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,740
I figured it must've been
something important.

461
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
Are you alright after that?

462
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,740
I'm fine now.

463
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,100
That's good to hear.

464
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,460
I just wanted to check in.

465
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,500
I'll hang up now.

466
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,340
Xiaoya,

467
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,500
when are you free?

468
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,560
Let me treat you to a meal.

469
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,740
I'm free anytime.

470
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,020
Sure.

471
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,780
Awesome.

472
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,420
You argued with Xinran again?

473
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,260
Again?

474
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,140
Do we really seem like enemies?

475
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,540
I talked about my marriage view

476
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,780
on the show.

477
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,260
She seemed unhappy

478
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,420
with my stance against marriage.

479
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,900
You're against marriage?

480
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
Your parents' divorce

481
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,220
has hit you hard.

482
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,260
Deep down,

483
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,100
I do want a happy family someday,

484
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,600
but I'm afraid of ending up
like my parents.

485
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,460
Maybe Xinran is the one

486
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,100
who can help you overcome that shadow.

487
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,000
This problem feels impossible to solve.

488
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,260
Women often say this:

489
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,700
If you don't want to marry,

490
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,060
then why be with me?

491
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,640
But does being together

492
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,100
always lead to marriage?

493
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,380
Most girls

494
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,300
think that way.

495
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,940
I like Xinran,

496
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,300
but I'm not sure
if we're right for marriage

497
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
or how long it'll last.

498
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,700
How's the wedding planning going?

499
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,940
It's okay.

500
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,820
Is Dad still against it?

501
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,540
He's been upset

502
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,860
about the board election lately.

503
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,220
If you're worried,

504
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,580
why not go home and check on him?

505
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,220
I'm afraid of upsetting him again.

506
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,980
Actually,

507
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,460
your dad is upset with you

508
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,740
because he feels

509
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,420
you didn't consider his pride.

510
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,780
But you need to remember

511
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,340
that he loves you the most.

512
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,460
You and your dad are just alike.

513
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,300
You both care about each other,

514
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,420
but you're just too stubborn

515
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,420
to admit it.

516
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,060
I was wrong.

517
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,860
I shouldn't have talked back to Dad.

518
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,540
Thanks, Mom.

519
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,380
I understand now.

520
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,780
I'll find time to go back.

521
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,580
Hello, do you have a reservation?

522
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,300
Yes, Mr. Jiang, for two.

523
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,330
Alright, this way.

524
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,190
Thank you.

525
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,380
Please have a seat.

526
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,220
Thanks.

527
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,060
(Ancheng)

528
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,900
(Ancheng)

529
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,540
Sorry, I'm still working.

530
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,060
(Ancheng)
It's okay. Take your time. I'll wait.

531
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,820
Miss, are you ready to order?

532
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,280
It's okay. I'll order later.

533
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,140
- Okay.
- Thank you.

534
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,700
Please come in.

535
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
Miss Fang.

536
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,020
Let's wrap it up for today.

537
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,220
Alright, thanks for your help.

538
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,540
Mr. Jiang asked us to. It's okay.

539
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,260
Mr. Jiang.

540
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,840
You must be exhausted.

541
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,260
Not at all.

542
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,580
Though it's tiring,

543
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,660
I still feel it's worth it.

544
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,020
If I can do this well,

545
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,860
I'll earn Anlan's praise.

546
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,640
However tough it gets, I won't mind.

547
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,460
What I mean is

548
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,760
that if someone as perfectionist

549
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,320
as Anlan accepts me,

550
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,980
isn't that the greatest recognition?

551
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,380
You don't need to explain.

552
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,420
I get what you mean.

553
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,300
To be honest,

554
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,460
I admit I ignored your feelings before.

555
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,700
I should reflect on that.

556
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,160
Let's not bring it up again.

557
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,180
Are you hungry?

558
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,300
Would you like some takeout?

559
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,900
I'm sorry for telling you to leave.

560
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
I didn't mean it.

561
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,460
I know you've been good to me.

562
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,580
But whenever I think of Anlan,

563
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,900
it still hurts inside.

564
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
I wish he could just notice me more,

565
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,060
praise me a little more,

566
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,540

sorry.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

606
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,900
You must be hungry.

607
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
It's fine; you worked so late.

608
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,600
I guess you haven't eaten either.

609
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,180
I'm used to it.

610
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,100
That can't be good.

611
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,400
That will ruin your stomach.

612
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,220
Since we're both hungry,

613
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,860
I'll go ahead and order.

614
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,700
Sure.

615
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,180

00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,900
Thank you.

Jianing,

620
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,340
stop playing on your phone.

621
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,260
Eat something.

Ancheng,

623
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,780
this is a secret photo I took of Anlan.

624
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,490
Isn't he super handsome?

625
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,740
Hey, don't zone out.

626
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,580
Eat now.

627
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
I was so late.

628
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,220
Aren't you mad?

629
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,340
Why would I be mad?

630
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,140
You're working,

631
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,020
not just having fun.

632
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,140
Besides,

633
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,330
when you like someone,

634
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,340
you'll be tolerant and patient.

635
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,340
Like someone?

636
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,700
You'll care

637
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,500
about whether they've eaten enough.

638
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,740
You'll wait

639
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,260
for their messages.

640
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,860
I waited so long for you,

641
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,860
which means

642
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,740
I like you, right?

643
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,660
Don't feel pressured.

644
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,940
I know you like Fang Jianing,

645
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,700
but you showing up today

646
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,280
already makes me happy.

647
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,860
We're already over.

648
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,500
Why?

649
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,540
Is it because she likes Jiang Anlan?

650
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,180
That's just how life goes.

651
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,860
The one you like doesn't like you back.

652
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,020
Why does mutual love

653
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,180
have to be so hard?

654
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,820
Well, even mutual love

655
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,180
faces tough times.

656
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,420
From Yao Yuan
and Jiang Anlan's marriage,

657
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,540
I can tell your parents

658
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,300
must have high expectations for you.

659
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,740
Everything has to go their way.

660
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,700
It's the same in my family.

661
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,660
No matter how well I do,

662
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,420
my parents still favor my sister.

663
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,800
That's why I couldn't stand it
and moved out.

664
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,180
You're the eldest son.

665
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,560
The pressure must be even greater.

666
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,820
With both of you being so amazing,

667
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,460
do they often compare you?

668
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,600
Can we not talk about this?

669
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,380
Oh.

670
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,460
Sorry about that.

671
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,820
I didn't mean to offend you.

672
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,660
Don't get me wrong.

673
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,260
I just think

674
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,180
you're no less than Jiang Anlan.

675
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,460
Go ahead and eat.

676
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
Biyun?

677
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,540
Biyun,

678
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,400
can you help me put this on?

679
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,860
I twisted it while playing golf

680
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,740
this morning.

681
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,220
Dad.

682
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,020
Let me do it.

683
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,020
You twisted your waist

684
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,720
because your posture was wrong.

685
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,020
You're getting older.

686
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,160
Don't try to push yourself.

687
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,580
Ouch.

688
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,500
You little rascal.

689
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,620
Nothing nice comes from you.

690
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,620
I heard from your mom

691
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,940
that you're determined

692
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,220
to marry Yao Yuan,

693
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,020
right?

694
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,660
Yes.

695
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,300
If so,

696
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,460
why come to me?

697
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,900
Dad,

698
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,420
though our wedding is planned
to be simple and low-key,

699
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,820
I still hope to have
my family's blessings.

700
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,820
You once told me

701
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,420
that you married Mom

702
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,460
against everyone's wishes.

703
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,940
That's why I feel like you

704
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,060
would really understand me.

705
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,380
If I can't marry Yao Yuan,

706
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,380
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

707
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,180
You've grown up.

708
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,700
Hearing you talk to me like this

709
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,900
makes me happy.

710
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,780
Alright then.

711
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,700
Give me a chance

712
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,940
to see Yao Yuan in a new light.

713
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,740
In a few days,

714
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,700
bring her home for dinner.

715
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,260
Really?

716
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,620
Thanks, Dad.

717
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,300
At the same time,

718
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,980
I hope you'll consider coming back
to help at the company.

719
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,620
Dad,

720
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,820
I think my brother is better suited

721
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,540
than I to be the general manager.

722
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,700
Your brother is capable,

723
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,300
but times have changed.

724
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,220
The group needs a bold,
innovative leader.

725
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,060
Anlan,

726
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,020
you have a responsibility to the family.

727
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,420
Dad.

728
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,340
There's no point in my saying more.

729
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,760
Think it over yourself.

730
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,160
What were you talking about?

731
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,220
Nothing important.

732
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,800
I just tried to convince Dad
to accept Yao Yuan.

733
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,020
And to make it clear

734
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,440
that you're not interested
in being the general manager,

735
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:23,880
right?

736
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,380
I want to be the general manager,

737
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,660
but not because you step aside.

738
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,780
I'll fight for it myself.

739
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,320
I need to talk to you.

740
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,360
If Li Ao wants to borrow something
from Xinran,

741
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,380
why doesn't he go himself?

742
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,500
Why must I come at this time?

743
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,700
Is this really necessary?

744
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,220
Xinran,

745
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,640
I've liked you for a long time.

746
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,780
I've liked you
since our first offline meeting.

747
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,330
I kept this love deep in my heart,

748
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,420
but I can't hide it anymore.

749
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,020
Since Wen Cheng can't make you happy...

750
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,140
Li Ao, you jerk.

751
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,070
You're my friend.

752
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,510
How could you betray me like this?

753
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,140
We're both unmarried.

754
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,300
Why can't I pursue Xinran?

755
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,560
You know better than anyone
how serious I am about her.

756
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,960
I'm serious about her, too.

757
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,800
That's different.

758
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,900
We share the same interests.

759
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,740
We like the same foods and movies.

760
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,460
Besides, Xinran has a bad temper
and no patience.

761
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,340
Can you handle that?

762
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,060
- I...
- He really likes me.

763
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,180
I believe he can manage it.

764
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,660
You...

765
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,260
Are you really interested in Li Ao?

766
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,660
If he can protect and take care of me,

767
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,660
I can accept that.

768
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,180
I can do that, too.

769
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,260
If someone bullies you,

770
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,260
I can stand up to them.

771
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,580
I want to plan a trip.

772
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,540
Can you come with me?

773
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,160
Whether it's domestic or international,

774
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,900
I'll go with you.

775
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,980
If my hair turns gray

776
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,020
and I start looking ugly,

777
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,340
will you still travel with me?

778
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,410
I'll push your wheelchair.

779
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,780
Oh.

780
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,260
I get it now.

781
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,500
You're just fooling me.

782
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,470
We're not.

783
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,800
We're just trying to get you to say

784
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
what you really think.

785
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,380
What you just said
means marriage, right?

786
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,900
We just need to follow

787
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,260
the usual path most people take.

788
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,340
Once we have that paper,

789
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,780
I won't accept anyone else.

790
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,300
That's my promise to you.

791
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,660
Are you teaming up
to pressure me into marriage?

792
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,260
That's not true.

793
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,700
We just don't want you
to be so afraid of marriage.

794
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,540
You really have

795
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,860
no interest in Li Ao, right?

796
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,180
You guess.

797
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,540
Not at all.

798
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,420
Wow, nice.

799
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,260
Nice.

800
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,590
- Nice.
- Yeah.

801
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,460
Such a great shot.

802
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,500
Mr. Jiang is impressive.

803
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,140
Are you here?

804
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,620
Dear.

805
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,160
I got held up by a last-minute meeting.

806
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,180
Take a look around first.

807
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,020
I'll come later.

808
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,020
Okay.

809
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,180
That last shot was so precise.

810
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,020
He can even compete
in an international game.

811
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,300
That's so accurate.

812
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,460
Thank you for coming.

813
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,230
Here.

814
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,460
What would you like?

815
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,300
Well.

816
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,900
I'm just looking around.

817
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,140
I see.

818
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,300
It's my first time here.

819
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,020
I want to buy something

820
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,870
for my grandson.

821
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,750
Hey,

822
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,060
do you have any recommendations?

823
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,700
Everything's there; take a look.

824
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Well...

825
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,940
I'll take this one.

826
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,860
Chocolate ice cream.

827
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,140
Fifteen.

828
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,980
