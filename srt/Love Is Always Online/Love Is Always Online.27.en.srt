33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,940
Mr. Wang,

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,500
this technology is indeed good,

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,860
but based on the data,

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,500
the production cost
of dissolvable plastic

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,180
is over 35% higher
than traditional plastic.

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,860
With such a cost gap,

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,380
if anything goes wrong,

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,460
the price we pay could double.

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,180
Isn't that too risky?

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,220
That's not right.

43
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,100
We can't recoup costs short-term,

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,580
but in the long run,

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,540
the benefits will far
outweigh these extra costs.

46
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,100
Take Coca-Cola for example,

47
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,640
they started using
biodegradable packaging early on.

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,740
Now the operations run smoothly,

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,700
and they gained acclaim
as an eco-friendly company.

50
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,940
So I believe

51
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,860
this project is feasible.

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,860
- But...
- My brother is right.

53
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,380
Investment is future-focused.

54
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,020
This eco-friendly plastic

55
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,020
offers business potential
and eco-protection.

56
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,300
It's truly a win-win project.

57
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,140
Mr. Jiang surly

58
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,580
has such sharp insight.

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,500
As an entrepreneur,

60
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,960
we should have a sense of mission,

61
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,180
and make right investments
to change the world.

62
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,740
In recent years, traditional plastic

63
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,820
has caused serious environmental damage.

64
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,060
I think we should take this chance

65
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,380
to become the pioneer.

66
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,100
Let other enterprises in the country

67
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,860
recognize the importance
of eco-protection.

68
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,660
Since Anlan agrees,

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,180
we should draft the plan

70
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,020
as soon as possible.

71
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,020
Fine, no problem.

72
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,860
I believe

73
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,460
this time our collaboration

74
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,940
will be even more successful.

75
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,140
I'll have

76
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,980
the related materials

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,980
emailed to you.

78
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,540
Pleasure working with you.

79
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Likewise.

80
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,820
How's the fitting going with the attire?

81
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,220
Everything's going well.

82
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,780
Really?

83
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,340
Don't you have to try several outfits

84
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,460
before finding the right one?

85
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,340
You don't believe me?

86
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,060
With my figure,

87
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,620
anything looks good on me.

88
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,460
Sir.

89
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,340
You want this?

90
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,430
Here you go.

91
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,660
Sir, this is our homework.

92
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,820
To protect the environment.

93
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,140
Wow, that's awesome.

94
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,580
- Keep it up.
- Bye.

95
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,620
Bye, kiddo.

96
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,180
So cute.

97
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,940
If our case succeeds,

98
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,900
kids won't have to
pick up plastic bags.

99
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,420
What do you mean?

100
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,140
Guess what came to mind

101
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,260
when I saw him?

102
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,620
I hope our children,

103
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,580
our grandchildren,

104
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,820
and their children too,

105
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,020
will get to see the beautiful world

106
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,020
free from garbage pollution.

107
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,660
Mr. Jiang,

108
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,940
your vision

109
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,700
is truly far-reaching.

110
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,220
Of course.

111
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,010
I have to work even harder now.

112
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,660
Consider this your wedding gift.

113
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,260
What about me then?

114
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,660
I'll give myself back to you properly.

115
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,180
For the sake of our baby,

116
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,340
I accept the gift.

117
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,940
After the show,

118
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,940
I'll continue to reveal

119
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,740
the ten signs a man likes you.

120
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,300
Okay,

121
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,580
let's take a break.

122
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,620
So,

123
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,380
what are the ten signs
a man likes a woman?

124
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,300
Number five, he often
finds excuses to contact you.

125
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,940
Number four,
he remembers what you say.

126
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,460
Number three,
he always asks what you're up to.

127
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,980
Number two,

128
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,420
when he talks to you,

129
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,340
he looks into your eyes.

130
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,980
And number one?

131
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,300
If I told you,
you wouldn't watch my show.

132
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,780
I'm not going to watch it anyway.

133
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,060
I've been too busy with Yuan's wedding.

134
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,860
I don't even have time to sleep.

135
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,220
Where would I find time to watch it?

136
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,740
That busy, huh?

137
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,340
Marriage is really exhausting.

138
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,140
Who even came up with this system,

139
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,980
just to torment
these lovesick men and women?

140
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,020
But that's the most
important moment in life.

141
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,140
Isn't it worth it?

142
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,540
True, a little hardship won't hurt.

143
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,220
It's like prepping for married life.

144
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,180
You're pretty cynical about marriage.

145
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,980
Marriage is basically the tomb of love.

146
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,500
It feels like being buried alive.

147
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,240
You want to run,
but you probably can't escape.

148
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,580
Wen Cheng.

149
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,820
Get ready.

150
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,950
Okay.

151
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,620
The number one sign a guy likes you.

152
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,700
The angrier you get,

153
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,180
the happier he becomes.

154
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,820
You still have doubts?

155
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,620
Remember Ruishi's

156
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,860
entrepreneurial mission?

157
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,700
I know, it's people first.

158
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,980
But this is a case

159
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,310
we've never handled before.

160
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,060
We don't really know

161
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,980
what Wang Xing is like.

162
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,540
You know,

163
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,460
business isn't just about analysis.

164
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,060
You have to trust your gut.

165
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,300
Remember last time,

166
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,380
we were negotiating

167
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,940
about a new material for phone cases?

168
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,660
On the signing day,

169
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,820
you found out their boss

170
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,360
was using phone cases
from another company.

171
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,380
Then you stopped it immediately.

172
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,100
Mm.

173
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,260
All their R&D staff
have collectively jumped ship.

174
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,380
And the boss

175
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,220
was just bluffing us with old data.

176
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,380
What they actually made

177
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,580
broke on the ground
just like the dropped phone.

178
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,380
So what are you trying to say?

179
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,020
This time, I have a strange feeling.

180
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,660
I get your doubts.

181
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,300
Why don't we be practical

182
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,700
and carefully analyze the data
Wang Xing gave us?

183
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,420
I'll also check on

184
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,300
his personal credibility.

185
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,140
I think it's rare that my brother

186
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,700
can balance environmental protection

187
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,980
and business profit.

188
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,620
We hardly ever see eye to eye on work.

189
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,540
So I hope this project goes smoothly.

190
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,820
I know you don't like
unfamiliar territory,

191
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
but that doesn't mean

192
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,260
it lacks investment value.

193
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,940
Let's discuss thoroughly

194
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,100
before deciding.

195
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,660
Here, have some tea.

196
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,300
Anlan went to try on the groom's outfit.

197
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
Oh.

198
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,980
Just stop

199
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,140
being so stubborn.

200
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,620
After all,

201
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,980
our son is getting married.

202
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,740
You can't just

203
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,220
leave the groom alone, right?

204
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,300
Doesn't the bride have no parents?

205
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,060
Do you want Anlan
to be without parents too?

206
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,860
Yao Yuan's family may be ordinary,

207
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,420
but her upbringing is decent.

208
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,580
At least she's educated.

209
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,220
Honestly, I don't understand

210
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,780
what you dislike about her.

211
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
They grew up in

212
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,260
completely different environments.

213
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,620
Marrying her in would cause problems.

214
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,180
Despite that,

215
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,140
haven't they both
worked hard to get this far?

216
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,940
Can't you just trust
your son's judgment for once?

217
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,060
You want me to trust him?

218
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,900
Ever since he started dating her,

219
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,580
he's lost all motivation at work.

220
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,500
Look at Ancheng,

221
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,220
trying so hard for

222
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,420
the General Manager position.

223
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,700
And what's Anlan doing?

224
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,750
Huh?

225
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,220
You know well that

226
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Anlan doesn't want
to compete with his brother.

227
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,340
I believe in him.

228
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Fine.

229
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,020
Even if he's not ambitious,

230
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,900
he should at least
show support for the family.

231
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,400
But look what he did.

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,260
Seems like our family affairs

233
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,240
have nothing to do with him at all.

234
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,460
Here you go again.

235
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,580
You always project your expectations

236
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,020
onto others.

237
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,940
You want everything done your way.

238
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,820
All parents

239
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,780
make decisions for their kids' sake.

240
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,860
But the kids have grown up now.

241
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,520
They have their own ideas.

242
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,620
They have their own lives, right?

243
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,980
Enough of that.

244
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,260
Ancheng told me

245
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,980
they are teaming up on a project.

246
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,380
Let's see how Anlan performs.

247
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,020
Ancheng, I like you too,

248
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,620
but my heart belongs to Anlan.

249
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,540
I think what we have

250
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,180
is just a sibling-like bond.

251
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,940
Sorry.

252
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,700
I think we shouldn't meet

253
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,620
until I've figured this out.

254
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,700
(Fang Jianing)

255
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,460
Got some time?
Let's grab a meal together.

256
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,220
Everyone needs to eat.

257
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,620
I often eat alone.
It gets pretty lonely.

258
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,380
Are you hungry?

259
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,420
Just say yes.

260
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,540
Ancheng.

261
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,140
Thank you.

262
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,140
You're so thoughtful.

263
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,740
It's what I should do.

264
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,450
I once met a guy

265
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,100
who didn't pull out a chair for me,

266
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,340
and even scolded the guy
at the next table who helped.

267
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,660
He said stuff like,

268
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,660
"Women just get more useless

269
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,340
because men like this exist."

270
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,700
It was so awkward.

271
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,140
I didn't know when you'd come,

272
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,980
so I already ordered.

273
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,580
Please enjoy your meal.

274
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,220
I used to envy Yao Yuan

275
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,340
for finding someone
as perfect as Jiang Anlan.

276
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,500
But now I realize,

277
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,460
perfection must be hereditary.

278
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,180
Otherwise, how could you
both be so flawless?

279
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,580
You're exaggerating.

280
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,940
Not at all.

281
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,460
You're thoughtful and understanding.

282
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,260
Jiang Anlan is also a rare gem,

283
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,180
so loyal and smart.

284
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,820
His biggest flaw is

285
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,180
having no flaws at all.

286
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
Really?

287
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,620
Yeah.

288
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,420
You haven't seen how
he chases after Yao Yuan.

289
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,930
He was really dedicated.

290
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,380
I'd say,

291
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,740
even someone who doesn't like him at all

292
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,730
would end up completely
devoted to him.

293
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,780
That's true.

294
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,540
He does everything so perfectly.

295
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,460
Every step of dating

296
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,500
is part of his plan.

297
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,180
I really admire him.

298
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,420
Even how he treats Yao Yuan

299
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,740
is so meticulous.

300
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,340
What do you mean?

301
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,050
Nothing.

302
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
I just accidentally

303
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,380
saw his plan to win over Yao Yuan.

304
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,860
I didn't expect

305
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,780
dating could be designed like this.

306
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,300
For example,

307
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,500
I saw what he wrote,

308
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,620
"Start from gaming,

309
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,420
leave a deep impression on Yao Yuan."

310
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,340
Yao Yuan's name in the game

311
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,540
is For Thy Sake, right?

312
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,580
Yeah.

313
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,300
Back then, Lord of All

314
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,540
did pursue Yao Yuan

315
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,030
in the game.

316
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,380
And in real life,
they were pretty close too.

317
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,740
You mean it was all planned out?

318
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,380
There are always strategies in love.

319
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,300
I can understand that.

320
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,180
Courtship

321
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,700
does require some thought.

322
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,100
But if it was all planned,

323
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,060
then what in this relationship is real?

324
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,540
Do you

325
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,500
think I should tell Yao Yuan?

326
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,220
Anlan likes Yao Yuan,

327
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
and Yao Yuan likes him back.

328
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,180
Isn't that enough?

329
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,660
Ancheng,

330
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,780
got plans later?

331
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,020
You don't seem in a good mood.

332
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,580
I'll take you somewhere.

333
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,140
Let's eat first.

334
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,140
Come on, let's go dancing.

335
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,390
Hey.

336
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,080
I don't know how to dance.

337
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,170
You don't need to know how.

338
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,670
Just move your body to the music.

339
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,100
Let's go.

340
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,380
Hey, pretty, have a drink.

341
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,980
The one who saved me last time.

342
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,340
Ancheng.

343
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,340
Why did you drink so much?

344
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,860
Didn't I say we shouldn't meet again?

345
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,860
You're drunk. I'll take you home.

346
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,860
I'm not going home.
I still want to have fun.

347
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,940
Jianing told you to leave.
Can't you hear?

348
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,220
Go away!

349
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,420
Everyone, go away!

350
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,180
Didn't I say don't see me again?

351
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,900
Why did you follow me here?

352
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,820
I'm worried about you!

353
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,100
I don't need you to worry about me.

354
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,420
Who do you think you are?

355
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,540
Do you really think

356
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,620
you're my big brother?

357
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,700
There's no way I could be with you.

358
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,900
I've liked Anlan for so many years.

359
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,140
How could I be with his brother?

360
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,480
So you don't wanna be with me

361
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,220
just because I'm Jiang Anlan's brother?

362
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,780
When will you finally let him go

363
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,420
and give us a chance?

364
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Why can't you just understand?

365
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,900
The one I like is Anlan.

366
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,660
I liked him before,

367
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
I like him now,

368
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,660
and I'll like him in the future.

369
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,180
Why does it have to be him?

370
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,940
I've always been by your side!

371
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,660
Why can't you

372
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,540
look at me

373
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,060
and think about me?

374
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
What about me?

375
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,940
Why does the one I like

376
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,580

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,620

Honestly,

449

you should just move on.

It's faster that way.

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,780

Hey.

Aren't you

457
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,100
going to cheer me on?

458
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,330
Are you even my friends?

459
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,780
Aren't we just doing what friends do?

462
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,580
I'll be there for you.

463
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,180

is just a waste of breath.

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,980
come take a look.

If you miss him, just give him a call.

472
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,340
But he was the one who left me first.

473
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,780
Shouldn't he at least call
to check on me?

474
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,350
If he wanted to call you,

475
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,860
he would have done it already.

476
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,260
With Fang Jianing,

477
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,420
such a pretty and rich girl by his side,

478
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,060
why would he like me?

479
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,700
Not necessarily.

480
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,500
What if

481
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,380
he has some unusual tastes

482
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
and just likes someone

483
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,860
who's a little dense like you?

484
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,220
Seriously, go away.

485
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,060
So childish.

486
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,500
What's wrong?

487
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,220
What did Xinran say
that upset you so much?

488
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,060
She said Jiang Ancheng

489
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,780
might like a dense girl like me.

490
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,660
What about my brother?

491
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,460
Your brother is so outstanding.

492
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,140
When is he getting married?

493
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,540
I'm still busy.

494
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,780
I'm heading out first.

495
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,620
Okay.

496
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,060
What's wrong with you now?

497
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,020
Is he really going back to the company?

498
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,620
Yeah.

499
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,900
He made plans with Su Wen.

500
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,940
Really?

501
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,820
What's going on?

502
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,780
Did you see him with

503
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,100
another woman?

504
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,100
No, it's not that.

505
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,740
I'm not sure if I should say.

506
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,500
What's there not to say? Just tell me.

507
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,780
Ancheng told me,

508
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,100
Jiang Anlan has a notebook
full of plans to pursue you.

509
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,900
He wrote down every step
of pursuing you in it.

510
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,460
All of this was planned by him.

511
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,260
Are you saying

512
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,740
he had it planned out

513
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,100
to be with me?

514
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,300
Yeah.

515
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,260
Actually, Anlan

516
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,420
is very meticulous by nature.

517
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,470
So doing something like this

518
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,620
is not surprising.

519
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,990
Besides Shengshi,

520
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,370
his feelings for you in real life

521
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,420
were all part of his plan too.

522
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,100
You guys keep looking.

523
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,700
I'll go find him

524
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,580
and ask him directly.

525
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,220
Yuan.

526
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,260
This is on you.

527
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,180
Better to let her know

528
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,660
before the marriage, right?

529
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,500
So,

530
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,020
are we still picking a dress?

531
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,280
Pick one for your own wedding.

532
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,260
Jiang, why did you want to see me?

533
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
To give you the invitation.

534
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,260
You actually came all this way

535
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,500
just to hand me the invitation?

536
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,420
You really are boring.

537
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
So pointless, honestly.

538
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,660
Here, this one's actually for you.

539
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,340
Trash.

540
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,100
I want you to blend
eco-friendly plastic with art.

541
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,700
With Yao Yuan's marketing,

542
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,300
you can create an eco-friendly concept.

543
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,820
Only then will the product
get real attention.

544
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,220
Fine. I'd even collect trash just to

545
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,100
work with Yao Yuan.

546
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,940
But hey, Jiang,

547
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,340
aren't you worried that

548
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,020
we might start catching feelings?

549
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,300
From the company to school,

550
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,620
don't you guys spend
all day together every day?

551
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,420
I've never seen you catch feelings.

552
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,820
You still don't get it, do you?

553
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,140
If it was going to happen,
it would have by now.

554
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,020
If it hasn't happened,
then it just won't happen.

555
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,300
Aren't you picking the wedding dress?

556
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,340
Can we talk privately for a bit?

557
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,620
Sure.

558
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,980
Hey,

559
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,300
is there anything I can't hear?

560
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,660
What's wrong, dear?

561
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,820
Do you have a little notebook?

562
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,860
One where you keep your plan
to win me over?

563
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,980
Why ask me this suddenly?

564
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,900
I'm just asking if you do or not.

565
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
I do.

566
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,500
Let me see it.

567
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,140
(Find Yao Yuan, meet game goals)

568
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
(Making a good impression
on For Thy Sake)

569
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,900
(Hold the wedding,
not contact her during a business trip)

570
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,020
(First date at a Western restaurant
to show I value her)

571
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,340
(Never leave her side,
make her used to me being around)

572
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,980
Not contacting me
during a business trip.

573
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,180
That was part of your plan too?

574
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,780
What do you call that?

575
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,020
Playing cat and mouse?

576
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,540
You find my anxiety

577
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,060
really entertaining to you?

578
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,340
Of course not.

579
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,420
So every move I make,

580
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,340
every reaction I have,

581
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,980
is all part of your plan.

582
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,060
The online meetup,
the kiss, falling in love,

583
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,580
it's all something you designed?

584
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
What do you take me for?

585
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,100
Am I just your project plan?

586
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,540
I just wanted to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

587
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,580
Yeah.

588
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,660
So you can't afford

589
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,740
to let your love fail.

590
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,700
Then what am I?

591
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,140
I'm just the reward

592
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,900
for your success?

593
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,980
That's not what I meant.

594
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,380
Do you think this is funny?

595
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,860
I feel like such a fool.

596
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,300
I'm being played by you.

597
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,420
All my reactions
are exactly how you planned.

598
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,460
Have you thought about how I feel?

599
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,940
Yao Yuan.

600
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,860
Listen, I just don't want to lose you.

601
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,260
Yeah.

602
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,060
That one sentence
would have been enough.

603
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,900
None of this was necessary.

604
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,780
Going on dates during work hours.

605
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,900
Our boss really knows how to do his job.

606
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,340
I think you're just jealous of Boss.

607
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,580
I...

608
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,780
Didn't you go out with Yuan?

609
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,900
Why do you look so upset?

610
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,260
Yao Yuan broke off the engagement.

611
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,740
Looks like I have a chance now.

612
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,030
Actually, when I was pursuing Yao Yuan,

613
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,220
I had made a plan.

614
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,460
I originally didn't intend
to tell her about it.

615
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,800
You even planned out
how to chase Yao Yuan?

616
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,260
Because I

617
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,340
can't accept failure.

618
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,540
Being with Yao Yuan
means everything to me.

619
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,020
So now that she knows,

620
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,260
she can't accept it?

621
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,570
She thinks it was all just staged.

622
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,350
It feels just like that movie.

623
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,300
Ah,

624
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,180
I know,

625
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,060
the one called

626
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,100
The Truman Show.

627
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,700
Stories in life

628
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,500
never happen by chance.

629
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
Girls will definitely get upset,

630
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,420
because they don't understand

631
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,020
even if guys

632
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,740
plan everything perfectly,

633
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,680
they don't want to
embarrass themselves.

634
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,700
If you like someone,

635
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,580
does having a plan really matter?

636
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,340
What do you know?

637
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,300
What they want is
that feeling of destiny.

638
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,860
If even that spark is planned,

639
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,820
doesn't it just turn into

640
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,460
a doomed romantic drama?

641
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,140
Oh.

642
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,620
I get it now.

643
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,420
But,

644
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,720
Boss, you have a meeting.

645
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,180
Cancel it for me.

646
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,340
I'm not in the mood.

647
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,380
Ancheng is in the meeting room.

648
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,300
Don't worry.

649
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,540
I'll talk to Yao Yuan.

650
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,660
I'm good at

651
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,740
convincing girls.

652
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,300
Don't worry.

653
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,620
(Team introduction)
This is the initial plan.

654
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,980
Feel free to ask

655
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,100
any questions.

656
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,940
I'll explain them.

657
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,230
Thank you.

658
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,260
Let's wrap up.

659
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,780
Anlan,

660
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,500
you seem distracted.

661
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,220
It's nothing.

662
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,100
Is it because Dad

663
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,940
is still against you marrying Yao Yuan?

664
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,950
I'll figure something out with Dad.

665
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,820
Some things

666
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,980
are better left to chance.

667
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,900
Don't just stick to the plan.

668
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,300
How about this,

669
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,620
I'll take extra care

670
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,660
of this project,

671
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,640
so you can focus on
the wedding preparations.

672
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,900
I'm really fine.

673
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,460
Don't be formal with me.

674
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,100
Wait a second.

675
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,700
Why do you avoid me?

676
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,760
I don't want us to end up

677
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,220
not even being friends.

678
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,380
I don't know either.

679
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,500
I've always seen you as my big brother.

680
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,260
Suddenly, you want me to...

681
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,100
I just can't adjust to that.

682
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,580
I think we both
need some time to cool off.

683
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,940
Hey, Jianing.

684
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,220
Hey.

685
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,900
Are you okay?

686
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,270
Here.

687
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,020
I'm not eating.

688
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,540
I'm not a kid, why are you feeding me?

689
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,340
Tell me.

690
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,820
Was the whole Anlan's courtship plan

691
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,660
your idea?

692
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,500
No.

693
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,660
Really, it wasn't.

694
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,120
I just found out about this myself.

695
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,820
I was wondering,

696
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,420
how Anlan could move so fast

697
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,260
and so smoothly.

698
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
So it was all planned.

699
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,140
This person is really calculating.

700
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,500
But honestly, you can't blame Anlan.

701
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,290
The chemistry between a man and a woman

702
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,840
builds up naturally through interaction.

703
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,860
There are genuine emotions involved,

704
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,360
but also some deliberate effort.

705
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,380
Anlan acts this way

706
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,780
because he cares about Yuan too much.

707
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,060
He doesn't want to lose her.

708
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,300
I get that part.

709
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,660
But if I set a trap for you,

710
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,440
would you be happy about it?

711
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,380
I could be.

712
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,620
Cut it out.

713
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,340
Now, what we need to do is

714
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,820
stop them from breaking up
and make sure they get married.

715
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,380
Don't worry.

716
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,980
Even we can tell Anlan is sincere.

717
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,340
How could Yuan not see it?

718
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,820
They'll be fine.

719
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,140
Wen Cheng,

720
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,500
is there a plan

721
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,820
about how you chase after me?

722
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,420
No way.

723
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,090
I'm only chasing you with my heart.

724
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,980
- And...
- And what else?

725
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,380
Also,

726
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,380
my courage of being shot by your arrows.

727
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,060
I hope Anlan and Yuan get married soon.

728
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,510
I'm waiting to be the godfather.

729
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,100
What's up? Don't you think
I'd be a good godfather?

730
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,260
They haven't even married yet,
you're overthinking it.

731
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,980
Have one.

You finally answered the phone.

740
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,100
What's going on?

741
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,940
Well,

742
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,460
we all know about the plan.

743
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,260
I understand you might
need time to accept it.

744
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,310
But you can't just avoid everyone.

745

bottling things up

751
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,460
isn't as good as letting it all out.

752
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,620
Alright.

753
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,980
Give me a cup of

754
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,020
Moonwalk.

755
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,420
One Purple Superman.

756
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,620
And one

757
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,560
I'm Not Listening to You.

758
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,060
Okay.

759
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,460
What are the names of these drinks?

760
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,100
They sound so strange.

761
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,020
Yao Yuan.

762
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,260
Though their names

763
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,710
sound a bit odd,

764
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,740
they all taste great.

765
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Honestly, Su Wen,

766
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,380
I'm not great with alcohol.
I get drunk easily.

767
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,860
I don't think this place suits me.

768
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,620
Let's go somewhere else.

769
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,580
Alcohol can ease your worries.

770
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,540
Don't worry, I won't let you overdo it.

771
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,220
These are all carefully chosen drinks.

772
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,340
Try it.

773
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,940
It tastes good.

774
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,060
Why does it taste so good?

775
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,460
I can't even tell it's alcohol.

776
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,540
- Tasty, right?
- Yeah.

777
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,940
I'm drinking it.

778
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,060
Go ahead.

779
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,780
You don't want any?

780
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,140
You should drink.

781
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,260
Yao Yuan.

782
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,860
Let me ask you.

783
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,020
Did you have a fight

784
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,860
with Jiang?

785
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,060
I mean,

786
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,340
did you have a fight with Jiang?

787
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,900
What do you think?

788
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,140
How could Jiang Anlan do that?

789
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,460
How could he chase me
like it was all planned?

790
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,900
What does he take me for?

791
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,620
Just a project, right?

792
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,700
Or just a proposal?

793
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,860
You're definitely a project.

794
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,540
His most important project.

795
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,820
To be honest with you,

796
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,020
guys always have a plan

797
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,420
when chasing girls.

798
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,940
Some are just smarter than others.

799
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,500
For someone as cunning as Jiang,

800
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,780
this method seems

801
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,980
pretty normal to me.

802
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,060
When you're chasing a girl,

803
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,780
don't you have a plan too?

804
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,940
Me?

805
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,940
Just look at me, you'll see.

806
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,940
I rely on my personality.

807
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,420
But Yao Yuan,

808
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,620
let me be honest.

809
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,300
Even someone like me

810
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,260
can't deny Jiang's sincerity toward you.

811
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,260
I bet you know that better than I do.

812
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,500
You are his plan.

813
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,780
But you're his most important plan,

814
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,940
and also his top priority project.

815
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,040
Without the drive to win,
there's no plan.

816
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,420
