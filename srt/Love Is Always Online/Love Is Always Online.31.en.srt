Dry these tea leaves in the sun.

They have many uses.

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,580
Grandma, if you hadn't told me,

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,860
I wouldn't have known tea dregs

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,900
were so useful.

Jiang.

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,420
Why are you here?

we wouldn't meet again?

Anlan...

76
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,220
Su Wen told me everything.

77
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
You were always

78
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,580
mature for your age as a child,

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,620
only sharing good news, hiding the bad.

80
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
You like to

81
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,200
take all the burden yourself.

82
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,580
Look at you.

83
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,340
After this happened,

84
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
you still act like

85
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,180
nothing's wrong in front of me.

86
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,020
You must be carrying so much pain.

87
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,390
Grandma.

88
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,620
You don't blame me, right?

89
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,820
Silly child.

90
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
Why would I blame you?

91
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,920
I care about you more than anything.

92
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,980
Yuan,

93
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,420
I want to tell you something.

94
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,980
When I first saw Anlan,

95
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,460
he looked really familiar.

96
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,340
I thought about it for a while,

97
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,140
and then I remembered.

98
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,020
Back then,

99
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,940
after your parents had the accident,

100
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,020
he came here

101
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,260
looking for you many times.

102
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,260
He came to look for me?

103
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,940
Yeah.

104
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,020
Every time he came,

105
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,500
he looked worried,
trying to find out how you were.

106
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,180
Grandma,

107
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,020
you still can't tell me

108
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,140
where is Yao Yuan?

109
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,580
After all that's happened,

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,410
I think Yuan

111
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,220
doesn't want to be disturbed.

112
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,780
You'd better go back

113
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,540
and give her some peace and quiet.

114
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,380
Put the matter between you

115
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,020
on hold for a while.

116
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,020
Grandma,

117
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,940
here's my number.

118
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,340
If Yao Yuan comes back,

119
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,500
or if she feels a bit better,

120
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,580
I hope you'll let me know.

121
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,860
I'll wait for her.

122
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,580
Why are you so determined to find Yuan?

123
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,340
Because I want to apologize to her.

124
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,780
I'm truly sorry.

125
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,180
Every time he left,

126
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,860
it felt like

127
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,100
the whole world was falling apart.

128
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,100
That left a deep impression on me.

129
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,820
Honestly, this kid

130
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,340
is not a bad person.

131
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,620
He just had no choice.

132
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
After that,

133
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,140
I couldn't find that note anymore,

134
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,380
so I never tried to contact him again.

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,180
It wasn't until today when I saw him

136
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,020
that I realized,

137
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,340
back then,

138
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,180
he wasn't just worried about you,

139
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,580
he actually liked you.

140
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
He's liked you all this time.

141
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,060
He always wanted to say sorry

142
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,540
to you personally.

143
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,980
Would it

144
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,230
give him peace?

145
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,860
I think Anlan

146
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,440
must have suffered a lot,

147
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,100
feeling so helpless.

148
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,820
Just think about it,

149
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,380
after everything that happened,

150
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,100
how much courage it must've taken
for him to love you.

151
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,220
But Grandma,

152
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,380
every time I see him now,

153
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,260
I can't help but remember

154
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,940
how hard my parents

155
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,180
had to live back then.

156
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,180
If it weren't for the Jiang family,

157
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,260
my parents might still be alive today.

158
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,420
We could be happy.

159
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,460
Right now, I just

160
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,380
can't forgive myself at all.

161
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,300
How could I possibly

162
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,340
like the person

163
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,740
who caused my parents' death?

164
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,540
How could I be with someone
from the Jiang family?

165
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
Yuan,

166
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,220
I don't want to lecture you.

167
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,340
I just want to tell you this.

168
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,980
I'm no different from your parents.

169
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
I only hope

170
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,380
to see you happy and joyful every day.

171
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,580
I don't want to see you

172
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,780
putting yourself through such pain.

173
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,140
Being human is actually pretty tough

174
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,380
and also simple.

175
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,900
As long as you follow your heart,

176
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,900
no matter how much
hardship you endure,

177
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,100
it's all worth it.

178
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,580
What scares me most

179
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,580
is when you refuse
to face your own heart.

180
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,700
What will you do

181
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,940
if I leave you?

182
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,780
I'll still love you,

183
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,860
and think about you.

184
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,300
How do I know you'll
love and think about me?

185
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,540
I will.

186
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,380
So confident?

187
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,540
Yeah.

188
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,340
I think I'll love you
for about a hundred years.

189
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,300
Just around a lifetime.

190
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
That should be enough.

191
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,980
Alright then.

192
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,180
And I'll invest in longevity medicine
in the future.

193
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,020
We could be put into dormancy

194
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,870
and cryopreserved,

195
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,500
then travel through wormholes together.

196
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
Enough already.

197
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,270
♪Arguing with you, fighting with you♪

198
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,220
♪Every minute, every second with you♪

199
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,340
(Dear)

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,150
♪Nothing else really matters anymore♪

Please try again later.

203
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,450
Sorry, the number you dialed is...

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,560

Yuan.

207
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,220
Didn't we agree
to go to the tea plantation?

208
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,860
Let's go.

209
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,100
I'm not going over just yet.

210
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,580
You guys go ahead first.

211
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,460
Come on, let's go.

212
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,580
If you keep hiding here,

213
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,700
you'll start growing mold.

214
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,540
Anlan.

215
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,780
Why not turn on the lights?

216
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,380
Why did you drink so much?

217
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,620
Anlan,

218
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,220
have you eaten anything?

219
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,220
Drinking so much without eating

220
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,620
is bad for your health.

221
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,220
Mom.

222
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,620
Why wasn't I born into
an ordinary family?

223
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,180
I know many envy my background,

224
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,260
and my advantages.

225
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,220
I don't deny I'm lucky,

226
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,780
but why does such privilege

227
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,620
end up costing me so much?

228
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,460
It seems

229
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,380
Yao Yuan really hurt you deeply.

230
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,100
We're the ones who hurt her.

231
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,300
If we hadn't pulled out the investment,

232
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,900
her parents wouldn't have
gotten into the accident.

233
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,300
We pushed so hard
for business performance,

234
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,860
but ended up tearing her family apart.

235
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,700
Mom.

236
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,540
This isn't your fault.

237
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,300
Yao Yuan will understand someday.

238
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,540
Mom, I've been thinking all day.

239
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,220
Why did things turn out this way?

240
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,180
I've been hiding the truth for so long

241
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,420
cause I was afraid this day would come.

242
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,820
Now, even the love I have for her

243
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,380
is causing her pain.

244
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,500
I just wanted to live the life I wanted.

245
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,860
Why does it have to be so hard?

246
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,700
Mom.

247
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,420
Su Wen.

248
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,460
Eat more.

249
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,140
Here.

250
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,940
Try the prawns I made for you.

251
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,780
Thank you, Grandma.

252
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,740
Yuan.

253
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,580
Have some vegetables.

254
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,300
Look, I made so many dishes.

255
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,460
If you don't eat them,

256
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,180
they'll just go to waste.

257
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,980
Thank you, Grandma.

258
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,620
Grandma, I'm sorry.

259
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,020
I made you worry.

260
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,690
What's there to worry about?

261
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,230
I just don't want you

262
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,020
to make things harder on yourself.

263
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,500
Don't dwell

264
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,460
on certain things.

265
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,220
No matter how much you think it through,

266
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
there's no clear answer.

267
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,460
Just let it be.

268
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,460
Now, let's eat.

269
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,100
Grandma,

270
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
I will leave

271
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,140
after dinner.

272
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,820
Leave?

273
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,660
Yeah.

274
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,300
I thought you wouldn't return to Ruishi.

275
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,140
Why the rush?

276
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,900
I want to find something else
to do back there

277
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,060
to keep myself busy.

278
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,780
Oh.

279
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,020
That sounds good.

280
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,780
Just go back.

281
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,300
If you want to,

282
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,340
you can come anytime.

283
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,900
I always welcome you home.

284
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,740
Grandma.

285
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,740
Don't worry.

286
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,860
I will

287
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,420
always be Yao Yuan's bodyguard.

288
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
Yuan is lucky

289
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,940
to have a good friend

290
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,220
like you.

291
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,620
I'm the one who should be grateful.

292
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,220
Right, you're running out of fans.

293
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,420
Isn't it easy to get fans?

294
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,340
As long as I take a few cases,

295
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,180
my boss will...

296
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,420
It's okay, Su Wen.

297
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,740
We all need to get back on track.

298
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,180
Are you really going back?

299
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,700
Yes, really.

300
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,060
Why?

301
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,100
There's no use otherwise.

302
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,730
I came out this time to clear my head

303
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,130
and use this chance

304
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,300
to forget Anlan.

305
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,820
But I realized

306
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,020
when people feel sad,

307
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,540
the more they want

308
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,300
to run from something,

309
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,860
the harder it is to escape.

310
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,980
Even if I quit my job

311
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,020
and live with my grandma,

312
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,780
I'll still think about him.

313
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,780
He always sneaks into my mind
without me noticing.

314
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,260
No matter what I'm doing,

315
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
when I'm eating,

316
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,780
sleeping,

317
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,180
walking,

318
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,060
picking tea leaves,

319
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,380
or even just breathing,

320
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,820
I always feel like

321
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,970
someone is calling me Dear

322
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,780
from behind.

323
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,020
And when I turn around,

324
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,980
I see him,

325
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,140
smiling softly, looking right at me.

326
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,580
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm losing my mind.

327
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,060
Longing is a sickness,

328
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,060
and a broken heart

329
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,700
is even incurable.

330
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,900
So I made up my mind.

331
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,260
I stopped fighting it.

332
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,940
I should face it head-on.

333
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,380
Maybe one day, things will go smoothly.

334
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,620
Then my life could finally
get back on track.

335
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,580
But what if

336
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,660
things don't go well?

337
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,380
If things don't go well,

338
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,460
I'll have no choice but to let myself

339
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
be completely heartbroken.

340
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,540
Until one day,

341
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
his image in my mind

342
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,020
starts to fade more and more.

343
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,860
Until

344
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,140
I can't even remember
what he looked like.

345
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,020
Until

346
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,780
I can't picture

347
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,380
the way he looked at me.

348
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,940
I simply

349
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,300
don't dare to think about the future.

350
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,540
Because

351
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
without Anlan,

352
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,580
I will never

353
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,500
be happy again.

What's with the eco-friendly
plastic project?

365
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,020
There's an issue with the patent rights.

366
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,700
We're finding a solution.

367
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,260
There's an issue?

368
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,140
Can patent issues
just come up out of nowhere?

369
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,420
Chairman.

370
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,260
I considered what you said
before investing.

371
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
I had my doubts too.

372
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,060
But Anlan is interested.

373
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,910
He thinks this case will be a win-win.

374
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,700
I agreed, so...

375
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,540
Willful.

376
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,960
This is the price you pay for willfulness.

377
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,820
We'll find a way to fix it.

378
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,020
Is it you,

379
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,900
or is it you both?

380
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,900
I heard from your mom that
he's locked himself in the room.

381
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,700
For a woman,
he's lost his appetite and focus.

382
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,820
What does it mean?

383
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,740
Trying to starve himself?

384
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,140
Listen,

385
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,940
compensation is the least

386
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,300
of our worries if anything goes wrong

387
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,700
with this project.

388
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,220
But if it damage the company's image,

389
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,540
who'll take responsibility?

390
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,580
Both companies have been
dragged into this.

391
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,580
Do you want others to laugh at us?

392
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,540
How many times have I told you?

393
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,180
Trust

394
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,060
is the foundation of everything.

395
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
If you act like this,

396
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,380
who would trust us?

397
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,140
Just stay in this room and think it over

398
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,260
before you leave.

399
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,460
Anlan,

400
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,300
have something to eat.

401
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
No matter what happens,

402
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,500
Mom will always support you.

403
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,500
(Li Ao)
Boss,

404
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,460
your father is concerned
about this case.

405
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,380
Anlan.

406
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,220
To be honest,

407
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,940
I'm not good at comforting others,

408
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,380
but when I'm feeling down,

409
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,820
I like to eat something sweet.

410
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,960
So I thought,

411
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,820
maybe this could
lift your spirits a bit.

412
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,450
Thank you.

413
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,500
How are you and Yao doing?

414
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,290
We're fine.

415
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,620
You're lying.

416
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,020
You took so many days off at once

417
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,060
and you've lost a lot of weight.

418
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,980
You look exhausted.

419
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,740
How can you be fine?

420
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,500
You and Yao haven't really
broken up, have you?

421
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,700
I don't want to see you
with anyone else,

422
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,180
but if it's Yao,

423
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,780
I guess I could accept it.

424
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,260
So no matter what happens

425
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,420
between you two,

426
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,380
I hope you can reconcile.

427
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,460
You're way too involved

428
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,420
in your boss's love life.

429
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,500
Boss,

430
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,500
I have something to report.

431
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,260
Jianing, go out first.

432
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,420
Okay.

433
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,540
You need to sort out the issue

434
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,420
with Yao quickly.

435
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,100
What's wrong?

436
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,780
The eco-friendly plastic case

437
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,020
isn't looking good.

438
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,700
Also, the client says the last batch

439
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,580
of samples isn't biodegradable

440
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,660
and wants to return all.

441
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,060
Didn't we investigate Wang Xing before

442
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,350
and found no problems with him?

443
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,980
His background is clean.

444
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,380
But no one knows why

445
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,340
the products are faulty.

446
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,180
Accept all returns

447
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,340
as requested.

448
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,140
As for the others,

449
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,100
try to contact Wang Xing.

450
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,820
Boss.

451
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,060
I found something.

452
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,340
Tell me on the car.

453
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,510
My brother's found Wang Xing.

454
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,020
I'm not sure about this.

455
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,220
Mr. Jiang.

456
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,220
Mr. Wang.

457
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,020
What's wrong with the eco-friendly
plastic patent formula?

458
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,980
Mr. Jiang.

459
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,260
I'm truly sorry.

460
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,620
The patent was almost finalized.

461
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,140
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
guaranteed it so confidently.

462
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,820
- It was...
- Almost?

463
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,620
Is it normal to approve

464
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,500
something without a finalized patent?

465
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,540
If the patent doesn't go through,

466
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,860
I'll take full responsibility

467
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,860
for the costs you invested.

468
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,580
Take responsibility?

469
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,420
How will you do that?

470
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,060
Such a crucial patent's problems

471
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,860
made the product defective

472
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,420
and non-compliant with regulations.

473
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Even if you compensate us,

474
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,060
you can't make up

475
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,900
for our credit loss.

476
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,700
As long as the project makes money,

477
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,500
whether you have the patent formula

478
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,380
won't affect our
willingness to cooperate.

479
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,020
We can work together

480
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
to secure the formula.

481
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,180
But you lied, saying you already had it.

482
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,820
This...

483
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,060
I didn't want that either.

484
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,180
But you still did that.

485
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,820
It's useless to talk about it now.

486
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,460
What matters is

487
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,420
getting the patent soon

488
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,660
and securing the formula

489
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,380
so the product launch won't be delayed.

490
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,940
Product launch?

491
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,820
Without the patent,

492
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,780
no matter how we produce it,

493
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
we still can't pass the inspection.

494
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,700
How can we launch it then?

495
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,940
Maybe it's just a batch issue.

496
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,820
Let's wait for the next batch

497
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,660
to do re-inspection.

498
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,100
Right.

499
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,620
Mr. Jiang, we've faced

500
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,750
this situation before.

501
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,340
Luckily, when the report came out,

502
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,660
your brother reminded me

503
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,860
to request a re-inspection.

504
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,060
Otherwise, I

505
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,900
would have panicked.

506
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,900
You knew about
the product failure early on.

507
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,620
Why did you hide it from me?

508
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,460
Didn't you give me full authority?

509
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,860
And what happened?

510
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,180
The patent wasn't approved,
causing product failure.

511
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,100
You decided to sign the contract.

512
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,660
Now that things have gone wrong,
you're blaming me?

513
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,740
You were swamped with the wedding,

514
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,700
so I wanted to help you.

515
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,100
But now you're accusing me.

516
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,580
Don't bring up the wedding.

517
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,180
What's done is done.

518
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,380
How long will you keep complaining?

519
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,460
Since this happened,

520
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,820
have you ever said sorry to me?

521
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,300
You know exactly where
Yao Yuan stands in my heart,

522
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,160
but you act like

523
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,580
you just accidentally
stepped on my foot.

524
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,460
Does saying sorry

525
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,060
fix anything?

526
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,140
At least it makes me feel like

527
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,500
you're truly sorry,

528
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,860
and you care about how I feel.

529
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,900
Sorry.

530
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Feeling better now?

531
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,660
You two have arrived.

532
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,340
Why aren't you going in?

533
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Dinner's almost ready.

534
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,820
Let's go.

535
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,500
Ancheng.

536
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,340
How's the plastic case coming along?

537
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,580
I heard from your dad

538
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,620
that things aren't going well.

539
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Don't worry, everything's under control.

540
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,620
Is that so?

541
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,700
That's good to hear.

542
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,300
What about Yao Yuan?

543
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,540
Is she still refusing to forgive you?

544
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,900
It's not just about me
needing her forgiveness.

545
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,940
Our whole family should apologize
and ask for her understanding.

546
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,620
If only we'd looked beyond the numbers

547
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,540
to the families behind them

548
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,780
when making the decision,
then it wouldn't

549
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,620
have been so cold,

550
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,460
so heartless,

551
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,820
and her family wouldn't be ruined.

552
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,460
We're running a business, not a charity.

553
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,620
If we had to feel sorry

554
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,540
for every project,

555
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
how could it keep running?

556
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,060
I'm not asking you to pity them.

557
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,860
I want you to see their potential.

558
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,980
Think about people, not just numbers.

559
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,500
Focus on the people?

560
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,660
You tell me how to think then.

561
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,380
Some things matter way more than money.

562
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,820
That's too subjective.

563
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,540
So is it okay to lose money

564
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,580
as long as you like it?

565
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,980
Enough.

566
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,660
- Dad.
- You two,

567
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,300
why argue during a family meal?

568
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,940
Alright, alright, sit down.

569
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,780
Have a seat.

570
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
Grandpa, you guys eat.

571
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,780
I'm not hungry.

572
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,340
Anlan.

573
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,060
Anlan.

574
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,060
Where are you going?

575
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,900
Home.

576
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,740
Eat first.

577
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,180
I can't eat.

578
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,740
Don't be mad at him.

579
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,580
Work's been tough for him lately.

580
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,380
Plus, the issue with that girl,

581
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,860
and now the family fight.

582
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,180
Try to understand him, okay?

583
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,980
He's your son.

584
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,380
You take care of it.

585
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,780
You act like he's not your son.

586
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,940
He just takes after you.

587
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,580
Where's Yao Yuan?

588
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,260
She went straight to her room.

589
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,100
Maybe she's avoiding my questions.

590
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,140
Avoiding each other like this

591
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,380
won't solve anything.

592
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,000
They clearly love each other.

593
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,340
Even if it's in the past,

594
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,660
can't they talk it through properly?

595
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,740
If they love each other,

596
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,980
they should face it together.

597
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,260
There's nothing that can't be solved.

598
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,220
You're not the one involved,

599
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,940
so of course it's easy for you to say.

600
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,700
If you were the one involved,

601
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,060
would you stay so calm?

602
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,740
I definitely would.

603
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,220
I hate wasting time more than anything.

604
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,620
Haven't we dragged it on too long?

605
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,740
You know how much
Anlan has given for Yuan.

606
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,660
But do you know how important

607
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,540
Anlan is in Yuan's heart?

608
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,300
Ever since Mr. and Mrs. Yao passed,

609
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,620
I've felt like

610
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,980
there's a veil over Yuan's smile.

611
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,380
Since her parents are gone,

612
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,300
if she's too happy,

613
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,820
she feels a deep sense of guilt.

614
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,660
It was Anlan who made Yuan believe

615
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,060
that she could be truly happy

616
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,700
and life actually held some hope.

617
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,380
But when it comes to this matter,

618
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,300
Anlan actually lied to her.

619
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,660
If you were Yuan, what would you do?

620
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,060
Would you forgive him that easily?

621
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,700
But you have to try to understand
how Anlan feels too.

622
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
If it were me,

623
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,260
I definitely wouldn't dare say it.

624
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,100
We can understand that,

625
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,260
but this is something we can't force.

626
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,300
You know,

627
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,260
Yuan loves Anlan deeply,

628
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,820
but she also loves her parents.

629
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,580
If she forgives him so easily,

630
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,460
how could she forgive herself?

631
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,300
I know Anlan is your friend.

632
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,140
But

633
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,860
all we can do

634
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,380
is keep them company.

635
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,060
If you don't sell,

636
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,660
I'm going to cause a scene.

637
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,740
I'll sell all of it to you.

638
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,420
You should leave now.

639
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,500
Come with me.

640
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,980
Alright then.

641
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,340
In that case, I'm staying.

642
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,060
Isn't this For Thy Sake?

643
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,540
Why are you selling all your equipment?

644
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,500
I'm selling my account.

645
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,380
Sell it?

646
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,540
Are you

647
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,460
going to be a housewife?

648
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,060
What a shame.

649
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,540
You reached such a high level.

650
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,500
Exactly.

651
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,380
Will you buy it?

652
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,940
No, no, no.
We wouldn't dare act recklessly.

653
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,220
Exactly.

654
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,300
What if we buy it,

655
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,200
and it brings us trouble?

656
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,070
That's true.

657
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,460
Even if you quit playing,

658
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,060
we can still hang out here in Shengshi.

659
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,740
Otherwise,
married life would be so dull.

660
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,700
It would get boring fast.

661
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,420
I'll buy it.

662
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,980
What's the update on the plastic?

663
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,340
It depends on my brother.

664
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,700
He'll find a way to fix it.

665
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,900
After everything that happened,

666
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,820
you still trust him?

667
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,900
Yes.

668
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,340
I know you two are brothers.

669
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,380
You want to stand by family.

670
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,860
But you can't let that

671
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,260
blind your judgment.

672
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,940
If it were any of
our usual business partners,

673
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,620
they would have wiped him out by now.

674
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,740
I believe my brother
didn't mean for this.

675
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,340
Family ties

676
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,780
are the most troublesome bonds.

677
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,380
That's true.

678
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,260
Maybe your dad
didn't want to be your dad,

679
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,180
but he can't just shrug and say,

680
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,220
"I'm done".

681
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,140
There's no way around it.

682
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,220
Even if I start my own company,

683
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,620
we'll still be connected by blood.

684
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,100
I've never understood

685
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,500
why you trust him so much.

686
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
Especially when he...

687
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,420
Outside of business,

688
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,420
he made you and Yao Yuan...

689
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,420
How is Yao Yuan doing?

690
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,020
Do you think she's okay?

691
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,700
If this keeps up,

692
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,900
you both will get sick.

693
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,140
Stop worrying about it.

694
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,540
Didn't you say before

695
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,460
you two had a falling out
over something small,

696
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,220
but then you got back together?

697
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,140
People who are meant to be

698
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,980
will end up together eventually.

699
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,340
It just takes a bit of

700
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,300
time to let things settle.

701
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,820
Can time really fix everything?

702
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,220
Time can heal everything.

703
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,620
It depends on whether
you're willing to wait.

Check this out.

722
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,800
(Fake Eco-Materials by Ruishi)
They say our plastic

723
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,950
(Sea Turtles at Risk if Released)
doesn't break down at all.

724
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,020
At best, it just fragments,

725
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
and flows into the ocean,

726
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,940
ending up as trash
in sea turtles' stomachs.

727
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,260
It hasn't officially launched yet.

728
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,300
Why are these reports coming out?

729
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,460
I checked on that reporter.

730
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,980
He says he has evidence against us,

731
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,900
but he's unwilling to go into details.

732
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,180
Said it's to protect
the source of the information.

733
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,540
Let my brother know.

734
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,860
Then contact Wang Xing

735
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,860
and see if he knows
anything about the leak.

736
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,100
Speaking of Wang Xing,
I have something to report.

737
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,620
Go ahead.

738
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,260
He has withheld
the factory workers' wages.

739
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,500
Workers haven't been paid
despite working for some time.

740
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,100
There's already been a protest.

741
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,380
Now we need to settle the payments

742
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,340
and keep production going.

743
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Unless we confirm
it's eco-friendly plastic,

744
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,420
what's made will just be useless waste.

745
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
But the factory disagrees.

746
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,060
They've invested manpower and equipment.

747
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,420
The losses aren't small.

748
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,500
Got it.

749
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,740
Let me think it over.

750
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,060
Anlan did say my coffee is good.

751
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,540
I'll make it for you every day.

752
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,380
Master.

753
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,860
I saw that news report.

754
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,140
Do you think I can help with anything?

755
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,940
Maybe I can ask my parents to help you.

756
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,220
They have quite a wide network.

757
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,860
See if they can

758
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,580
help find the source of the rumors fast.

759
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,620
I really appreciate

760
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,060
you making me coffee.

761
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,220
But running a business

762
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,260
isn't child's play.

763
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,860
We can't rely on connections
to fix things.

764
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,780
Boss,

765
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,580
no matter what happens,

766
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,620
we'll be with you through it all.

767
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,900
Yes, absolutely.

768
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,740
We stand by you.

769
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,580
Exactly.

770
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,260
Even if you asked us
to finish all the plastic,

771
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,220
we wouldn't mind at all.

772
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,380
Boss, we're behind you.

773
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,140
Boss, we've got your back.

774
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,380
Thank you.

775
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,300
Don't thank us.

776
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,780
We should be the ones thanking you.

777
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,060
Whenever we tell friends
about working at Ruishi,

778
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,740
they're always so jealous.

779
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,220
Exactly.

780
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,180
This time, it's our turn to contribute.

781
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,900
Let your friends envy you

782
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
for having such great employees.

783
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,460
Boss, we're behind you.

784
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,940
Boss, we've got your back.

785
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,460
Keep it up, we're with you.

786
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,660
Jiang Anlan's really
in deep trouble this time.

787
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,660
They decided to produce the plastic,

788
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,500
and invested without checking properly.

789
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,340
That's his own fault.

790
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,820
But I think

791
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,180
he might have been fooled.

792
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,780
Who could possibly fool him?

793
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,540
Isn't he the one doing the fooling?

794
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,820
He's hidden his ties
with Yao Yuan's family all along.
