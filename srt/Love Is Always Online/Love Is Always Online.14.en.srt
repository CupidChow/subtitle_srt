1
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,521
Sis

2
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
What's wrong?

3
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:50,601
Weren't you going out on a date?

4
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:52,841
Zhuang Wei

5
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,801
Zhuang Wei has another woman.

6
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:56,281
Ah.

7
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:57,441
No.

8
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:58,281
What happened?

9
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,361
We went shopping today.

10
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,081
A woman came over.

11
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,161
She said she's his girlfriend.

12
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,121
She told me

13
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:08,881
what she can give him in this life,

14
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,640
I can never give him.

15
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,281
Zhuang Wei

16
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,681
Zhuang Wei, in front of her,

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,000
broke up with me.

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,640
Sis, it's okay.

19
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,361
I'm here for you, okay?

20
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:27,521
It's all right.

21
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,121
He's not the only man in the world.

22
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:36,561
Sis,

23
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,801
It took you so long to move on.

24
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,001
You were so relieved back then

25
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,241
that before you got married,

26
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,841
you saw his true colors.

27
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,801
I really don't want you hurt again.

28
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:50,881
From now on,

29
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,601
if he calls you,

30
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,761
and you can't help but want to answer,

31
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,681
call me instead, okay?

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,800
What if he

33
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:01,921
shows up like today?

34
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:02,881
Just tell me.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
I'll handle it for you.

36
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:08,761
Before,

37
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,601
you always protected me.

38
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:13,921
Now it's my turn to protect you.

39
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:24,241
Let's go.

40
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:34,921
Hello.

41
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:35,961
Hello.

42
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,561
I'm looking for Jiang Anlan.

43
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:39,041
May I ask who you are?

44
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:41,721
How about this—

45
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,041
Call him for me.

46
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:43,761
Just say

47
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:44,921
I'm Yao Yuan's uncle.

48
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:46,041
I need to discuss something with him.

49
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,681
Yao Yuan

50
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:49,401
Sorry,

51
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:50,921
I don't think we have that person here.

52
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,161
Can you call him?

53
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:52,681
Hello.

54
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,201
How can I help you?

55
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:56,761
Who are you?

56
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,121
I'm Jiang Anlan's brother.

57
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:58,801
Jiang Ancheng.

58
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,361
You said you're Yao Yuan's uncle,

59
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:01,721
right?

60
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:02,521
Yes, yes.

61
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,121
So you're in charge here too?

62
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:05,841
Sort of.

63
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,521
What do you need with Anlan?

64
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:08,961
That's great, that's great.

65
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:09,681
Here's the thing—

66
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,721
I want to open a chain restaurant.

67
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,721
But I'm having trouble with funding.

68
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:14,721
Oh, right.

69
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:15,601
Look,

70
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,201
I brought the project proposal.

71
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,600
I want to see

72
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,881
if you can help me out.

73
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:23,841
Let's talk somewhere else.

74
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:24,601
Okay, sure.

75
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
Mr. Shi, feel free to speak openly.

76
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:33,761
Okay.

77
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,081
I used to run a small shop.

78
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,441
Business was booming.

79
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,521
The prospects were great.

80
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:39,961
So,

81
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,081
I discussed with my partner

82
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,161
about opening a chain.

83
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:44,001
But now,

84
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:45,361
I'm short on money.

85
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,401
So,

86
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:47,881
can you invest in me?

87
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:03,441
Talk to this person.

88
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:04,361
He can help you.

89
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:10,001
Yao Yuan really found a great partner.

90
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,801
Even her boyfriend's brother is reliable.

91
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,841
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

92
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:17,481
Well, I'll be going now.

93
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:24,001
Brother Ancheng.

94
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:25,601
Jiajia.

95
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:28,441
Who was that?

96
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,240
Oh.

97
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:30,801
That's Yao Yuan's uncle.

98
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:31,961
He came to borrow money from Anlan.

99
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:32,921
Anlan wasn't here,

100
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:33,641
so I helped him.

101
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,161
You lent him money?

102
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:37,641
If I can help, I do. Glad to see it.

103
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,361
It's a favor for Anlan.

104
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:40,801
Don't tell Anlan about it.

105
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,121
Wait until he succeeds,

106
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:43,481
it'll be a nice surprise for him.

107
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,321
Brother Ancheng, you're so kind.

108
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,441
So Yao Yuan's broke because of her uncle.

109
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,401
Didn't expect she had such a relative.

110
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,281
If Uncle Jiang finds out,

111
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,081
he'll definitely blow up.

112
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,321
Those two won't get together.

113
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:01,041
Hey.

114
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,961
Why are you dressed so formally today?

115
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,961
There's an interview at the company later.

116
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:06,481
Brother Ancheng, you know what?

117
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,121
Since I came here,

118
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,561
I can make coffee and do copies now.

119
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,521
I think I've improved a lot.

120
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,121
So I think

121
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:15,681
a real job won't be too hard for me.

122
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:17,001
I believe you can do it.

123
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:17,641
Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,041
I'll go get ready now.

125
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:19,961
Good luck!

126
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:20,561
Go for it!

127
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:50,481
Yao Xinran

128
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:53,721
Didn't you say you'd move on from that jerk?

129
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,521
But you know,

130
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,641
we were together for so long.

131
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,440
It's not that easy to forget.

132
00:06:58,761 --> 00:06:59,281
Besides,

133
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:01,841
he broke off the engagement for me.

134
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,841
Maybe he'll change for the better?

135
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:07,561
Whenever you see Zhuang Wei,

136
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,320
your brain turns to mush.

137
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,921
You trust a cheater's words?

138
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,281
Might as well believe the dead can come back.

139
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:29,361
Hey.

140
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:30,841
Fairy Lady

141
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,681
Didn't I win our last bet?

142
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,121
Don't you owe me a meal?

143
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,241
You didn't really accept, did you?

144
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:40,561
Don't get hung up on one blade of grass

145
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,721
and miss the whole forest.

146
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,641
All right, I get it.

147
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:45,921
I'll treat you to dinner.

148
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:47,281
Send me the time and place.

149
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:48,961
Okay.

150
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:57,801
That guy is the textbook definition of scumbag.

151
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,081
Cheating, breaking off engagements,
rekindling an old flame—

152
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:01,721
He’s committed every possible
relationship crime.

153
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,401
He honestly deserves a public flogging.

154
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,521
Beat him until he can’t stand up.

155
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:07,481
Then lock him up in jail.

156
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:08,441
Don’t let him out to hurt anyone.

157
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:11,601
How can you be so foolish?

158
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:12,921
Who are you calling out?

159
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,001
I’m talking about you.

160
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:16,521
No, not you two.

161
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,201
You handle your own issues.

162
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:20,601
Explain it to me clearly.

163
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:21,481
Who is that woman?

164
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:22,801
I wish there was a law

165
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:24,601
to arrest all these emotional scammers.

166
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:29,201
Boss.

167
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:30,521
Wan Jin Group.

168
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,641
Hotel project proposal for couples.

169
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,361
It’s finished.

170
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:33,121
Please take a look.

171
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,721
Isn’t targeting only couples too narrow?

172
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:39,921
It’s fine.

173
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,121
Couples are everywhere.

174
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:43,281
You have one.

175
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,241
Not everyone has a partner.

176
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:49,961
But most people have family.

177
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:51,921
What we need to do

178
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,841
is broaden our target.

179
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,001
Let everyone

180
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,161
dream of going from couple to spouse,

181
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,240
then building a family and career.

182
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:01,441
Okay, I’ll have them revise the proposal.

183
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,361
Where did you get this family happiness idea?

184
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:08,561
It’s part of my future plan too.

185
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:11,801
If it goes well,

186
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,121
your wife should get a share of the bonus.

187
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,921
The company is expanding soon.

188
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:17,321
We’re scheduling interviews.

189
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:17,841
I know.

190
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,561
Fang Jianing is one of the candidates.

191
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,201
I always keep work and personal life separate.

192
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,641
As long as she’s talented,

193
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:25,721
I’ll accept her.

194
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:32,281
Next, please come in.

195
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:34,761
Anlan, big brother.

196
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:38,881
Please have a seat.

197
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,441
I heard you’re applying for

198
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:44,561
Special Project Planner.

199
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:45,801
Yes.

200
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:48,441
I’m clear-minded and creative.

201
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,801
I’m sure I can handle this job.

202
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:54,641
Tell me,

203
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,161
what did you learn during your internship?

204
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,041
I can use the coffee machine now.

205
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:01,801
Do you think you’re applying

206
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:02,921
for a restaurant server job?

207
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,881
I can use the printer too.

208
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,281
I know how to print both sides of an ID on one page.

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,480
And both sides are upright.

210
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:10,201
That’s actually impressive.

211
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,881
But we need a Special Project Planner,

212
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:15,801
not a general helper.

213
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,761
Everyone starts from scratch.

214
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,601
I’m smart and hardworking.

215
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:22,521
I can definitely do this job.

216
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:26,281
What do you think?

217
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,161
Ms. Fang’s resume is impressive.

218
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,041
She’s fluent in several languages.

219
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,160
During her internship,

220
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:34,001
many supervisors praised her talent.

221
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:38,681
Me,

222
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,041
I have one concern.

223
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,081
Can a young lady like you handle this?

224
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:46,801
I can.

225
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,441
I’m very resilient.

226
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,961
I never cried taking medicine since kindergarten.

227
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:55,921
How about this—

228
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:57,561
give me three challenges.

229
00:10:58,121 --> 00:10:59,001
If I pass them all,

230
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,121
you hire me.

231
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:04,881
Deal.

232
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,440
Really?

233
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,001
That’s great!

234
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,360
Thank you, Anlan!

235
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:10,001
I’ll work really hard.

236
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:15,321
By the way, Anlan—

237
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:17,641
maybe you can get Yao Yuan a side job.

238
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,361
I saw her selling gear in Sheng Shi last time.

239
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:21,721
She looked exhausted.

240
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:22,721
So I bought everything.

241
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,641
Bye, Anlan!

242
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
Fang Jianing said you’re selling gear?

243
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:42,201
I haven’t sold in a while.

244
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,160
There’s so much gear.

245
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,841
You want to buy?

246
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:45,601
Yeah.

247
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,401
Isn’t that what I should do?

248
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,761
If you need help again,

249
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:50,481
be sure to ask me.

250
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:51,881
We’ll figure it out together.

251
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:59,041
Are you tired?

252
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,081
No.

253
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:03,081
Should we order takeout tonight?

254
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,121
Or have hotpot instead?

255
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,521
Just cook something simple.

256
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:10,681
Madam is wise as always.

257
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:11,921
You’re annoying.

258
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,160
Hey.

259
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,001
Mm.

260
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,521
This one looks better.

261
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,280
Get this one, get this one.

262
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:22,481
Hey, hey, hey.

263
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,320
Wait, wait.

264
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:24,241
No, no.

265
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:25,721
What’s wrong?

266
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:26,401
Oh no.

267
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,401
Come here, look at this.

268
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:30,961
Don’t think expensive means better.

269
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:31,881
It just looks nice.

270
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,681
These tomatoes look ugly,

271
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,761
but they taste great.

272
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,521
And they’re cheap—let’s get these.

273
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,841
Madam says buy these.

274
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:45,321
So we’ll buy them.

275
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,121
Such big tomatoes.

276
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:54,321
Let’s go.

277
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,280
Let’s go.

278
00:12:58,801 --> 00:12:59,481
Hey, hey.

279
00:12:59,641 --> 00:12:59,961
Wait.

280
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:01,681
Why are you buying so many veggies?

281
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:02,561
We can’t finish them all.

282
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:03,681
Can’t finish.

283
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,321
We can make vegetable soup.

284
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:07,241
Want to buy anything else?

285
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,481
No need, we have plenty at home.

286
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:21,761
This one looks pretty good.

287
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:22,761
Get this one.

288
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,241
Wait, wait.

289
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:24,801
Why are you buying so much?

290
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:25,361
Put it back.

291
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:25,841
What's wrong?

292
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:27,441
Do you even know what this is?

293
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:28,481
Just get this much.

294
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,401
It looks pretty nice.

295
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
Look at this.

296
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,641
Buy two, get one free—such a deal.

297
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,360
Eat it in the morning.

298
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,040
Get this one.

299
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,521
Madam says buy this, so buy it.

300
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:41,961
Buy two, get one free.

301
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:43,521
Buy it.

302
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:45,761
Don't buy so much, even of this.

303
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:46,801
What are you doing?

304
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:47,521
Let's go.

305
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,081
With Madam with me from now on,

306
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,121
I'll never waste money again.

307
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,961
You work hard for your money.

308
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,561
Buying all this random stuff—

309
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,961
Can't finish it, it's a waste.

310
00:13:59,001 --> 00:13:59,561
Right?

311
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,641
I like you just the way you are.

312
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:03,201
What way?

313
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,561
Your stingy side.

314
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,121
Want to know?

315
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:06,561
Yeah.

316
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:10,601
You're annoying.

317
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,160
Jiang Anlan.

318
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:21,001
Yeah.

319
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,161
My uncle.

320
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:23,921
Did he call you?

321
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,401
No, why?

322
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:29,041
He called me.

323
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,241
Said someone wants to invest in him.

324
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,241
Wants me to celebrate with him.

325
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:36,681
I'm wondering if that person is you.

326
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:38,521
Yeah.

327
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:40,881
About your uncle—

328
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:43,081
Let me be honest.

329
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:44,921
Don't take it personally.

330
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:47,441
Helping him is actually hurting him.

331
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,521
Once he gets a taste of success,

332
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:50,361
he'll want it again.

333
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:51,841
It'll never end.

334
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,281
He wasn't like this before.

335
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:57,481
But now he is.

336
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,241
Mistakes he made himself—

337
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,161
He has to face them himself.

338
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,561
If someone always bails him out,

339
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,281
he'll never realize it.

340
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:18,201
If he truly understands,

341
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,481
I can help him, but with conditions.

342
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,641
But I won't do it behind your back.

343
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,161
Come on, eat.

344
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:33,441
Go ahead.

345
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:40,841
What is this? So crunchy.

346
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,201
Cabbage.

347
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:46,961
Why is it so crunchy?

348
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,241
It's not cooked.

349
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,121
Oops, I spaced out.

350
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:54,081
Hey, stop eating.

351
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:54,881
Spit it out, quick.

352
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:55,921
Stop eating, stop.

353
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:56,521
No.

354
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:57,761
I'll eat whatever you give me.

355
00:15:58,681 --> 00:15:59,241
Okay.

356
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:00,601
Then all of this is for you.

357
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:01,641
Eat it all, okay?

358
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:02,961
It's all raw, you eat it.

359
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:04,481
Eat it all, dip it in sesame sauce.

360
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:05,681
Hey, don't eat it.

361
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,561
Stop eating, stop.

362
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:08,761
Then I'll eat too.

363
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:25,401
What are you doing?

364
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:27,681
Still overspending?

365
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:29,641
Yeah.

366
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:32,521
About my uncle—

367
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:33,641
It makes me even more sure

368
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:34,961
my earlier judgment was right.

369
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:36,361
We should save money.

370
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,241
For emergencies.

371
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:40,961
Hey, tell me—

372
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:44,241
Besides selling gear on Sheng Shi,

373
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:45,161
what else can I do?

374
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:46,641
Go on a date with a pro.

375
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:49,081
Just kidding.

376
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,641
Everyone has their own place.

377
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,441
With your delicate hands,

378
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,561
you can't do hard labor.

379
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:58,641
I think

380
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:00,761
you could be a young madam.

381
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:01,761
Hey.

382
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,121
Alright, alright, I'm done joking.

383
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,361
I think

384
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:07,001
you could do street art.

385
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,081
Like sketching portraits for people.

386
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:10,961
Two birds with one stone.

387
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,441
You get to draw and make money.

388
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,521
Why didn't I think of that?

389
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,521
Don't tell Jiang Anlan or Wen Cheng.

390
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:20,961
Oh.

391
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:57,921
You can draw?

392
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:58,721
Yeah.

393
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,200
Alright, draw one for me.

394
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:01,161
Okay.

395
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:20,681
Your drawing looks pretty good.

396
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:21,561
Let's be friends.

397
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,601
I'll send my friends to you.

398
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:24,561
They'll be your customers.

399
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,921
You haven't seen my work yet.

400
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,601
I can tell you can draw just by looking at you.

401
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,840
How about we grab a meal together?

402
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,640
Huh?

403
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
How much can you make in a day here?

404
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:40,441
Tell me, I'll pay you.

405
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,281
Hey, let's add each other on WeChat.

406
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:43,761
You scan me, or I scan you.

407
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:46,681
Or you add me.

408
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:49,681
I need a thick-skinned friend anyway.

409
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:51,601
Don't say anything yet.

410
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,601
I'll just tell you, I'm her boyfriend.

411
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,281
Still not leaving?

412
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,641
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

413
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:04,881
Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,201
You can't help me with drawing.

415
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:10,441
Drawing.

416
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:12,401
He doesn't want you to draw for him.

417
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:13,201
Can't you tell?

418
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:14,761
I can tell.

419
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:16,121
But what can I do?

420
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:17,601
I'll help you.

421
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:19,441
I don't want your help.

422
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:20,441
I want to earn money myself.

423
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,400
Alright.

424
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,361
Then at least let me be your assistant.

425
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:28,241
How would you assist me?

426
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:35,281
Classmate

427
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:35,961
Mm-hmm.

428
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:37,081
Taking a photo?

429
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:40,001
Want a sketch portrait?

430
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:41,641
Take a look.

431
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,241
Let me tell you.

432
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,241
She's a real master today.

433
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,880
Here for inspiration.

434
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,521
Miss this chance, it's gone.

435
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:54,201
Really?

436
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,361
Then, draw one for me.

437
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:57,081
Have a seat.

438
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:37,441
Looks great.

439
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,081
Happy with it?

440
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:39,601
Here's your payment.

441
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:39,961
Thank you.

442
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:41,361
Take care.

443
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:41,681
Mm-hmm.

444
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:46,041
Hey.

445
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,161
Interested in a portrait sketch?

446
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,760
You guys are drawing for people?

447
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,281
Yeah, yeah! Get one drawn!

448
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:55,561
No, thanks.

449
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:56,321
Come on.

450
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:58,041
Look, you two.

451
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:00,441
Why is she so pretty?

452
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:02,961
She looks at her own portrait every day.

453
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,321
Over time, it rubs off.

454
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,281
You get prettier and prettier.

455
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:08,921
You two should get one drawn too.

456
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:10,161
Take it home and look at it daily.

457
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:11,641
You'll get prettier.

458
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,401
Are you saying we're not pretty now?

459
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:16,841
That's not what I mean.

460
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,880
Then draw one for us.

461
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:20,521
Sure, have a seat.

462
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,640
Come on.

463
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:40,961
Who are you drawing?

464
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:43,321
The one on the left.

465
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll draw the right.

466
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:09,521
Sorry for the wait.

467
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:16,321
Happy with it?

468
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:19,521
Can't say I'm unhappy.

469
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:22,481
It's really unique.

470
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,401
Then pay up quickly.

471
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,641
There's a line behind you.

472
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:27,841
Oh, okay.

473
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:28,961
Here, here.

474
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:29,481
Thanks.

475
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,041
Take care.

476
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:34,401
Please.

477
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:36,481
Come, have a seat.

478
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:40,761
You'll be next for a sketch.

479
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:41,441
Don't rush.

480
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:01,041
See?

481
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:03,001
I can help you earn money now.

482
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:05,121
Why are you laughing?

483
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:06,321
Keep it safe.

484
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,201
This is a master's work.

485
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,121
From now on,

486
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,241
Double the price.

487
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:33,361
Why am I so unlucky?

488
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:35,361
Can't see Jiang Anlan, but run into you.

489
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,241
Does this mean we're fated?

490
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:39,641
What are you doing here?

491
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:42,041
Guild Leader set me up with

492
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,641
an intern designer position.

493
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:44,561
I'm reporting in today.

494
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,041
Using connections.

495
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:51,281
What?

496
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,761
I mean,

497
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:54,481
Guild Leader's not here.

498
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:55,761
Give me the coffee.

499
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,040
Here, all yours.

500
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:58,401
Don't bother me anymore.

501
00:23:58,761 --> 00:23:59,361
Huh?

502
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,601
That's too high a price, I think.

503
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,241
Here.

504
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:03,361
Save your energy.

505
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:05,641
I'm not interested in guys like you.

506
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:07,041
What's wrong with guys like me?

507
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:09,321
No sense of responsibility.

508
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,281
No stability.

509
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:11,681
No opinions.

510
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:14,921
You're spot on.

511
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:15,881
Many of my classmates are like that.

512
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,441
Want to have lunch together?

513
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:21,801
What do you want to eat?

514
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:22,681
Anything's fine.

515
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:23,201
You decide.

516
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:24,241
See?

517
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,041
No opinions.

518
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,680
Why the sour face?

519
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:42,681
Smoke got to you?

520
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:44,281
Doesn't suit my taste.

521
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:47,041
You picked this place.

522
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:48,121
I paid for it.

523
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:49,401
And you say it's not to your taste.

524
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,321
So picky.

525
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,241
Did you reply to the message?

526
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,160
What message?

527
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,201
See, when I mention messages,

528
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:01,361
you play dumb.

529
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,521
Did you really reply?

530
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:03,801
Show me your phone.

531
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:06,121
Why should I show you my phone?

532
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:07,121
I worked hard

533
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,321
to get rid of that jerk for you.

534
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,400
And you still contact him.

535
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,641
Isn't that biting the hand that helps?

536
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:11,561
Yes.

537
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,641
I should thank you.

538
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,041
But whether I reply or not

539
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:14,921
is none of your business.

540
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,641
Even if I call him now,

541
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,641
it's still not your business.

542
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:19,921
Just show me.

543
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:26,841
Hurry, look for it.

544
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:30,401
Where did it go?

545
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:42,641
Wen Cheng

546
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,240
Out with the old, in with the new.

547
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:46,961
Just like relationships.

548
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,201
My phone

549
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:51,481
is all worn out now.

550
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:53,841
I'll get you a new one.

551
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,321
Mr. Liu

552
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,600
Jiang Anlan must be held up.

553
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:05,561
Otherwise,

554
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:06,561
let's eat first.

555
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:07,401
No need to wait for him.

556
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:08,441
No rush.

557
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,121
Let's wait a bit more.

558
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,321
You're finally back.

559
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,480
The food's gone cold.

560
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:18,441
Doesn't matter.

561
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:19,721
For Jiang Anlan,

562
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,721
I'd wait till night.

563
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:22,561
You're too polite, Uncle Liu.

564
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:24,961
Anlan

565
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,201
Let me introduce you.

566
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:27,441
This is my daughter, Liu Qiaoyi.

567
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:28,481
Everyone,

568
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:29,321
calls her Joyce.

569
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,040
Anlan,

570
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:39,801
Joyce just graduated from a US college.

571
00:26:39,841 --> 00:26:40,801
Uncle Liu also intends

572
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,601
for her to take over the Liu family business.

573
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:43,961
You two should get to know each other.

574
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,361
If you meet in business later,

575
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:46,601
it’s good to have someone to rely on.

576
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:48,201
Hello.

577
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,401
I’m Jiang Anlan.

578
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:50,681
I know who you are.

579
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,361
Now we’ve met.

580
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:53,881
Let’s enjoy this meal.

581
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,361
Come on, come on.

582
00:26:58,401 --> 00:26:59,481
Let’s all eat first.

583
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:00,201
We can chat while we eat.

584
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:01,761
Joyce doesn’t know me yet.

585
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,161
I’m Jiang Ancheng.

586
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,201
I’m in charge of the business department.

587
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,000
Let’s toast with tea instead of wine.

588
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:06,681
Let’s be friends.

589
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:14,521
Anlan,

590
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:15,481
if you have time,

591
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:16,641
show Joyce around.

592
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:17,641
You’re about the same age.

593
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,201
She just returned to China.

594
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:19,961
She doesn’t know

595
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:20,801
where the fun places are.

596
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,001
I’m busy with work.

597
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:26,761
I’m afraid

598
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:27,761
I don’t have much time.

599
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,161
I’ll head out first.

600
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:37,801
I thought it was something important.

601
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:38,481
I rushed back for this.

602
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,920
I have an important meeting at work.

603
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,401
I’ll have dinner with you tonight.

604
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:45,361
This kid

605
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:46,561
is such a workaholic.

606
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:48,201
Then go quickly, okay?

607
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,200
Everyone, let’s eat.

608
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:52,281
The food’s getting cold.

609
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,040
Yao Yuan,

610
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,960
come here.

611
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:58,841
Try the food here.

612
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,841
It’s these dishes

613
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:02,881
that impressed the investors.

614
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,121
Yao Yuan,

615
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:05,401
I’ll succeed this time.

616
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:06,321
When I do, I’ll pay you back

617
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,400
with interest, every cent.

618
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,201
Tastes great.

619
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:13,081
Yao Yuan,

620
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:15,761
that guy from last time,

621
00:28:15,801 --> 00:28:16,641
is he your boyfriend?

622
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:19,721
What’s up?

623
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:21,841
He was well dressed.

624
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:23,161
He must be doing well.

625
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:25,641
He’s okay.

626
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:26,921
He just

627
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,281
built his own company

628
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,921
through hard work.

629
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:32,001
Good.

630
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:33,441
It’s nothing.

631
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:34,321
I was just asking.

632
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:35,761
You’re so kind,

633
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,081
I worry you’ll be taken advantage of.

634
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:38,561
Uncle, don’t worry.

635
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,881
He treats me well.

636
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:42,881
Eat more, have some more.

637
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:44,801
Try the prawns.

638
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:46,041
Eat while it’s hot.

639
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:58,921
I’m leaving.

640
00:28:58,961 --> 00:28:59,601
Bye.

641
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,081
What are you doing?

642
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,041
I’ve never given anyone a phone before.

643
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,041
Aren’t you going to thank me?

644
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:07,081
You’re just replacing mine.

645
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,401
It’s not a gift from you.

646
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:09,641
If you hadn’t grabbed my phone,

647
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,761
would it have fallen in the pot?

648
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:11,681
If you hadn’t called him,

649
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:12,521
I wouldn’t have grabbed it.

650
00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:13,961
You really think I’d call him?

651
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:15,721
You wouldn’t.

652
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:18,041
In your eyes,

653
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:19,081
am I that naive?

654
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:21,161
Hmph.

655
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:26,281
Seriously,

656
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,521
don’t contact that guy anymore.

657
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:44,761
I’m leaving too.

658
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,401
You’re something else.

659
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:58,201
You made progress and didn’t tell us.

660
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:00,041
Did you say anything?

661
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:01,961
The whole world knows.

662
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,521
Wen Cheng.

663
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:13,321
You spent so much.

664
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,201
And got me a new phone.

665
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:16,241
It’s so expensive.

666
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,281
And so hard to use.

667
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:19,961
How do I even use this?

668
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:23,681
If you don’t like it, give it to me.

669
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,361
No way.

670
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:24,921
Give it back.

671
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:26,521
He gave this to me.

672
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,001
I’m heading up.

673
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:29,681
Mm.

674
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:42,601
As long as I want to spoil you,

675
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,281
I’ll spoil you, spoil you.

676
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:54,801
Aren’t you supposed to be in a meeting?

677
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:55,961
Why are you all staring at me?

678
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:57,641
Did I come to the wrong place?

679
00:30:58,521 --> 00:30:59,681
Mr. Su.

680
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:00,561
Sorry about this.

681
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,761
We might have missed contacting you.

682
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:04,161
We didn’t inform you.

683
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,081
Oh.

684
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:06,961
The time’s been changed.

685
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:08,481
Mr. Su.

686
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:10,401
We received instructions from above

687
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,241
that a new photographer

688
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:13,361
will be replacing you.

689
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:16,561
Who switches people at this time?

690
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:19,721
You’re not respecting me.

691
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:21,241
We’re really sorry.

692
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,401
The notice was sudden.

693
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:23,321
Sorry.

694
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,401
What kind of company does things this way?

695
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:26,681
I’ll tell my boss right away.

696
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,401
I won’t work with you again.

697
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:29,321
Mr. Su,

698
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:33,241
I’m really confident in this proposal.

699
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:34,321
You all put in a lot of effort.

700
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:35,161
So,

701
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,481
I hope we can move forward smoothly soon.

702
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:39,881
So, Miss, is there anything about our project

703
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,561
that you're still not satisfied with?

704
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:42,721
We can keep making changes if needed.

705
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:43,921
It's already very good.

706
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:45,921
Is there anything else you think needs work?

707
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:47,401
Thank you all so much.

708
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,641
No problem. We should be thanking you.

709
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,201
Why are you here?

710
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:56,681
I'm here to present my proposal.

711
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,041
Why are you here?

712
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:01,721
You're the new photographer?

713
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:06,001
So you were the original photographer.

714
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:09,601
I honestly didn't know.

715
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:11,081
If I'd known this was your project,

716
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:12,201
I wouldn't have taken it.

717
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:13,281
Stop pretending you don't know.

718
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:17,121
What are you doing?

719
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:18,161
What are you doing?

720
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:19,121
Let go.

721
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,081
You're still the same as ever.

722
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:24,961
Now that you're back,

723
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,721
what do you want from me this time?

724
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:29,241
If I said I came back for you,

725
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,121
would you believe me?

726
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:33,761
I truly didn't know this was your project.

727
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:36,001
You really haven't changed.

728
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,601
You do things

729
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,441
and act like nothing happened.

730
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:40,481
Like nothing ever happened.

731
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,361
Is messing with people fun for you?

732
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:46,361
You really don't trust me at all.

733
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:48,921
Fine.

734
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,281
I'll drop the project right now.

735
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:53,641
You made a promise.

736
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:54,961
Can you just break it so easily?

737
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:57,161
Compared to you,

738
00:32:57,201 --> 00:32:58,601
this project means nothing.

739
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:03,361
Fine.

740
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,521
Let's say I misunderstood.

741
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,121
I don't care either.

742
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:10,801
Su.

743
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:14,201
I was wrong about the past.

744
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:15,761
This time, I'm back.

745
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:16,881
I won't leave you again.

746
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,841
I can give up my career for you.

747
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:22,481
I want to be with you again.

748
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:52,401
Why did you come?

749
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,641
I missed you, that's all.

750
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:55,001
If you missed me, just call.

751
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,641
The students are here. Sit down quickly.

752
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,241
You can't do this over the phone.

753
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:02,281
Go sit down now.

754
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:09,961
Where's Su Wen?

755
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Why isn't he bothering you?

756
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:12,921
He didn't come today.

757
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:13,481
He said

758
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:14,121
the door broke

759
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:15,441
and he locked himself inside.

760
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,840
He actually made up that excuse.

761
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:18,921
He's probably out having fun.

762
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:20,921
I called him, but he didn't answer.

763
00:34:21,841 --> 00:34:23,801
He's been acting weird lately.

764
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,001
Just stop calling him.

765
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:28,801
If you keep this up,

766
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:30,521
he'll come up with more excuses to bother you.

767
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,880
He won't bother me anymore.

768
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,281
I've made things clear to him.

769
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,601
We're just friends.

770
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:40,761
You really told him?

771
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:43,161
I wasn't going to tell you.

772
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:43,921
Didn't want you to gloat.

773
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:45,601
Of course I have to gloat!

774
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:47,681
You clearly rejected him.

775
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,600
Isn't that like claiming me for yourself?

776
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,041
No one can separate us.

777
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:14,441
Madam.

778
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:15,481
Please enjoy.

779
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:31,241
What's wrong?

780
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:34,361
Ah!

781
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:37,081
Spicy!

782
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,480
Sorry, I didn't know it was spicy.

783
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,801
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

784
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,121
Eat this instead.

785
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:50,721
No.

786
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,041
Are you free this weekend?

787
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,200
There's a new romance movie out.

788
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,160
I want to watch it with you.

789
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:15,641
Or do you want to see a horror movie?

790
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,161
You used to get scared and hide in my arms.

791
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:21,801
I wasn't really scared.

792
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,001
I was just pretending before.

793
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:40,321
Are you crazy?

794
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:41,481
What's there to hesitate about?

795
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:43,001
Hurry up and hang up!

796
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,760
Don't use the phone I gave you to answer him.

797
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:46,801
Quick!

798
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:48,161
Reject him now!

799
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:49,001
Right away!

800
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:49,841
Immediately!

801
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:55,041
Why is Wen Cheng everywhere?

802
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:58,241
Oh no.

803
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:04,801
Do you think I'm sick lately?

804
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:07,201
I keep hearing Wen Cheng's voice.

805
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:09,441
That means

806
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:11,081
Wen Cheng is in your heart.

807
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:12,441
Everywhere.

808
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,401
No way.

809
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:15,481
My heart's too busy for that.

810
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:16,641
Why would I think of him?

811
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:29,801
Let's grab a meal together.

812
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:30,881
Come on.

813
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:33,121
Let's go.

814
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:55,001
Her symptoms like this,

815
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:57,641
I've seen them recently too.

816
00:37:57,681 --> 00:37:58,601
Wen Cheng is often like this as well.

817
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,201
They probably have the same cause.

818
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,721
What are you two up to?

819
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:06,881
Am I invisible to you?

820
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,681
Sis, what's going on with you lately?

821
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,640
I don't have much appetite.

822
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:12,681
Are you feeling down?

823
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:15,241
How could I be in a bad mood?

824
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,361
Zhuang Wei can't affect my mood.

825
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:22,641
Why those faces?

826
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:24,081
It's over between me and him.

827
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,761
No need to announce it to us.

828
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:26,961
Go tell Wen Cheng.

829
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,401
Why should I tell him?

830
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:29,681
Because he really cares.

831
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:30,801
You know what?

832
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,641
He drags me and Li Ao every day

833
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:33,481
just to say

834
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,161
"Rekindling an old flame is foolish."

835
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:36,441
He's driving us crazy.

836
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:39,281
Sis,

837
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,641
please don't go back to him.

838
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,081
Didn't Xiao Ya rekindle an old flame before?

839
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,521
Within a month,

840
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,321
she took everything and left.

841
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:48,361
Before leaving,

842
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:49,721
she even took the toothpaste.

843
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,521
Said it was bought by herself.

844
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:52,841
Mm.

845
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:54,201
Wen Cheng went through that too.

846
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:56,081
That woman even said

847
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:57,881
"The next one will be better."

848
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:00,001
You're not just treating me to dinner,

849
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,161
you're here to talk me through this.

850
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:03,841
We're concerned about you.

851
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,920
I'm caring for you on Wen Cheng's behalf.

852
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:08,481
People, you know,

853
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:09,721
don't change easily.

854
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,721
If you try again,

855
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:13,201
it might end up the same.

856
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:20,721
Eat.

857
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:35,561
You still haven't found a place?

858
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:37,521
Not yet.

859
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:40,001
I want to borrow your studio for a bit.

860
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,160
I'll pay rent.

861
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:42,841
Please don't say no.

862
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:53,961
I turned down that project.

863
00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:55,201
For you.

864
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:00,001
Don't drag me into your own issues, okay?

865
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:01,761
What,

866
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:03,641
trying to make me feel I owe you?

867
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:07,161
I really did it for you.

868
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:08,841
They replaced you.

869
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:10,441
Of course I'll stand with you.

870
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:11,681
Let them run into trouble.

871
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:24,321
Su,

872
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:26,761
you have to trust me.

873
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:29,481
You're the one I want.

874
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:31,041
Everything else

875
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:31,801
I don't care about.

876
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,281
I have some work at the company.

877
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:50,921
I'll head back first.

878
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:53,561
Call me when you get home.

879
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:54,561
Mm.

880
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:00,121
Bye.

881
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:01,241
Bye.

882
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,041
I forgot my keys.

883
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:11,761
How long have you been standing here?

884
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:12,841
Five minutes.

885
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:15,081
Oh no.

886
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:37,161
Calling each other so sweetly,

887
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:38,481
but it still won't last.

888
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:40,321
In this world,

889
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,481
nothing really lasts forever.

890
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,961
What are you talking about?

891
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,001
Spam messages.

892
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:52,881
Wen Cheng called you.

893
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:58,161
Then call him back.

894
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,320
Tell him

895
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:00,521
thanks for the phone.

896
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,321
How do I use it?

897
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:04,241
That's a pretty weak excuse.

898
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:07,521
You don't need a reason to care.

899
00:42:09,121 --> 00:42:10,521
Who's caring about him?

900
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:15,641
Xiao Ya said

901
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:17,321
there's an online quest today.

902
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:18,281
The rewards are great.

903
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:19,241
Let's give it a try.

904
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,640
But that online event needs four people.

905
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:24,161
We only have three, what do we do?

906
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:26,641
So let's ask Tianxia Bang for help.

907
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:28,361
Sounds good.

908
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,601
Let's go complete the quest first.

909
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,881
I've been wanting that Riyue Bow.
