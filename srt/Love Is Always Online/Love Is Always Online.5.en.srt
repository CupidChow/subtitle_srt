1
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,041
All right.

2
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:45,321
Are you sure she's going to a birthday party

3
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,481
and not performing Peking opera?

4
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,521
Oh my, going out like this is scary!

5
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:56,161
I’ll never believe it again

6
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,721
when you say you do your own makeup well.

7
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:58,441
Not after this.

8
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:01,281
Sis, can you fix it for me?

9
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:03,321
Let me do your makeup.

10
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,761
Hand me that, quick!

11
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,721
Can this even be fixed?

12
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,561
Trust me.

13
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,921
A room full of strangers

14
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,001
already makes me uneasy.

15
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:37,961
Will I

16
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,201
not fit in there?

17
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:41,921
Maybe I shouldn’t go.

18
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:43,561
No way.

19
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:44,561
You gave me shoes,

20
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:45,401
and a dress too.

21
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:46,161
How could I not go?

22
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:48,001
If you tell Jiang Anlan

23
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,801
you’re not suited for this event,

24
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:51,401
he’d probably understand.

25
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:54,201
But I don’t want him to understand.

26
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:56,281
I don’t want him to think

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,480
we’re from different worlds.

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Why are you laughing?

29
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,000
I feel like

30
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,201
I’m witnessing love happen.

31
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:16,881
Do you like it?

32
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,601
We all got this for you.

33
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:21,841
Let me put it on for you.

34
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:36,561
It looks beautiful.

35
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,081
Now, whether it’s the richest heiress

36
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,761
or Jiang Anlan’s ex-girlfriend,

37
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,361
none can rival our Yao Yuan.

38
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,881
How do you know he has an ex?

39
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,521
Someone that outstanding

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,041
must have had an ex-girlfriend.

41
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,481
Rich people’s circles are so small,

42
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,921
maybe his ex will actually show up.

43
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,721
She’s called an ex for a reason.

44
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:56,801
They’ve already broken up.

45
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:00,761
Don’t be upset.

46
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,241
Let’s go enjoy our date.

47
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:26,801
Sister-in-law.

48
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
The boss had something come up.

49
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,281
He asked me to pick you up first.

50
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:29,961
He’ll be here soon.

51
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:40,681
The boss instructed me

52
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,881
to get you first.

53
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,681
And report to him first.

54
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:00,761
He really didn’t mean it.

55
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,721
He’s waited for this day so long.

56
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:04,721
He picked out your dress days ago.

57
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:06,641
There’s a real client this time.

58
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,481
The company’s huge,

59
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,281
so many people.

60
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,321
If anything goes wrong,

61
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,361
we’ll all be out in the cold.

62
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,241
It’s okay.

63
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,721
He’s so busy but still wants to be with me.

64
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,761
I should be the one embarrassed.

65
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:21,601
It’s fine.

66
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,041
The boss is happiest with you.

67
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:23,881
He’s truly happy.

68
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:25,281
Lately,

69
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:26,561
he’s become more open-minded,

70
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:27,401
and his temper’s improved.

71
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,361
Everyone at our company

72
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:30,281
owes you thanks.

73
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,241
Don’t tell him that.

74
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,561
Li Ao didn’t say anything weird, right?

75
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,161
No.

76
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,881
I’m the one talking bad about you.

77
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,321
What’s wrong?

78
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,241
Your voice sounds a bit hoarse.

79
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:03,921
It’s nothing.

80
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:05,241
I’ll be there a bit late.

81
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,361
Wait for me.

82
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:56,641
Welcome.

83
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:02,721
Sister-in-law.

84
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,401
I need to go pick up the boss first.

85
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:05,401
Once he’s awake,

86
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:06,601
I’ll bring him over.

87
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,081
Okay.

88
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,001
This—

89
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:13,801
The boss asked me to give this to you.

90
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:17,321
What is it?

91
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,801
A wise plan.

92
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:20,161
I’ll head out now.

93
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,801
Before you go in,

94
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,241
take a deep breath.

95
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,161
I’m a little worried

96
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,481
all eyes

97
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:56,841
will be drawn to you.

98
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,721
What about the other girls?

99
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:03,681
You’re the most beautiful.

100
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,801
Not just in my eyes,

101
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,081
but in everyone’s eyes.

102
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,601
So before I arrive,

103
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,561
absolutely no drinking.

104
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:16,441
Miss, would you like a drink?

105
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:20,361
Thank you.

106
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:20,801
It’s fine.

107
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,921
Don’t make eye contact with guys.

108
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,481
If someone tries to chat you up,

109
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,081
just tell them

110
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:28,321
you’re waiting for

111
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:29,721
Jiang Anlan.

112
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,121
If anything upsets you,

113
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,441
be brave.

114
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:35,561
I’ll be there soon.

115
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,360
Hey, miss.

116
00:08:58,721 --> 00:08:59,521
You came alone?

117
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,320
Who invited you?

118
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,441
Why haven’t I seen you before?

119
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,761
Fang Jianing invited me.

120
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:05,681
So you’re Jiajia’s friend.

121
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:06,481
How about

122
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:07,761
coming over for a drink?

123
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,041
I’ll introduce you to my friends.

124
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:11,361
I’m waiting for Jiang Anlan.

125
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,120
Sorry.

126
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:35,561
Sister Yao.

127
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:37,721
Where’s Brother Anlan?

128
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:41,521
He’s held up with something.

129
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,600
Let me introduce you to my friends first.

130
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:44,961
Otherwise, you’ll be bored waiting.

131
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,201
Come, let me introduce you.

132
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:53,681
This is Yao Yuan.

133
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,041
Jiang Anlan's girlfriend.

134
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,321
So you're Jiang Anlan's girlfriend.

135
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,881
How did you meet Jiang Anlan?

136
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:02,641
Work partners.

137
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:03,921
No.

138
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,281
We met through gaming.

139
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:06,921
Gaming?

140
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:09,161
Is it the kind where you lose a game

141
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:10,361
and have to chat up someone?

142
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:11,681
So that's why Jiang Anlan picked you?

143
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:13,281
No, that's not it.

144
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,681
We met while playing Sheng Shi online.

145
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,401
Online game.

146
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,121
Jiang Anlan

147
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,281
plays that too?

148
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:23,241
Anlan is really good at it.

149
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,760
He's a golden boy.

150
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,681
You must be a water fairy in the game.

151
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:29,601
But meeting in a game

152
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,361
and dating in real life too?

153
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,281
I don't know anyone like that.

154
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:34,761
You're really lucky.

155
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:38,521
Your necklace—

156
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,520
What brand is it?

157
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:42,521
A friend gave it to me.

158
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,480
I'm not sure.

159
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,161
Did Jiang Anlan give it to you?

160
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:48,161
Anlan wouldn't give something so cheap.

161
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,401
This necklace—

162
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,841
My sister and my friend gave it to me.

163
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:03,361
I really like it.

164
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,161
The price doesn't matter much.

165
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:06,561
Listen,

166
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:08,201
when you're with Jiang Anlan,

167
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,681
price really doesn't matter.

168
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,201
That's not what I meant.

169
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:13,921
Hey, what are you doing?

170
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,481
Sister Yao,

171
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:16,481
they're just joking.

172
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,081
That's nice.

173
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,241
To have such good friends and sisters.

174
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,801
Willing to spend money for you.

175
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:32,721
Why hasn't your fever gone down?

176
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,401
You've been so tired lately.

177
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:46,401
Take your medicine.

178
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,201
You shouldn't go.

179
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:09,281
I can pick up Yao Yuan instead.

180
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:11,241
I promised her.

181
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:16,961
I have to—

182
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:18,161
be there with her?

183
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,001
Isn't it the same at home?

184
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,121
I need her to know

185
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,441
we're not that far apart.

186
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,520
Can you really handle it?

187
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:36,961
I'll give you just half an hour.

188
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,041
After that,

189
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:39,001
you must go to the hospital.

190
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,401
Hello?

191
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:49,561
Hello?

192
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,761
Sis, how are you doing now?

193
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:53,841
I'm fine.

194
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:55,201
Just now,

195
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,241
Fang Jianing introduced me to her friends.

196
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:58,241
We chatted for a bit.

197
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:00,281
That's good.

198
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:03,881
So you were worried too?

199
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:05,321
Didn't you look

200
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:07,001
like you didn't care at all?

201
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:09,881
Who'd worry about you?

202
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,721
Everyone loves you.

203
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,521
Plus, the golden boy is with you.

204
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,960
Why would I worry?

205
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:19,801
What's wrong?

206
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,281
Is the golden boy busy chatting

207
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:22,721
and ignoring you?

208
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:24,041
Oh.

209
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,440
He hasn't arrived yet.

210
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,081
What?

211
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,401
He left you there alone?

212
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:30,841
He must've been held up.

213
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,721
He'll be here soon.

214
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:33,281
Still,

215
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:35,081
he shouldn't leave you alone there.

216
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:35,921
Who knows in that crowd

217
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,481
if there are all kinds of monsters.

218
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,840
You think it's Sheng Shi?

219
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,201
With monsters and all?

220
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,160
But—

221
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:44,761
It's fine, really.

222
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,081
They're all nice to me.

223
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,001
I'll be back soon.

224
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:51,521
Alright.

225
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:52,761
If anything happens,

226
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,321
let me know, okay?

227
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:54,961
Okay.

228
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:14,481
Do you think Jiang Anlan has a weakness

229
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,481
in that girl's hands?

230
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,121
Otherwise,

231
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,081
why would he choose a girl like her?

232
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,601
They're not a good match.

233
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,361
And that necklace—

234
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:25,161
Do you remember it?

235
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:26,121
I remember.

236
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,321
It's hilarious.

237
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:31,001
My sister and my friend gave it together.

238
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,801
They even teamed up for that cheap thing.

239
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,441
I held back from asking her.

240
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:36,361
Does her family

241
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:38,121
even split boxed meals?

242
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:40,841
How could Jiang Anlan

243
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,241
have such poor taste?

244
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,801
If you run into trouble,

245
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:47,361
be brave.

246
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,121
I'll be there soon.

247
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,401
First,

248
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,001
let me answer the question

249
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,481
you've been holding back.

250
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:12,721
In my family,

251
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,321
we don't eat boxed meals.

252
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,441
We all cook ourselves.

253
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,561
Outside food is expensive and not tasty.

254
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,721
I know exactly what I like.

255
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:28,801
This necklace—

256
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,201
I don't know its price.

257
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,001
But to me,

258
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,441
the thought matters more than the price.

259
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,801
Maybe your necklace

260
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,481
costs tens of thousands from your friends.

261
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,721
That's nothing to them.

262
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,161
But my necklace

263
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:51,841
is from my sister

264
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,481
and my friend.

265
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:57,401
Even if they go hungry,

266
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,361
they still wanted to give it to me.

267
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,881
To me, it's worth more than anything.

268
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:12,761
As for poor taste—

269
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,281
you can ask Jiang Anlan yourself

270
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:17,841
when he arrives.

271
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,761
Wait for him.

272
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,481
Where is he?

273
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:24,881
You've been here so long,

274
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,681
have you seen him yet?

275
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:29,361
If he really cared,

276
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,361
would he leave you here alone?

277
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:34,681
Anyone can see

278
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:35,961
you don't belong here.

279
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:37,841
He just wants you

280
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,241
to face reality.

281
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,361
A place that judges people
by their looks

282
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,161
and their background

283
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,521
is not somewhere
I want to stay long

284
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,201
I don't want to stay there either

285
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:00,721
What a joke

286
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,561
You act like you're above it all

287
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,561
If you really don't care

288
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,601
why didn't you come in
wearing jeans and a T-shirt?

289
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,921
Why pretend to be
a rich girl?

290
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:12,801
I just think

291
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,361
it's basic manners

292
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,521
Enough, let's drop it

293
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,881
Since you're not happy here

294
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,161
I'll walk you out
on behalf of the birthday girl

295
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:28,561
Sorry

296
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,201
I didn't mean it

297
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,161
But looking at your dress

298
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,241
it seems like it's your only one

299
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,681
Now you can have it your way

300
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:38,481
Wear jeans next time

301
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:39,881
to birthday parties

302
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:10,921
Yao Yuan

303
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:12,441
I'm sorry

304
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,081
My friend is a bit blunt

305
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,401
She often hurts people
without realizing

306
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:29,361
I'm fine

307
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:31,521
Yao Yuan

308
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,681
They didn't mean it

309
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:37,841
After all, around Jiang Anlan

310
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,441
there are plenty of privileged people

311
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:41,921
Suddenly seeing his girlfriend

312
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,281
isn't what they imagined

313
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,560
It's natural to feel jealous

314
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:49,961
But if you think about it

315
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,121
what they said isn't wrong

316
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:56,041
You and Jiang Anlan
have such different backgrounds

317
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:57,881
Getting along

318
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:59,681
will bring some friction over time

319
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,801
Are you together
just for the novelty?

320
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:04,601
Is that why you're dating?

321
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,280
Of course

322
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,561
I hope you two end up well

323
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
Just like in the movies

324
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,361
A Cinderella story

325
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,040
Oh my god

326
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,041
That's so romantic

327
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:19,481
I'm rooting for you

328
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:22,881
Alright

329
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:25,001
It's almost time
to cut the cake

330
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:26,441
Let's go

331
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,361
Don't worry about your dress

332
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:29,961
Stand next to me

333
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:30,561
No one will say anything

334
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:31,961
Come on

335
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:55,601
Boss

336
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,361
How are you?

337
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,241
Are you alright?

338
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:16,081
President Jiang

339
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:17,041
Hello, President Jiang

340
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:18,361
President Jiang

341
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:22,481
Jiang Anlan, you're finally here

342
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,521
We're just about to cut the cake

343
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:25,441
Where's Yao Yuan?

344
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,401
Has anyone seen Yao Yuan?

345
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:32,081
She

346
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,641
She spilled her drink herself

347
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,761
and got all messy

348
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:37,161
She felt embarrassed

349
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,121
so she left early

350
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,041
You'd better be telling the truth

351
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,840
It's true

352
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:47,441
She really did spill her drink

353
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,881
I told her it was fine

354
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,081
No one would care

355
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,640
But she just left on her own

356
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,081
Why did President Jiang leave?

357
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,481
Boss, your face is so red

358
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,001
Are you running a fever again?

359
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:22,241
I'm fine

360
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:25,281
Help me look for her along the way

361
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,281
She shouldn't be far

362
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:27,241
Okay

363
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,121
Stop the car

364
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,121
Stop

365
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:02,401
Yao Yuan

366
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:24,201
Who bullied you? Tell me

367
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:27,961
No one

368
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,441
I just feel

369
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,441
maybe I don't fit in there

370
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:34,121
so I wanted to get some air

371
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:35,801
Don't be like this

372
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,321
Just tell me
if something happened

373
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,760
I...

374
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:45,001
I think maybe there

375
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,161
I don't belong

376
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,001
When I look at that place

377
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,081
I keep thinking of my past

378
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:02,681
No matter what happened before

379
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,481
I promise it won't happen again

380
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,201
How can you promise that?

381
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,961
Are you going to tell everyone

382
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,000
"I'm Jiang Anlan's girlfriend"

383
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:21,601
so I get special treatment

384
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,521
and no one can bully me?

385
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,361
Let's just be together

386
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:27,361
Who cares about them?

387
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,961
Maybe they're right

388
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:37,041
You're so outstanding

389
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:39,761
Am I good enough for you?

390
00:24:44,321 --> 00:24:45,001
You are

391
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,441
No one but you
deserves to stand with me

392
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,321
You may not care
what others say

393
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,401
because they can't affect you

394
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:00,801
but they can affect me

395
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,521
When I look at you

396
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,801
I'll just feel
we're worlds apart

397
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:09,601
The gap between us is so big

398
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:19,201
I want to ask you something

399
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,121
Why do you like me?

400
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,681
I just do

401
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,440
Why so many questions?

402
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,521
Sorry

403
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:37,681
I need some time alone

404
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:26,561
How are you?

405
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:27,561
Are you okay?

406
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:28,401
I'll take you to the hospital

407
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,361
Find someone to follow Yao Yuan

408
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:34,801
until she's home safe

409
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,481
Okay, got it

410
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:53,641
We're from different worlds after all

411
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:23,601
Maybe they're right

412
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:26,321
You're so outstanding

413
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,001
Am I good enough for you?

414
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:00,441
Sis, I'm back

415
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:01,481
How was it?

416
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:02,521
Did you have fun?

417
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,721
It was nice

418
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:06,121
Why did you come back so early?

419
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,601
I'm just a bit tired

420
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:10,441
What's wrong?

421
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,281
Hey, what's up with you?

422
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,401
Sis, I'll go change first

423
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:23,201
Sis

424
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:24,521
If something's wrong,
talk to me

425
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:25,401
Did you hear me?

426
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:51,681
Sis

427
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:52,921
Are you okay?

428
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:55,121
If anyone bullies you,

429
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:55,801
just tell me.

430
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:56,881
I'll help you deal with them.

431
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:00,961
I'm fine.

432
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,641
I'm heading to the studio.

433
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:06,281
Why go to the studio so late?

434
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:37,321
Madam

435
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:39,641
I still made it here.

436
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:43,481
Aren't you glad

437
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:45,201
to have a husband like me?

438
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:47,961
I'm really curious

439
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:49,561
how you have the nerve

440
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:50,801
to say that yourself.

441
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:52,081
Who else would say it?

442
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,001
Ruo Wei Jun Gu

443
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:56,001
You're my wife now.

444
00:31:37,281 --> 00:31:37,801
Bro,

445
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:40,681
your dishes today,

446
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,161
they're really delicious.

447
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:43,001
Yeah.

448
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:44,521
I really like them too.

449
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:45,121
Really?

450
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:46,001
Big bro, sis-in-law,

451
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,161
as long as you like them.

452
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:49,601
Big bro,

453
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:52,641
Sis, I really love your family's food.

454
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:53,521
It's so tasty.

455
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:54,961
Glad you like it.

456
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:56,281
Hey, didn't you say last week

457
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:57,481
you really liked a bag?

458
00:31:57,961 --> 00:31:59,161
I saw it in France.

459
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:00,401
So I quickly got one for you.

460
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:01,601
You got it for me?

461
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:02,441
You're giving it to me?

462
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:04,121
Of course, it's for you.

463
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:05,201
No, it's too expensive.

464
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:05,601
I can't accept it.

465
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:06,601
Don't worry about the price.

466
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:07,921
Your birthday's next week,

467
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,481
right?

468
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:09,841
Let this be your birthday gift.

469
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:10,481
Okay?

470
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:11,321
As long as you like it.

471
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:12,681
Next time, if you want anything else,

472
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,001
just tell me, okay?

473
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:14,841
Sis, you're so nice.

474
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:21,361
Hey.

475
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:22,321
Here you are.

476
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:26,161
What's up?

477
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:27,801
Bro,

478
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:29,921
it's been a while.

479
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:33,001
Just came to see you.

480
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:34,681
Yao Yuan,

481
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:36,521
let's skip the small talk.

482
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:39,161
I know you're having money troubles.

483
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,761
I can't really help you.

484
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:41,441
Dad,

485
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:44,081
dinner's ready.

486
00:32:58,281 --> 00:32:59,321
We're brothers,

487
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:00,881
so take this money.

488
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:02,401
Just use it for now.

489
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:03,881
As for the rest,

490
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:06,001
I can't do much else.

491
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:19,640
Doctor,

492
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:20,201
Doctor,

493
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:22,961
Has Jiang Anlan's fever gone down?

494
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:25,241
He's been having recurring fevers.

495
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:26,281
This morning,

496
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,321
it finally broke.

497
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:30,401
Ah.

498
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:31,921
When can he be discharged?

499
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:32,841
Miss Fang,

500
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:34,681
let the doctor handle this.

501
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,401
It's all my fault.

502
00:34:41,761 --> 00:34:42,721
I kept asking Jiang Anlan

503
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:43,801
to come to my birthday party.

504
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:45,961
And dragged Yao Yuan along.

505
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:47,841
Made him tired and stressed.

506
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:48,641
It's fine.

507
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:49,561
Lately,

508
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:50,441
the company has a lot going on.

509
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:52,081
He already had a cold.

510
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:53,041
I

511
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:54,001
didn't remind him to rest more.

512
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,560
You

513
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:55,521
should head home first.

514
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,161
Li Ao,

515
00:34:58,321 --> 00:34:59,681
it's been days now,

516
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:01,161
why hasn't Yao Yuan

517
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,441
come to take care of Jiang Anlan?

518
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,601
Isn't she his girlfriend?

519
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:07,721
They had a fight.

520
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:10,121
Is it because of me?

521
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:13,041
Oh, that can't be.

522
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:13,801
When Jiang Anlan wakes up,

523
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,081
he'll get mad at me again.

524
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,280
Should I call Jiang Anlan's family?

525
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:18,801
Don't.

526
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,881
The boss said

527
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:20,761
his matters

528
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:21,641
shouldn't be shared.

529
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,281
At home,

530
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,241
I'll handle it.

531
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:23,921
You

532
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:25,241
should go home first.

533
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:40,521
How many to buy?

534
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:41,401
Boss, one.

535
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:42,921
Two.

536
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,681
I don't have hands.

537
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,200
I do have hands.

538
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,000
I can hold it.

539
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:47,881
Alright, alright.

540
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:48,641
I'll decide for you.

541
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:49,441
Just one.

542
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:49,961
Couples

543
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:50,641
always share one.

544
00:35:58,001 --> 00:35:58,601
So sweet.

545
00:35:59,001 --> 00:35:59,601
Let me have a bite.

546
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:03,881
Tasty, right?

547
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:04,521
Delicious.

548
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:18,041
Which one do you want?

549
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:19,721
This one, strawberry's good.

550
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:39,641
Oh.

551
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:41,361
Why are you cooking today?

552
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:43,801
Just keeping busy.

553
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:47,441
It's definitely not that simple.

554
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:48,961
What's really going on?

555
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,001
The big shot didn't contact you?

556
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,361
I don't care if he did or not.

557
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:00,001
Your face already

558
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,481
gave everything away.

559
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:02,601
How long has it been since he called?

560
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:08,401
Three days, I think.

561
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:11,401
You remember it so clearly.

562
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:12,841
And you say you don't care.

563
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:15,641
Did you two have a fight?

564
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:18,681
If you did argue,

565
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,840
you need to talk more.

566
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:20,881
Don't just leave it hanging.

567
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,441
Feelings fade if you ignore them.

568
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:26,521
We didn't fight.

569
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:28,841
I'm not mad at him.

570
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:32,121
Relationships are hard to explain.

571
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:33,921
What's so hard to explain?

572
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:34,641
Come on.

573
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:35,641
Tell me about it.

574
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:37,041
I'll stand up for you.

575
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:43,441
Was it at the birthday party

576
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:44,401
that someone bullied you?

577
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:46,201
It's nothing.

578
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:46,961
Just tell me.

579
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:48,081
I'll go settle it for you.

580
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:49,361
Sis,

581
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:51,401
I'm really fine.

582
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:53,201
You say you're fine,

583
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:56,401
but look at the fish in your hand.

584
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:01,161
Poor little fish.

585
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:08,161
Yao Yuan.

586
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:09,841
Yao Yuan.

587
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:11,201
Yao Yuan.

588
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:12,001
Yao Yuan.

589
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:14,441
Anlan.

590
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,600
You're finally awake.

591
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:20,561
How long was I asleep?

592
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,121
Almost three days.

593
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:23,121
Have some water.

594
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:26,241
Where's Yao Yuan?

595
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:27,401
I asked Zhang He.

596
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:28,641
He said

597
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:30,041
she's just a bit troubled,

598
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:30,641
but everything else is fine.

599
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:32,801
I visited Baihua Tang in the game.

600
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:34,681
Only Water Fairy was there.

601
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,960
She said

602
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,521
Yao Yuan's been busy painting lately.

603
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,960
She hasn't had time for Sheng Shi.

604
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:40,801
Where's my phone?

605
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:41,801
My phone, give it to me.

606
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:42,921
Phone.

607
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:43,961
Hurry, hurry.

608
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,361
Is she still mad at me?

609
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:56,521
Doctor.

610
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,201
Hey, doctor.

611
00:38:58,281 --> 00:38:59,041
I want to be discharged.

612
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:00,721
You're all better now.

613
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:01,561
So I

614
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:02,561
can't keep you here anymore.

615
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:04,001
Anything else I should watch out for?

616
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:05,841
Just the usual advice.

617
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:07,281
Get plenty of rest.

618
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:08,121
Don't overwork yourself.

619
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:08,601
Okay.

620
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:10,961
Your immune system is fine,

621
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:12,441
but with your condition,

622
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:13,521
if you catch a cold,

623
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,160
others just take some medicine

624
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,201
and rest for two days to recover.

625
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:17,961
If you're not careful,

626
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:19,121
it could be life-threatening.

627
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:21,161
This time,

628
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:23,201
luckily, no pneumonia developed.

629
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:24,401
Otherwise,

630
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:26,321
I couldn't face your father.

631
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:28,001
Thank you, I understand.

632
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:29,041
Doctor,

633
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:30,721
thank you for taking care of me.

634
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:31,521
In the future,

635
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:32,521
I might trouble you again.

636
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:35,361
What am I saying?

637
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:36,241
Hopefully,

638
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:37,361
there won't be a next time.

639
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,201
I won't bother you again.

640
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:42,281
He can't sit still for a moment.

641
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:43,641
Last night during rounds,

642
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:44,641
in his sleep,

643
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:45,921
he kept calling out,

644
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:47,041
"Yao Yuan,

645
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:48,241
don't move away."

646
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,241
Our nurse

647
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:52,161
was so envious.

648
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:54,561
No idea which girl

649
00:39:54,841 --> 00:39:55,841
could make Mr. Jiang

650
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,161
miss her so much

651
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,161
even when he's sick.

652
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:02,681
Hurry and get your boss discharged.

653
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:03,761
I'll go handle the discharge.

654
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:05,041
Right, right.

655
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:09,881
Anlan,

656
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:10,881
it's windy outside.

657
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:11,841
Wait here.

658
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:12,521
I'll bring the car around.

659
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:37,161
Xiao Yuan,

660
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:38,921
the call from the big boss.

661
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:41,241
Don't answer, don't answer.

662
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,081
Okay, okay.

663
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:44,921
Hello?

664
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:50,281
Is this Yao Yuan?

665
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,560
This is Yao Xinran.

666
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:54,161
Is Yao Yuan there?

667
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:55,321
She's busy right now.

668
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,001
Right now,

669
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,681
she's mixing up sugar and salt

670
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,960
and putting it in the fish bone soup.

671
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:01,961
Looks like

672
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:03,561
tonight we'll be drinking

673
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:04,801
sweet and sour fish bone soup.

674
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:07,921
Didn't I tell you not to answer?

675
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:09,721
It interrupted my TV show.

676
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,041
But if you answer, how can I talk?

677
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:12,161
Just tell the truth.

678
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:13,041
Tell him

679
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:14,241
you really miss him.

680
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:15,481
You miss him so much you can't sleep.

681
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:16,161
I don't!

682
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:17,081
You're making that up.

683
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:21,241
The call's still on.

684
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:25,401
Big boss,

685
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,001
Yao Yuan really misses you.

686
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,401
Do you want to talk to her?

687
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:36,161
Hello?

688
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:37,241
I'll call you in a bit.

689
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,520
Call back in a bit.

690
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:00,161
How long is "a bit"?

691
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:02,201
Li Ao,

692
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:04,401
how long is "a bit" to you?

693
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:06,201
Five minutes

694
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:07,881
or an hour?

695
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:09,441
Or maybe all night?

696
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:11,521
Hard to say.

697
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,960
Waiting is a personal thing.

698
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:15,841
I think maybe

699
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:16,961
her phone's out of battery.

700
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:17,761
She's charging it now.

701
00:42:19,561 --> 00:42:20,921
I should buy her more chargers.
