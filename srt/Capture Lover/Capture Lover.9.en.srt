1
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,100
Ding.

2
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,460
I am thirsty.

3
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:41,275
I want to drink some water.

4
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:46,730
Ying Jiaming, did you broke your arm or leg?

5
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,660
Can’t you pour the water by yourself?

6
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,720
Ah, you are such a brat.

7
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,090
Ying has been injured.

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,820
He is the major person to be
taken care of in our family now.

9
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,700
He just asked you to pour some water for him.
It is a piece of small cake.

10
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:56,710
Ying, don’t worry.
I will pour it for you.

11
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,200
No, no, I can do it myself.

12
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,270
You are such a child.

13
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,870
After I am done,

14
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,090
I will give you a lesson.

15
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,725
Mum.

16
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,060
You need someone to give you a good beating.

17
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,360
Ah, don’t say that.

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,694
My son, don’t say that.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,450
What are you doing?

20
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm Cold.

21
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,425
Bullshit, The heating is on

22
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,460
in our house. How can it be cold?

23
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:48,250
What are you doing?

24
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,780
Put my hands inside

25
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:51,806
to keep them warm.

26
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:52,920
Get your hands away.

27
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,540
Just for a while.

28
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,270
I said get your hands out.
What’s wrong with you?

29
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,687
Just ten seconds.

30
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,150
Time's up.

31
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:11,720
What are you doing?

32
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,390
Electrification by friction to keep myself warmer.

33
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,900
Stop doing this. Or get out.

34
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,270
Don’t sleep here.

35
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,825
I need to warm myself for a while.

36
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,460
Ying Jiaming, what do you want?

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,180
My skin clinging to your skin
will make both of us warmer.

38
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,600
Get off me.

39
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,850
Ying Jiaming.

40
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,920
My mom is in the next room.

41
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,200
It's late now.
Auntie must have fallen asleep.

42
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,190
What do you want on earth?
If you do this again, I will scream for help.

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,720
Go ahead.

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,100
Scream as you want.

45
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,625
You are my wife.

46
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,670
I can do what I want with you.

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,425
Why don't you just go die?

48
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,427
I wonder who cried so hard in the hospital

49
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,900
asking me not to die.

50
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:07,175
Ah.

51
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,300
You have gotten bored with me.

52
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,160
Then, do it quick.

53
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,390
I am going to bed after.

54
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,350
Ah?

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,080
Don't you understand Chinese?

56
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,620
Yes, I understand Chinese.

57
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,090
Ding, Ding.
I am coming.

58
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,840
No one would disturb us tonight.

59
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,070
We can be more open.

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,630
Wait.

61
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:55,912
Let us chat and relax for a while.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,040
Every minute is too precious to lose.

63
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,775
Let’s make every minute count.

64
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:05,050
Hello?

65
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:07,000
HaoZi?

66
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,625
What?

67
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,100
Go away. Take a hike.

68
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,425
Ying Jiaming!

69
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,970
Why is he always bothering you?

70
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,760
I have told you many times.

71
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,550
He is my childhood friend.

72
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,927
But I am still not comfortable with it.

73
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,160
Ying Jiaming, I'm warning you.

74
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,850
You're not allowed to get angry with my friend.

75
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,540
If you keep doing this,

76
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,525
I am afraid that you might get angry
with my mom or even me.

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,380
I can never thank your mom enough.

78
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,845
How could I be angry with her?

79
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:36,910
I wouldn't even dare.

80
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,260
Alright, I promise.

81
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,820
I won't get angry with him anymore. Ok?

82
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,124
Seriously though.

83
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,575
When did you start falling love with me?

84
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:45,675
When you completely lost your mind.

85
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:46,673
I said seriously.

86
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,790
I could not tell when.

87
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:49,932
I just thought that

88
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:52,598
you were very nice
and I wanted to get closer to you.

89
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:56,513
Ding, I've never been so close to someone

90
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:59,543
since my mom passed away.

91
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,874
I want to thank you and your mom for
giving me so much warmth.

92
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,984
Now, I am very happy.

93
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,200
In fact,

94
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,013
I am afraid that some day.

95
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:11,357
My mom would know about our relationship.

96
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:12,141
How would she react?

97
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,650
My mom has raised me alone.

98
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,710
I am afraid that I might break her heart.

99
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:20,633
Honey, don’t worry.

100
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,736
I would behave well in front of our mom.

101
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:25,663
Let her entrust you to me in person.

102
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:28,155
Really?

103
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:29,683
Yes, of course.

104
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:31,944
You don’t trust me?

105
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:33,290
Besides,

106
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,954
Who else can you trust if you don't trust me?

107
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:35,747
Right?

108
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:38,470
Well, the New Year is coming.

109
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,225
What does our mom like?

110
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,690
Let me know, I can buy her some.

111
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,270
I don't think mom lacks anything.

112
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:50,913
No, sweetheart.

113
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:51,921
Our mom lacks one thing.

114
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,575
What?

115
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:56,690
Do you know what I mean?

116
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:00,325
Over these years, my mom

117
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:02,503
really went through a lot to raise me alone.

118
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,253
She has not remarried.

119
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:07,022
I think to find a person

120
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,462
who can make her happy

121
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,162
and accompany her is the most important thing.

122
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,092
Sweetheart,

123
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,867
our mom has had too many hardships all her life.

124
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,600
We are her sons.

125
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,042
It is time for us to think for her.

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,675
By the way,

127
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,975
my mom has been getting along with.

128
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,573
Uncle Chen upstairs well.

129
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,081
Uncle Chen also takes good care of our mom.

130
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,700
His son works elsewhere,
and he also needs someone to accompany him.

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,230
I think he likes our mom.

132
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,582
Then, let’s be the match-maker.

133
00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:38,222
We can invite Uncle Chen over to celebrate New Year.

134
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:41,182
Good idea.

135
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:43,162
Sweetheart,

136
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:46,172
you and our mom have had too many hardships.

137
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:50,332
In the future, I promise.

138
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:53,032
I would make you and your mom live happily.

139
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:56,425
Ying Jiaming,

140
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:58,350
I have gone through

141
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:02,545
unimaginable hardships over the years.

142
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,554
And now with you by my side,

143
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:08,232
I no longer have to fight alone.

144
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:10,990
My life is complete.

145
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,100
I love Ying Jiaming.

146
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:21,024
Shut up.

147
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,048
Son, listen to me.

148
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:26,072
You're wrong.

149
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,796
Do you know what others would speak of you?

150
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,920
They'll call you pervert

151
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:31,744
a rogue,

152
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,268
or even insane.

153
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,492
Mom, you care too much about what others think.

154
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:37,316
You should care about my happiness.

155
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,340
Son,

156
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,564
how could you say so?

157
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:43,488
Of course I care about your happiness.

158
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,900
You're so cruel.

159
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,524
I fell into your trap.
