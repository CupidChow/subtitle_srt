1
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,375
Xiao Jia,

2
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:02,774
The novel you wrote is so interesting!

3
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:03,935
Your writing skills are high!

4
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,951
The domineering male boss falls
in love with the stone-cold pretty boy.

5
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:11,075
What a plot!

6
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,800
Our company has-

7
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,350
two new ideas,

8
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,190
one is Ding Junjie's idea,

9
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,868
and the other,

10
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,772
is Xiao Liu's idea.

11
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:29,775
I think both ideas are good.

12
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,925
However, we can only choose one of them.

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
We have discussed all afternoon,

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,850
and it is time to come to a conclusion.

15
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,775
So,

16
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,974
let's listen to Mr. Ying's advise.

17
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,900
I agree with Mr. Ding's idea.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Ying,

19
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,066
although my idea is not very novel,

20
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,096
but it is the safest idea.

21
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,610
Although Mr. Ding's creativity is very good,

22
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,650
it may create great benefits for the company.

23
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,354
But Mr. Ding's ideas will-

24
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,827
have many difficulties in
the implementation process.

25
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,899
Mr. Ding, how do you ensure

26
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,362
that our products can be
listed as soon as possible?

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,186
You said that we can cooperate with the anchors.

28
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,064
We don't have similar work experience at all,

29
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,092
so how can we ensure-

30
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:26,225
that our products-

31
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,356
can be launched as soon as possible-

32
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,796
and sold to consumers as soon as possible?

33
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:31,967
This is too risky.

34
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,715
I think so too.

35
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,915
We're not familiar with E-commerce.

36
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:41,255
If we want to do this,

37
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,112
I'm worried that

38
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,115
there would be many problems.

39
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,114
Ms. Leng, Mr. Ying,

40
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,762
we really need to start doing e-commerce.

41
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,044
Now the e-commerce industry-

42
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,756
has surpassed traditional retail industry.

43
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,905
We need to change our sales model,

44
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:05,828
and take advantage of the Internet.

45
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,574
For example,

46
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,550
we can cooperate with Weiya and Li Jiaqi-

47
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,675
to develop channels-

48
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,400
and take advantage of the Internet-

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,465
To promote our brand and new products.

50
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:17,674
Besides, cosmetic and personal care products

51
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,323
creates high engagement on the internet.

52
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,824
So we can better

53
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:23,584
focus on our target consumers.

54
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:26,036
Of course we would have to compromise
on the profit now,

55
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,810
but there will be countless market benefit
out there for us.

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,525
So, in the future,

57
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,270
I suggest that our company
should sign a group of anchors.

58
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,038
Although that's a lot to invest-

59
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,549
in the early stage,

60
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,895
but according to my research and analysis,

61
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:41,798
our future sales will increase tenfold!

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,080
So I think-

63
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:44,383
that cooperating with the anchor to sell goods-

64
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,064
is the focus of our development this year.

65
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,684
I support Mr. Ding's idea,

66
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,165
for no reason.

67
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,167
If there has to be a reason,

68
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:54,416
I think Mr. Ding's ideas are-

69
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,808
risky and crazy.

70
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,109
If I am a distributor,

71
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:01,938
I am confident-

72
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,479
to sell my products to consumers.

73
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:04,847
So,

74
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,349
Miss Leng, do you have any other questions?

75
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,333
So…

76
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:15,116
Ok,

77
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,247
Let's do it then.

78
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:23,045
I hope that Mr. Ding's idea can
yield satisfactory results.

79
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:25,322
I will do my best, Miss Leng.

80
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:37,826
Why did you support my idea so much?

81
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,554
Because your idea is risky,

82
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,739
and easy to make my old man's company lose money.

83
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:47,604
I am seriously discussing with you.

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,560
I appreciate your guts.

85
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
This group of people-

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,165
they're too pedantic for such a young age.

87
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,893
They are literally dragging the company behind

88
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:57,181
if we don't make any changes.

89
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,916
We need to take some risks.

90
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:04,704
Hawking once said,

91
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,890
The splendor of life lies in adventure.

92
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,642
This is the most decent thing you said-

93
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,272
ever since I met you.

94
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:16,515
But,

95
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:17,877
why do you have so much faith-

96
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,397
in your ideas?

97
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:23,380
Because I believe in intuition!

98
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,091
Aha？.

99
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,886
Come on, I'm serious.

100
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,581
Ok,

101
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:37,216
I'm a web KOL myself,

102
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,313
I have personally experienced the impact

103
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:41,264
that E-commerce can bring,

104
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,314
the propagation effect.

105
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:43,932
So,

106
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:45,438
I never get to understand anything

107
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,076
merely by the knowledge.

108
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,127
We must go deep into the scene,

109
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,391
and take that role.

110
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:51,608
How I buy products

111
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,004
recommended by KOLs,

112
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:55,038
How I recommend products

113
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,548
as an anchor myself...

114
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,844
Every detail of this whole process,

115
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:01,787
I've been through all that.

116
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,446
Our company has been doing
beauty products for more than ten years,

117
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,074
It's an old brand.

118
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:08,856
Of course there are defects,

119
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,014
like only focusing on certain target consumers,

120
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:12,983
Our sales have also been very stable,

121
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,860
But young people don't know much about our brand.

122
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:17,374
So if we cooperate with the anchors,
compromise on some of the profits

123
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:20,062
and increase brand exposure with lowest price.

124
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,640
Without affecting original cost,

125
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,560
You can even make profits.

126
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:24,966
That's the thought.

127
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,556
About our marketing programs this time,

128
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,299
With the joint efforts of everyone,

129
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,649
The results are excellent.

130
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:53,514
Therefore, the company

131
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:56,184
acknowledges the marketing department.

132
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:58,284
Especially the team led by Vice President Ding!

133
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,959
Teamwork is the best, cheers!

134
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,959
Cheers!

135
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,423
In addition,

136
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:15,648
I want to thank Mr. Ding!

137
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:17,448
Xiao Ding,

138
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:21,048
I admire your wisdom and poise.

139
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:22,573
I really admire you.

140
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:25,573
To Xiao Ding, cheers!

141
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,148
Xiao Ding,

142
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:28,690
This is the first time in more than 20 years.

143
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,747
My dad ever praised me.

144
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:31,748
Ugh.

145
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:34,698
I'm flattered. That's my job.

146
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,702
What happened?

147
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:39,143
I thought they never see eye to eye on things.

148
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,548
Exactly. What is happening anyway?

149
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:42,923
You don't understand,

150
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,699
Husband and husband are unstoppable
as long as they work together.

151
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:46,929
In that case,

152
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,448
Let's make our dream come true.

153
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:49,608
Mr. Ding and Mr. Ying,

154
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,099
Since you enjoy working with each other so much,

155
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,768
please sing a song together!

156
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,223
Shut up!

157
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:55,523
You are too much!

158
00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,798
But I can't sing.

159
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:01,823
Don't be such a turn-off.

160
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:03,548
What song would you like?

161
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,300
No way.

162
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:21,924
Meng Yao wants to see me today.

163
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:23,748
I have a date with her.

164
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,000
Date her some other time,
and accompany me today.

165
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:29,324
You have so many friends,

166
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,348
Go hang out with them.

167
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:32,372
I'm not going.

168
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:35,496
I thought you don't like her.
So don't hang out with her.

169
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,700
What's your problem?

170
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:42,924
What is the deal with you two?

171
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
What does it have to do with you?

172
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:47,524
Of course it has something to do with me!

173
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,648
Wait a minute, guys...

174
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,372
Don't quarrel.
