1
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,800
Miss, is my cake ready?

2
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,150
Don't rush, it's ready now.

3
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,350
If I'm not rushing, I would've ordered food delivery.

4
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,175
I'm really in a rush.

5
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,700
I wonder which girl would like him,

6
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,525
this guy is really a pervert.

7
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,600
Junjie,

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,750
This cake is so cute!

9
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:24,825
Happy Birthday!

10
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,200
Thank you.

11
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:28,000
Make a wish!

12
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,600
Where have you been?

13
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,625
What did you just do?

14
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,950
Ding Junjie, it's working time now!

15
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,550
Did I interrupt your work?

16
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,225
No!

17
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,850
What is in your hand?

18
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,650
I am hungry so I bought a cake.

19
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,325
Oh.

20
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,250
Hurry up and end the birthday party
with your girlfriend.

21
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,300
And finish the project asap.

22
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,150
I want it tomorrow.

23
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,750
Don't delay your work.

24
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,500
We…

25
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,550
Junjie, your new boss is too harsh.

26
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,825
Ignore him.

27
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,100
Thank you very much!

28
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,375
Thank you for accompanying me on my birthday.

29
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,050
It's nothing, after all, I am your only girlfriend!

30
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,125
No, you are my female friend.

31
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,800
There is no difference between the two!

32
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:56,175
Ok…

33
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,675
Wait for me for another hour,

34
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,575
I will drive you home after work.

35
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,300
OK.

36
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,175
Why did I buy him cake?

37
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,225
I don't know why I did this.

38
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,025
No,

39
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,475
I just wanted to joke with him.

40
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,175
With this kinky cake.

41
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,900
Forget it, feed this cake to the dog.

42
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,150
This is just a joke, why take it seriously?

43
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,200
Are you cold?

44
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:24,600
Yes.

45
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:26,225
I'm cold.

46
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,250
But no matter how cold it is,

47
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,200
I want to keep walking with you.

48
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,375
Meng Yao,

49
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,175
Don't push me away.

50
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,175
Let me hug you for a while,

51
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,825
just for a while.

52
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,100
Junjie, I don't know if you remember,

53
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,454
since I was in elementary school,

54
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,329
I have been good friends with you,

55
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,005
wherever you go, I will follow.

56
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,238
Whoever you are friends with, I get along with them.

57
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,125
Like that, we became college students.

58
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,367
And from college to where we are now.

59
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:20,594
But Junjie,

60
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,398
I am somewhat tired now.

61
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:30,625
Sorry, Meng Yao.

62
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,025
Don't say sorry to me.

63
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,425
You did nothing wrong.

64
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,625
I wanted it.

65
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,937
I just want to love you in silence.

66
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:47,400
For a few more years,

67
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,025
is that okay?

68
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:51,850
Meng Yao...

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,100
Please don't refuse me.

70
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,575
Like you said, I'm your only girlfriend.

71
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:02,650
If you have a new girlfriend,

72
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,000
please tell me.

73
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,175
She has to be better than me.

74
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,502
Otherwise, I wouldn't agree.

75
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:14,450
Okay,

76
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,750
let me go home by myself.

77
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,925
You don't need to send me anymore.

78
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:25,075
Meng Yao…

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,553
Sorry, Meng Yao,

80
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,158
for letting you down.

81
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,800
Mom, why are you still up?

82
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,625
I can't sleep.

83
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,900
Is it cold outside?

84
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,675
It's cold.

85
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,975
Take off your coat.

86
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:10,750
Thank you, mom.

87
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,700
Your company is too harsh.

88
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:18,400
Why do you have to work late on your birthday?

89
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,832
Because today is my birthday,
the company intentionally made me work late.

90
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:25,975
Son, what did you eat tonight?

91
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,525
Did you eat junk food?

92
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,275
I made dumplings,

93
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,975
have some.

94
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:32,675
Mom…

95
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,475
I had dinner at the company.

96
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:36,266
Meng Yao bought me cake.

97
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,646
Meng Yao is really a good girl.

98
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,075
You should invite Meng Yao over sometime.

99
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:43,350
OK.

100
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:44,875
I like Meng Yao very much.

101
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,466
I've liked Meng Yao since she was little.

102
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,800
So, how are you two getting along?

103
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,100
Mom, Meng Yao and I are just good friends.

104
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,175
How could this be?

105
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:02,900
Mom, we are just really good friends.

106
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,600
Take this advice from your mom.

107
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,675
I know feelings are important,

108
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,350
but you shouldn't miss the right person.

109
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:14,250
I think Meng Yao is a good girl-

110
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,025
and very fond to you.

111
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,050
You can consider making her your girlfriend.

112
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,100
She could be the right girl for you.

113
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,125
Mom, can we not talk about this?

114
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,101
I don't have plans to fall in love yet.

115
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,450
Okay,

116
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,150
You are already an adult,
and you have your own opinions.

117
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,800
But,

118
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,425
Be sure to let mommy know when you
have a girlfriend.

119
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,925
I have not much to expect now,

120
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,625
except that you get married and have children.

121
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,600
How time flies!

122
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,050
We have lived together for so many years.

123
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:54,200
You are 26 now and I just got older.

124
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,725
Mom, you are still young!

125
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,722
In my heart,

126
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:01,840
you are always a beauty.

127
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:04,067
You are young, not old!

128
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,425
Mom,

129
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,299
I'll work hard and make more money.

130
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:10,970
I swear I will no longer make you suffer.

131
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,600
OK?

132
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,100
Stop this sad topic.

133
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,300
Wait here, I will serve the dumplings.

134
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,775
The dumplings I made are stuffed with
sauerkraut from Northeast China.

135
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:23,750
OK!

136
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,775
The dumplings have a particularly thin skin.

137
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:33,025
Try some, are they good?

138
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,575
What do you think?

139
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:41,350
Very delicious.

140
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:50,975
My mother once told me that

141
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,975
eating dumplings in winter

142
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:54,150
gives you a good mood.

143
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,875
The dumplings are very delicious,
stuffed with sauerkraut from Northeast China.

144
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:10,750
Excuse me...

145
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,400
Who are you?

146
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,725
What do you guys do?

147
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,900
You don’t need to ask who I am.

148
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,450
Who are you? I am looking for Ying Jiaming.

149
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,350
Sorry, you are not allowed to come in.

150
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,975
Who pushed me just now?

151
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,572
Don't touch me!

152
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,775
Sorry, you are not allowed to come in.

153
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,850
Don't touch my mink coat.

154
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,525
My mink coat is very expensive.

155
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:32,785
You can't compensate.

156
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,580
Your company is nothing in my eyes,

157
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,865
I don't care.

158
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,550
Please be informed.

159
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,550
Sorry, you are not allowed to come in.

160
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,600
This is rediculous!

161
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:49,925
Sorry, you are not allowed to come in.

162
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,050
We are about to drive you out!

163
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,225
Ying Jiaming! Come out!

164
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:59,225
Don't avoid me!

165
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:02,600
He hasn't come to work yet.

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,975
Who are you?

167
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:06,800
How do you know he didn't come to work?

168
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:08,400
He is my boyfriend.

169
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,925
Jiaming, I miss you.

170
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,850
Zhang Fengxia, why are you here?

171
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,825
Please call me Lucy. Lucy Zhang.

172
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,500
Lucy, why are you here?

173
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:19,975
Because you don't reply my messages!

174
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,875
Lucy, please go home.

175
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,225
We broke up long ago.

176
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,325
Jiaming, what did you just say?

177
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,075
What is this bitch to you?

178
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,125
He…

179
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,700
He is my boyfriend, like I said!

180
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,425
Aha?

181
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,925
Xiao Ding, please help me!

182
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,293
This girl is very savage.

183
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,150
Please help me just this time.

184
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,425
I think the female colleagues
are having a dream come true.

185
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,375
I knew they are a couple!

186
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,450
There's more fictions to write.

187
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,175
Please!

188
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,352
I apologize for all the stupid things I did,

189
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:04,000
and I'm truly sorry.

190
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:04,775
I can help you, but only once.

191
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:06,275
What are you doing?

192
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,950
So what's the excuse this time?

193
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,200
Terminal illness? Impotence?

194
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,500
No/

195
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:16,750
Lucy.

196
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,775
I never told you about it,

197
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,350
because the timing was not right.

198
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,950
But.

199
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,300
Today, I have to tell you this.

200
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,275
Actually, I am not impotence
and I don't have premature ejaculation.

201
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,100
I'm just gay.

202
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,825
Let me introduce.

203
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:33,147
The guy next to me

204
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,650
is my better half which
I haven't told anyone about.

205
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,375
I love him very much.

206
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh my god, this is huge!

207
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,250
Lucy,

208
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,700
How touching our love is!

209
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,175
No matter what others think of us.

210
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,925
This is true love!

211
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,900
Jiaming, are these words you said true?

212
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Of course!

213
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,725
Even if it is discriminated by others,

214
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,250
I want to announce to the world that I love him!

215
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:09,700
I love him so much!

216
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,150
Look!

217
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:18,000
He is already pregnant!

218
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:19,800
Em…

219
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,825
Lucy, bye!

220
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,400
Wait for me, honey!

221
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,200
What's going on?

222
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:28,850
So chaotic!

223
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:32,750
I'm so heart-broken right now!

224
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,050
For real?

225
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,900
What a crazy world!

226
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,100
The tables are really turned nowadays!

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Is your voice OK?

228
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:20,724
None of your business!

229
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:21,848
You made me work late again today.

230
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,372
Are you doing this on purpose?

231
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,300
You knew I'm doing this on purpose.

232
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:27,924
Why bother ask?

233
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,300
I quit, are you happy now?

234
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,500
Are you and Ying Jiaming really an item?

235
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
Hey, Jiang Zhihao!

236
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:42,724
Are you out of your mind?
How could it be true?

237
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,200
Hey bro, don't make up bullshit.
