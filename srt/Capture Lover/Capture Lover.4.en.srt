1
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,425
Is your throat better?

2
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:42,700
Nothing to do with you!

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,226
You made me work overtime again today,

4
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,400
did you do it intentionally?

5
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,601
You clearly know that I did it on purpose,

6
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,875
why come to question me?

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,400
I can resign!

8
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,200
You can go to the personnel department to resign.

9
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,750
Okay, I will go now.

10
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,900
I was joking.

11
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,400
Don't be angry!

12
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,974
Ying Jiaming, you made me work overtime yesterday,

13
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,999
and you're not satisfied with the project I did.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,124
You made me work overtime again today,

15
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,800
you are deliberately bullying me!

16
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,125
Okay,

17
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,525
I'm sorry!

18
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,375
Well, let me buy you dinner tonight,

19
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:34,150
as my apology to you.

20
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,050
I would rather work overtime than
have dinner with you.

21
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,750
Come on, it's just dinner!

22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,450
After dinner, your project
plan is approved directly.

23
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:45,525
Plus, I will give you a few more paid holidays.

24
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:46,725
You think I would just give in

25
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:49,001
because the conditions
you offered are very generous?

26
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:50,665
You will definitely accept my invitation!

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,725
Yes, I accept!

28
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,595
Let's go to dinner together!

29
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,175
Xiao Ding,

30
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,250
are you really in love with Ying Jiaming?

31
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,025
Jiang Zhihao,

32
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:33,425
Are you out of your mind? Of course not.

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,324
He promised to double my salary for this month,

34
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:37,525
and a year-end bonus, so I promised him.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,475
How can you believe what he said?

36
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:46,575
Yeah, how can I believe what he said?

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,975
Why don't you believe what I said?

38
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,353
It's already off hours, why are you still here?

39
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:52,626
Do you want to work overtime?

40
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,750
Mr Ying, I will go home immediately.

41
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,650
Mr Ying, bye...

42
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,300
Why does he come to you every day?

43
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:09,050
He is my best friend and we are neighbors.

44
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,425
We go home together every day
when you're not here.

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Alright, let's go to dinner.

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,880
Try the barbecue in this
shop, it is very delicious.

47
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,100
Thank you.

48
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,175
Mr.Ding,

49
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:24,810
It's not working time now,

50
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:26,300
don't be too polite.

51
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,115
I am used to being polite to others.

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,280
You are used to keeping a
distance from others, right?

53
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,499
How can you have friends?

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,540
I don't have many friends.

55
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,876
I only have two friends,
Jiang Zhihao and Meng Yao.

56
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,220
Besides, I have no other friends.

57
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,950
Meng Yao is not your girlfriend?

58
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,900
No.

59
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:46,975
She likes me...

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,439
Well, it's complicated.

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,950
So we're on the same boat.

62
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,375
No, I don’t think so.

63
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:58,825
You are a jerk.

64
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:05,425
Bro, don't talk like that
when you don't have proof.

65
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:09,134
That girl, no, that bad girl,

66
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,246
my dad forced me to date her.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,950
The girl's family is very rich.

68
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,852
We are like... "business marriage".

69
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:20,300
I really don't love that girl.

70
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,675
But she just wouldn't give up on me.

71
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,575
Then,

72
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,400
we agreed on one thing.

73
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,125
If things go okay after one month,
this relationship continues.

74
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,526
If not,

75
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,275
We break up.

76
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,300
But that girl is stalking me!

77
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:40,915
She just doesn't want to break up with me.

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,825
What's worse,

79
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,605
she followed me to the company today.

80
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,750
Now that I told her I am gay,

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,200
she'll definitely give up.

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,375
By the way,

83
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,650
my dad aka the chairman may fire me.

84
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Two birds with one stone.

85
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,275
I didn't know that.

86
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,825
That's why I said we're on the same boat.

87
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,975
Cheers, to the same boat.

88
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,000
Sorry, I can't drink.

89
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,150
Why?

90
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,369
I have caught a cold recently.

91
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,501
The weather is a bit cold and
my throat is uncomfortable.

92
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:18,899
So this morning I really
didn't intend to vomit,

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,400
but I couldn't hold it back.

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,125
I thought you did it on purpose.

95
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,750
I remember,

96
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,400
when my throat was uncomfortable,

97
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,725
my mother would make me-

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
rock sugar pear juice.

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,280
That's always a lifesaver for my throat.

100
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,590
Your mother must be very good at cooking!

101
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,300
My mother's cooking is great!

102
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:44,775
Very delicious.

103
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,625
It's a pity that I can't have that anymore.

104
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,075
Sorry.

105
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,970
It doesn't matter,
I will make it for you next time.

106
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:01,050
That would be too much trouble for you.

107
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,175
You see,

108
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,758
you are too polite again.

109
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,525
Are you still holding a grudge

110
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:09,749
about what happend ealier?

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,625
Don't mind,

112
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,870
that was not at all personal.

113
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,025
I did it to get the company to fire me.

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,575
I'm not happy in this company.

115
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,650
That's why I deliberately made trouble.

116
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,725
To be honest,

117
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:30,951
I think this company is too boring.

118
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:34,125
Everyone is stupid.

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Thanks to you,

120
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,850
I don't feel so bored.

121
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:40,975
I almost forgot,

122
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,879
thank you for helping me out this morning.

123
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:48,750
But why do you want the company to fire you?

124
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,425
I have other dreams.

125
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:52,050
Did you know,

126
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,650
that this boring 9 to 5 routine is not what I want,

127
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:57,874
not with those dummies.

128
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,824
I'm so tired of all this!

129
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,650
So, what kind of life do you want to live?

130
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,700
For me…

131
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,775
I want to be a chef-

132
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,507
and open a barbecue restaurant.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,829
Sounds romantic, right?

134
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,525
Sounds free, yeah?

135
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:23,592
Rich people are unrealistic.

136
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:26,075
Em…

137
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,520
Don't you want to live like this?

138
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,014
I want it, but I find it unrealistic.

139
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:33,800
You are too boring.

140
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I support Mr. Ding's creativity,

141
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:04,224
there is no reason.

142
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:05,648
If I have to say,

143
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:07,172
I think Mr. Ding's ideas-

144
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:09,696
are dangerous and crazy.

145
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,600
Because your idea is risky,

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it may cause the company to lose money.
