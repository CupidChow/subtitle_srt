1
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,300
Mom, I'm back.

2
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,315
Mom, what’s wrong?

3
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,175
Son,
sit down.

4
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:02,070
What’s wrong?

5
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,293
Mom wants to talk to you.

6
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,080
Talk about what?

7
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,080
Are you and Ying Jiaming a couple?

8
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:17,670
What are you talking about?

9
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,680
Stop lying.

10
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,150
Ying Jiaming’s father has told me

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,050
everything.

12
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:26,262
The accident last time

13
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,217
was because you and Ying Jiaming…

14
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:30,222
Ah,

15
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:31,502
Mom,

16
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,250
Mom,

17
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,025
Ying Jiaming and I, we,

18
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,400
Son,

19
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,320
how could you be so irresponsible?

20
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,225
You embarrass me.

21
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,380
Mom,

22
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:10,340
I love Ying Jiaming.

23
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:12,570
Shut up.

24
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,120
If I knew you two would end up like this,

25
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,162
I'd never let him come over.

26
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,180
Mom, even if you don't want to hear it,

27
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,050
I still have to say it.

28
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,510
I love Ying Jiaming.

29
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,350
There's nothing wrong with loving someone.

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,200
It just happens that the person I like is a man.

31
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,280
Not all couples need to reproduce.

32
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,245
What supports us is love.

33
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,836
Son, listen to me.

34
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:44,730
You're wrong.

35
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,620
Do you know what others would speak of you?

36
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,000
They'll call you pervert

37
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,800
a rogue,

38
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,820
or even insane.

39
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,925
Mom, you care too much about what others think.

40
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,690
You should care about my happiness.

41
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,525
Son.

42
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,160
Son,

43
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,330
how could you say so?

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,390
Of course I care about your happiness.

45
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:08,290
I'm happy now.

46
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,620
But when you're being discriminated and abused

47
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,034
you won't be happy.

48
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,190
Even if the whole world abuses your son

49
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,070
and laughs at your son,

50
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,360
would you still stand by my side?

51
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:26,625
Of course I will.

52
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:31,200
Then that’s enough.

53
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,030
But you won't be happy.

54
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Why not?

55
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,860
Mom isn't afraid of discrimination.

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,470
But mom's afraid that you'll get hurt
from how they look at you.

57
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,100
I absolutely will not allow you

58
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,040
to make such a wrong decision,

59
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,270
or to suffer any kind of damage.

60
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,525
Mom,

61
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:56,825
Mom, are you ok?

62
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,850
Stop.

63
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,790
Cool down these days

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
and stop seeing Ying Jiaming.

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,000
Mom, I beg you, I really like him.

66
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,193
Mom, please.
Stop.

67
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,110
End of discussion.

68
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,174
Listen to what I say.

69
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:13,290
Ok, mom,
Ok.

70
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,194
I'll do what you say. Stop being angry.

71
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:16,500
Mom,
Mom,

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,350
are you ok?

73
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,600
Mom, is it your heart again?

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,250
Mom, calm down, I'll listen to you.

75
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,405
Mom.
Give me your cell.

76
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,350
Mom.

77
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,680
Why don’t you listen to mom?

78
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,525
You contacted Ying Jiaming again, right?

79
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,150
Mom, I won't break up with him.

80
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:50,800
You.

81
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,310
You deliberately pissing me off.

82
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,775
Ah, mom,

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,075
- You want to piss me off?
- Mom.

84
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,390
Mom, mom, are you ok?

85
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,375
Get off of me.

86
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,825
Mom, is it your heart again?

87
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:07,700
Mom,

88
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,800
Tell me,

89
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,550
do you choose Ying Jiaming or me?

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,100
Give me an answer.

91
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,310
Mom, I choose you.

92
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,320
You mean it?

93
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,850
Yes.

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,180
Break up with Ying Jiaming right now.

95
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,850
Ok, ok, ok, I'll do whatever you say.

96
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,850
I'll listen to you.

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,625
Mom, calm down.

98
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,230
Calm down, ok? Mom.

99
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,650
Junjie, go home with me.

100
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:57,850
What’s wrong?

101
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:01,578
I can't go with you.

102
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:03,500
Sorry.

103
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:05,391
I'm really sorry.

104
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,503
It wasn't easy for my mom to raise me.

105
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:10,925
I can't go with you

106
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:13,806
it's for her good.

107
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,300
What about me?

108
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,475
What shall I do?

109
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,200
Don't you have a soft spot for me?

110
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,425
My mom's forcing me to make a choice.

111
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,700
I have no choice.

112
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:34,850
I have to give you up.

113
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,900
How can you give up so easily?

114
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,200
I don’t want to give up.

115
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,950
Junjie.

116
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,260
I've never been afraid of how others see us.

117
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,790
I'm worried about my mom.

118
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:55,889
My mom's heart is acting up again,

119
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,475
because of our relationship.

120
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,700
I can't lose her. Do you understand?

121
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,888
Did you forget what you told me?

122
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't.

123
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:15,750
Let me go.

124
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,398
At least we still have the memories.

125
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:24,950
Ding Junjie.

126
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:27,650
I'm very sad.

127
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,695
But I feel for you, because I love you.

128
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,716
You can give up.

129
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:36,575
But once you do.

130
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,380
I'll never look back.

131
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,455
Are you sure of this?

132
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,405
Why are you forcing me to choose?

133
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,093
I'm not forcing you to choose.

134
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,618
But when I've overcome so much to come see you.

135
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:56,316
And this is your answer.

136
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,275
Ying Jiaming, I'm sorry.

137
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,266
There's no happy ending for us.

138
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,492
You're so cruel.

139
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,260
I fell into your trap.

140
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm hopeless.

141
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:20,550
Mom,

142
00:13:22,984 --> 00:13:24,164
we won't be together.

143
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:25,796
Son.

144
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,772
Mom, are you satisfied now?

145
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,350
But once you do.

146
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,329
I'll never look back.

147
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:16,365
Are you sure of this?

148
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,175
I'll teach you how to have a fresh start.

149
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,175
Where did you go?

150
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:00,225
Ding Junjie, it's office hours now.

151
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:10,500
Ding,

152
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:12,700
though I'm not sure

153
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,603
what happened between you and Director Ying,

154
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,750
But I'll support all your decisions.

155
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,650
A change of environment may be better for you.

156
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,400
Have you found the next job?

157
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,050
Not yet.

158
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,475
I plan to travel around

159
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:30,200
and relax.

160
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:32,700
Good luck in the future.

161
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,600
Let's go.

162
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:56,775
Ying Jiaming.

163
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:06,700
You said you want freedom,

164
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,875
you saided you want romance,

165
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,475
you said you want to set up a BBQ stand.

166
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,525
How about this?

167
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:19,200
We won't set up a location,

168
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,325
but if we bump into each other,

169
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:28,225
I'll bravely take your hand.
