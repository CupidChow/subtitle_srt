1
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:57,500
What are you doing?

2
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:00,325
Hello, I am sleeping.

3
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:01,925
Get up and pee.

4
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,250
Okay.

5
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,925
No, anything else?

6
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,260
I'm hanging up then.

7
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,850
Let's go somewhere.

8
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,100
No way.

9
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,996
Meng Yao wants to see me today.

10
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,295
I have a date with her.

11
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,400
Date her some other time,
and accompany me today.

12
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,249
You have so many friends,

13
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,115
Go hang out with them.

14
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm not going.

15
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:30,075
I thought you don't like her.
So don't hang out with her.

16
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,570
I'd rather hang out with her than with you.

17
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,900
Alright, that's it, bye.

18
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,575
My parents got separated since I was little.

19
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:13,925
Don't say it, I understand.

20
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,300
I truly understand you.

21
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,850
No one gives us love,

22
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,450
No one gives us love.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,875
We are two heart-broken souls.

24
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,115
Seeking comfort from each other.

25
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,775
Oh my god, what did I say last night?

26
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,425
Hey, why are you here?

27
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,025
Mr. Ying, are you stalking them too?

28
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,050
Duck your head.

29
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,275
What are you saying? I'm just hanging out.

30
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:31,000
You do what you do, I have to keep following them.

31
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,999
Hey, why are you following them?

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,760
For the happiness rest of my life.

33
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Is it...

34
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,780
No!

35
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,350
Are you...

36
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm not.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,175
This can't be... but it is as it is.

38
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:38,575
Hao Zi,

39
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,750
Why are you here?

40
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,114
How can you guys do this?

41
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,650
Having a date without me?

42
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,450
Why should we include you in our date?

43
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,050
We used to hang out as a group,

44
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,200
But now you two are abandoning me.

45
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
That's why I'm angry.

46
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,275
What's your problem?

47
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,665
What is the deal with you two?

48
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
What does it have to do with you?

49
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:05,225
Of course it has something to do with me!

50
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:07,774
Wait a minute, guys...

51
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:08,989
Don't quarrel.

52
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,225
Shut up!

53
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,225
Are you two in a relationship?

54
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,250
We're in a relationship, so what?

55
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,670
What does it have to do with you?

56
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,550
We are no longer hanging out as a group!

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey,

58
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,125
Here I am!

59
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,450
Ying Jiaming, why are you here?

60
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,675
Why can't I come?

61
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,480
You came with Jiang Zhihao?

62
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:55,775
Who?

63
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:02,125
Was that Jiang Zhihao?

64
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Yes indeed.

65
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,700
No, no, not together.

66
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:09,650
Xiaoding, are you here with your girlfriend today?

67
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,850
I...

68
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,474
Non need to be so awkward.

69
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,175
Just eat and drink,

70
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,700
Make yourselves at home, I don't exist.

71
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,950
Continue your date.

72
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,350
What do you mean?

73
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
What do you mean?

74
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,850
Fine, I'll leave you guys.

75
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,425
Hey, Meng Yao!

76
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,275
Meng girl, goodbye!

77
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,825
Ying Jiaming, why are you here anyway?

78
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,700
Why can't I come?

79
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:51,755
Why can't I come over? I'm not allowed to see you?

80
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,125
Why do you want?

81
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,291
Nothing.

82
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,324
I'm just stopping by to check on you.

83
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,575
Are you out of your mind or something?

84
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,000
Hoes before bros?

85
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:01,424
She can be here, why can't I be here?

86
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,174
Go home, you're out of your mind.

87
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:05,175
You can see her, why can't I see you?

88
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,824
Don't bother me, I am really busy.

89
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:07,500
I am not out of my mind.
Hey.

90
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,000
Jun jun Junjie...

91
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,175
I'm just checking on you.

92
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,775
Yes, it's weekend and I want to see you.

93
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,050
It's normal.

94
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,470
Of course the leader can check on his members.

95
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,855
It's not working hours now.

96
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:18,700
Why?

97
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,000
Today is the weekend. -So what?

98
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,524
I am the leader and I care about
my members even on weekends.

99
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,525
Don't you have friends?

100
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,001
No, I have no friends, what's wrong?

101
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:26,500
I really have no friends.
Go to your friends and leave me alone, OK?

102
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:29,350
I just want to see you, so what?

103
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,050
She can do it, why can't I do it? Why?

104
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,624
I said I'm just stopping by to see you, what's wrong?

105
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,625
Ying Jiaming!

106
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,775
Yes, I don't have friends.
What's wrong with that?

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,574
Why? I don't know why.

108
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:40,175
Why?

109
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,475
Because I like you.

110
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Ok…

111
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,650
Ah, I mean I like your work attitude.

112
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,975
Your idea. I appreciate you a lot.

113
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:56,665
You have problems. Get them fixed.

114
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:58,475
Junjie,

115
00:08:58,675 --> 00:08:59,850
Junjie, Junjie.

116
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,150
What did I say? I didn't say anything.

117
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
I did not say anything.

118
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:13,850
Sir, are you paying?

119
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,099
Why? I don't know why.

120
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,500
Why?
Because I like you.

121
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,300
Hello, how long has it been since Mr.
Ding was absent?

122
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,075
Ah, did he say he came down with what?

123
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,425
Fine, got it.

124
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:09,075
Mr. Ying, I was a little hungry.

125
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,530
Has Xiao Ding really been sick these days?

126
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,275
Yes, he is really sick.

127
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,225
I swear to God that this is true.

128
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,925
Aren't you afraid that God will punish you?

129
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I am...

130
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:25,700
So tell me the truth!

131
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,100
Xiao Ding did not want me to say it.

132
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,275
Within three numbers, if you
don't tell me the truth...

133
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,725
I will kiss you in public.

134
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,750
I don't want to stay here anyway.

135
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,850
If you don’t want to be fired, tell me the truth.

136
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,275
Xiaoding is hiding from you these days.

137
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,325
He has been at home.

138
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:52,825
Where is his home？.

139
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:31,425
Who is it?

140
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,050
Coming.

141
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:37,550
Who are you?

142
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:40,350
Hello Auntie, is this Ding Junjie's home?

143
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:41,375
Yes.

144
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,675
I’m Xiao Ding's colleague, Ying Jiaming.

145
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,630
I heard that he has been sick these days.
I'm here to visit him.

146
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,675
Ah, come in now. Come in.

147
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,950
Come in, please.

148
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,675
You didn't have to bring so many things.

149
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Come in and have a seat.

150
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:01,651
I'll pour you a glass of water.

151
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:02,675
It's okay, Auntie.

152
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:11,715
My Junjie,

153
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,601
He said he's not feeling well these days.

154
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,705
I told him to go to the doctors
but he wouldn't listen to me.

155
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,350
Junjie, get up, your colleague is here.

156
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:19,300
Thank you.

157
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:20,725
I can't get up, I'm sick.

158
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,690
Your colleague is here, come on.

159
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,325
I can't get up, I'm sick.

160
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,425
Hey, who taught you to be so rude?

161
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:31,001
Xiaoying, wait here, I'll go get him out.

162
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,550
Auntie, I'll just go see him.

163
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,050
OK.

164
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,452
I'm making dumplings in the kitchen,

165
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:36,900
Stay for a while to eat dumplings.

166
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
OK, thank you.

167
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,250
What's this all about?

168
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
What are you doing?

169
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,725
Why are you avoiding me?

170
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,875
I'm not avoiding you.

171
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:07,295
You are. You didn't come to work all these days.

172
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:09,550
I am sick and uncomfortable.

173
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,875
Xiao Ding,

174
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:12,682
Are you holding grudges-

175
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,308
about what happened?

176
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,480
What are you talking about?

177
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,050
I don't remember.

178
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,975
I said...

179
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,700
Don't say it, I have forgotten it.

180
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:25,825
Sorry.

181
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:27,397
I don't know-

182
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:28,950
why I would say that.

183
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,509
If it really bothers you so much,

184
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,075
I'm very sorry.

185
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,000
I said, don't say it.

186
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,825
Okay, I won’t.

187
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:40,550
Junjie, Xiaoying, dinner is ready.

188
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:43,550
Okay mom, coming.

189
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's go.

190
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,850
Why are you so lazy?

191
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,525
Come over and get Xiaoying a bowl.

192
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:03,795
Auntie, I'll get it myself.

193
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,550
Do you know where the bowl is? Sit down.

194
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,675
Come on, Xiaoying is our guest.

195
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:10,550
I know, Mom.
You take the tableware.

196
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,820
Xiaoying, try the dumplings stuffed
with sauerkraut from Northeast China.

197
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,100
No need to rush.

198
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Hey,

199
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,425
Don't rush, no one is taking your dumplings.

200
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,575
Be polite.

201
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:49,825
Xiaoying, is it delicious?

202
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,700
Auntie, this is so delicious.

203
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,200
Your cooking is amazing!

204
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,601
Today is the winter solstice,

205
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,825
People should eat dumplings
on winter solstice.

206
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:03,650
Eating dumplings warms people's hearts.

207
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,250
My son has always loved my
dumplings since childhood.

208
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Xiaoying,

209
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:13,475
Thanks, mom.

210
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,175
Why are you crying?

211
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,350
Nothing, it's just that seeing you together

212
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,950
reminds me of my mother.

213
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,225
My mom...

214
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,065
she used to make dumplings as well.

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
She also said,

216
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,325
eating dumplings in winter

217
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,485
warms people's hearts.

218
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,100
I did not know this.

219
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,750
What happened to your mother?

220
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:52,525
Mom, stop asking.

221
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Don't stop me. Cheers!

222
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,424
Cheers! Mom!

223
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:19,948
Cheers!
Mom!

224
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:21,996
Stand up! Ying Jiaming!

225
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,020
What instructions do you have, leader?

226
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:25,944
Don't cheers with my mom!

227
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:28,268
Xiao Ding-Ding, please say yes.

228
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,492
You told me you will hand out with me before.

229
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Xiao Ding, about this month...

230
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,700
Oops!

231
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:38,424
Sorry! Sorry for bother!

232
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:39,048
Hello!

233
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:41,572
Junjie, someone was broke into my house.

234
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:43,396
Can you please come over?

235
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,320
Sure, I come over now.

236
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400
OK, please hurry!
