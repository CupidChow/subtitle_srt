00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:35,600
Hello everyone,

2
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:38,125
due to personnel changes,

3
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm transferring to another department.

4
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
The company has decided on a candidate

5
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,585
to take over my position.

6
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Jiaming,

7
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:56,873
Ying Jiaming,

8
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:59,950
is the new manager of the company's marketing department.

9
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,448
Say a few words to everyone.

10
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:31,675
Thank you everyone for the loose clapping.

11
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,775
From now on, let's work hard together.

12
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
Why?

13
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,250
I thought Vice President Ding would be the new manager.

14
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,200
Ying Jiaming is just a newbie

15
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,550
who is always on the phone or sleeping.

16
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,550
Why can he be the general manager?

17
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:02,475
Because Ying Jiaming is a handsome guy!

18
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,625
Looks is all that matters nowadays.

19
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,750
I don't think so,

20
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,550
Vice President Ding is also handsome.

21
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:12,468
I want to be a die-hard fan of Vice President Ding.

22
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,625
The devil is in one detail.

23
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,885
Ying Jiaming's surname is Ying.

24
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,444
So what?

25
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,634
Oh? So what?

26
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,075
Is it?

27
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,066
Don’t you know?

28
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,225
He may be Cherrie Ying's younger brother!

29
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:48,075
I want to be a die-hard fan of Ying Jiaming.

30
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:49,981
Oh my god!

31
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:51,960
He is going to the office of Vice President Ding.

32
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,480
I think they will definitely conflict.

33
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,375
Go out and knock on the door.

34
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:06,356
Oops, Xiao Ding Ding!

35
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,531
You are so arrogant!

36
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:10,375
I have some words for you.

37
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,225
Congratulations?

38
00:06:13,404 --> 00:06:14,029
Borrowing power to do evil.

39
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,085
I disagree with you.

40
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,585
What does "Borrowing power to do evil" mean?

41
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,460
Vice President Ding!

42
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,185
Is that all?

43
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,385
Starting from today,

44
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,135
I am your leader. I am your boss.

45
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,260
I'm here to see if my staff is okay.

46
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,835
We must establish friendly relations!

47
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:40,435
I hope you can give me some pointers in my future work.

48
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:44,760
Please be assured that I will give you some suggestions.

49
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,935
Okay!

50
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,885
Xiao Ding Ding!

51
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
I will give you lessons.

52
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,035
Ding Junjie, I've been so bored in this company,

53
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,685
but now you can play with me.

54
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,410
Xiaoding, why are you working late again today?

55
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:06,285
Ask that guy called Ying Jiaming.

56
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,160
Why is he always torturing you?

57
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,825
He has a mental illness.

58
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:13,960
There's nothing we can do.

59
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,510
But today is your birthday.

60
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:20,110
We're supposed to have a birthday party at your place.

61
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm afraid that has to be cancelled.

62
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,460
He is the chairman's son,

63
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,835
you can go to the chairman to complain to him.

64
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,360
Do you think I will have a chance to
meet the chairman?

65
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:34,860
I don't think so.

66
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:36,185
So…

67
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,260
Okay, then I'm off work first.

68
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,525
Be careful on the way.

69
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:36,660
Hello.

70
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,110
Hello, Mom,

71
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,085
I'm working late today and can't go home for dinner.

72
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,360
Why?

73
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:45,290
I want to earn overtime pay.

74
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,285
Well, I already made dumplings for you.

75
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,485
And I will keep them for you.

76
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:49,710
You can eat them when you get back.

77
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,485
No need, mom.

78
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,950
I don't want to have dinner.

79
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,260
Okay. Bye.

80
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,785
What a pity!

81
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:25,250
Vice President Ding, you are busy working!

82
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,275
I am not very busy, just passing the time.

83
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,460
You haven't eaten dinner yet,
we can eat dumplings together!

84
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,110
My mother once told me that

85
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,960
eating dumplings in winter

86
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,149
gives you good mood.

87
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,324
These are so delicious and hot,
stuffed with sauerkraut from Northeast China.

88
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:44,650
I am in a bad mood to see you.

89
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,825
Why don't you go home?

90
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,715
I see that you're working late

91
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:57,825
and I just couldn't ditch you.

92
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:58,490
I want to accompany you.

93
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,850
How can you work with your computer off?

94
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,085
I'm not hungry.

95
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,035
It's past dinner time,
why are you not hungry yet?

96
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:08,285
Try these dumplings stuffed with
sauerkraut from Northeast China.

97
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:14,075
I don't want it, take it away.

98
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:16,460
You are too much.

99
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,010
If you don't eat it, then I will.

100
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:29,710
Are you angry?

101
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:33,260
I am not angry.

102
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,635
I know why you are angry-

103
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,635
because I disturbed your date.

104
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,775
What is the password of your phone?

105
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,100
I don't know.

106
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,335
I can't believe your password is so stupid!

107
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,835
Give me my phone!

108
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:02,385
Let me see.

109
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:05,485
You are so annoying!

110
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,950
A pretty girl sent you a message.

111
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,360
Who is this girl?

112
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,199
Give back!

113
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,575
Nah!

114
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,125
Let me see, let me see.

115
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,275
Are you really angry?

116
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,965
Fine,

117
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,554
there's your pretty girl.

118
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,075
Why not read the message?

119
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,600
Hi, son, I sent you a WeChat red envelope.

120
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,724
Mom, keep this money for yourself.

121
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,244
You can't go home for dinner,

122
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,690
so I sent you a WeChat red envelope as compensation.

123
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,033
Happy birthday, son!

124
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,700
Thanks, Mom.

125
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,250
Mom, go to bed earlier.

126
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,275
Uh, okay.

127
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,925
Then I won't disturb your work.

128
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:06,525
Why are you looking at me?

129
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,150
Today is your birthday?

130
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,120
Yes.

131
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,175
Why didn't you say so?

132
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,750
You are clearly intentional.

133
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:21,200
I swear to God, I really didn't know that
today is your birthday.

134
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,575
Please wait for me in the office.

135
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,125
Where are you going?

136
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,100
What did you just do?

137
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,300
Ding Junjie, it's working time now!

138
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,300
What is in your hand?

139
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I am hungry so I bought a ca6ke.

140
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,400
Mom, why aren't you sleeping?

141
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:08,124
I can't sleep.

142
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,248
Is it cold outside?

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,600
Who was hitting me just now?

144
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,124
Don't touch me!

145
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:13,048
Sorry, you are not allowed to come in.
Hey.

146
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:15,196
Don't touch my mink coat.

147
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,500
Actually, I am not impotence and
I don't have premature ejaculation.

148
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,324
I'm just gay.
