1
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,600
Are you cold?
Are you ok?

2
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:12,950
I like it here a lot.

3
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,525
I'd come here in the winter when I was young.

4
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:17,675
My dad was afraid
that I might fall into the ice hole.

5
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:19,650
He'd beat me if he finds me here.

6
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,850
Then,

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,864
my mom would protect me.

8
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,050
You're so naughty.

9
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,800
My parents used to argue all the time.

10
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:33,904
I was surrounded by their negative emotions,

11
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,181
so I like to be alone.

12
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:38,550
When I'm sad,

13
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:40,417
I'd come here,

14
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,575
feel the breeze.

15
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,850
Then I'd feel much better.

16
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:49,100
Ying Jiaming,

17
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,650
Do you know

18
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,675
what the happiest thing is?

19
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:58,700
The person I love

20
00:02:59,075 --> 00:02:59,918
loves me back.

21
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,650
Why do you say this to me?

22
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:07,850
Boring.

23
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,275
Yes, I'm bored.

24
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,375
Ding Junkai.

25
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,450
In fact,

26
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,939
love is something

27
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,063
uncontrollable.

28
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,827
Nor can it be explained.

29
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,750
Sometimes,

30
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,075
it might be

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,000
a fleeting glimpse, a vision of eternity.

32
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,377
Who taught you these?

33
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,000
Ding,

34
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,500
I want to embrace the world

35
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,625
with the one I love.

36
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,150
No others.

37
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,241
There's just you and me in this world.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,916
What we pursue in life is love and freedom.

39
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,750
Spend our time in each other's gentle arms.

40
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,025
It must be

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,550
very romantic and wonderful.

42
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,375
Come, have a try.

43
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,400
The blue sky and the white clouds,

44
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,833
It's hard to remember all the words.

45
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:26,925
Pity it's a cloudy day.

46
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,425
Ding,

47
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,121
there's something.

48
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,553
I want to talk to you about.

49
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:13,750
How do you expect me to talk to you,

50
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:17,110
when I'm not even sure of my own feelings.

51
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,050
You're sure.

52
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,775
I thought we were just pretending.

53
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:25,454
But I find out

54
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,101
you've become part of my life.

55
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,850
Each time I'm with you,

56
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,350
I'm seeing how you actually feel.

57
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:34,252
So.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,132
Stop avoiding me, ok?

59
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:38,125
Jiaming,

60
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,825
I'm not as brave as you.

61
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:46,396
I don’t know the consequences.

62
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,475
Especially for my mom.

63
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:50,075
I don't want this to affect her,

64
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:53,975
so we need to pretend well in front of her.

65
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:55,412
Let her accept me.

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
Ok, let’s not talk about this. Let's go.

67
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,175
Ah, auntie.

68
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:12,913
Ying, Junjie went to find you.

69
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:15,000
Find me?

70
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:16,656
In fact,

71
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:17,881
Ah, wait, auntie,

72
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:19,306
you said he came to find me?

73
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,781
Really? When?

74
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,720
Hours ago. What’s wrong?

75
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,305
He's not there?

76
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,200
No.

77
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,131
He said he's going downstairs
to get some groceries.

78
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,256
But he's been out for hours already.

79
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:33,430
His line's busy, I thought…

80
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:40,231
Auntie, he's probably stuck in traffic.

81
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,831
He's here, auntie, don’t worry.

82
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:42,431
I have to go.

83
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:51,850
Wake up,

84
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,450
wake up,

85
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,606
wake up,

86
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:03,431
Zhang Lucy,

87
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:04,956
it's you.

88
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:06,906
Little brother,

89
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:08,656
why are you so surprised?

90
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:10,775
You stole my boyfriend.

91
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,356
It's natural that we get even.

92
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,081
Zhang Lucy.
What are you doing?

93
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:22,052
Ying Jiaming, you're finally answering my calls.

94
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:23,381
What have you done to Ding Junjie?

95
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,106
He's quite safe now.

96
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,131
But I'm not sure for how long.

97
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,356
Don't do anything stupid.

98
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:30,285
I should warn you

99
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:31,199
not to call the police.

100
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,725
Otherwise, I'll die with him.

101
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,256
You're crazy.

102
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,156
Ying Jiaming, this is your last chance.

103
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,131
Me or him?

104
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,506
If you choose me, he dies.

105
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,706
If you choose him, we both die.

106
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:46,506
That's not an option. Where are you?

107
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,323
I sent the address to your WeChat.

108
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:51,281
Don't involve the police, come alone.

109
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,425
Also, I'm not crazy.

110
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:55,731
I'm just a fairy who's crazily in love.

111
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,306
Zhang Lucy,

112
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:27,881
Ah,

113
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,375
why do you sigh?

114
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:33,681
Fool.

115
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:38,231
How dare you call me fool?

116
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:42,706
Wait, what do you mean?

117
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:45,913
Don’t you know it's all an act?

118
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,125
He can't tolerate you,

119
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,056
so he acts that way.

120
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,331
Acting? Impossible.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,816
Why impossible?

122
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:58,306
I just called Ying Jiaming.

123
00:09:58,506 --> 00:09:59,981
I could feel that he's tense.

124
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:03,896
Woman's instinct is always right.

125
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,081
You can't fool me.

126
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:08,831
Unless

127
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,206
he says that he doesn't like you

128
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:11,576
he doesn't love you.

129
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:14,506
Or else I won't believe it.

130
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,106
You're ill.

131
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,381
Director Ying, here is the document…

132
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,906
I don't have the time now.

133
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:29,731
But this document needs your signature.

134
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:30,975
Ding Junjie got into trouble, call 911.

135
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:35,656
It'll only take 10 seconds.

136
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:36,906
Ah.

137
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:34,606
See,

138
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:37,035
You're a man with no chest

139
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:40,056
no hips. I don't see why he likes you.

140
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:41,775
Same with you.

141
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:42,731
Shut up.

142
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:46,031
You're not good-looking, either.

143
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,133
Ying Jiaming’s spouse should be at least

144
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,781
be like me.

145
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:53,206
My personality and looks are better than yours.

146
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,256
There's nothing bad about me.

147
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:47,968
You have the looks, but empty minded.

148
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:49,952
You have the face, but no brains.

149
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,181
Is that a weakness?

150
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:52,881
You…

151
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,006
Zhang Lucy, let Ding Junjie go.

152
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,456
Why? It wasn't easy getting him.

153
00:12:58,306 --> 00:12:58,756
Hold him.

154
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:02,331
What are you doing?

155
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,056
You can

156
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,756
choose him, and we both die.

157
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,331
Or you can choose me,

158
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,481
and tell him that you don't love him.

159
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:12,506
So childish.

160
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:13,906
You won't say it.

161
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,481
Ok, Ding Junjie, I don't love you anymore.

162
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:18,006
Zhang Lucy, let him go.

163
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:20,256
Since you don't love him anymore, come kiss me.

164
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:23,306
Don't push it.

165
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:30,281
I set the rules.

166
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,831
I don't love him, doesn't mean I'll love you.

167
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,406
Can you two stop argu?

168
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:36,831
Go away.

169
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:39,131
I'm not talking to you.

170
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:43,056
See,

171
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,847
and you said you were just acting.
Thought you could fool me?

172
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,181
If this can be tolerated, why not?

173
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:49,931
Zhang Lucy,

174
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:51,931
it's "If this can be tolerated, what can not?"

175
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:53,756
You're driving me crazy, Ying Jiaming.

176
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:55,881
You know how much I love you.

177
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,431
How can you treat me like this?

178
00:13:58,431 --> 00:13:58,856
Since childhood,

179
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:00,625
anything I want

180
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,681
I get it.

181
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:03,731
Only you, Ying Jiaming.

182
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:05,906
I hate you.

183
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:07,900
I hate you so much that

184
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,356
I would break your bones and drink your blood.

185
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,996
How about you kneel down

186
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,127
and let them beat you till I'm satisfied?

187
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,180
Then I'll let you two go.

188
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,975
Jiaming.

189
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,725
Jiaming.

190
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:24,500
Jiaming.
Jiaming.

191
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,225
Zhang Fengxia, stop.

192
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,975
Jiaming.

193
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:39,650
Jiaming.

194
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,875
Help.

195
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,199
Jiaming.

196
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,075
Jiaming, hang in there.

197
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,385
Auntie, the fact is

198
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,090
I failed to protect Ding.

199
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,650
It's not your fault.

200
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,085
It's all hers.

201
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,524
Auntie, the police have taken her in.

202
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,225
Ah,

203
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,275
my son,

204
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:16,156
my son,

205
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,069
You're finally awake.
Mom, where's Jiaming?

206
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,400
Jiaming, Mom, is Jiaming ok?

207
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,230
Son, Ying was seriously injured.

208
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,681
He needs more rest.

209
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:29,750
You should lie down.

210
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,725
Mom, Jiaming saved me, if it wasn't him…

211
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,750
Jiaming, wake up.

212
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,750
Jiaming.

213
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:39,146
Son, lie down.

214
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,779
He's exhausted.

215
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,304
He needs to rest for a while.

216
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:44,749
Don’t disturb him.

217
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:45,915
You should lie down.

218
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,625
Jiaming.

219
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,675
Mom, Jiaming's moving.

220
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,925
Jiaming, Jiaming, wake up.

221
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:06,195
I'm not dead yet, don't cry.

222
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:09,650
You're finally awake.

223
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,738
Thank god you're ok.

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,075
I'm ok. Look at me, I'm fine.

225
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:20,150
Good, good.

226
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,825
I want to sleep some more.

227
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,734
But you need to wake up later.

228
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,035
OK.

229
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,950
You must wake up.

230
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,175
As long as you wake up, I'll do anything.

231
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,375
Deal.

232
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,575
Son, quick, lie down.

233
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,076
OK.

234
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,800
You brat.

235
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:12,024
Ying's injured.

236
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,948
He's top priority now.

237
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,772
Just pour him water, stop rambling.

238
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:17,796
Skin to skin will keep us warm.

239
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,220
Get off.

240
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:20,244
Ying Jiaming.

241
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:21,468
My mom's in the next room.

242
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:22,592
It's late now.

243
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:23,616
Auntie's asleep already.

244
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,940
What are you doing?
