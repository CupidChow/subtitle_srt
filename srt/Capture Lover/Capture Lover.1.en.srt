1
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,625
I am Ding Junjie.

2
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,094
I am 25 years old.

3
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,000
I work hard.

4
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,950
My life is very calm and my work is smooth.

5
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,975
I work hard and concentrate on my career.

6
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,800
My life must not deviate from the right direction.

7
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,325
But,

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,825
I met this boy who was sleeping
in the conference room.

9
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:08,250
That's all for today!

10
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:24,800
Ying Jiaming.

11
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,775
Stop!

12
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,375
Please sit down.

13
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,600
Leader,

14
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,950
Do you have an opinion on me?

15
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:47,300
I have no opinion about you.

16
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:50,725
Why do you sleep during a meeting?

17
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,059
Because I am sleepy today.

18
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,625
This is working time.

19
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,850
But I am very sleepy now.

20
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,350
Ying Jiaming, If everyone imitates you,

21
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,600
then the company would go bankrupt.

22
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,850
Than go bankrupt.

23
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,200
Okay, you can go.

24
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:17,475
OK.

25
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:38,625
Manager Leng,

26
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,950
Vice President Ding, what happened?

27
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,125
Manager Leng, what's wrong with Ying Jiaming?

28
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,600
Why did our HR department recruit him?

29
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,100
He doesn't work, he eats and play
video games during work,

30
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,225
If not, he sleeps during work,

31
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:52,150
He doesn't finish any work.

32
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,879
Vice President Ding,

33
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,350
Just think about the surname
of our chairman.

34
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,175
The chairman？His last name is "Ying".

35
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,800
So, can't you see?

36
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:05,400
Oh...

37
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,025
I see that now.

38
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,575
Listen to me, just let it be.

39
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,625
You and I work for the company,

40
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,675
Ying Jiaming must be the successor
of the company in the future,

41
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:24,025
all we have to do is get along well
with Ying Jiaming.

42
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,050
Now, Do you know what I mean?

43
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,675
Oh my god.

44
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,300
Ying Jiaming,

45
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,167
Ying Jiaming, is this your project?

46
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:10,800
Yes.

47
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,300
You copied the whole project from the internet.

48
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,550
You didn't even change the LOGO.

49
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,050
Is this your work attitude?

50
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,400
Leader,

51
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:23,125
is my working attitude very bad?

52
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,150
At least you know yourself well.

53
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:29,825
Don't laugh.

54
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:31,800
Leader,

55
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,750
please fire me.

56
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,900
Ying Jiaming,

57
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,300
I would really like to fire you.

58
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,950
But you and the chairman are relatives,

59
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:40,300
so I can't decide to fire you.

60
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:44,925
Okay,

61
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm working late tonight, you stay with me.

62
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,125
Leader, you are so over the line.

63
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,650
I have a dated tonight.

64
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,350
You can't ruin my marriage like that.

65
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:57,175
The chairman doesn't care about your marriage,

66
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:58,550
and I don't even care.

67
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,675
No, I can't work late tonight.

68
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:02,675
Fine.

69
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:03,700
File an application to the chairman.

70
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,184
If the chairman agrees,

71
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,475
then I have no objection.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,375
You are so cruel.

73
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,675
Don't raise your fingers.

74
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,975
I will personally supervise your work.

75
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,250
What are you doing?

76
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,050
Locking the door so you won't run away.

77
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,350
Hey, I'm well-mannered!

78
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,800
And I don't go by unspoken rules in the workplace.

79
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,950
What are you doing？.

80
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,950
Redo the project until I am satisfied.

81
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,150
Boss, you are too cruel!

82
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,225
I need to go to the toilet.

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,900
This is for you.

84
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
The mouth of this water bottle is too small.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,125
Don't worry, I also prepared
another water bottle for you.

86
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,675
If you still think this bottle is too small,

87
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,275
then I'd have to check myself.

88
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,000
What?

89
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,325
You are a rogue!

90
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,075
I have to be a rogue to deal with a rascal like you!

91
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,415
If you're not happy,

92
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,100
please go complain to the chairman.

93
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,075
Ding Junjie!

94
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:53,125
Now, I am your leader.

95
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,550
Please don't be lazy at work!

96
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,825
I'm hungry.

97
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,600
I prepared instant noodles for you.

98
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,775
I want to eat seafood.

99
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,975
Do you think I look like seafood?

100
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,950
Don't bargain with me.

101
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,300
I don't wanna eat that.

102
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:07,550
Okay,
Hurry up,

103
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,600
redo the project.

104
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,800
Oh my god!

105
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,675
Ding Junjie, why are you doing this?

106
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,425
Oh?

107
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,575
In order to perform well in front of the chairman,

108
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,475
I strive for better job opportunities for myself.

109
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,875
It's better if I torture you,

110
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,824
I can still get promoted.

111
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,250
You are too superficial.
Yes.

112
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,850
And vulgar.

113
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,650
Exactly.

114
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,650
You will pay for what you did today.

115
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:47,975
I'm looking forward to it.

116
00:08:59,225 --> 00:08:59,800
Please come in!

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,650
Miss Leng, what's wrong?

118
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:07,250
Xiao Ding, why are there so many errors-

119
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:08,925
in this market data sheet?

120
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,500
Miss Leng, this market data sheet was not made by me.

121
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:25,575
Xiao Ding, please don't make excuses
for your mistakes.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,150
You need to think about why something went wrong.

123
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, Miss Leng, I'll modify the
market data table immediately.

124
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,150
Okay.

125
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,225
Oh my god, my eyebrows!

126
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:14,325
What are you doing?

127
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,775
Boss, please have some water, don't be angry!

128
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,250
Take that away.

129
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,600
I realized my mistake.

130
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,850
So, I apologize to you.

131
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:26,775
Please have some water, don't be angry.

132
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:39,775
Is the water good?

133
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,450
How did you realize your mistake?

134
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:47,725
I shouldn't have given you this water.

135
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:52,325
Why?

136
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:53,750
What's wrong with this water?
En…

137
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:57,200
This is from our toilet.

138
00:10:59,125 --> 00:10:59,850
Aha!

139
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,875
I'm sorry, boss.

140
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,450
I really came to apologize to you.

141
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,825
It's not water from the toilet.

142
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,950
On three, get the fuck out.

143
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:17,150
I really came to apologize.

144
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,250
This water is not from the toilet.

145
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:20,050
Three.

146
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,750
In fact, this is really from the toilet.

147
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,150
I was joking with him.

148
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,175
What happened?

149
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,000
Nothing.

150
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,900
Don't look, do your work.

151
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,200
Ding Junjie,

152
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,400
you are too evil!

153
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,300
You drew a turtle on my forehead?

154
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,350
It takes one to know one.

155
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,317
Are you holding grudges against me?

156
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,500
You started it.

157
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,475
We are now the enemy.

158
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,950
I'm not afraid of you!

159
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,850
Ok!

160
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,600
Hey,

161
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,330
that's done with a water-proof marker,

162
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,875
which cannot be washed off.

163
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,600
Ying Jiaming,

164
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:52,624
is the new manager of the company's marketing department.

165
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
I want to be a die-hard fan of Ying Jiaming.

166
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:57,724
Oh my god!

167
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,648
Oops, Xiao Ding Ding!

168
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:02,672
You are so arrogant!

169
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
I have some words for you.

170
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:07,824
Congratulations?

171
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,548
Borrowing power to do evil.

172
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,700
Xiao Ding Ding!
