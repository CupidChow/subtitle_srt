1
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:45,025
Stop crying.

2
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,525
It's the Winter Solstice Festival,

3
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,475
and it's my birthday.

4
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:53,275
Ding, can’t you be a little more enthusiastic?

5
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,925
It’s your birthday?

6
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,125
Yes.

7
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,775
Auntie, when we're at work
Ding always acts like he's the boss.

8
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,025
I've always been so kind to him.

9
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,150
If he still behaves that way,

10
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,925
tell me.

11
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,350
I'll teach him a lesson.

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,825
Oh ya, go to the store and grab two beers

13
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:08,175
to celebrate your colleague’s birthday.

14
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,100
It's too cold. I don’t want to go out.

15
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:11,925
Stop complaining.

16
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,725
Auntie, it's ok, I don't drink.

17
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:15,250
Ah, no, no.

18
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,134
Boy, listen to me.

19
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:20,000
When I tell you to do something, go do it.

20
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:20,850
Quickly.

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,350
Come, Ying, taste my dish.

22
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,575
Here.

23
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,175
I can help myself.

24
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:32,650
OK, help yourself.

25
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:36,875
This is very good.

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,025
Eat more.

27
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,700
Auntie, I'll go with him.

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,325
Ah, ok.

29
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,825
No, the dumplings will get cold.

30
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,025
I'll heat them up.

31
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,175
You have your ways.

32
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,550
Your mom doesn’t seem to hate me.

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,425
You have no shame.

34
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,275
How dare you.

35
00:02:58,425 --> 00:02:59,863
Don’t forget, I was your leader before.

36
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,300
More importantly, I'm the leader at home.

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,000
Ok, ok, ok.

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,450
Once a leader, for life as a leader.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
You're always my leader, happy?

40
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,225
Leader, you cold?

41
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:10,650
Get your hands off.

42
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,200
Try to like me more.

43
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:14,225
Hurry up.

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,925
Mom, stop, you should't drink.

45
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:28,725
Auntie, tell you the truth,

46
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,400
seeing you is like seeing my mom.

47
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,450
Mine passed away when I was very young.

48
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:39,200
Ying, you can see me as your mom.

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,850
You'll have everything Junjie has.

50
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:44,950
I'll see you as my own.

51
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,675
Tell me if anyone bullies you.

52
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,675
See who dares.

53
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,500
Ok, mom.

54
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,625
Cheers.

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,425
Mom, don't drink so much.

56
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,175
Mom, let me pour you some more.

57
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:56,200
Mind your own business.

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,525
Mom, you shouldn't drink.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,875
Mom.

60
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,500
Cheers,

61
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,225
Ying,

62
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,150
though I'm not your biological mom,

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,450
after drinking with you today,

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,775
I think you're a great person.

65
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,200
What are you doing? Stop pouring.

66
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,225
Our Jiaming, oh, no, our Junjie

67
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,500
is good in every aspect

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,550
everything but his temper

69
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:26,825
just like me,

70
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,175
very stubborn.

71
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, too stubborn.

72
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:33,475
Junjie, you should learn from your colleague,

73
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,875
What a good personality

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,675
and great temper.

75
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:38,975
Mom, enough. Stop drinking.

76
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:40,875
What? Stop? No.

77
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,500
Let's drink, mom.

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:42,950
Cheers.
Mom.

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,925
Ying Jiaming, stand up.

80
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,250
Ready to follow orders, my leader.

81
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:49,400
Stop pouring.

82
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:53,100
Ok, mom, let’s stop for today.

83
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,625
Ah, no, we need to drink.

84
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,975
I haven't been so happy in 20 years.

85
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,875
Of course I should drink.

86
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,825
Cheers, one more.

87
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,450
Ying, stay here tonight.

88
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,775
Don't go anywhere.

89
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,800
Mom, don’t worry, I won't leave.

90
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:13,100
Mom. Cheers.

91
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:31,150
Mom, stop drinking.

92
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,355
It’s empty.

93
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,550
You bought too little.

94
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,400
Mom, let's go inside and rest.

95
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,475
Ying, let’s continue tomorrow.

96
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,275
Go to sleep.

97
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,275
I can walk myself.

98
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:44,700
Mom,

99
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,925
you drank too much. You shouldn't drink.

100
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,525
Quickly.

101
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,675
Wake up, go home.

102
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,800
Mom told me to stay here.

103
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,075
Then where would I go?

104
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,750
We can sleep together, it's warmer that way.

105
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Don’t let Ying go, he sleeps here.

106
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:23,975
- You hear me?
- I hear ya.

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,678
See, mom said so.

108
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:28,325
I'm staying here tonight.

109
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:31,075
Ok, mom, I got it.

110
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,550
Keep your hands to yourself.

111
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,550
Don't be too comfortable.

112
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:50,900
Mom, let’s drink some more.

113
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:42,200
Ding Junjie, take your clothes off,

114
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:44,975
and remember to use the blanket.

115
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,275
Go sleep.

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,925
What are you doing?

117
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,400
What the hell?

118
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:58,175
Sleep.

119
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,700
Ying Jiaming.

120
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:01,075
What are you doing?

121
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,775
Quiet, or your mom will wake up.

122
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,950
What on earth do you want?

123
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,350
I've been wanting to kiss you forever.

124
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:46,200
It's like I'm possessed.

125
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:47,975
I like your family.

126
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,450
Handing out with your friends.

127
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:52,950
I even dream of you.

128
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,300
In the beginning, I thought

129
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,175
it's because I've been single for too long.

130
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,450
Later, I found that.

131
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,875
I actually cared for you.

132
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,375
I couldn't say what attracted me.

133
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,825
I just like your confidence,

134
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,050
and your unyielding spirit.

135
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,100
You know how hard it's been for me these days?

136
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,075
I'd be in a bad mood,

137
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,825
if I don’t see you at work.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
My whole day would be ruined.

139
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:23,075
I just want to see you,

140
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:24,425
and kiss you.

141
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
I want to ask you why you've been ignoring me.

142
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,825
But when I see you,

143
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,150
my heart is softened.

144
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,675
But, we're men.

145
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,875
It's ok, just by telling you I feel much better.

146
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,150
I won't force you to feel the same.

147
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,050
Let's act like how we were before, ok?

148
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,825
Hello?

149
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:02,700
Hello,

150
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,200
Junjie, I think a thief came by my house.

151
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,450
What?

152
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,575
Come quickly.

153
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,875
Ok, be there soon.

154
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,600
Ok, hurry up.

155
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,625
Where are you going at this hour?

156
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,450
Mengyao had a break in, I need to go over.

157
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,575
I'll go with you.

158
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,241
You drank too much lsat night,

159
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:24,300
you should rest.

160
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:25,800
I don't want you to go alone.

161
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,400
I'll go with you.

162
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,123
I came as soon as I heard.

163
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:34,675
How's everything? Are you hurt?

164
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:36,275
No, I'm fine.

165
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,275
No one's here when I got here.

166
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,575
Anything stolen?

167
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:42,725
No.

168
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:44,950
I called the police.

169
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,670
The police will file a report for you.

170
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:49,525
Junjie, let’s go.

171
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:51,275
Junjie,

172
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,075
Junjie, I'm a little scared.

173
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,550
Can you stay with me?

174
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,100
No.

175
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Ding Junkai, today is my birthday.

176
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,475
Junjie, please.

177
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,450
Jiaming, you go home first.

178
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:15,925
Ok.

179
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,550
Jinjie, you've changed.

180
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:40,750
Oh?

181
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:45,000
You used to do anything I please,

182
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,525
no matter what it is.

183
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,250
But

184
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,855
recently,

185
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,400
your attitude has changed.

186
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,400
Have you fallen in love with someone else?

187
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,100
I don’t know.

188
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,325
You know.

189
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,100
But you don't admit it.

190
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,575
You're hesitating again.

191
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,925
It's.

192
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:24,875
Ying Jiaming, right?

193
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:25,950
No,

194
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,450
nonsense.

195
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,600
You said that

196
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,050
you'd never lie to me.

197
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,050
Mengyao.

198
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:51,900
Some things

199
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,150
even I don't know myself.

200
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,025
Believe me,

201
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,625
I don't know how to explain it to you.

202
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Deep down, you know.

203
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,525
Be honest with yourself.

204
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,975
Actually,

205
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,437
I'm not forcing you to give me a reason.

206
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,700
It has always been me chasing after you.

207
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,675
I told you, Junjie,

208
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,800
if some day you like someone else,

209
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,975
tell me.

210
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,975
That person must be better than me.

211
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,900
Ying Jiaming is good, very good.

212
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,125
From today on,

213
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,885
I'll no longer bother you.

214
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,175
The happiness from the past ten years,

215
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,912
can last me a life time.

216
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,925
Today, I'll return the happiness to you.

217
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:12,925
Believe me,

218
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:16,825
I'll always support you

219
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,650
no matter what gender you fall in love with.

220
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,700
True love shouldn't have any boundary.

221
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,850
Mengyao, thank you.

222
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:31,775
What are you thanking me for?

223
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,525
In my heart,

224
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,875
you're always the best Ding Junjie.

225
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:42,407
In my heart,
you're always the best Mengyao as well.

226
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,175
Leader,

227
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,500
I sincerely invite you to go out with me.

228
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:14,825
Ah, Ding, please agree to my invitation.

229
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,150
You promised before, go out with me.

230
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,150
Ding, this month,

231
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,175
Oh my god.

232
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,275
Sorry for interrupting.

233
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,600
Go away.

234
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:31,475
Fine.

235
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:36,725
OK, that’s a date.

236
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,100
Zhang Lucy.

237
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,124
What are you doing?

238
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:07,048
What have you done to Ding Junjie?

239
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,372
You stole my boyfriend.

240
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,896
It's natural that we get even.

241
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,220
Director Ying, here is the document…

242
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:15,944
I don't have the time now.

243
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,900
But this document needs your signature.

244
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:20,424
Ding Junjie got into trouble, call 911.

245
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
You have the looks, but empty minded.

246
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:28,624
You have the face, but no brains.

247
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,648
Is that a weakness?

248
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:31,572
You…
