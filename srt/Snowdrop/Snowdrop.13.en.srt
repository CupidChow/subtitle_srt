EPISODE 13

3
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,927
I'll go in first.

4
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:17,432
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.
Then come in through the shrine.

5
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:19,851
We must kill him.

6
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:22,437
Understood, sir.

7
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,744
Captain, kill them all
when I give the order to shoot.

8
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:41,497
You're an expert marksman,
so I trust you not to miss any of them.

9
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,667
You must get rid of them
without getting caught.

10
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:49,631
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take out anything that moves.

11
00:01:58,264 --> 00:01:59,140
I'm back, sir.

12
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:04,354
He's still the director of the ANSP.
Will it be okay?

13
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:08,775
Hui-jun, I'm doing this

14
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:10,944
for our country and people.

15
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:13,446
He only cares about saving his daughter.

16
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:15,865
We can't leave our fate to him.

17
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:17,951
If the election scheme succeeds,

18
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,412
I'll make you a member of Dongsim Society.

19
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:26,000
You must climb the ladder

20
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:29,254
to help me become
the presidential candidate.

21
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:32,882
The moment I entered the Military Academy,

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,635
I swore to serve you, Tae-il.

23
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:38,096
Good.

24
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:03,663
Yeong-ro.

25
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:20,555
Dad.

26
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,473
Yes?

27
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:28,604
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

28
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,523
Of course not.

29
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:36,571
-Who told you that? That's absurd.
-Please stop it.

30
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,241
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

31
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:43,077
What are you talking about?
I really want to save you.

32
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:46,247
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

33
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,875
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

34
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,088
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:55,465
No, it's not.

36
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:57,967
-Why do you think that way?
-Don't move.

37
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,095
And my brother…

38
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,432
Yeong-u…

39
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,728
died because of me.

40
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:15,902
If my friends die too,

41
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:17,820
I won't be able to…

42
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:18,863
Yeong-ro.

43
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,323
Please…

44
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:24,619
I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

45
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:25,703
Don't move!

46
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:38,591
Yeong-ro!

47
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:48,518
No!

48
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,694
Were you only going to save me?

49
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:03,574
You were going to kill him
and all my friends inside, weren't you?

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,327
What? What the hell is she doing?

51
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:08,746
Yeong-ro.

52
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,333
Your brother asked me to protect you.

53
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,545
While drawing his last breath,

54
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,428
Yeong-u asked me to keep you safe.

55
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,143
I want to save you first
because you're my daughter.

56
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,397
Can't you understand that?

57
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:44,115
Open fire!

58
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:53,082
<i>What was that? Are they going in
without telling me?</i>

59
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,876
Damn it. Follow me.

60
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,544
Hey, Woo! Follow me with the camera!

61
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:57,753
-Hurry! Block the rest!
-What?

62
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,130
Hurry up!

63
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:00,506
-You, with me!
-Wait.

64
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,049
What about us?

65
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:05,428
Come in!

66
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,346
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

67
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,306
Move back!

68
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,640
Don't shoot!

69
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:14,604
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

70
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:17,064
Who the hell is shooting?

71
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:23,905
Yeong-ro.

72
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:25,490
Yeong-ro.

73
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:27,283
It's all right.

74
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:29,035
It's okay.

75
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:30,244
You're safe.

76
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,294
Hold fire!

77
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:41,297
Kill him.

78
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,133
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

79
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,984
Mr. Eun!

80
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,528
Mr. Eun!

81
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:06,197
-Mr. Eun.
-They brought a reporter.

82
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,367
Mr. Eun!

83
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,662
Move aside. Mr. Eun!

84
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:14,789
Damn it!

85
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:16,040
We need a medical team.

86
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:17,375
-Bring a stretcher!
-I repeat!

87
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,709
-Hurry!
-The director's down.

88
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:20,169
-Mr. Eun's unconscious!
-Hurry up.

89
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,462
Move faster!

90
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,363
I was worried
something had happened to you.

91
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,615
I was quite scared.

92
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,951
We're all going to die in a week anyway.

93
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,202
We're all going to die?

94
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,204
Watch what you say.

95
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,581
Shut your own mouth.

96
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:59,500
You're a warrior of our great Republic,

97
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:01,919
and you beg your enemy for your life?

98
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:12,805
And a romance
with the ANSP director's daughter?

99
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,725
Just for that,
you should be shot to death.

100
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:21,981
<i>The ANSP director's daughter?</i>

101
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:23,649
<i>Yeong-ro?</i>

102
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,736
Eung-cheol.

103
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:32,617
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

104
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,785
Search the room for lanterns.

105
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:37,079
They'll cut off the power
before breaking in.

106
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:39,749
If they come in, I'll defend the basement.

107
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:46,213
By yourself?

108
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,344
Untie me.

109
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:54,555
You're not telling me to die
by enemy hands tied up like this, are you?

110
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,931
You can't, Comrade Lim.

111
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:59,477
If we untie him,
he'll try to kill you first.

112
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:04,565
If the power is cut off,
come up to the second floor with him.

113
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,109
Understood.

114
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:27,463
What do I do? I have to find
a way out before they break in.

115
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:35,554
That damn wench. What a sly minx.

116
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,350
She's been pretending to be
a rice cake shop's daughter all this time?

117
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:44,730
The daughter of the ANSP director
who might kill us all…

118
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:49,652
Hold on.

119
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:53,322
What if I use that fact to my advantage?

120
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,038
The radio.

121
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,082
I should find it first.

122
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:09,338
Why aren't you saluting me? Huh?

123
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,133
How's Eun?

124
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:15,386
The wound is severe, so they'll know
for sure after the surgery.

125
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:16,387
So?

126
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,181
Is he going to make it or not?

127
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,393
The best surgeon in Korea
is doing the surgery.

128
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:23,936
I'm sure he'll make it.

129
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:28,023
"What happened?"

130
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,152
The reporters keep asking me that.
What should I--

131
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:32,528
Are you seriously asking?

132
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,697
He tried to go in to save his daughter…

133
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,409
and those damn spies got him.

134
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:42,079
Lim Soo-ho shot him? In front of Yeong-ro?

135
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,208
I mean, last time--

136
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:51,297
Listen, you bastard.
Don't you know he's an armed Northern spy?

137
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,175
You saw how frantically he provoked us.

138
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:55,885
You still think he wouldn't do it?

139
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:59,096
Understood, sir. I'll tell the reporters
that's what happened.

140
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:07,897
<i>If people think Eun got shot trying to
negotiate with them to save the hostages,</i>

141
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,566
<i>he will be hailed as a hero, again.</i>

142
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,109
Damn it.

143
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,205
Hello?

144
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:26,665
Hello, doctor. How are you?

145
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:30,795
He's been shot?

146
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:32,797
How is he?

147
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,843
You must save him. Please.

148
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:39,637
Okay. I'll be right over.

149
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,728
It was supposed to be a put-up job.

150
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:52,107
But they shot the ANSP director?

151
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,236
<i>MBS breaking news.</i>

152
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,864
<i>Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies</i>

153
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,699
<i>near the Hosu University dorm.</i>

154
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:02,201
<i>In an unprecedented turn of events,</i>

155
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:05,120
<i>two SWAT team members
were killed at the scene.</i>

156
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:08,624
<i>We'll hear from our reporter
on the scene for further details.</i>

157
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,293
<i>-Reporter Wi?</i>
-Those goddamn bastards…

158
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,837
What's going on?

159
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,256
That's a lie. Don't believe what they say.

160
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,967
There are people
killed or hurt, but you didn't shoot?

161
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,427
Are you saying it was friendly fire then?

162
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,977
The last thing we want is to make the
public angrier. Why would we shoot them?

163
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,688
Until we figure out what's going on,

164
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:33,607
you should all stay
in the prayer room. Now.

165
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:38,028
Get up, everyone. Let's go. Now.

166
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:46,287
Yeong-ro failed
to convince her father, didn't she?

167
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,795
Anyway, who shot them?
You must have a hunch.

168
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,339
My hunch is

169
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:01,302
that Eun Chang-su is opposing using force
because of Yeong-ro,

170
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:04,221
so they took the opportunity
to get rid of him.

171
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,307
If that's true,

172
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:09,476
they won't hesitate to kill the students.

173
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,275
Go to the prayer room.

174
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,961
Right. To the prayer room…

175
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:38,380
The prayer room.

176
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,608
No!

177
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:35,688
It's all right.

178
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,150
No one's going to die.

179
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:43,862
Don't worry.

180
00:14:58,752 --> 00:14:59,878
I apologize, sir.

181
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,714
I tried so hard to stop him,

182
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:03,757
but he went to get his daughter out, and…

183
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:05,884
How dare they shoot my right-hand man!

184
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:09,513
They're just pawns. They wouldn't
have done it without the North's orders!

185
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:10,806
That's not true, sir.

186
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,225
Since they found out
the North was trying to kill them,

187
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:15,519
they've been disobeying
their country's orders.

188
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:16,520
<i>Disobeying?</i>

189
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:21,900
They sent such idiots to carry out
this crucial scheme that will decide

190
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:23,277
our country's fate?

191
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,947
Go and kill those
commie bastards yourself right now!

192
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:28,741
I will, sir!

193
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,452
I will go in and kill them myself tonight!

194
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,078
Don't worry a thing, sir!

195
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:34,371
I swear on my life--

196
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,800
<i>God damn it. Since when
was Eun Chang-su his right-hand man?</i>

197
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:49,511
<i>Didn't he say
he wanted to watch the Olympics with me?</i>

198
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,265
Will it be okay if the hostage situation
doesn't last until the election?

199
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,311
We have the upper hand now.

200
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,354
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,482
We'll take them out secretly and quickly.

202
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:05,652
Prepare two teams of the most
loyal guys with good combat skills.

203
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:07,613
Then cut off the power.

204
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:10,616
We will go retake the dorm in ten minutes.

205
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:12,910
Yes, sir.

206
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,513
KANG CHEONG-YA
DOCTOR

207
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,230
<i>Seriously wounded, the ANSP director
is being taken to the hospital.</i>

208
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:45,818
<i>And two SWAT team members were killed.
It's such a brutal tragedy.</i>

209
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,402
Who did such a horrible thing?

210
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:48,946
It must be Nam Tae-il.

211
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,198
Nam Tae-il?

212
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:53,450
They both aspire
to presidential candidacy.

213
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:57,871
Tae-il has been keeping an eye
on Eun for a long time.

214
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:01,083
Hold on.

215
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,085
<i>Well,</i>

216
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:07,673
<i>we have been trying
to resolve this situation peacefully.</i>

217
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:10,843
<i>However, this incident triggered
public anger,</i>

218
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:12,803
<i>and we have decided</i>

219
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,471
<i>we can no longer ignore it.</i>

220
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,723
<i>Therefore, the ANSP is declaring</i>

221
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,267
<i>that as of this moment,</i>

222
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,936
<i>we will take a hard line without mercy.</i>

223
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:25,399
<i>Fellow citizens, we will not let them
have their way anymore.</i>

224
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:27,484
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

225
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:29,862
They're making up

226
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:34,283
a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

227
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:37,327
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

228
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:38,620
Right?

229
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,122
That's obvious.

230
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:44,084
The hostages know
this is their election scheme.

231
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:48,213
On top of that, you and Gang-mu
are working together to ruin it.

232
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:54,052
Now Tae-il has no reason to wait
until the election to end this situation.

233
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:55,637
Then…

234
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,681
will it be tonight?

235
00:17:57,764 --> 00:17:59,766
We should get ready to fight right now.

236
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:05,355
Now that Eun's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

237
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:36,970
To the library?

238
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:39,389
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

239
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:41,308
What do we do now?

240
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,602
Stop the nonsense and find your mask!

241
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,562
Hurry! They're going
to raid this place soon.

242
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,814
Really?

243
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,484
Two cops were killed,
and the ANSP director was shot.

244
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:53,320
What?

245
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,447
He was shot?

246
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,407
Why are you so surprised?
You heard gunfire.

247
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:02,579
Yeong-ro, what are you doing?
Find your mask and lantern!

248
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:04,790
Hurry up!
We have to go to the library asap!

249
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,213
Yeong-ro!

250
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,350
<i>After the incident,
Director Eun of the ANSP</i>

251
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:27,437
<i>was taken to Hankuk Central Medical Center
and is in surgery as we speak.</i>

252
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:29,606
<i>According to the medical staff, the bullet</i>

253
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,192
<i>missed the aorta,
which prevented immediate death.</i>

254
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:34,569
<i>They say they will know for sure
after the surgery</i>

255
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,990
<i>and are not sure yet
if the surgery is going well.</i>

256
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:40,492
<i>Meanwhile, some are worried</i>

257
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:43,745
<i>that Director Eun might end up
in critical condition</i>

258
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,831
<i>even if the surgery goes well.</i>

259
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>By the looks of it, he might be
unconscious and on a ventilator--</i>

260
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:45,390
I told you to move in lines!

261
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:47,601
Move in lines!

262
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:49,936
Move in lines!

263
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:53,482
Are you okay?

264
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,817
My dad…

265
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,028
How did my dad get shot?

266
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,156
Go stay in the library. Now!

267
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,574
Take Yeong-ro with you.

268
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,034
Let's go, Yeong-ro.

269
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:12,751
Hey! Seol-hui! Here!

270
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:15,879
-Seol-hui!
-Gwang-tae!

271
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:20,175
Listen carefully.
We can't stay here and get killed.

272
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:23,470
It's better to escape here
and cooperate with the ANSP.

273
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:26,056
He's right. We can't trust these guys.

274
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:27,849
They might blow themselves up!

275
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,773
Hurry up, Hye-ryeong!

276
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,191
Come on!

277
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:38,860
This is crazy!

278
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:44,449
No. That's too dangerous.

279
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:47,953
Is there any way to ward them off
other than this?

280
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:50,747
Since Eun is seriously injured,

281
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,375
Nam must be leading the operation.

282
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,461
It's worth a shot if it's Nam.

283
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,797
If this is one of your tricks,
you better stop.

284
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:02,300
Because I'll be right behind you
pointing my gun at you.

285
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:04,761
Hurry up. Time is running out.

286
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:24,823
As you know, the armed spies are occupying
the Hosu University dorm.

287
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:27,409
The first goal of this operation

288
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:31,580
is to kill the Northern spies
and everyone helping them.

289
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,040
And the second goal

290
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,918
is to rescue Dr. Kang.

291
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:37,961
If possible,

292
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,422
we'll rescue Dr. Kang.

293
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:43,341
Everyone here? Is anyone missing?

294
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,135
Hye-ryeong and Seol-hui are not here.

295
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:49,014
Gwang-tae and Byeong-tae
aren't here either.

296
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:51,475
Those damn brats.

297
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:54,728
Wait. What if they're trying
to sneak away by themselves?

298
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:57,230
Everyone wait here.

299
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,484
-Where are you going?
-I need to go to the cafeteria.

300
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,486
Come on, Ms. Oh.

301
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:06,656
Walk slowly.

302
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:10,619
Slowly!

303
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:12,954
Comrade Joo!

304
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,165
Comrade Joo!

305
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:31,515
Eung-cheol.

306
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,444
If he attacks you again,

307
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:46,780
don't hesitate to shoot him.

308
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:51,159
I will. I will put a hole in his head.

309
00:23:54,496 --> 00:23:55,455
Go up.

310
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,570
Yeong-ro!

311
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:41,167
Hey!

312
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:48,425
No! Don't shoot!

313
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,386
I passed the Civil Service Exam for--

314
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:53,471
Get down!

315
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:57,517
Get out!

316
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:15,785
Get out now!

317
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:44,981
Come on!

318
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,524
Hurry up! Come on!

319
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:47,919
It's clear, sir.

320
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,391
We'll proceed with the operation.

321
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,476
We're going in.

322
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:27,751
Room 202, clear.

323
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:28,835
No targets found.

324
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:31,504
<i>Lounge, clear. No targets found.</i>

325
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,928
Forward!

326
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:57,238
Don't shoot!

327
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:04,329
I'm Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
from Hankuk Central Medical Center.

328
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:07,373
Please help.

329
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,001
Dr. Kang! I'm Nam Tae-il!

330
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,711
Where are you?

331
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:14,631
Come on out, ma'am! We'll protect you!

332
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:29,187
She's there! All units, hold!

333
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,315
Hold! Stay where you are!

334
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:37,654
If you don't stop the operation,

335
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:40,156
I can't guarantee Dr. Kang's safety!

336
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,620
We don't mind blowing ourselves up.

337
00:28:46,704 --> 00:28:48,248
M1 dynamite

338
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:50,834
is strapped to her body.

339
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:53,878
If you don't leave on the count of ten,

340
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:57,757
we're all going to die here.

341
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:00,677
That goddamn bastard!

342
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,594
One!

343
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:04,514
Help!

344
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:08,351
-Damn it!
-Two!

345
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,812
I visually confirm
at least ten sticks of dynamite!

346
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:13,731
We can't retake the dorm
in this situation!

347
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:22,448
Three!

348
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:23,616
Move aside.

349
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:26,327
Sir! It's dangerous!

350
00:29:33,543 --> 00:29:34,919
Wait, sir!

351
00:29:36,504 --> 00:29:37,630
Cheong-ya.

352
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:40,133
Please. Please don't come any closer.

353
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,135
Please.

354
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,787
God, it burns.

355
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,207
Five!

356
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,459
I'll save you

357
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:16,794
at all costs.

358
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:20,006
So hang in-- Damn it!

359
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,549
Sir.

360
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,765
Please…

361
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:31,935
Leave now. Please…

362
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:34,312
Sir.

363
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:36,105
Please…

364
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:44,447
Seven!

365
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:57,919
Abort the mission!

366
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:03,591
All units, retreat!

367
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:05,843
Eight!

368
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:09,847
I told you, we're retreating right now!
You're just rats in a trap!

369
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:12,016
Let go of me!

370
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,893
I'll make sure to come back!

371
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:17,438
I will come back
and blow your heads off, you bastards!

372
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,608
Retreat!

373
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:22,360
Retreat!

374
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:24,946
All units, retreat!

375
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:27,240
Sir! Put on your mask!

376
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:30,034
Abort the mission! Retreat!

377
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:32,537
Abort the mission!

378
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:35,540
Retreat!

379
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:12,785
You jerk! You're such an idiot!

380
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,954
You coward!

381
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,040
Why did you do something so stupid?

382
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:20,084
If it weren't for Soo-ho,
you would've all been killed!

383
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:25,173
It's really true
they're trying to kill us all!

384
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:30,303
Quiet!

385
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:34,390
They've all retreated!

386
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:35,975
Go wash up now!

387
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,018
Hurry up!

388
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:45,818
Eung-cheol, lock Comrade Joo and Ms. Oh
in the basement.

389
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:48,404
Okay.

390
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:54,368
<i>It's been confirmed that Director Eun, who
was taken to the hospital and had surgery,</i>

391
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:57,163
<i>is in critical condition at the moment.</i>

392
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:58,873
<i>Director Eun was injured</i>

393
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:01,959
<i>while trying to rescue
the hostages himself,</i>

394
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:06,005
<i>so many citizens are praying
that he get better soon--</i>

395
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:10,343
Mr. Choi.

396
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:11,761
Yes, ma'am?

397
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:16,140
Was it really the spies that shot him?

398
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:19,977
Pardon? I'm not sure what you're asking.

399
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:25,608
Isn't this an election scheme?

400
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:30,029
The North and South planned
this hostage situation together.

401
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:35,743
But the mere pawns dared to shoot
the director of the ANSP?

402
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:39,330
It doesn't make sense.

403
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:44,252
Well, that's true.

404
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:51,134
But Mr. Eun went in to save his daughter,
and the spies--

405
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:54,595
I can't wrap my head
around this situation.

406
00:33:57,431 --> 00:34:01,894
Your boss has been shot, Mr. Choi.

407
00:34:03,187 --> 00:34:05,148
But you don't have any doubts about it?

408
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,282
<i>Confronting their frantic provocation,</i>

409
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:16,492
<i>we tried to take them down using force,</i>

410
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:21,330
<i>but the spies
strapped bombs to all 34 hostages.</i>

411
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:25,376
<i>So we had no choice but to
regretfully retreat for their safety.</i>

412
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:27,670
<i>The bombs they have</i>

413
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:31,007
<i>are too many for this hostage-taking</i>

414
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,925
<i>to have been accidental…</i>

415
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:37,263
The bombs we have are too many?

416
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:40,266
So this is how these bastards
are covering it up?

417
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:44,687
How's Mr. Eun?

418
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,439
They said the surgery went well,

419
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:48,691
but he's still unconscious.

420
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:51,402
Keep monitoring him. And Han-na,

421
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:54,780
<i>stay safe. Over and out.</i>

422
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:06,334
Eun is still not conscious.

423
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,878
Before Eun Chang-su comes around,

424
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:12,340
Nam Tae-il will desperately
try to end this hostage situation.

425
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:14,425
To make a great contribution

426
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,720
and make up
for trying to kill Eun Chang-su.

427
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:23,100
Bombs strapped to the hostages
and too many bombs…

428
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:25,061
Seeing how they're lying,

429
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:28,773
I think they're planning
to set off the bombs around the dorm.

430
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:31,734
We must let the press know

431
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:34,737
that they're going to blow up the dorm.

432
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,365
But that's not going to save us.

433
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:43,579
We must cut off their money.

434
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:49,919
If we do that, both the South and
the North won't be able to kill us rashly.

435
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:55,049
You mean the money
the South is going to send the North?

436
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:02,598
If we can get our hands
on that huge amount of money…

437
00:36:03,516 --> 00:36:06,060
We might be able
to make a deal with Lim Ji-rok,

438
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,895
who wants us dead.

439
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:10,481
That's right.

440
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:14,694
Then we will have the upper hand
in this damn game.

441
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:16,487
But how on earth

442
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:19,198
will we cut off the money?

443
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:25,288
I will go out there
and intercept the money.

444
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:32,586
Look, doctor.

445
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:37,466
You're talking absolute nonsense.
You know that, right?

446
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,596
An Gyeong-hui is the Chief of the OPC
and in charge of the money.

447
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,098
And you'll take it from him?

448
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:47,977
As you all know,

449
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:52,857
I can find out
Nam Tae-il's real intentions if I want.

450
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:58,446
He's the ruling party's secretary-general
and the former ANSP director.

451
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:04,493
I'm sure he knows inside out how much
is supposed to be paid to the North

452
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:06,162
and how it's managed.

453
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,501
Besides, An's wife and I are acquainted.

454
00:37:14,712 --> 00:37:18,215
But will it be enough to make it work?

455
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:21,552
An's wife is quite easy to handle

456
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:24,805
because she's very greedy.

457
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,016
And she has a head for managing money,

458
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,144
so she has complete control
over her husband when it comes to money.

459
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,897
That's true. An made quite big money

460
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,816
by using the ANSP's
secret fund as his wife said.

461
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,778
I heard him boasting about it.

462
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:46,035
I'll go out and intercept the money.

463
00:37:47,244 --> 00:37:49,622
As long as the money is our possession,

464
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:52,083
they can never set off the bombs.

465
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:57,213
Can I have a word?

466
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:10,142
I found it weird when she suggested the
dynamite bit. This is what she was after.

467
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,312
Can't you see what she's up to?

468
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,314
She wants to get out of here.

469
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:19,402
If that was her goal,
she would've told Nam Tae-il.

470
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:23,447
That the dynamite
and detonator were dummies.

471
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:28,411
Then they would've killed
all the hostages who know she's a spy.

472
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:31,914
She helped us instead,
but you're suspecting her?

473
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:34,834
Fine.

474
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:40,256
Let's say I'm convinced and we trust her.

475
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:45,094
How will she intercept that huge money?
You think it's even possible?

476
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,642
Don't underestimate what she's capable of.

477
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,605
All right, fine.

478
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,900
Let's say
our great Comrade Kang intercepts

479
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:01,986
that large amount of money.

480
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,363
She's coming back here with it?

481
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:06,282
Do you believe that?

482
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:08,701
Or are you pretending to?

483
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,664
Whichever the case,

484
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:16,876
do you have any other plan?

485
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,169
As soon as she gets out--

486
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:21,630
As soon as she gets out of here,
they'll blow the dorm up.

487
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:26,969
We'll stop Nam from doing that.

488
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:30,014
How?

489
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:32,141
How will you?

490
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:36,687
Tell Eun's wife that Nam's the one

491
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:40,024
who got Eun shot right now.

492
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,402
And that he's planning
to blow up this dorm.

493
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,362
She'll stop it since her daughter's here.

494
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:51,744
As you say,

495
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:56,165
even if Kang doesn't come back here,

496
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,211
I have no choice but to bet on this plan.

497
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:04,423
If we do nothing,
we have no chance of getting out alive.

498
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:08,719
But with this plan,
we have a 50-50 chance.

499
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:13,057
So we have

500
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:15,976
a 50-50 chance?

501
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:23,609
Fine.

502
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:28,364
Han-na.

503
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:30,115
Han-na, do you copy?

504
00:40:30,783 --> 00:40:33,327
Tell Director Eun's wife this right away.

505
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:36,539
VIP WARD

506
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,432
Excuse me.

507
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:57,184
How can I get to the VIP ward?

508
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:59,853
-The VIP ward?
-You're looking for the VIP ward?

509
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,438
Director Eun of the ANSP, right?

510
00:41:02,189 --> 00:41:03,649
-I'll tell her.
-Yes, doctor.

511
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:05,484
Doctor.

512
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:09,697
How is the director doing?
He'll wake up soon, right?

513
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:12,408
Of course. Don't worry too much.

514
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:17,079
Oh, right. Could you give this
to his wife for me?

515
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:18,622
She asked for it.

516
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:20,291
Sure.

517
00:41:24,086 --> 00:41:25,045
She said I did?

518
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,171
Yes.

519
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,519
<i>I have something to tell you
about how Mr. Eun was shot.</i>

520
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:43,814
<i>I'll be waiting
in the ladies' room downstairs.</i>

521
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,304
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

522
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:19,516
-Let's go to the camp.
-Yes, ma'am.

523
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:24,688
My emergency frequency is 3-8.

524
00:42:26,273 --> 00:42:28,776
Let me know as soon as you get the money.

525
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:31,779
I'll distract them

526
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,907
to help you come back in safely.

527
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:39,870
Didn't you tell me
to leave for another country?

528
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:43,248
And now you're making sure I come back?

529
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:45,459
To be honest,

530
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:48,379
I still hope

531
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:51,298
you'll stop being used like me…

532
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,469
and leave for another country

533
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:59,264
to live a happy life.

534
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,271
But you need to come back

535
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:09,316
for the hostages,

536
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,485
my comrades,

537
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:15,781
and my sister Su-hui to live.

538
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:20,369
Are you

539
00:43:21,704 --> 00:43:23,414
scared that I might…

540
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,420
not come back?

541
00:43:36,844 --> 00:43:38,220
Then give me…

542
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:43,308
a reason I must

543
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,729
come back.

544
00:43:50,315 --> 00:43:51,567
For instance,

545
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:57,114
"If you come back with the money,

546
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:06,457
I will leave with you to another country."

547
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:12,838
Of course,
I'll be betraying my country then.

548
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:18,886
But if I can leave with you…

549
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:38,071
Eun's wife is already moving.

550
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,119
You should get ready.

551
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,092
Think carefully.

552
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:02,262
This is

553
00:45:03,555 --> 00:45:07,017
the only way you'll live.

554
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:10,479
<i>Dr. Kang first!</i>

555
00:45:10,562 --> 00:45:12,356
We must save Dr. Kang first, okay?

556
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:13,398
-Salute!
-Salute!

557
00:45:13,482 --> 00:45:14,608
Understand, you bastard?

558
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:15,943
-Ma'am!
-What?

559
00:45:24,952 --> 00:45:26,578
What are you doing here?

560
00:45:26,662 --> 00:45:28,747
Are you insane?
Why'd you come here at this hour?

561
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:35,546
Ms. Hong told me to come here
without telling me why.

562
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:37,756
She practically threatened me

563
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,259
saying she'd run over
to the First Lady if I didn't.

564
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:43,470
What? Eun's wife really did that?

565
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:44,596
-Salute!
-Salute!

566
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:46,431
Mr. Nam.

567
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:02,072
Hello, ma'am!

568
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,376
Give us some privacy.

569
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:17,296
Get out, guys.

570
00:46:21,884 --> 00:46:23,594
-Mr. An.
-Yes?

571
00:46:24,553 --> 00:46:27,973
Do you have any beer here by any chance?
I'm quite thirsty.

572
00:46:58,587 --> 00:47:01,131
You should really know your place, woman!

573
00:47:01,214 --> 00:47:05,302
If you want to be the leader of the wives,
you should do it properly!

574
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,766
So this is what they call
a bolt from the blue.

575
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:13,727
Ms. Hong, what the hell are you doing?

576
00:47:25,364 --> 00:47:28,408
You heard my husband would become
the president if 13 people died.

577
00:47:29,117 --> 00:47:30,619
So did you encourage your husband

578
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,913
to kill my husband?

579
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:36,792
What? Are you out of your mind?

580
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:39,544
Have you gone insane?

581
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:40,587
My goodness.

582
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:44,633
Since your husband, who's aspiring

583
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:48,887
to become the president, is in critical
condition, you must've lost reason.

584
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:50,847
Get it together

585
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:52,641
and go home, please.

586
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:03,068
So you're playing innocent?

587
00:48:03,777 --> 00:48:05,862
As soon as I tell the First Lady,

588
00:48:05,946 --> 00:48:08,281
everyone around you will be questioned

589
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:10,993
and evidence will turn up.

590
00:48:11,451 --> 00:48:12,828
Will you be okay?

591
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:20,877
Oh, my God.

592
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:25,257
Hey, do you call this
delusion or paranoia?

593
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:31,972
You betrayed your commander
who'd saved your life three times.

594
00:48:32,055 --> 00:48:34,808
And joining in the President's coup,

595
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:37,269
the First Lady hates you for it.

596
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:43,608
God, it's come again.

597
00:48:43,692 --> 00:48:46,361
Even though
my husband didn't join the coup,

598
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:49,656
he stayed loyal to his superior
until the end.

599
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,743
So the First Lady recommended him
to the President repeatedly.

600
00:48:52,826 --> 00:48:55,037
You know that, right?

601
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:57,372
If she finds out

602
00:48:58,915 --> 00:49:00,417
my husband was

603
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:02,335
in fact shot

604
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:05,964
by some vicious insider,
and not by the Northern spies,

605
00:49:06,048 --> 00:49:08,925
how do you think
the First Lady will react?

606
00:49:10,343 --> 00:49:13,680
"Once a mongrel, always a mongrel"

607
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:15,807
is a philosophy she lives by.

608
00:49:19,686 --> 00:49:20,645
Why don't you

609
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:24,691
go tell her if you have time for this?

610
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:27,319
For Code 1

611
00:49:27,402 --> 00:49:31,698
and the First Lady, our party's winning
the election is the most important thing.

612
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:37,662
So that they can
keep playing at King and Queen.

613
00:49:38,705 --> 00:49:40,248
That's right! Absolutely!

614
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:41,416
Of course.

615
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:44,586
The election is in seven days now.

616
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:48,173
You think they'll side with Eun,
who's useless?

617
00:49:48,256 --> 00:49:50,092
Those people need me,

618
00:49:50,175 --> 00:49:52,886
someone who'll wrap up
the election scheme successfully.

619
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:55,722
They need me! No matter what I've done!

620
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:58,308
-Understand?
-Understand?

621
00:49:58,391 --> 00:49:59,768
Well done!

622
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:12,155
Do you think

623
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,492
they'll keep you by their side
after the election?

624
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:19,871
Once it's over,
you'll end up like a mongrel

625
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:21,998
kicked out of a feast.

626
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:24,584
You wench! I'll kill you!

627
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:26,336
-No, honey!
-Oh, my God!

628
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:27,337
Ma'am.

629
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,421
-Let go of me!
-What?

630
00:50:36,763 --> 00:50:38,849
You bastard!
How dare you call me after that?

631
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:40,684
<i>It's me. Please help me.</i>

632
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:45,355
What? Hey, what's going on? What happened?

633
00:50:45,438 --> 00:50:47,607
Remember the sleep-inducing shot?

634
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:50,235
I stabbed the guy guarding me with it.

635
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,114
<i>The rest are all
in the prayer room to eat right now.</i>

636
00:50:54,197 --> 00:50:55,365
<i>What do I do?</i>

637
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:57,075
Get me out of here. Please!

638
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,411
Of course! Listen.

639
00:50:59,494 --> 00:51:02,247
Go to the washroom
in the basement right now.

640
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,456
There are windows there.

641
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,459
I'll send my guys there
to pick you up. Go now!

642
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:07,794
Okay. Hurry up.

643
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:09,129
I'm so scared.

644
00:51:09,212 --> 00:51:11,965
I understand. Of course, you're scared.

645
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:16,136
We're heading there right now.
Hang in there.

646
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:17,304
<i>We'll be right over.</i>

647
00:51:20,348 --> 00:51:22,267
Captain!

648
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:24,561
-Come over here!
-Yes, sir?

649
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:26,104
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir?

650
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:32,569
-Understood?
-Understood, sir.

651
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:35,280
Is someone escaping through the basement?

652
00:51:35,363 --> 00:51:36,364
Honey!

653
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:39,159
I love you!

654
00:51:39,242 --> 00:51:40,994
Go back home. Now!

655
00:51:41,077 --> 00:51:42,579
Go now!

656
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:46,124
What's gotten into him?

657
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:49,586
Honey! Stay safe, okay?

658
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:57,010
Why did he do that here?
That's embarrassing.

659
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:23,328
Stay safe.

660
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:32,379
You too.

661
00:52:45,475 --> 00:52:46,893
Good luck.

662
00:53:02,242 --> 00:53:03,827
Promise me…

663
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,084
you'll leave with me if I come back.

664
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:31,521
I guess I must come back

665
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:33,648
to hear your answer.

666
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:01,926
Han-na, listen carefully.

667
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,680
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya of Hankuk Central
Medical Center is a Northern spy.

668
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:09,934
What?

669
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:14,314
Secretary-General Nam Tae-il's doctor
is a Northern spy?

670
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:17,067
I'm sure they're more than that.

671
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,070
<i>So you must find evidence of it.</i>

672
00:54:20,153 --> 00:54:23,406
We need it to stop him
from blowing up the dorm.

673
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:27,535
Okay.

674
00:54:27,827 --> 00:54:31,498
But… God, Kang acted
so nonchalantly all this time.

675
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,085
And she will soon

676
00:54:36,252 --> 00:54:40,131
get out of the dorm on the pretext of
intercepting the payment for the scheme.

677
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:43,301
Watch her every movement too.
You can't miss anything.

678
00:54:43,385 --> 00:54:47,514
I'll watch them in bed together
if I have to, so don't worry.

679
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:44,464
-Careful.
-Damn it.

680
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:47,383
Turn on the lights. There.

681
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:51,429
You're home!

682
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,432
I'm so relieved.

683
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:57,519
I'm not dreaming, am I?

684
00:56:58,478 --> 00:57:02,065
Why don't you hit me?
Slap me. Here. Come on.

685
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,320
That hurts so much.

686
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:11,699
Do you know how much I resented you?

687
00:57:12,534 --> 00:57:14,077
I know I told you to leave,

688
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,080
but how could you run like that
when you saw the dynamite?

689
00:57:17,664 --> 00:57:19,332
What do you mean, run?

690
00:57:19,415 --> 00:57:21,251
I was scared they might blow you up.

691
00:57:21,334 --> 00:57:25,088
I was so scared my gorgeous Cheong-ya
might be blown to pieces.

692
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:27,799
Although the President ordered me
to kill them all,

693
00:57:27,882 --> 00:57:30,051
I chose to retreat to save you.

694
00:57:30,885 --> 00:57:33,179
God, do you know how sad I was?

695
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,515
I realized I was the only one
who could save myself.

696
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:37,767
So I decided to escape at all costs.

697
00:57:38,434 --> 00:57:41,354
You did well. I've been thinking

698
00:57:41,437 --> 00:57:44,983
how to get you out of there all this time.
Well done.

699
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:49,320
How could you let those spies
go wild like that?

700
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:52,615
Joining hands with the ANSP team leader

701
00:57:52,699 --> 00:57:54,158
and shooting the ANSP director.

702
00:57:54,784 --> 00:57:56,703
Those damn bastards.

703
00:57:56,786 --> 00:58:00,373
How could they send such idiots
for the 300-million-dollar scheme?

704
00:58:00,456 --> 00:58:03,668
They should've sent guys who would die
if their country told them to.

705
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:06,671
Instead, they sent
some soon-to-be traitor.

706
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:08,965
It must've been hard for you.

707
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:10,550
You did well.

708
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:14,929
Wash me. I want to take a shower.

709
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:19,517
Sure, sure. All right.
Let's go take a shower.

710
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:21,269
Let's go.

711
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:46,294
Dad…

712
00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:01,476
Dad…

713
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:22,163
Please… Dad…

714
00:59:56,322 --> 00:59:58,408
-Thank you.
-Happy New Year.

715
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:00,034
Help the less fortunate.

716
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:03,329
<i>I told you, the fortuneteller
promised to pick them out.</i>

717
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:07,500
But the money must be sent to the North
as soon as the election's over.

718
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:10,294
We still have as many as six days left.

719
01:00:12,088 --> 01:00:14,882
You're number two in the ANSP now.

720
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:18,136
You can find out
companies' confidential information.

721
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:22,223
If you use that much money,
you can even pull off a scam.

722
01:00:22,974 --> 01:00:23,808
A scam?

723
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:26,769
You can make a 30% profit in a few days.

724
01:00:28,312 --> 01:00:32,108
30% of 300 million dollars
is 90 million dollars.

725
01:00:32,191 --> 01:00:33,359
With that much money,

726
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:37,447
we can buy a hundred of
those popular apartments in Apgujeong.

727
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:41,159
-A hundred?
-Yes!

728
01:00:41,743 --> 01:00:43,703
If we snowball that money into a fortune,

729
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:46,998
who knows?
You might end up becoming the President.

730
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:50,960
The President?

731
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,926
Now that Nam Tae-il
got rid of Director Eun,

732
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:02,930
if you take care of Nam, why not?
You have a chance.

733
01:01:03,014 --> 01:01:06,434
And the weapon you need
to trample on him is money!

734
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:15,193
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

735
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:16,778
Those bastards

736
01:01:16,861 --> 01:01:18,738
even strapped bombs

737
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:21,282
to Eun's daughter, all over her body--

738
01:01:21,365 --> 01:01:23,659
Will you keep letting me down?

739
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:29,373
Sir, I should have told you this sooner.

740
01:01:29,457 --> 01:01:30,875
I apologize.

741
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:34,921
But the truth is, because Director Eun

742
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:37,048
failed to keep his man under control,

743
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:39,926
an agent named Gang-mu
has joined hands with the spies.

744
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:44,138
On top of that, he has told the hostages
that this is the election scheme.

745
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:55,149
The only way to take care of all this
neatly is to blow up the dorm.

746
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:59,278
But Director Eun has been strongly
against it because of his daughter.

747
01:02:02,824 --> 01:02:04,075
If you say yes,

748
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:06,661
I will put an end to it at once.

749
01:02:24,762 --> 01:02:27,139
Did you have breakfast? Eat with me.

750
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:30,893
I really appreciate it, sir!

751
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:07,722
OCCUPATION: FORTUNETELLER
HOMETOWN: NORTH PYONGAN

752
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:39,921
How on earth…

753
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:42,381
Weren't you

754
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:45,843
being held hostage in the dorm?

755
01:03:52,016 --> 01:03:54,936
I was instructed
to give you this urgently.

756
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:14,956
Mother…

757
01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:19,502
Her lifetime wish is to see her son,
who parted ways with her during the war,

758
01:04:19,585 --> 01:04:21,045
once again before she dies.

759
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,426
What do you need me to do?

760
01:04:44,443 --> 01:04:46,070
They're all useless.

761
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:49,073
But I've picked out just a few

762
01:04:49,156 --> 01:04:52,743
based on the companies'
top-secret info my husband found out.

763
01:04:57,373 --> 01:05:00,126
You'll soon meet someone
who will come across the sea.

764
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:04,880
And that person is so precious that you
might not able to meet them ever again,

765
01:05:04,964 --> 01:05:06,966
so you should never miss them.

766
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:09,010
The deity told me
to make sure to tell you.

767
01:05:12,054 --> 01:05:13,931
"So precious," you say?

768
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,018
That person will change your life

769
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,769
completely.

770
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:30,698
Make sure you get it delivered today.

771
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:32,908
I'm flying to New York tomorrow morning.

772
01:05:32,992 --> 01:05:34,702
Of course. Don't worry.

773
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:39,498
Ms. Kim!

774
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:41,959
-You're back, ma'am.
-Hi.

775
01:05:43,419 --> 01:05:48,174
A person who's come across the sea…
It must mean a foreigner, right?

776
01:05:48,257 --> 01:05:50,217
I guess so.

777
01:05:50,301 --> 01:05:53,429
Right. What's that? A customer's come?

778
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:55,389
Yes. She's getting changed.

779
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:58,017
She's bought as many as three dresses
from your collection!

780
01:05:58,642 --> 01:06:00,352
Oh, is that so?

781
01:06:03,689 --> 01:06:05,066
Where do I send them?

782
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,027
Actually, I am staying at the Marine Hotel.

783
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,446
-You can just send them to my room.
-Great.

784
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:13,365
She's a foreigner.

785
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:17,119
-Can you leave this?
-Yes.

786
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,040
This is my room number.
Please have the clothes delivered there.

787
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:26,545
Oh, my.

788
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:30,091
A fund manager at ABK Partners?

789
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:35,012
Isn't this company a private-equity firm

790
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:37,765
based in Hong Kong?
One of the best, at that.

791
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,519
She's impressed that you're a fund manager
at ABK Partners.

792
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:45,272
She's wondering if it's the famous
asset management company

793
01:06:45,356 --> 01:06:46,649
for equity funds in Hong Kong.

794
01:06:46,732 --> 01:06:48,818
She heard its outstanding reputation.

795
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:52,655
You've heard us? I'm flattered.

796
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:55,991
You must have great interest
in investments.

797
01:06:56,492 --> 01:06:57,910
It's a pleasure to meet you.

798
01:06:58,994 --> 01:07:01,413
Nice too meet you.

799
01:07:03,874 --> 01:07:08,212
I came to Korea to look for investors
for a private equity fund that I started.

800
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:11,841
You need to know that
it's a quite a sizeable fund.

801
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:15,427
She said she came to Korea
to look for investors

802
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:17,138
for a private equity fund that she made.

803
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:19,598
She says the fund
deals with very large sums.

804
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:22,101
I'm sure it is.

805
01:07:22,184 --> 01:07:26,230
48 VIPs all of over the world
have already subscribed.

806
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:29,400
But as you know,
we can only take 49 people.

807
01:07:30,776 --> 01:07:31,819
So only one spot's left?

808
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,824
Which means you're just in time.

809
01:07:36,907 --> 01:07:39,577
We have exactly one spot left.

810
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,078
Would you like to sign up?

811
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:46,000
She asked if you'd like to sign up
for the last spot left.

812
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:47,209
Oh, my.

813
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:51,213
My goodness. Thank you so much.

814
01:07:51,297 --> 01:07:54,008
Of course, I should. Translate it now!

815
01:07:54,091 --> 01:07:55,634
I'm sure you got that one.

816
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:01,098
Thank you. Thank you very much.

817
01:08:01,932 --> 01:08:05,978
<i>Director Eun Chang-su, who was shot by
the armed spies around 7 p.m. yesterday,</i>

818
01:08:06,061 --> 01:08:09,607
<i>underwent surgery
but is still unconscious.</i>

819
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:12,943
<i>Dr. Song Hyeon-tak of Hankuk Central
Medical Center, who did the surgery,</i>

820
01:08:13,027 --> 01:08:15,654
<i>said they should watch him
closely for a few more day</i>

821
01:08:15,738 --> 01:08:17,823
<i>to check on Mr. Eun's progress.</i>

822
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:02,618
I did everything you told me to do.

823
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:06,705
And Dr. Song has announced
that you're in critical condition.

824
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:09,083
Nam Tae-il…

825
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:11,961
must not find out.

826
01:09:12,044 --> 01:09:13,796
Of course.

827
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:17,466
I find Choi suspicious too,
so I'm keeping this from him.

828
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:22,221
You were very lucky.

829
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:24,848
He said only 13 people would die…

830
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:30,312
Honey, it really must mean
that you'll become the President.

831
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,607
Otherwise,
how did the bullet a sniper shot

832
01:09:33,691 --> 01:09:36,110
just graze your ribs a little?

833
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:38,612
The deity kept you safe.

834
01:09:40,572 --> 01:09:41,615
Now…

835
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:48,747
we must come up with a plan
to bury that bastard Tae-il alive.

836
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:59,591
<i>Damn, the short rib soup was amazing.</i>

837
01:10:00,175 --> 01:10:01,343
Keep up the good work.

838
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:03,804
I've got to say,

839
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,016
she's a good luck charm.

840
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:09,768
As soon as she got out,
everything's going well.

841
01:10:10,394 --> 01:10:11,603
Wait.

842
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:15,482
I wonder what my little pretty thing's
doing. Hey, give me the phone.

843
01:10:19,403 --> 01:10:20,696
My God.

844
01:10:22,406 --> 01:10:23,449
Hello?

845
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:25,326
Hello?

846
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:31,332
Just when I was about to call you!

847
01:10:31,415 --> 01:10:34,877
When the hostage situation's over,
how about we go on a trip?

848
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,546
<i>Just the two of us, let's go some place</i>

849
01:10:37,629 --> 01:10:40,591
where no one knows us.
I want to go around holding your hand.

850
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:42,593
How about the Maldives?

851
01:10:43,594 --> 01:10:45,971
You precious little fox.

852
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:47,973
Sure.

853
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:50,392
Let's go at the end of the year.
Book tickets.

854
01:10:50,476 --> 01:10:52,644
Really? You really mean it?

855
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:55,481
Tell me your passport number then.

856
01:10:56,982 --> 01:10:57,816
Okay.

857
01:11:00,944 --> 01:11:03,072
Got it. I'll book the tickets.

858
01:11:04,656 --> 01:11:06,867
I know. Me too.

859
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,670
Is this the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank?

860
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,383
I'd like to open a secret account.

861
01:11:23,842 --> 01:11:27,221
Kang Cheong-ya just called
the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank,

862
01:11:27,304 --> 01:11:29,932
<i>lying that she's the wife
of Secretary-General Nam Tae-il.</i>

863
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:35,229
As soon as she told them Nam's passport
number, they said they'd send their staff.

864
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:38,732
Swiss BR Bank? Is she planning to flee
after opening the secret account?

865
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:44,571
If she goes to the airport or
tries to stow away, arrest her right away.

866
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:46,365
Arrest her?

867
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:48,992
Me, who's being chased by the agency?

868
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:53,288
Even if I arrest her,
I have nowhere to hand her over.

869
01:11:53,372 --> 01:11:55,124
Who said anything about the agency?

870
01:11:55,749 --> 01:11:59,044
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

871
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:02,047
That's the only way to save the hostages

872
01:12:02,714 --> 01:12:05,300
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

873
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:31,410
<i>I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't</i>

874
01:12:31,493 --> 01:12:33,537
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

875
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,372
So trust me and be patient.

876
01:12:35,456 --> 01:12:37,124
<i>That's great!</i>

877
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:39,209
Them blowing themselves up?
That's way better.

878
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:41,837
<i>What if Kang makes off
with 300 million dollars?</i>

879
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,047
<i>Just trust her and wait for her?</i>

880
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:45,549
<i>Once she has that much money,</i>

881
01:12:45,632 --> 01:12:47,634
<i>she might flee to another country.</i>

882
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,972
<i>I'll help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.</i>

883
01:12:55,392 --> 01:12:58,103
Your father is the ANSP director?

884
01:12:58,187 --> 01:13:00,606
<i>Isn't he the one trying to kill us all?</i>

885
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:02,649
<i>Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?</i>

886
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:04,610
<i>That's so creepy!</i>

887
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:07,779
I want to help you get out alive.

888
01:13:07,863 --> 01:13:10,574
<i>I'll get in the same car as Soo-ho.</i>

889
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,618
<i>I'm sorry I've put you</i>

890
01:13:13,952 --> 01:13:15,204
<i>through all this.</i>

891
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,081
<i>Soo-ho.</i>

892
01:13:18,707 --> 01:13:21,710
I'll stay by your side until the end.

893
01:13:25,756 --> 01:13:28,550
BONUS

894
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:36,099
You're Linda Young, a fund manager
at ABK Partners based in Hong Kong.

895
01:13:36,642 --> 01:13:38,769
And you're flying to the New York HQ
tomorrow morning

896
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:40,646
to have a conference meeting.

897
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:42,898
I'm Gong Gil-sun,

898
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:45,984
who used to scam US soldiers in Osaka.

899
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:49,029
I'm the Gong Gil-sun.
Don't you know my nickname?

900
01:13:49,112 --> 01:13:51,448
Of course I do. "Threatening Gong."

901
