EPISODE 8

3
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,017
Hello?

4
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:21,269
Yes. And?

5
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:24,647
What? What are you talking about?

6
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,400
Eun Yeong-u?

7
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,904
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

8
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:43,082
What? Where is he going?

9
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,007
MYEONGDONG GENERAL STORE

10
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,727
You're good at that.

11
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,770
Of course.

12
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:13,821
Are you here to pick up your clothes?

13
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:17,116
I thought you weren't coming today.

14
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:20,370
I stopped by the Hosu University dorm.

15
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:25,541
Why would you go there?
It must be quite chaotic there.

16
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,878
I figured they probably hadn't had
anything to eat, so I went

17
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:30,463
to give them some food.

18
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:37,512
Could you step aside?

19
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,561
Step aside?

20
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,369
Or I will for you.

21
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:08,001
Ma'am, this is bad.

22
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:10,128
It's Yeong-u.

23
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:13,715
What?

24
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:17,427
My son is?

25
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:18,845
Where's my husband?

26
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:20,763
He's at the hospital.

27
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:23,975
That rude wench.

28
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,853
Did she just leave without saying bye?

29
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:29,647
I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,233
I asked them to take
special care of your son,

31
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,319
so they assigned him
to somewhere far from HQ.

32
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,863
But I didn't know
they sent him to Udo Island.

33
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:40,908
This way, sir.

34
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:46,289
ARMED FORCES HOSPITAL

35
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,172
Good work, guys.

36
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,721
He's asleep, right?

37
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,181
We gave him a sedative.

38
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,189
Yeong-u.

39
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:13,858
I shouldn't have let them

40
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:16,194
assign you to the front lines.

41
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:25,620
Dad.

42
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:27,163
Hey.

43
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,291
I…

44
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,836
promised Mom…

45
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:36,214
Mom?

46
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:42,261
…that I would protect…

47
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:50,103
That I would protect Yeong-ro.

48
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:52,772
<i>Mom.</i>

49
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,526
I'll protect Yeong-ro.

50
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:58,778
So don't worry.

51
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,823
I'll make sure she marries

52
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:04,075
someone who loves her so much.

53
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:08,913
And I'll look out for her by her side
until she becomes an old lady,

54
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,207
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

55
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,419
I'm just three years younger than you.

56
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:24,595
Dad.

57
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:26,597
Yes?

58
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,309
Yeong-ro…

59
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,526
Keep her safe.

60
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,028
Of course, I will.

61
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:44,532
But you should get better
and do it yourself.

62
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:47,869
You should do that.

63
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,499
Yeong-u?

64
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,085
Don't fall asleep. Talk to me.

65
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:58,504
Cardiac arrest!

66
00:05:58,588 --> 00:05:59,505
What's that sound?

67
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,382
-Move aside!
-Move aside, sir.

68
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,675
Do something!

69
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:05,344
Yeong-u! Don't fall asleep.

70
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:06,888
Don't fall asleep!

71
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:08,514
Yeong-u, wake up!

72
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,016
Wake him up!

73
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,601
Come on, do something!

74
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:12,894
Yeong-u, wake up!

75
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:16,606
Wake him up!

76
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:20,526
Don't fall asleep! Yeong-u!

77
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:31,120
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

78
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:30,216
This is the Rhine.

79
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:32,510
This is the Rhine.

80
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:34,053
VIP, answer me.

81
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:39,475
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

82
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:43,437
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

83
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:47,483
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

84
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:50,736
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

85
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,947
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

86
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,116
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

87
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,910
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

88
00:09:57,993 --> 00:10:01,914
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

89
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:05,418
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

90
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,796
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

91
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,715
<i>and came to Korea</i>

92
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:13,467
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

93
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,346
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

94
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,349
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

95
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:41,537
What…

96
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:44,290
What did she just say?

97
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,504
My brother…

98
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,300
was killed?

99
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:08,355
My brother is dead?

100
00:11:18,574 --> 00:11:19,575
No…

101
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,205
No…

102
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:25,915
No…

103
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:28,584
It can't be true.

104
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:33,047
Why… Why is my brother dead?

105
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,089
No…

106
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:36,842
That's not true…

107
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:44,058
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

108
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,231
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

109
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:51,232
Eun Yeong-ro!

110
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,234
Eun Yeong-ro!

111
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:57,613
-Yeong-ro!
-Yeong-u!

112
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,493
Let go! Let go of me!

113
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,161
Calm down!

114
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:07,873
I need to go see for myself!

115
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,587
It's dangerous.
You don't want to die, do you?

116
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:43,742
You're the leader of those
who killed Yeong-u?

117
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,662
You evil bastard.

118
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,540
Holding us hostage wasn't enough?
Why did you kill my brother?

119
00:12:49,623 --> 00:12:51,292
What did he do wrong?

120
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,586
He didn't do anything to deserve it!

121
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:57,506
Bring him back.

122
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:00,009
Bring him back!

123
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:49,141
DORM ROOM 208

2ND FLOOR LOUNGE

127

<i>Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.</i>

128
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,597
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

129
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:31,016
<i>After roll-call, in room 207,</i>

130
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,561
<i>Yeo Jeong-min, Ko Hye-ryeong,
Yoon Seol-hui, and Eun Yeong-ro</i>

131
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:37,731
<i>ate</i> ramyeon <i>and chat with Lee Jang-hui

132
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,234
<i>and Kim Gang-hui and Lim So-yeon
from room 206.</i>

133
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:43,445
<i>Yeong-ro received a necklace as a gift
from an unnamed man who was</i>

134
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,030
<i>her partner at the Open House.</i>

135
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,074
<i>They must be seeing each other.</i>

136
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,451
The girl who treated me?

137
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:54,164
<i>I heard the ANSP director's son is dead.
What if they try to retaliate against us?</i>

138
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,338
<i>Did you forget about the instructions?</i>

139
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:04,800
But they were given before his death.

140
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:08,470
<i>I'm at Hosu University where
the armed spies are holding people hostage</i>

141
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:11,390
<i>after escaping the ANSP surveillance.</i>

142
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,267
<i>The university is closed to the public</i>

143
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,603
<i>including its students, and the police
special forces have been sent in.</i>

144
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:21,150
<i>ANSP has camped in front of the dorm
and taken control of the scene--</i>

145
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:27,990
Set a booby trap on the cafeteria windows
and put an extra bomb.

146
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:30,993
<i>A bomb?</i>

147
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:33,787
If they try to deceive us again,

148
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:37,624
I'll push the button.

149
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,958
Talk about bad timing.

150
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,335
If only you'd come in a bit later.

151
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:05,921
Turn around.

152
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:33,282
That…

153
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:35,951
Why is that…

154
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:56,471
You know I have
a detonator in my pocket, right?

155
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,099
Don't try anything funny.

156
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,435
Will you blow everyone up?

157
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,939
You know Lee Seong-jo, right? The one
who came to assassinate the president.

158
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:10,277
He fell in love with someone in the South
and is living happily.

159
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,532
Don't you want to live here
with someone you love, like him?

160
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:24,374
If you want to live happily
with that woman, don't do anything stupid.

161
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,418
I won't let it slide twice.

162
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,047
"That woman"? Who?

163
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:36,011
Oh, her? She's just
one of my subordinates. Nothing more.

164
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,555
Just colleagues.

165
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,364
Go in.

166
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,810
How is she?

167
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:27,229
I gave her a tranquilizer,

168
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,898
so she'll be fine after some sleep.

169
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,829
Can we have a word for a minute?

170
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:09,855
I know the North and the South
made a deal,

171
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:11,606
but we never know

172
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,484
how things will turn out and when.

173
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:17,404
You know that, right?

174
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:19,906
Of course, ma'am.

175
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,783
So the ANSP director's daughter…

176
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:27,205
hid you in this dorm?

177
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:29,875
Yes.

178
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:37,299
Since you're indebted to her, it must
be bothering you. I understand that.

179
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:43,221
But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.

180
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,770
I never had any personal feelings for her.

181
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:54,483
I'm relieved to hear that.

182
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,287
The hostage situation
hadn't been in the news all this time,

183
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:09,247
but the news about it just broke out.

184
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,416
And my face has been disclosed.

185
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:16,213
Will we really be able
to go back alive in ten days?

186
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,342
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:24,346
Are you worried about that
or doubting the party?

188
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,556
I'm not doubting the party's orders.

189
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:29,101
I just don't trust the ANSP.

190
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:30,936
As I told you,

191
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:34,898
last time we followed
the instructions and went out there,

192
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:37,442
they sprayed us with bullets to kill us.

193
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:43,198
If what you're saying is true, it means
they stabbed the party in the back.

194
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,075
Would the party really have

195
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:48,286
negotiated with such backstabbers again?

196
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:51,581
Then…

197
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,960
let me ask you one thing.

198
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:02,175
Why in ten days?

199
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:05,095
You seriously don't know?

200
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:09,599
A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?

201
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:50,265
That's a bomb, isn't it?

202
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:54,978
They said they'd release more of us,
but aren't they going to just kill us all?

203
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:57,397
There you go again.
Don't jump to conclusions.

204
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:00,442
They wouldn't dare.
The army is surrounding this place.

205
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:05,280
Wait. Where's Yeong-ro?

206
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,782
What if they took only her somewhere safe?

207
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:09,201
Keep it down.

208
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:12,287
He took her out of here in secret.

209
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,414
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,584
Get back to sleep.

211
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,670
Even when they tried
to kill the doctor by the window,

212
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:23,298
he desperately tried
to save Yeong-ro first.

213
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,716
I saw it with my own eyes!

214
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,926
Gye Bun-ok.

215
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:29,804
I bet even if all of us here are killed,

216
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:32,098
he'll still try to save Yeong-ro.

217
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:34,684
It's already been two hours.

218
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:37,270
They must've released her. Right?

219
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:38,480
Of course not.

220
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:42,984
She passed out.

221
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:47,322
After hearing that her brother died during
an engagement with a Northern spy boat.

222
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:49,741
Her brother died?

223
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:51,618
I feel so bad for her.

224
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:54,371
-Oh, no.
-Poor Yeong-ro.

225
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,217
Honey.

226
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,220
What are you doing here?
The guests are coming.

227
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,223
It's all my fault.

228
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:16,601
I'm the one who got him killed.

229
00:24:18,812 --> 00:24:21,064
That's not your fault.

230
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:23,984
When you sent him to the front lines,

231
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:27,862
you were in a crisis because of the Campus
Stabilization Act. You had no choice.

232
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:30,907
On top of that, he protested
against the government.

233
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,076
Very enthusiastically, at that.

234
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,663
I was so worried
that you might get on Code 1's bad side.

235
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,001
Honey.

236
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:44,588
I know it's really hard for you,

237
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:48,341
but our Yeong-u
bravely sacrificed his life

238
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:52,512
for our country and people while
fighting against spies from the North.

239
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,433
If only it weren't for Operation Phoenix…

240
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,728
If Code 1 finds out

241
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:02,439
you blame the operation for it,
you'll be doomed!

242
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:05,025
Now that the operation has failed,

243
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:07,110
if you're pushed out,

244
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:08,320
what about Yeong-ro?

245
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:10,530
We can't bring Yeong-u back,

246
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:12,824
but we must save Yeong-ro at all cost!

247
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,452
I know you made a deal with the North,

248
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:19,956
as long as she's in the hands of
those brutal spies, she can never be safe.

249
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,334
Honey!

250
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,879
You must pull yourself together!

251
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:29,090
I know. I know that.

252
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:31,092
Yeong-u…

253
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:32,969
Yeong-u…

254
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,808
<i>And I'll look out for her</i>

255
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:41,728
by her side until she becomes an old lady,

256
00:25:42,937 --> 00:25:45,190
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

257
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,275
I'm just three years younger than you.

258
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,576
Yeong-u!

259
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,289
Yeong-u!

260
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:04,626
Yeong-u!

261
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:08,588
Yeong-u…

262
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:12,092
Yeong-u!

263
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:18,056
Yeong-u…

264
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:20,809
Get it together.

265
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:24,062
My brother

266
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:26,022
is gone.

267
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:30,110
You must've had a nightmare.

268
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:31,986
Don't you remember

269
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,655
passing out?

270
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,133
It's all right.

271
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,134
It's okay.

272
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:57,303
All right, breathe in again.

273
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,016
It's okay.

274
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:09,315
<i>Wait.</i>

275
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:15,196
Can you give me that necklace?
No, can you sell it to me?

276
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:24,873
I'm sorry,

277
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:30,003
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

278
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,593
They must be mistaken.

279
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:38,803
Maybe someone by the same name.

280
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,771
<i>The late Eun Yeong-u, the Marine</i>

281
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:33,191
<i>who sacrificed his life to kill our
enemies during the life-and-death battle.</i>

282
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:35,193
<i>The last thing he did while alive</i>

283
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:39,155
<i>was write a letter
to his one and only younger sister.</i>

284
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:42,617
<i>He was going to finish writing it
after the patrol,</i>

285
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:46,704
<i>but the blank space
will never be filled now.</i>

286
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:50,124
<i>I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>

287
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,362
Go back to the room.

288
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:27,161
Go back to the room.

289
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:30,123
Let me go.

290
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:35,962
Let me out.

291
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:44,596
My brother…

292
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,310
I want to go see my brother.

293
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:56,149
Please.

294
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,027
Please let me see him one last time.

295
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:38,274
Thank you.

296
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,859
What? Okay.

297
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:47,116
I can't imagine how devastated
you must be to have lost your child.

298
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,453
But his sacrifice won't be in vain.

299
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:58,586
Be strong.

300
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:05,093
Mr. Park, you don't need to worry
about the Han I-sep abduction case.

301
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:09,514
We've broken the hostage situation
in the news to take care of it neatly--

302
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:12,141
Stop. How could you be so inconsiderate?

303
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,687
They just lost their child.

304
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:22,318
Right.

305
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:26,197
I heard your daughter
is being held at Hosu University.

306
00:31:28,992 --> 00:31:30,201
Yes,

307
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:33,538
I just found out
that Yeong-ro is one of the hostages.

308
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:37,917
He's just so worried about our country
even when his children are in danger.

309
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,127
-Stop it.
-It's just…

310
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:43,756
I'm sure the people will appreciate
your true patriotism someday.

311
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,009
Stay strong.

312
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,438
Let's go.

313
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:06,904
I can't believe you!

314
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:07,989
I just…

315
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:13,327
I mean,

316
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:17,874
since when were
Mr. Park and Eun that close?

317
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,918
If Mr. Park is to be elected president,

318
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:23,588
you'll end up as a fifth wheel.

319
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:24,839
That's enough!

320
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:27,967
What do you even know? Don't jinx it.

321
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:29,052
I mean,

322
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:33,723
he used to treat Eun like a nobody
until recently. What's changed?

323
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:35,099
What a sly snake.

324
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,020
He's after sympathy votes
he might get thanks to Eun.

325
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:43,649
If the Han I-seop case broke out without
any counterplan, he would've chewed me up!

326
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:46,444
Wait.

327
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:50,448
So there's a counterplan
to bury the Professor Han scandal?

328
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:58,372
What do I do with you?

329
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,585
Eun's wife caught on quick.

330
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:04,545
You seriously don't know?

331
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:07,048
What other than the hostage situation?

332
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:11,636
You'll use the hostage-taking?

333
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,973
But what if something
happens to the students?

334
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:16,974
Do you think--

335
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,186
That's not important right now!

336
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:24,690
Look how well the former actress is
supporting her husband. What about you?

337
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:28,569
All you do is act
like the leader among some ladies.

338
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:31,030
My goodness.

339
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:36,119
Honey.

340
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:42,416
Don't worry about a thing.

341
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:46,754
No matter what Ms. Hong does,

342
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,132
unless 13 people die,

343
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:51,884
it'll be all for nothing.

344
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,182
What are you talking about?

345
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:05,314
For Eun to become president,

346
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,777
13 young virgins must die
according to the fortuneteller!

347
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:12,738
Again? You went to see
a fortuneteller again?

348
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:15,825
He's not just any fortuneteller.

349
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,413
Even when you agonized
over whether to join the coup,

350
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:24,750
he's the one who told me you should
take out the commander and join it!

351
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:27,879
Are you a birdbrain? Are you?

352
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:29,714
I told you never to talk about it!

353
00:34:29,797 --> 00:34:32,592
How many times must I tell you?

354
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:34,844
Right.

355
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:36,888
Gosh.

356
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,225
I'm sorry, honey.

357
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:45,188
I forgot.

358
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:51,152
You must want to screw me over.

359
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:52,945
There's no other explanation.

360
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:54,363
God damn it!

361
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:00,286
Darn it.

362
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:02,580
That little sly minx.

363
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:11,047
Mr. An. Can't you see what I mean?

364
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,092
I know the fact that he died
during the engagement is important,

365
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:18,262
but the fact that the director
sent his own son to the front lines…

366
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:19,639
No!

367
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:23,434
You should leave out the protesting part.

368
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:27,188
People need to know
he sent his son to the front lines

369
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:30,066
so that they'll be
impressed by his patriotism.

370
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:32,068
I understand, ma'am.

371
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:37,114
Mr. Eun will make a great
presidential candidate in the future.

372
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:39,742
<i>And I'll make sure people
will remember that.</i>

373
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:44,705
By the way, I should go there
to pay my respects to him.

374
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,541
You just focus on preparing
for tomorrow's announcement.

375
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:50,836
Don't worry. We're even rehearsing it.

376
00:35:51,128 --> 00:35:52,088
Salute!

377
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,470
Where were we?

378
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:06,394
<i>Let's continue.</i>

379
00:36:08,354 --> 00:36:09,689
I'm Gal Sang-sik from JBC.

380
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,358
Thank you.

381
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:16,070
The ANSP announced that Han was killed
while defecting to the North.

382
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:19,323
Why are you trying
to frame the best brains

383
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:21,784
of the opposition candidate for it?

384
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,245
I told you.

385
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,249
In Professor Han's bag,

386
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:31,377
we found a letter
from his son in the North

387
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,421
that says they should destroy

388
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:35,214
the pro-US candidate--

389
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:36,173
No!

390
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:39,593
You can't get so worked up.

391
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:40,928
Right.

392
00:36:41,595 --> 00:36:43,306
I should relax.

393
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:44,348
Let me try it again.

394
00:36:44,432 --> 00:36:46,183
Are you going to do this all night?

395
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:48,936
Look.

396
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,440
It's going to be live. It'll be
broadcast live all over the country!

397
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:55,568
It's my chance
to become popular nationwide.

398
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:57,403
Of course, it must go perfectly!

399
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:01,282
Guys.

400
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:05,953
What should I wear tomorrow?

401
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,204
Pardon?

402
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:33,481
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

403
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:34,185
9 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION

404
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,736
DORMITORY GUIDE MAP
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

405
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:44,862
CAFETERIA, LOUNGE

406
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:47,448
CAFETERIA

407
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,537
Take your time and eat little by little.

408
00:39:54,538 --> 00:39:55,539
Here.

409
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:19,438
Yeong-ro, you should eat.

410
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:25,569
Or you'll collapse.

411
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:37,039
I think he should be untied to eat this.

412
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:43,045
-Untie him.
-Okay.

413
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:44,880
Come on.

414
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:50,844
Hey, come eat.

415
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,304
What are you doing?

416
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:55,015
-Eat? What…
-I saved some for you.

417
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:57,434
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

418
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:03,399
This is for you. Come on.

419
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:05,568
-You get out of here.
-Come on.

420
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:11,156
-Sir.
-Yes?

421
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:13,867
Why don't you eat with me?

422
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:45,733
Did you sleep at all?

423
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:48,861
I don't even know
if I did for the past two days.

424
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:54,658
Your face has become
such a mess in two days.

425
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,788
If I'd searched more thoroughly,

426
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,374
this wouldn't be happening.

427
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:06,128
They were determined to hide him,
so you wouldn't have found him.

428
00:42:06,211 --> 00:42:07,254
Stop it.

429
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:16,597
I know the hall director is
a stickler for the rules,

430
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:19,558
but I still don't get why

431
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:21,727
she stopped us from searching like that.

432
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,480
I found that weird too.

433
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,817
A man who'd been shot came to hide
in the dorm. A spy, at that.

434
00:42:29,568 --> 00:42:30,861
What if he harmed the kids?

435
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:33,614
She should've been scared
and let you search.

436
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:38,285
There are so many
suspicious things about her.

437
00:42:42,706 --> 00:42:44,124
There are many?

438
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:47,753
Yes. Once a month,

439
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,298
-without anyone knowing, she went to--
-Hey, you.

440
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:53,467
Stop talking nonsense.

441
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,468
Just eat.

442
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:57,012
You said you found it suspicious too.

443
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,598
Suspicious?

444
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,559
Maybe she has no family.

445
00:43:02,643 --> 00:43:04,853
She's cooped up in the dorm
even during holidays.

446
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:06,480
But once a month,

447
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:12,027
she goes out at dawn and comes back
all exhausted right before roll-call.

448
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:23,455
<i>All exhausted?</i>

449
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:26,083
Yes. That's not all.

450
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,670
And it was really strange
when she took the job in the dorm.

451
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:31,004
Hey, now.

452
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:32,381
Shut it.

453
00:43:32,464 --> 00:43:35,426
I overheard what you told Ms. Oh.

454
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,220
What on earth did you overhear?

455
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:45,185
The day before Ms. Song died, she saw

456
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,938
Ms. Pi's picture.

457
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:49,606
Picture?

458
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:56,739
No, it wasn't a picture.
What was it? It was…

459
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:03,829
God damn it! Put him on right now!

460
00:44:03,912 --> 00:44:05,956
Don't you know who I am?

461
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:07,624
I'm still the hall director!

462
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:13,338
Sir.

463
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:18,552
I may be quitting for personal reasons,

464
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:23,432
but I've been working
as hall director in this dorm

465
00:44:23,515 --> 00:44:25,809
for 11 years, 5 months, and 12 days.

466
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,937
Can just anyone be in this position?

467
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:33,609
If you hire such a woman as hall director,
you'll be insulting me

468
00:44:33,692 --> 00:44:36,111
and tarnishing
Hosu University's history and tradition!

469
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:39,740
You'll also be
threatening the students' safety!

470
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,915
You think I haven't done
the reference check?

471
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:51,043
My cousin lives in Munich.

472
00:44:52,377 --> 00:44:53,796
<i>My goodness.</i>

473
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:58,050
<i>Her eyes are so big that she looks scary.</i>

474
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:02,179
<i>Thinking that,
I was looking at her picture.</i>

475
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:04,890
She's not good enough to be my successor.

476
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:11,146
I'm quitting, but I care.

477
00:45:12,397 --> 00:45:15,067
Who the hell asked you to do this?

478
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,196
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

479
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:23,075
She'll be the next hall director
over my dead body!

480
00:45:23,158 --> 00:45:24,451
Do you understand?

481
00:45:26,703 --> 00:45:27,704
Ma'am.

482
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,215
<i>And that night,</i>

483
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:41,802
<i>Ms. Song killed herself.</i>

484
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:46,139
Killed herself?

485
00:45:46,932 --> 00:45:47,850
Why?

486
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:50,018
How would I know?

487
00:45:50,102 --> 00:45:53,564
She was about to quit
because she'd been quite ill.

488
00:45:53,647 --> 00:45:56,316
So I just thought
she didn't want to live anymore.

489
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,068
But why did she

490
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:01,572
oppose hiring Ms. Pi
as hall director like that?

491
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:05,325
I mean, Ms. Pi graduated from
Hosu University and studied in Germany.

492
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:06,869
I don't know.

493
00:46:06,952 --> 00:46:09,496
How would we ever know
what the high-ups think?

494
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,915
Anyway,

495
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:15,377
when I went to see
the new hall director afterward,

496
00:46:16,336 --> 00:46:21,091
it turned out to be
the woman with big eyes.

497
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:43,530
COLT 25 POCKET PISTOL
LIGHTER, RADIO

498
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,578
Hey.

499
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:51,288
Yes?

500
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:53,040
Showing off your drawing skills?

501
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:54,541
Is that it?

502
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,126
Darn it.

503
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,962
Add a scar or something.

504
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:01,340
Right here.

505
00:47:02,007 --> 00:47:03,133
A scar? What for?

506
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,520
You drew him well. It's very similar.

507
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:16,647
Thank you.

508
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:19,107
We're not using it to catch him.

509
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:21,193
It's for promoting
a sense of national security.

510
00:47:21,276 --> 00:47:23,528
Yes, and Lim Soo-ho looks too pretty.

511
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:25,697
We need the other guys to look scary

512
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:28,158
to make them look like bad guys.

513
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:34,414
What's that?

514
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:38,961
We added them in. People can't think
we're failing to catch only three guys.

515
00:47:39,044 --> 00:47:42,214
Lim Soo-ho and the six spies.
Seven in total.

516
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:43,966
That's right.

517
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:53,183
ANNOUNCEMENT ON INVESTIGATION
OF HOSU UNIV. HOSTAGE SITUATION

518
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:54,267
<i>Lim Soo-ho</i>

519
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:58,480
went to the Hosu University dorm
to hide with lethal…

520
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:02,192
Lethal.

521
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:03,944
Lethal.

522
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:09,449
You don't even knock now?

523
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,374
Aren't you worried about the students?

524
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:20,627
Do you expect them to be safe
after provoking the spies like this?

525
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:23,839
I'm telling you,
he was holding the detonator!

526
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:25,549
If he pushes it, everyone will die!

527
00:48:27,592 --> 00:48:28,677
Han-na.

528
00:48:29,678 --> 00:48:32,055
Don't go against the flow.

529
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:34,307
We do what we're told

530
00:48:35,017 --> 00:48:37,144
without question. Absolute obedience.

531
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:40,022
The detonator?

532
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,442
The director's daughter is in there.

533
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:46,361
You think he'd do
something that might kill her?

534
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:49,614
What do you mean?

535
00:48:49,698 --> 00:48:51,616
It's better for you not to know.

536
00:48:52,117 --> 00:48:53,910
What you don't know won't hurt you.

537
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:55,829
Stop bothering me.

538
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,833
Lethal.

539
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,753
He's here again.

540
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:08,467
Gal, that bastard. How dare he come here?

541
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:10,510
That bastard.

542
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:15,932
He's here!

543
00:49:23,899 --> 00:49:27,027
I'm An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations.

544
00:49:27,986 --> 00:49:29,404
Before the announcement,

545
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:32,032
I pray for the souls of

546
00:49:32,532 --> 00:49:34,409
the late Eun Yeong-u,

547
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:36,620
the son of director Eun,

548
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:39,748
and the late Marine Kim Yeong-jun.

549
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:43,877
And I also offer my sincere condolences
to the bereaved families.

550
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:51,218
Now,

551
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:55,263
I'll explain how the investigation
for the hostage situation is going.

552
00:49:56,264 --> 00:50:00,977
Lim Soo-ho disguised himself as
an economics student at Berlin University

553
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,979
came to Korea early this year.

554
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:04,731
The ANSP

555
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:08,568
started to try to find out
his whereabouts, suspecting he was

556
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:12,280
Taedong River 1
who'd been acting in Germany.

557
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:17,035
We had our agents tail him
and keep a close eye on him.

558
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:22,916
Finally, we saw Professor Han I-seop
secretly meeting Lim Soo-ho.

559
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,836
So we started chasing those two.

560
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:34,219
A case without hard evidence
but with circumstantial one.

561
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,848
Want to dig into it?

562
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,307
A case?

563
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:42,435
What kind of case?

564
00:50:44,479 --> 00:50:46,773
Here! Take photos of these.

565
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:52,529
These are booby traps
that the spies have set all over the dorm.

566
00:50:52,612 --> 00:50:57,701
"It's better for you not to know. What you
don't know won't hurt you." He said.

567
00:51:01,955 --> 00:51:03,331
The Hosu hostage situation?

568
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:05,876
Without An knowing?

569
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:10,088
On the ANSP's honor, we'll solve
the case safely. Take a photo of me too.

570
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:11,464
Take it!

571
00:51:15,886 --> 00:51:17,596
We won't give in

572
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,807
<i>to the brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime.</i>

573
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:22,726
<i>The ANSP and military</i>

574
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:27,105
<i>try our utmost best to rescue</i>

575
00:51:27,856 --> 00:51:30,442
<i>all of 64 hostages safely</i>

576
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:32,569
<i>from the seven Northern spies.</i>

577
00:51:32,652 --> 00:51:35,864
The brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime…

578
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:41,453
They know we're just three,
but they announced that we're seven.

579
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:45,373
Should I trust them and
follow the instructions from the party?

580
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:47,667
I'm sure they just want to avoid the blame

581
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:51,880
that they're failing to catch
just three with hundreds of soldiers.

582
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:54,799
What about ten days later?

583
00:51:56,343 --> 00:51:58,762
They just created four more spies.

584
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:02,015
How do you think they'll put an end
to this hostage situation?

585
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:08,313
Release half of the hostages.

586
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:10,857
Pardon?

587
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:13,193
If 30 hostages get released

588
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:15,946
and say there are only three spies,

589
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:17,697
won't that be fun to watch?

590
00:52:18,365 --> 00:52:22,077
They won't be any use to you anyway.
Plus, it's hard to control all of them.

591
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:28,291
I'll release everyone
except the ones we really need.

592
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,502
Is there anyone you want to release?

593
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:44,432
No, I just know Director Eun Chang-su's
daughter is the one we need the most.

594
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:20,844
We don't intend to hurt you.

595
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,389
We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.

596
00:53:25,056 --> 00:53:26,766
To prove that, I will

597
00:53:28,893 --> 00:53:30,395
release 30 of you today.

598
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:34,607
Quiet!

599
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:39,279
Ms. Pi.

600
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,906
This is the list of those I'll release.

601
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,867
Call their names.

602
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:50,707
Yeong-ro.

603
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:52,042
I think they'll release you.

604
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:54,502
I hope they'll release us too.

605
00:53:54,586 --> 00:53:56,129
Please.

606
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:00,342
Je Min-gyeong.

607
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:02,594
Finally!

608
00:54:02,677 --> 00:54:03,970
Kim Bit-ni.

609
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:05,263
-Hey!
-Me?

610
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:06,890
Yang Hye-ji.

611
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,684
Kim Dong-hui.

612
00:54:11,394 --> 00:54:12,604
Ko Jeong-gyeong.

613
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:15,523
-Koo In-na
-Yes!

614
00:54:16,983 --> 00:54:18,651
30 people right away?

615
00:54:18,735 --> 00:54:19,903
What?

616
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:21,654
You don't want them?

617
00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:26,159
How could you release them like that?
We got to work together.

618
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:29,496
Right after the announcement?
It makes no sense.

619
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:32,999
In return, send in things we demand.

620
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,167
Hey, wait!

621
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:37,337
Keep them for now. Don't release them yet.

622
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,923
We'll send in anything you need.

623
00:54:41,049 --> 00:54:41,966
And

624
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:44,135
Dr. Kang…

625
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:47,680
Release her right now.

626
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:50,934
She won't be released.

627
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:54,187
<i>She had hidden a gun in her bag.</i>

628
00:54:55,146 --> 00:54:57,273
What? A gun?

629
00:54:58,983 --> 00:54:59,818
You…

630
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:02,570
If you lay a finger on her, I will--

631
00:55:02,654 --> 00:55:06,783
<i>We need drugs for diabetes
and blood pressure and some men's clothes.</i>

632
00:55:07,492 --> 00:55:10,495
Have the ANSP agent from yesterday
bring them here.

633
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:17,502
Some cup noodles too.

634
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:25,760
Ten boxes of cup noodles too.

635
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,723
Hello?

636
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:34,436
This damn bastard hung up on me again.
What a rude bastard.

637
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:35,437
Cup noodles.

638
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:39,107
But what kind of cup noodles?

639
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:56,708
He's such an ungrateful bastard.

640
00:55:57,292 --> 00:56:00,503
We even hid bloodstained towels
in our bras to save him.

641
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,548
How could we not be included in those 30?

642
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:05,967
Yeong-ro, Seol-hui, and I even got naked.

643
00:56:06,551 --> 00:56:08,803
If only I knew he was such an ingrate.

644
00:56:09,137 --> 00:56:12,348
I mean, how could he not release Yeong-ro?
He knows his brother is dead.

645
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:15,768
Yeong-ro.

646
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,106
How about we talk to Ms. Pi?

647
00:56:22,108 --> 00:56:25,904
I mean, I know she's cold-hearted,
but I doubt she'll just ignore her.

648
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:29,073
You're right.
And what's one more person to 30?

649
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:31,409
Right. Pi may have a nasty temper,

650
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:33,369
but she's quite eloquent.

651
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:36,498
You guys obviously don't know her well.

652
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:39,459
Hey. Dream on.

653
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:41,794
Bun-ok.

654
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:46,216
Go bring some water.

655
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:48,968
Hot water.

656
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:56,267
You.

657
00:56:57,602 --> 00:56:59,020
Stay put.

658
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:02,649
But Ms. Pi told me to fetch water.

659
00:57:04,108 --> 00:57:05,401
You little…

660
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:17,038
Don't take long!

661
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:14,095
Hold on. What's that?

662
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:19,309
Oh, my.

663
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:21,477
What's all this?

664
00:58:22,562 --> 00:58:23,730
I knew it.

665
00:58:24,063 --> 00:58:25,565
There's always a silver lining.

666
00:58:26,649 --> 00:58:28,234
What are you doing?

667
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:43,374
Are you out of your mind?
If you get caught, we'll all die!

668
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,793
Hey, do you think I'm blind or something?

669
00:58:45,877 --> 00:58:47,545
How can I ignore this?

670
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,798
How will they know who took it?

671
00:58:50,882 --> 00:58:52,759
I'll just play dumb.

672
00:58:52,842 --> 00:58:54,135
Darn it.

673
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:57,513
Of course, they'll know.

674
00:58:58,097 --> 00:59:00,642
Because I'll tell them you took it.

675
00:59:01,851 --> 00:59:03,186
Bun-ok.

676
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:05,313
How could you say that?

677
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:09,734
Don't you know
I liked you for your fighting spirit?

678
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:13,446
Do you take me for a pushover? Damn it.

679
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:24,666
Damn it. Don't come near me.

680
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:25,917
Stay away.

681
00:59:27,627 --> 00:59:28,628
Darn it.

682
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:52,652
I told you!

683
00:59:54,404 --> 00:59:55,947
I told you not to do this.

684
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,409
I told you we'd all die if we were caught!

685
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:05,623
That wench talked me into it.

686
01:00:05,957 --> 01:00:09,335
She approached me and coaxed me into this!

687
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:15,425
I didn't.

688
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:18,344
I really didn't.

689
01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:27,979
That damn bastard.

690
01:00:30,481 --> 01:00:32,233
I'm so sorry.

691
01:00:34,986 --> 01:00:37,113
Sang-beom.

692
01:00:37,196 --> 01:00:39,157
What happened to your face?

693
01:00:43,286 --> 01:00:44,662
Please, sir.

694
01:00:58,384 --> 01:00:59,761
Sang-beom.

695
01:01:45,056 --> 01:01:47,767
Sang-beom, you idiot. My goodness.

696
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:56,025
Please, sir.

697
01:01:57,276 --> 01:01:58,236
Sir.

698
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:01,364
-Let it slide this once.
-Sir.

699
01:02:02,031 --> 01:02:04,367
He's just an ignorant fool. Please, sir.

700
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,664
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. Please.

701
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:10,957
Come here, you fool.

702
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:14,502
Sang-beom!

703
01:02:15,086 --> 01:02:16,254
Sang-beom!

704
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:17,797
How dare you!

705
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:21,884
Please, sir! Are you okay?

706
01:02:27,098 --> 01:02:28,432
-I'm sorry.
-Move!

707
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:29,475
I'm so sorry.

708
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:34,230
-Stop hitting him!
-I'm so sorry.

709
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,611
Please don't kill them! Please!

710
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:44,240
Why are you doing this to us?

711
01:02:45,074 --> 01:02:48,202
Please don't kill them! Please!

712
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:49,412
You bastard!

713
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:52,456
Stop it, you s***!

714
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:54,375
Stop it!

715
01:02:56,085 --> 01:02:58,129
You can't do that to an old man!

716
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,260
Go ahead. Shoot me!

717
01:03:04,343 --> 01:03:05,720
Shoot me, you bastard!

718
01:03:05,803 --> 01:03:06,637
Comrade Joo!

719
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:07,680
Go ahead.

720
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:09,849
Shoot. Shoot me!

721
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:15,813
Shoot me, you bastard!

722
01:03:15,897 --> 01:03:16,856
Comrade Joo!

723
01:03:24,864 --> 01:03:26,324
Damn it!

724
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:41,339
He tried to steal our money--

725
01:03:41,422 --> 01:03:43,466
Lock the three in the prayer room.

726
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:01,651
That hurts.

727
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:20,086
You idiot!

728
01:04:20,169 --> 01:04:23,255
You can't just stop
getting into trouble, can you?

729
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:25,800
What on earth did you do this time?

730
01:04:25,883 --> 01:04:26,759
Shut up.

731
01:04:28,052 --> 01:04:30,054
It's all your fault

732
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:32,765
I turned out this way.

733
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:33,766
What?

734
01:04:36,185 --> 01:04:39,230
Aren't hundreds of special forces
surrounding this place? Aren't they?

735
01:04:39,814 --> 01:04:41,065
There are just three of them.

736
01:04:41,148 --> 01:04:42,900
Can't they just snipe at them?

737
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:46,696
They're being cautious
because the hostages might get hurt.

738
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:51,575
They're right out there.
This is driving me crazy!

739
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:53,077
Stop it, you idiot!

740
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,913
Oh, my back. It hurts so much.

741
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,876
-Hey.
-Yes?

742
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,795
-Are you okay?
-What? Yes.

743
01:05:02,878 --> 01:05:05,214
Untie me too. Untie me first!

744
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:07,425
Listen, sir.

745
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:10,136
I'll tell you a way out of here,

746
01:05:10,219 --> 01:05:11,679
so take him with you.

747
01:05:13,305 --> 01:05:14,473
A way out of here?

748
01:05:15,057 --> 01:05:16,600
Is there a way out?

749
01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:22,189
Come on.

750
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,150
This way.

751
01:05:26,485 --> 01:05:28,654
Here. This is the one.

752
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,368
Where does this lead?

753
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:36,495
If you go all the way down the stairs,

754
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:39,665
you'll find the exit on basement two.

755
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:01,562
Just keep working.

756
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,527
Hey! You did such a good job!

757
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:11,572
You didn't even seem nervous.
You must be a natural on TV.

758
01:06:11,655 --> 01:06:12,948
I'm flattered.

759
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:17,703
These are things they're demanding.

760
01:06:18,204 --> 01:06:19,371
Get them ready

761
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:23,209
and have the agent
who was sent in yesterday deliver them.

762
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:26,045
You mean Jang Han-na?

763
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:29,381
But she's enraged right now.

764
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:31,342
How about we send another agent?

765
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:33,052
That bastard said it must be her.

766
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:36,388
He specifically told me to send her.

767
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:40,392
He must love women.
That young bastard even hung up on me.

768
01:06:40,476 --> 01:06:41,852
Understood, sir.

769
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,440
By the way, sir, since you stepped up,

770
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:48,734
things have been going smoothly.

771
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:52,113
That goes without saying.

772
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:54,448
Now,

773
01:06:56,242 --> 01:06:59,328
we just need to wait
until the election's over.

774
01:07:00,162 --> 01:07:02,164
Make me some coffee. Nice and sweet.

775
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:04,834
Do you mean me?

776
01:07:09,004 --> 01:07:10,172
Right away.

777
01:07:14,885 --> 01:07:17,429
This is so nice.

778
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:19,515
It really is.

779
01:07:54,508 --> 01:07:57,386
<i>Damn it! I told you, I won't get out!</i>

780
01:07:59,513 --> 01:08:02,850
But why? Why do you not want to get out?

781
01:08:02,933 --> 01:08:05,686
How many times do I have to tell you?

782
01:08:05,895 --> 01:08:09,815
While he escapes and brings
the special forces to kill the spies,

783
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:12,151
I'll turn my life around here!

784
01:08:12,234 --> 01:08:14,528
What? How will a fool like you
turn his life around?

785
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:15,946
Tell me how you will.

786
01:08:17,448 --> 01:08:19,450
You don't need to know.

787
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:21,035
Just get out of here alone.

788
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:24,622
How can I possibly leave without you?

789
01:08:24,705 --> 01:08:27,124
God, this is driving me crazy.

790
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:30,711
Dad, you won't be of any help anyway
if you stay here.

791
01:08:30,794 --> 01:08:33,214
So stop getting in my way

792
01:08:33,297 --> 01:08:35,090
and just go!

793
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:40,971
For God's sake, Sang-beom!

794
01:09:21,178 --> 01:09:24,515
Don't shoot! I'm Lee Gang-mu, the team
leader of Anti-communist Investigations 1!

795
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:27,393
SWAT team, follow me!

796
01:09:30,271 --> 01:09:31,146
A situation occurred.

797
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:35,109
<i>Team Leader Lee Gang-mu just came out
of the exit and is asking us to go in.</i>

798
01:09:41,323 --> 01:09:42,825
Make him go back in right now.

799
01:09:42,908 --> 01:09:45,327
Make him go back in! At all cost!

800
01:09:55,045 --> 01:09:55,921
Follow me now!

801
01:10:00,759 --> 01:10:02,678
We received an order. Go back in.

802
01:10:04,179 --> 01:10:05,973
Who the hell gave such an order?

803
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:14,940
The exit.

804
01:10:19,069 --> 01:10:20,487
You crazy bastards!

805
01:10:26,035 --> 01:10:28,454
If you come any closer,
we'll have to shoot you.

806
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:34,710
Go back in. It's an order.

807
01:10:39,798 --> 01:10:41,091
Go back in!

808
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:43,255
Sir, please.

809
01:12:44,339 --> 01:12:45,716
Please, sir.

810
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:47,509
Please don't kill him.

811
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:51,638
How did that bastard get out?

812
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:56,185
I'll tell you.

813
01:12:56,268 --> 01:12:58,562
He got out through here. This way.

814
01:13:06,236 --> 01:13:07,404
Here.

815
01:13:46,276 --> 01:13:47,444
<i>Why in ten days?</i>

816
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:49,988
<i>You seriously don't know?</i>

817
01:13:50,531 --> 01:13:54,117
<i>A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?</i>

818
01:13:54,701 --> 01:13:55,702
The doctor?

819
01:13:56,703 --> 01:13:59,831
The South Korean presidential election
is in ten days.

820
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:03,669
Does it have to do with it?

821
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:08,882
For the ruling party to regain power,

822
01:14:09,508 --> 01:14:12,219
I think the North and the South
made a secret deal.

823
01:14:12,302 --> 01:14:15,305
As long as the North has
the South at its mercy,

824
01:14:15,889 --> 01:14:17,891
<i>the ANSP can never hurt you guys.</i>

825
01:14:22,938 --> 01:14:26,483
Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

826
01:14:28,402 --> 01:14:29,861
It's taken me

827
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:32,573
as many as 17 years to come this far.

828
01:14:34,449 --> 01:14:36,243
Only a handful of people

829
01:14:37,452 --> 01:14:40,163
know who I really am, even in the North.

830
01:14:41,456 --> 01:14:45,335
<i>The fact that the party ordered me
to send you back safely</i>

831
01:14:45,836 --> 01:14:48,171
proves how much you mean to the party.

832
01:14:48,589 --> 01:14:49,798
Can't you see that?

833
01:14:55,846 --> 01:14:57,014
DOCTOR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
SECRET DEAL

834
01:14:57,097 --> 01:14:58,765
The doctor is what?

835
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,810
The doctor the agency sent in…

836
01:15:03,645 --> 01:15:05,063
is a Northern spy?

837
01:15:17,743 --> 01:15:19,953
The North and the South made a deal
for the election?

838
01:15:23,582 --> 01:15:25,334
Then the Han I-seop case is also…

839
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:33,550
And this hostage-taking too?

840
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,700
Go back to your seats!

841
01:15:59,826 --> 01:16:01,328
What was the gunfire about?

842
01:16:02,412 --> 01:16:03,747
You want us to all die?

843
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:08,335
Watch your tone, you bastard.
Because of you…

844
01:16:08,835 --> 01:16:12,047
The ANSP team leader tried
to escape through the exit.

845
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:14,299
<i>We shot at him to make him go back in.</i>

846
01:16:14,841 --> 01:16:16,677
You made him come back in?

847
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:18,595
Why?

848
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:20,055
Why do you think?

849
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:24,059
He insists we should have the SWAT team
break in. How could we let him out?

850
01:16:24,142 --> 01:16:27,396
<i>What if he comes out here
and tells everyone we should break in?</i>

851
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:29,314
He'll be a pain in the neck.

852
01:16:29,898 --> 01:16:32,484
<i>It's not looking good.
Why did they have to kill</i>

853
01:16:32,567 --> 01:16:34,611
the ANSP director's son of all people?

854
01:16:34,695 --> 01:16:38,573
Why do I have to talk with a mere spy
like you here, standing by 24 hours?

855
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:43,370
A high-up like me shouldn't be
doing this. You hear me, you bastard?

856
01:16:50,877 --> 01:16:54,047
Watch him closely
so that he won't come out again. Okay?

857
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:56,967
Hold out for nine more days,

858
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,886
<i>and we'll send you back to the North
without anyone knowing.</i>

859
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:27,122
<i>They don't hesitate
to abandon their own agent.</i>

860
01:17:27,706 --> 01:17:29,916
<i>Will they really let us live
as they promised</i>

861
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:32,794
<i>to the North?</i>

862
01:17:35,088 --> 01:17:37,966
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

863
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:41,636
<i>Only to use them
for the presidential election.</i>

864
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:44,514
<i>Then…</i>

865
01:17:46,099 --> 01:17:48,810
<i>the hostages, as well as me,</i>

866
01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:52,105
<i>and the Northern spies…</i>

867
01:19:16,815 --> 01:19:19,860
The ANSP agent who went out yesterday
is coming back with supplies.

868
01:19:25,574 --> 01:19:27,659
If you want her to live,
don't try anything.

869
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:32,163
Don't do anything.

870
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:33,915
You bastard.

871
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,418
Don't you dare touch her!

872
01:19:41,923 --> 01:19:44,384
You think you can get out of here alive?

873
01:19:45,218 --> 01:19:48,680
You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know

874
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:53,643
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

875
01:19:55,562 --> 01:19:57,522
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

876
01:19:58,106 --> 01:20:02,485
would it be better to rescue all
of the hostages and make people happy?

877
01:20:03,194 --> 01:20:06,698
Or would it be better to kill all of them
and make people furious?

878
01:20:07,657 --> 01:20:09,492
Of course, the latter would be better.

879
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:12,329
Because that'll make the voters
vote for the ruling party.

880
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:17,709
They'll spare the Northern spies
while killing all those innocent students?

881
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,462
You think that makes sense?

882
01:20:22,797 --> 01:20:26,635
If you're right,
that means the North gave up on our lives.

883
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:30,388
The high-ups in the South,
who don't hesitate

884
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:35,101
to kill the innocent
to gain power, would certainly do that.

885
01:20:36,478 --> 01:20:38,438
But my country is different.

886
01:20:40,523 --> 01:20:41,358
What?

887
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:44,361
My country never gives up on the comrades
even if they fall behind.

888
01:20:45,987 --> 01:20:48,365
The party considers the people
as its children.

889
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:51,076
They'd never abandon us.

890
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:55,497
Look.

891
01:20:57,165 --> 01:20:58,750
Wake up, will you?

892
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:00,835
You still don't get it.

893
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:03,254
In this scheme
for the presidential election,

894
01:21:03,797 --> 01:21:07,467
pawns like you and I are just tools
to use and throw away.

895
01:21:15,934 --> 01:21:18,478
If that's what I need to be
for my country,

896
01:21:20,855 --> 01:21:22,357
I'll gladly be one.

897
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:33,660
According to An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations,

898
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:35,370
in the dorm you can see,

899
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:37,664
64 hostages, including female students,

900
01:21:37,747 --> 01:21:41,042
are being held hostage
by seven Northern spies.

901
01:21:41,126 --> 01:21:43,253
Because of the gunfire heard not long ago,

902
01:21:43,336 --> 01:21:45,255
people fear for their safety.

903
01:21:59,352 --> 01:22:02,981
<i>You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know</i>

904
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,274
<i>this is</i>

905
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:08,361
<i>the scheme the high-ups of our countries
planned for the election.</i>

906
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:12,741
<i>Don't you still get it?</i>

907
01:22:13,992 --> 01:22:15,869
<i>Pawns like you and I are just tools</i>

908
01:22:16,786 --> 01:22:18,538
<i>to use and throw away.</i>

909
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,710
Why aren't they rescuing us?

910
01:23:06,294 --> 01:23:08,004
Why aren't they trying anything?

911
01:23:09,756 --> 01:23:10,715
You are

912
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:13,802
the director's daughter, right?

913
01:23:15,261 --> 01:23:18,348
I have to go see my brother.
I must get out.

914
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,809
What do I need to do?

915
01:23:20,892 --> 01:23:22,769
Help me. Please.

916
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:30,360
Don't act rashly.

917
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:34,197
He has a detonator in his pocket.

918
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:36,324
If he pushes the button,

919
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:39,994
the whole dorm will explode.

920
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,336
I know it's hard, but be patient.

921
01:23:49,254 --> 01:23:50,839
-I'll come up with--
-Hey!

922
01:23:53,383 --> 01:23:54,926
I just wanted to give him bread.

923
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:06,646
I need

924
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:08,731
to go to the restroom.

925
01:24:09,566 --> 01:24:11,067
Can I go?

926
01:24:25,957 --> 01:24:27,125
Make it quick.

927
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:37,051
-What aren't you going in?
-Comrade Joo.

928
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:42,056
Leave her to me and go watch the hostages.

929
01:25:10,543 --> 01:25:11,753
Please

930
01:25:13,171 --> 01:25:14,505
let me rest a bit.

931
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:22,263
Follow me.

932
01:25:34,067 --> 01:25:35,777
You didn't answer my question.

933
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:42,408
That paper airplane…

934
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:46,204
That's the one I flew out.

935
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:50,208
Why do you have it?

936
01:25:54,754 --> 01:25:56,965
Did you come to the dorm because of it?

937
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:02,428
I just found it while being chased.

938
01:26:03,263 --> 01:26:04,555
Get some rest here.

939
01:26:07,183 --> 01:26:08,434
Then why did you come back?

940
01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:12,355
You should've just left.

941
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:15,775
Why did you come back here?

942
01:26:26,744 --> 01:26:29,414
I just tried to hide in that old shrine.

943
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:35,253
If I'd known
it led to the inside of the dorm,

944
01:26:39,048 --> 01:26:40,550
I would never have gone in.

945
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,186
I'm sorry…

946
01:26:55,315 --> 01:26:56,399
about your brother.

947
01:27:07,201 --> 01:27:08,202
We will

948
01:27:09,746 --> 01:27:11,289
leave in nine days.

949
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:16,085
All this will be over in nine days.

950
01:27:18,421 --> 01:27:21,090
And I don't want to
hurt anyone in this dorm.

951
01:27:21,632 --> 01:27:24,177
I don't want to hurt anyone. I mean it.

952
01:27:25,928 --> 01:27:27,430
I want to

953
01:27:29,849 --> 01:27:31,559
release you right now.

954
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,192
But I can't.

955
01:28:10,306 --> 01:28:11,641
No. Don't go.

956
01:29:42,857 --> 01:29:44,025
If this button is pushed,

957
01:29:45,776 --> 01:29:47,737
the dorm will explode.

958
01:29:49,113 --> 01:29:50,323
Right?

959
01:30:03,169 --> 01:30:04,253
Eun Yeong-ro!

960
01:30:04,837 --> 01:30:08,090
Please believe me.
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

961
01:30:08,174 --> 01:30:10,968
<i>The party considers the people
as its children. They'd never abandon you?</i>

962
01:30:11,052 --> 01:30:12,303
You really think so?

963
01:30:12,386 --> 01:30:14,805
<i>If you want to go back alive,
just do as I say.</i>

964
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:17,266
If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.

965
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:19,393
<i>Bring me proof that what you say is true.</i>

966
01:30:19,477 --> 01:30:23,272
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

967
01:30:23,356 --> 01:30:25,483
<i>What are you going to do in here?</i>

968
01:30:25,566 --> 01:30:26,984
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

969
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:29,654
-Are you willing to kill the students too?
<i>-They're not</i>

970
01:30:29,737 --> 01:30:31,405
planning to kill the students, are they?

971
01:30:31,489 --> 01:30:34,534
Let's save the students together.

972
01:30:35,284 --> 01:30:37,286
How about you use me?

973
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:40,414
<i>Then before that,
there's something you need to know.</i>

974
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:43,292
<i>We might all be killed?</i>

975
01:30:43,376 --> 01:30:44,502
<i>Eun Yeong-ro ran away.</i>

976
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:49,924
<i>I must find you first to save you.</i>

977
01:30:55,721 --> 01:30:58,516
BONUS

978
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:04,480
Yeong-ro, close the door.

979
01:31:04,564 --> 01:31:06,232
Pi might smell it and wake up.

980
01:31:12,697 --> 01:31:14,448
Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.

981
01:31:14,532 --> 01:31:16,617
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

982
01:31:16,701 --> 01:31:18,160
Fine. Hurry up.

983
01:31:20,621 --> 01:31:23,291
Hey, your partner is really hot.

984
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:25,251
Set me up with his friend.

985
01:31:25,334 --> 01:31:27,086
Yes. Set me up too.

986
01:31:27,169 --> 01:31:29,839
-Please?
-Please?

987
01:31:30,673 --> 01:31:33,593
I'll talk to him when he calls me.

988
01:31:33,676 --> 01:31:35,469
-Great!
-Great!

989
01:31:36,387 --> 01:31:38,806
His friends? He's being chased--

990
01:31:43,728 --> 01:31:46,647
Anyway…

991
01:31:47,356 --> 01:31:48,774
I haven't seen that necklace before.

992
01:31:51,068 --> 01:31:52,945
-Did he give it to you?
-Really?

993
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:59,952
Oh, my. I'm so jealous!

994
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:01,746
Good for you!

995
01:32:03,247 --> 01:32:04,707
That's pretty. What bird is it?

996
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:06,751
A dove.

997
01:32:07,418 --> 01:32:09,211
-Isn't this a bit salty?
-Yes.
