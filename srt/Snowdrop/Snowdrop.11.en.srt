00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,666
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:09,046
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,476
You were right.

4
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:05,516
I must get out of here alive.

5
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,196
And I can't let my guys die.

6
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:16,236
Okay. Let's find a way
for all of us to get out alive.

7
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,296
Let's say we've held down the other spies.

8
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:37,546
Do we stand a chance against the ANSP
dying for the government to regain power?

9
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:38,886
We still got to try.

10
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:41,676
Or we'll all die just like they want.

11
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,726
I'm trying to save all the students too.

12
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:54,396
Hide here
until the other spies are held down.

13
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,736
Do not come upstairs.

14
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:17,006
See? I told you
they had lots of snacks in their rooms.

15
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,136
Have some.

16
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,636
We should bring
Comrades Lim and Kang some too.

17
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,606
Don't worry about that,
and just have some.

18
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,866
-That looks so good.
-What about us?

19
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:50,376
This is so good.

20
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,716
It's so good.

21
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:57,256
Dad!

22
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:00,926
That goddamn b****.

23
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:04,266
Hey, can't you see him fainting?
He needs sugar!

24
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:05,476
Shut up!

25
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,096
How dare you raise your voice?

26
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:19,656
Oh, my goodness.
We might die any moment now.

27
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:21,616
Shouldn't you at least feed us?

28
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:24,536
We're dying of hunger.

29
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,126
Shin Gyeong-ja.

30
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:35,666
Come here.

31
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,596
Bring this to him.

32
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:56,476
Our charismatic and thoughtful Bun-ok.

33
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:02,236
Could you please have mercy
and give us food too?

34
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,576
Even just a piece of bread.

35
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:08,036
-You'll be blessed.
-Yes.

36
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:19,796
Hey, Ko Hye-ja.

37
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:32,056
You said I shouldn't carry
an English book around

38
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:36,016
or receive the school newspaper
since I'm not a college student.

39
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:40,396
You said I should know my place.

40
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:46,906
Why are you bringing that up now?

41
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:48,996
Shut it. You don't get any food.

42
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,956
-Yoon Seol-hui!
-Yes?

43
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,126
Did you call me?

44
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:01,966
Hand out what you're holding
to the hostages.

45
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:06,546
And make sure
you don't give Ko Hye-ja any.

46
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:12,386
You don't give whom any again?

47
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:15,606
Ko…

48
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:18,066
Ko Hye-ja…

49
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,676
You're hungry, aren't you?

50
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:31,676
This won't do. Demand some more food.

51
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:39,976
Stand up.

52
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:33,156
You son of a b****.

53
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,046
You're betraying your country in the end?

54
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,506
They traded the South our lives for money

55
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:52,466
while they guaranteed us our safe return.

56
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,516
What?

57
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,596
They've disposed of their own agents.

58
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,436
Shut your mouth.

59
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:04,316
How dare you traitor bastard
insult our party?

60
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:24,166
It seems Lim Soo-ho betrayed you.

61
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,416
The ANSP agent's putting
a gun to the doctor's head.

62
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:27,546
A gun?

63
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:31,256
And she called Soo-ho a traitor.
I heard it clearly.

64
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:35,046
Keep an eye on the hostages.

65
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:40,886
What is it? What's going on?

66
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:44,766
Everyone, hands over your heads.

67
00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:46,606
And keep your heads down!

68
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:51,946
Eung-cheol.

69
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,946
Keep a close watch on the hostages.

70
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,196
Keep your heads down!

71
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:33,006
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

72
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:38,926
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

73
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:45,476
He said they had agreed to killing us all.

74
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:49,356
They made a deal with the South
and agreed to killing their own agents.

75
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:52,106
Then what? Guaranteeing our safe return?

76
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:54,316
We failed our mission,

77
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:56,526
so we should've blown ourselves up anyway.

78
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:57,526
Mission?

79
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,736
Who was the mission for?

80
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,986
What was it for?

81
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,156
Comrade Joo.

82
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:09,576
They ordered us to take down the Southern
government to achieve the revolution,

83
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,916
then abandoned us
for that very government to regain power.

84
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:16,876
The liberation of our country.

85
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:19,756
The people's democratic revolution.

86
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,346
Have you forgotten?

87
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,226
I'm sure it's for money,
not for the revolution.

88
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:32,146
For money, they sold their agents' lives
who have been loyal to the country

89
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,526
to the South.

90
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:36,356
That is…

91
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:40,276
what I can't forgive.

92
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,456
It's understandable
that you think that way

93
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,706
and feel betrayed.

94
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,046
But our families in the North…

95
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,426
Our families who are praying

96
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:05,466
that we accomplish our mission and
come back soon… If you think about them,

97
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,686
you shouldn't be doing this.

98
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:15,816
Think about your sister Su-hui.

99
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:21,696
<i>This is the necklace I cherish the most.</i>

100
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,446
But I'm giving it to you.

101
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:29,286
You…

102
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,826
must come back to the North.

103
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,686
Comrade Joo and I

104
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:57,356
won't tell the party
about the mistake you made today.

105
00:13:58,146 --> 00:13:59,606
Right, Comrade Joo?

106
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:02,276
I'll do as you say, Comrade Kang.

107
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,026
So untie me now.

108
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,196
Let's find a way

109
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:11,866
to save our families
as well as our agents.

110
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:15,386
Will there really be

111
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:19,516
any way for us
to save our agents together?

112
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,356
Check for yourself.

113
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:34,826
Go ahead and check
if the party still wants you…

114
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,076
to save and send me back alive.

115
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:53,676
There are tangerines.

116
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,976
There are tangerines, Ms. Pi.

117
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:00,806
Tangerines.

118
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,856
Let's have some first.

119
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:17,116
Let's bring the kids some too later.

120
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:18,206
Yeong-ro!

121
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:28,426
Bun-ok.

122
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:37,266
They told you to come up
since the spies are tied up.

123
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:40,556
Really?

124
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:41,726
This soon?

125
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,276
Are you sure?

126
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:51,986
If you don't believe me,
you can just stay here.

127
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:55,366
Ms. Pi.

128
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:56,446
Lead the way.

129
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:00,826
Let's go together.

130
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:02,956
Bun-ok.

131
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,006
I thought you'd never talk to me again.

132
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:12,176
Are you not mad at me anymore?

133
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:16,806
Forget about it. Come on now.

134
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,096
Come on.

135
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:25,516
Girls?

136
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,406
Comrade Director.

137
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,176
REPORT MESSAGE

138
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,836
SENDER: MORAN HILL 1

139
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:56,886
IS THE ORDER TO SEND
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BACK ALIVE STILL VALID?

140
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,056
"Eliminate Taedong River 1."

141
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,036
Where are we going?

142
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:04,116
Well…

143
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,626
I think they're gathered there.
Let's go that way.

144
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:12,086
I should've just killed you
when you looked suspicious.

145
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,256
Hey.

146
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:19,426
How could you think that way
when ordered to kill your comrade-in-arms?

147
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,716
Comrade?

148
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:26,556
He's a goddamn traitor.

149
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,766
He's not my comrade!

150
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,356
You're a piece of s***
who betrayed your country.

151
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,106
That voice…

152
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:38,406
I guess he's being held in the hall
director's office. Want to go check?

153
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:39,736
I'm sure Soo-ho's there too.

154
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:44,036
No. Bun-ok, let's just go back downstairs.

155
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,546
Bun-ok?

156
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,626
Bun-ok.

157
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:58,176
Go to the office quietly.

158
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:02,466
"Follow no orders but the direct ones."

159
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:06,886
They're telling you to kill me
even if other departments…

160
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:10,766
order you to save me.

161
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:20,526
Where do you belong, Comrade Kang?

162
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:23,536
The election scheme is the UFD's doing.

163
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:28,036
Is this also Director Lim Ji-rok's order?

164
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:06,497
Untie the doctor and Gyeok-chan right now.

165
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:10,172
What do you think--

166
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:12,502
Didn't you hear me?

167
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:19,682
Don't move.

168
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:24,222
Take one more step forward,

169
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:26,932
and I'll shoot.

170
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:29,182
Hand the gun over.

171
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:43,242
It's okay.

172
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:57,502
Have you ever killed a person?

173
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,882
Pull the trigger, and it's over.

174
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:01,932
No.

175
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,182
It's not over.

176
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:09,602
The eyes of the first person you kill
will haunt you forever.

177
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,612
The eyes of the person
whose life slips away…

178
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:20,532
will follow you around
when you eat or sleep.

179
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:23,282
Even in your dreams.

180
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:27,122
Your life will be a living hell
where you're chased

181
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:30,162
by those eyes endlessly.

182
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:35,082
I am trying

183
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,462
to save all of us here.

184
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:41,802
I'm trying to convince
Comrades Kang and Joo

185
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,512
to save everyone in here

186
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:47,972
including all the hostages.

187
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:52,482
Don't forget, Bun-ok.

188
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:55,692
All the hostages must die here
for you and me

189
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:58,902
to carry on without anyone
knowing what we did.

190
00:22:59,272 --> 00:23:01,942
I'll take care of you until the end.

191
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:04,242
-You know I'm capable of that.
-Shut up.

192
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,952
Now I'll tell Soo-ho and the ANSP agent

193
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,502
to put down their guns.

194
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,212
If they don't, don't hesitate

195
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:22,762
-to pull the trigger.
-Comrade Kang!

196
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:24,472
-Drop your guns.
-Sit down!

197
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:28,892
If they hear a gunshot, they'll break in.

198
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,432
The cafeteria and room 203
are not guarded at all.

199
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:33,182
They'll hold us down in three minutes.

200
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:37,102
-You'll be arrested in three minutes.
-Don't be fooled.

201
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:39,022
They'll never break in.

202
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:40,862
They haven't until now. Can't you see?

203
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:44,652
If they don't drop them in three seconds,
shoot her.

204
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:46,282
One.

205
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,532
Bun-ok…

206
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:50,332
Two.

207
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,332
Drop your guns now!

208
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:54,202
I'll really shoot her.

209
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:55,912
You don't think I can?

210
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,762
Drop your guns!

211
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:26,572
Good.

212
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:28,612
Well done.

213
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:30,782
Now,

214
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,662
bring Yeong-ro here.

215
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:41,082
Don't.

216
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:48,972
Step back.

217
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,602
Move back!

218
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:53,512
It's all right.

219
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,932
Slowly. Take it easy.

220
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:22,082
Bun-ok.

221
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:25,342
What are you doing?

222
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:26,302
Stay out of it.

223
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:29,382
Where did you get that gun?
Put it down right now.

224
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:30,932
Shut your mouth.

225
00:25:31,592 --> 00:25:34,392
Or I'll tell these guys
who you really are.

226
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:36,682
What?

227
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:39,482
Bun-ok. You must hurry. Come to this side.

228
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:41,352
Untie us first. Hurry.

229
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:44,982
Are you out of your mind?

230
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,112
Don't move!

231
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:09,672
Shoot me then.

232
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:16,602
You don't think I can?

233
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:20,062
The doctor said she'll save my father.

234
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:22,352
I can't afford to miss this opportunity.

235
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:25,112
I'm not going to miss it.

236
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:27,822
Is that so?
Then you're going to have to shoot me.

237
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:28,942
Shoot!

238
00:26:37,032 --> 00:26:38,952
You foolish brat.

239
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:44,252
Have you forgotten what happened to your
sister? Do you want to end up like her?

240
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:52,132
My sister was not a Northern spy.

241
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:57,642
She was not a Northern spy!

242
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,322
Damn it.

243
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:10,672
You know that.
Our deal is based on give-and-take.

244
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:13,882
I need to be sure
you'll get my daughter out first

245
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:16,632
for me to send you
300 million dollars in three days.

246
00:28:16,722 --> 00:28:19,892
Thanks to your agent who got in the way,
our agents died

247
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:21,642
and things got more complicated.

248
00:28:21,722 --> 00:28:23,852
<i>If you think about it,
it's all come to this</i>

249
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:26,062
<i>because you couldn't keep
your man under control.</i>

250
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:28,102
If you don't send
300 million in three days,

251
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:30,482
your daughter will be killed first.

252
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:33,572
Ms. Choi.

253
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:35,072
Ms. Choi!

254
00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:38,782
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

255
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:48,292
What about Kwon?
You still can't reach him?

256
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:58,132
Since he went out for lunch,
we haven't been able to reach him.

257
00:28:58,222 --> 00:29:00,432
How am I supposed to reach him then?

258
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:02,182
I'm sorry, sir.

259
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:05,392
If it's urgent, I'll have
an expenditure secretary go and--

260
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:07,392
It's not the kind of money
a mere expenditure--

261
00:29:09,812 --> 00:29:12,942
Search all over the city if you have to.
Find him as soon as possible!

262
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:14,192
Yes, sir.

263
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:20,992
<i>Kim.</i>

264
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:22,992
Are you sure?

265
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:30,922
Pick it up.
The President wants to talk to you.

266
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:33,332
Me? Why--

267
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:35,632
Just pick it up, you bastard.

268
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:45,472
This is Chief An Gyeong-hui
of Anti-communist Investigations speaking.

269
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:49,642
I heard you once cleaned up
after my son Jun-pyo. Is that true?

270
00:29:54,152 --> 00:29:56,782
The election is just around the corner,

271
00:29:57,402 --> 00:30:00,822
so I couldn't let the opposition party
have anything to attack you with.

272
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:04,662
Besides, serving and protecting you,
the hero who saved our country,

273
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:07,082
is the most important job
of the ANSP, sir.

274
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:08,872
What are you talking about?

275
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:11,372
ANSP agents should strive
to ensure national security

276
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:13,422
<i>and protect our people.</i>

277
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:15,132
<i>To encourage you</i>

278
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:17,922
to be more faithful to your duties,

279
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:21,722
I'll appoint you
as the new chief of the Office

280
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:24,342
of Planning and Coordination.

281
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:28,312
Pardon, sir? Really, sir?

282
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:31,562
I appreciate it, sir!

283
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:36,192
I swear to serve you loyally
until I die, sir!

284
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:40,612
And continue to be in charge of the case.

285
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:45,122
My wife said
your briefing seemed reliable.

286
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:46,662
I'm honored, sir.

287
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:49,292
I swear on my life
I'll do my best to make sure

288
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:51,502
this case ends well for you, sir.

289
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,122
Yes, sir.

290
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,542
Hey. Let me talk to him.

291
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:56,712
Give it.

292
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:00,512
Sir, this is Tae-il.

293
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:10,682
No, you're too kind, sir.

294
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,392
Don't worry about me, sir.

295
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:27,372
What was that about?

296
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:32,702
What did he say
that you even swore on your life?

297
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:37,422
Well, it was just… He just appointed me

298
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:40,672
as the new chief of the Office
of Planning and Coordination.

299
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:41,962
Wow!

300
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:45,132
Chief of the OPC?
Then you're number two in the ANSP.

301
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:46,222
Stop that.

302
00:31:46,302 --> 00:31:47,972
Congratulations, sir.

303
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:50,052
My gosh.

304
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:52,392
There are no connections

305
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:54,892
between you and him whatsoever.

306
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:58,942
What, did you give the First Lady
some valuable information?

307
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,232
You should watch what you say.

308
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:08,282
The President is suffering from rumors

309
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:11,582
that he's appointed his closest man
as chief of the OPC,

310
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:14,452
controlling the ANSP
with his power of appointment and money.

311
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:16,122
You know that.

312
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:19,462
If you think that way,
it can't be good for the President.

313
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:30,602
Look at this bastard.

314
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:33,472
You're one sly bastard, aren't you?

315
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,982
I thought you were small fry,
but you're actually a sly snake?

316
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,402
When you deal with a snake,

317
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:43,902
you shouldn't step on its tail.

318
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:46,862
When it lifts its head,

319
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:50,662
you must trample on it
mercilessly to kill it. Got that?

320
00:33:00,462 --> 00:33:01,632
Damn it…

321
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:03,802
What? Adultery?

322
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:07,882
He transferred tens of accounts
to Hanju Bank Sogong Branch lately,

323
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:09,342
so I thought it was weird.

324
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:11,392
He and the female branch manager…

325
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:12,972
Where's Kwon right now?

326
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:15,602
His wife sued him for adultery,

327
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:18,522
so the police caught him red-handed
in a hotel earlier.

328
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:30,362
Who does the President have in mind
for the next chief of the OPC?

329
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:31,742
Look into it secretly.

330
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:35,872
I did, sir, and… it's unprecedented.

331
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:41,212
We got intel that
Chief An Gyeong-hui has been appointed.

332
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:43,632
Chief An?

333
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:46,672
You are?

334
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:50,262
You're going to be the Chief of the OPC?

335
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:53,432
Oh, my God!

336
00:33:55,892 --> 00:33:58,062
How amazing!

337
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:03,732
The fortuneteller said you were likely

338
00:34:03,812 --> 00:34:05,862
to climb the ladder. He's so good!

339
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,402
I knew he was right!

340
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:08,572
Really?

341
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:12,532
Then, Charlotte, ask that fortuneteller

342
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:17,372
if there's a way for that bastard
Nam Tae-il to drop dead.

343
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:22,872
That bastard kicked me in the shin again.
The same spot he kicked last time!

344
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:25,042
Honey, honey.

345
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:27,922
They say money will
take care of everything for you.

346
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:32,132
You'll soon have an astronomical amount
of money at your disposal.

347
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:33,432
So what's the problem?

348
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:37,182
What's that stupid Nam Tae-il?
He'll crawl to you. Just wait and see.

349
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:40,142
Listen, honey. I got to go.

350
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:42,442
I should call the fortuneteller.

351
00:34:43,392 --> 00:34:45,482
Has Mr. An been promoted?

352
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:47,232
What?

353
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:50,232
Not just any promotion.

354
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,572
The Chief of the OPC is
like Code 1's vault.

355
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:55,532
Not just anyone can get the job.

356
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:56,572
Congratulations--

357
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:59,292
Hello, sir. It's me.

358
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:02,462
My goodness. How are you so good, sir?

359
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,292
What you said has really happened.

360
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:06,632
Hello, ma'am.

361
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,842
Yes.

362
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:12,592
I'm thinking
of paying you a visit tomorrow.

363
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:14,472
Oh, right.

364
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:17,012
Isn't it time for you
to get new golf clubs?

365
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:19,762
What do you say to golden ones?

366
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:25,812
It's my pleasure.

367
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:28,692
All right. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

368
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:37,622
When did you come?

369
00:35:39,242 --> 00:35:40,202
What was it?

370
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:43,582
What was with the golden golf clubs?

371
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:47,752
If you bribe someone carelessly,
you might get into trouble later.

372
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:52,552
I'm so sorry,

373
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:56,092
but I have to go shopping now.

374
00:35:56,182 --> 00:35:59,222
Ms. Kim. Fit Ms. Cho for me, okay?

375
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:03,562
What? That's wrong. Just wrong!

376
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,272
How could you leave it to her?

377
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:08,902
Ms. Kim.

378
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:12,022
Push Ms. Cho's fitting back

379
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:14,242
to the day after tomorrow.

380
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:17,202
All right? Since I have
no time tomorrow too. Move.

381
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:21,992
Well, then.

382
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:25,662
Is she out of her mind?

383
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:27,082
What's wrong with her?

384
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,672
Has she gone insane?

385
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:32,002
Apparently, her husband has been
promoted to chief of the OPC.

386
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:35,052
Chief of the OPC? Mr. An has?

387
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:40,262
But how? He wasn't that good.

388
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:42,812
My goodness!

389
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:49,942
What? So are you saying

390
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:51,902
our government planned

391
00:36:52,272 --> 00:36:54,652
this whole hostage situation
with the North

392
00:36:54,732 --> 00:36:57,072
to win the presidential election?

393
00:36:57,152 --> 00:36:58,402
That's right.

394
00:36:59,032 --> 00:36:59,912
My God…

395
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:03,582
I was just ordered
to have Professor Han defect to the North.

396
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:06,122
I didn't come here to kill you

397
00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:09,502
or hold you hostage here.

398
00:37:10,582 --> 00:37:12,752
While being chased unexpectedly,

399
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:15,672
I ended up holding you hostage.

400
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:21,472
Do you expect us to believe that?
You pointed a gun at us and held us down.

401
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:24,472
We were so scared.
And it was so hard for us.

402
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:25,892
-She's right!
-I agree!

403
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:27,522
This is ridiculous!

404
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,482
What kind of nonsense is this?

405
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:31,232
"Take down the communist party.

406
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:32,902
Defeat the Northern army!"

407
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:37,192
This is the slogan we learned. There's
no way our government would do that!

408
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:41,572
I know it's absurd and hard to believe,
but it is true.

409
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:46,162
I had no idea and escaped without
the spies knowing yesterday afternoon

410
00:37:46,242 --> 00:37:48,332
to have the SWAT team
break in to save you.

411
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:50,292
But they shot at me.

412
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:52,502
-What?
-What's he talking about?

413
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:55,132
They shot at you, an ally?

414
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:56,052
What did he say?

415
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:58,382
My God.

416
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:06,512
They're capable
of much worse things than this.

417
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,352
My cousin was a member
of the labor union at his work.

418
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:12,942
He was dragged
to the re-education camp and died.

419
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:17,022
They don't hesitate to kill
people who cross them.

420
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:19,822
Of course they're capable of this.

421
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:26,742
Whatever.

422
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:29,252
Whether it's true or not,
what's that have to do with me?

423
00:38:29,912 --> 00:38:32,292
Release me right now. I have to study.

424
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:34,882
The bar exam is soon!

425
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:38,342
-Is she serious?
-Quiet!

426
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:43,592
You have no idea how serious this is.
It's not the time to be selfish.

427
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:45,392
If anything goes wrong,

428
00:38:45,472 --> 00:38:48,102
the ANSP will kill us
as well as the spies.

429
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:51,562
If they can win the election,
30 people's lives?

430
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:55,232
It's nothing to the ANSP.

431
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:02,242
All right.

432
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:04,492
I'll be straightforward.

433
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:08,282
So are you saying if we escape this place,

434
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:12,582
they're going to shoot at us
just like they did at him?

435
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,382
I hope such a thing won't happen.

436
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:20,212
But it might happen,
so I'm saying we should protect ourselves.

437
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:24,432
The South or the North,

438
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:27,302
the higher-ups don't give a damn
about our lives right now.

439
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:40,232
We have eight days left now.

440
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:42,992
Eight days until the election.

441
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,152
Mr. Lee and I will find

442
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:48,202
a way for us to get out alive until then.

443
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:52,372
As of this moment,

444
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,582
you're free to do whatever you want
within the dorm.

445
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:59,882
Don't forget that
every entrance and exit is booby-trapped.

446
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,132
I know it's hard for all of you,

447
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,762
but we must work together
if we're going to beat them.

448
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:09,802
I hope no one will try
to escape alone to save their skin.

449
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:15,182
I think you should supervise
the students from now on, Ms. Pi.

450
00:40:17,942 --> 00:40:19,192
Hold on.

451
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:21,982
There's someone we need to punish first.

452
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:31,372
Bun-ok has a gun.

453
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:34,412
The doctor's underling
has been tormenting us.

454
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:50,932
The Gizzard joined the spies' side!

455
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:53,972
That b**** pointed a gun at us!

456
00:40:54,062 --> 00:40:55,222
Hye-ryeong.

457
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:57,692
Ms. Pi already knows.

458
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:01,362
She knows?

459
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,032
She's still going to let her be?

460
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,662
Ms. Pi, you really know what she did?

461
00:41:10,242 --> 00:41:12,492
This is way worse than stealing!

462
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:14,032
This is not right!

463
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:21,332
Everyone, be quiet and sit down.

464
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:38,732
Starting tonight, you'll sleep
in the rooms on the second floor.

465
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,692
Those who don't have roommates,

466
00:41:40,772 --> 00:41:42,692
Gather in groups of four.

467
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:45,982
I'll sleep in my room.

468
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,372
Gye Bun-ok, stop right there!

469
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:01,462
I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?

470
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:04,712
Is she crazy?

471
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:08,462
How could she be so rude to her?

472
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:46,632
Pi, you little…

473
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,922
<i>You turned it off
without telling me last time.</i>

474
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:51,262
How is it in there?

475
00:42:55,932 --> 00:42:56,972
Ah.

476
00:42:57,392 --> 00:43:01,392
This is Gye Bun-ok,
the telephone operator of the dorm.

477
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:04,602
<i>Are you working for the ANSP?</i>

478
00:43:04,692 --> 00:43:06,562
Are you outside the dorm right now?

479
00:43:07,822 --> 00:43:10,282
Who are you? Where's Pi?

480
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:13,572
Please! Please listen to me.

481
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:16,202
<i>I have very important information.</i>

482
00:43:16,452 --> 00:43:18,992
<i>So I contacted you in Ms. Pi's place.</i>

483
00:43:21,662 --> 00:43:23,752
Important information? What is it?

484
00:43:24,462 --> 00:43:26,462
I am really on the ANSP's side.

485
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:30,092
If anything happens to me,
you must help me, okay?

486
00:43:30,672 --> 00:43:31,632
<i>Okay?</i>

487
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:34,222
All right. So what's the information?

488
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:38,352
What happened is,

489
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:42,182
Lim Soo-ho the spy
and the ANSP team leader--

490
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:46,982
Hello? Hey.

491
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:49,482
This little…

492
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:58,911
You…

493
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:02,951
How long have you been
in league with them?

494
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,501
I haven't. This is the first time.

495
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,961
That radio belongs to Ms. Pi.

496
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:13,921
I just found it in the restroom.

497
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:22,101
Since we found out you helped the spies,
did you need some insurance?

498
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:27,271
If there were bullets in the gun,
you would've killed Ms. Pi.

499
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:30,361
What you did was horrible,
but you don't regret your actions at all.

500
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:34,491
If Ms. Pi hadn't begged us to let you be,
we would've locked you in the basement.

501
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:37,611
Then you go about
doing something like this?

502
00:44:39,281 --> 00:44:42,661
Ms. Pi begged you to let me be?
She really did?

503
00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:54,761
Do you know how many crimes
you have committed?

504
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:57,091
Violating the National Security Law,

505
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:59,801
threatening to kill,
illegal possession of firearms,

506
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:02,351
and probably attempted murder too.

507
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:07,891
If you give the ANSP some information,
you think they'll let you off the hook?

508
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:10,771
Did you think catching a Northern spy

509
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:13,481
means a better performance review
and more incentives?

510
00:45:13,571 --> 00:45:14,441
I was…

511
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:16,821
forced.

512
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:20,201
I was forced to do it. That's all.

513
00:45:22,491 --> 00:45:24,701
If you try anything stupid once more,

514
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:27,661
I'll consider you a Northern spy.

515
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,671
Go upstairs.

516
00:45:46,181 --> 00:45:47,431
<i>There's good news.</i>

517
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:52,101
<i>Since the explosion and gunfight
this morning, it's been about ten hours.</i>

518
00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:56,071
<i>And it's been confirmed by the command
post that there were no casualties</i>

519
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:57,401
<i>from the explosion…</i>

520
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:03,201
Mr. Choi.

521
00:46:03,781 --> 00:46:05,871
Are there really no casualties?

522
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:07,371
It's not a cover-up?

523
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:13,291
How could no one have died
when bombs exploded?

524
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,551
I mean, that's such a relief.

525
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:23,761
You know my husband is trying his best

526
00:46:23,841 --> 00:46:28,521
to save every single hostage,
even on the day of Yeong-u's burial.

527
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:30,641
Okay.

528
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:33,851
Why don't you try and convince him
to call it a day now?

529
00:46:35,061 --> 00:46:36,651
Okay. Thank you.

530
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:52,331
CAFETERIA, LOUNGE

531
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:57,921
<i>-Give them back!
-Give them back!</i>

532
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:08,061
Your father must've come too, right?

533
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:10,141
Where is he?

534
00:47:10,221 --> 00:47:13,231
Where is my future father-in-law?

535
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:20,941
He must be busy.
I think he's too busy to come.

536
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:22,821
I see.

537
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:25,531
Are you upset about that?

538
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:28,161
It's all right.
Oh Gwang-tae is here for you.

539
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:30,041
Mom!

540
00:47:30,121 --> 00:47:34,751
My goodness, I knew she'd be so shocked.

541
00:47:34,831 --> 00:47:36,751
I'm sure she hasn't even
drunk a drop of water.

542
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:38,791
Mom…

543
00:47:38,881 --> 00:47:41,211
Oh, my goodness. My mom looks all haggard.

544
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:43,261
I feel so bad for my dad too.

545
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:45,221
Can't we just go outside?

546
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:47,181
Didn't you hear the ANSP guy?

547
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:49,221
They'll shoot at us!

548
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:52,391
Dream on.
We all know the doctor is a Northern spy.

549
00:47:52,471 --> 00:47:53,431
They won't let us go.

550
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:55,227
Anyway...

551
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:58,311
Then we shouldn't trust
they're going to let us live?

552
00:47:58,401 --> 00:48:01,781
Oh, poor Hye-ryeong.
You've been believing them all this time?

553
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:06,531
Look, in this situation, we can't
trust the ANSP agent or the spies.

554
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:08,201
They just want to save their skin.

555
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:11,581
Who knows? They might be not letting us go
to use us as shields.

556
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:14,121
What do we do?

557
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:15,541
Look at that.

558
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:16,711
Oh, no.

559
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:20,541
<i>…if I think about the communists
who did those horrible things,</i>

560
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:24,671
<i>I feel so furious
that I feel like I'm going to die.</i>

561
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,511
<i>Fellow citizens, we must become stronger.</i>

562
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:29,511
<i>We need to become stronger</i>

563
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:33,521
<i>for the communists
to not even think about coming to hurt us.</i>

564
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:37,901
You picked the right person.
Did you have her rehearse it?

565
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,811
She caught on quickly,
so it wasn't difficult.

566
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:42,981
<i>Even in this desperate situation,</i>

567
00:48:43,071 --> 00:48:46,321
<i>their anti-communism stays strong,
and it's moving to see.</i>

568
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:51,161
<i>In order not to let any Northern spy
or pro-Communist set foot in our country,</i>

569
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:53,331
<i>all of the citizens must cooperate.</i>

570
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,251
Yes, they must cooperate.

571
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:58,791
I feel like I can hear
the approval rating going up.

572
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:02,041
Oh, right.

573
00:49:03,211 --> 00:49:04,631
Have you found the recording?

574
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:09,091
Gal is such a tenacious bastard,
so he's still holding out.

575
00:49:10,011 --> 00:49:11,971
But if we bring his mother
and threaten him,

576
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:15,181
what can he do? He'll talk soon.

577
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:18,391
<i>-We need all the citizens on full alert.</i>
-Come here.

578
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:20,981
<i>-I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>
-Come on.

579
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:25,231
I'm not going to hit you. Come here.

580
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:33,281
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what you're best at.

581
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:37,161
If a worm acts like a snake

582
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:40,749
and aspires to become a dragon,
it'll end up getting hurt. Okay?

583
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:43,541
-Yes, sir.
-Good job.

584
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:53,351
We're not going to make it
without Han-na's help.

585
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:55,471
We need to bring her in first.

586
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:00,271
Fine.

587
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:02,481
But I don't think

588
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:06,151
you should tell her
Kang Cheong-ya is a Northern spy.

589
00:50:06,231 --> 00:50:07,361
What do you mean?

590
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:12,071
Han-na must know that
to find out who's behind Kang.

591
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:15,741
And we need to find that out
to use it as our winning move.

592
00:50:15,831 --> 00:50:18,541
If Nam Tae-il finds out
Kang is a Northern spy,

593
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:20,501
he's going to try to kill all the hostages

594
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:23,251
before we could make our winning move.

595
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,541
Nam Tae-il?

596
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,131
He's the one who sent Kang in here.

597
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:38,431
She's infiltrated that deep?

598
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:40,981
I never imagined…

599
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:43,771
Then she's a step away
from entering the Blue House.

600
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:46,861
You think you can convince Kang Cheong-ya?

601
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:56,831
Do you want to die?

602
00:50:57,331 --> 00:51:00,831
How could you help
the traitor who fell for a girl--

603
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:04,881
Say what you will about Comrade Lim,
but I trust him!

604
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,211
He saved me during the training.

605
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,051
And he's the only one
who'll save me again!

606
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:10,381
You bastard.

607
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:12,551
Untie me before I beat you to death.

608
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:14,051
Untie me, you bastard!

609
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:15,091
Comrade Joo.

610
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:19,561
I don't think he can hear you yet,
so stop it.

611
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:30,361
<i>Eliminate Taedong River 1?</i>

612
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:54,671
Oh, no!

613
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:46,851
What's your name?

614
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:58,361
We agents shouldn't even ask
each other's names.

615
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:00,031
You know that.

616
00:55:00,651 --> 00:55:01,861
I'm Kang Cheong-ya.

617
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:05,491
My grandfather, who was
an independence activist, named me so

618
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:07,081
hoping I'd prepare for crises.

619
00:55:07,991 --> 00:55:10,331
-That's not my real name though.
-I didn't hear that.

620
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:19,301
That necklace…

621
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:21,921
Can you give it to--

622
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:24,681
No, can you sell it to me?

623
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:30,311
After another ideology education

624
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:33,731
and intensive training,
I'll have to go back to Seoul.

625
00:55:35,811 --> 00:55:37,521
And I have a feeling

626
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:41,691
-that will keep me alive.
-I'm sorry,

627
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:46,531
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

628
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,621
If…

629
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:57,961
If we ever meet again,

630
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:00,631
I will repay you…

631
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:04,221
for saving my life.

632
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:48,131
Did you want to see me, sir?

633
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:53,431
What I'm about to tell you

634
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:56,561
must stay between you and me
for the time being.

635
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:58,731
I understand, sir.

636
00:56:58,811 --> 00:57:02,191
You'll be officially appointed
as chief of the OPC tomorrow.

637
00:57:02,271 --> 00:57:05,191
Come up with 300 million dollars
with secret funds right away.

638
00:57:06,151 --> 00:57:08,861
300 million dollars?

639
00:57:09,201 --> 00:57:10,281
But that much money--

640
00:57:10,371 --> 00:57:12,951
You know that the hostage situation
is the election scheme.

641
00:57:13,491 --> 00:57:15,911
Treat it as working expenses,
and there'll be no problem.

642
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:18,871
Understood, sir.

643
00:57:21,711 --> 00:57:24,001
Oh, and, let's have a drink together soon.

644
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,241
You're just watching this guy
ripping the squid for me.

645
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:54,281
You're witless and tactless.

646
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:57,411
You're just feisty. That's all you are.
My goodness.

647
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:01,331
Hey. What did you come here again for?

648
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:03,501
You should rest at home.

649
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,591
Give me the camcorder.

650
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:11,721
Right. You want to see
your daughter's face? Here.

651
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:13,431
Have one.

652
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:16,851
The camcorder.

653
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:22,601
Don't worry.
Now that we've calmed down the parents,

654
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:25,111
once we receive the camcorder,
everything will go--

655
00:58:25,191 --> 00:58:27,531
-They didn't send it out yet?
-God, you startled me.

656
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:31,151
Those bastards just wouldn't listen to me.
How can I make them--

657
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,121
This damn bastard.

658
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:37,831
You bastard! What's taking you so long?

659
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:39,661
Send the camcorder out!

660
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:40,961
Fine.

661
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:42,541
Send Han-na in.

662
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:51,881
I think a bowl of chicken soup
will heal me. No, it's okay!

663
00:58:58,221 --> 00:59:00,101
What kind of chicken soup
do the South eat?

664
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:03,481
Chicken soup.

665
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:04,731
Chicken soup?

666
00:59:06,771 --> 00:59:09,111
<i>Samgyetang?</i> Or old plain chicken soup?

667
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:19,241
Along with 50 fried chickens.

668
00:59:19,331 --> 00:59:20,451
What?

669
00:59:20,871 --> 00:59:22,001
Fried chicken?

670
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:24,371
Are you out of your mind?

671
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:26,131
What a nerve they've got.

672
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:27,631
After the explosion, what?

673
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,301
The reporters will find it odd too.

674
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:32,301
Sending in fried chicken after a gunfight…

675
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:35,091
Look. Just be grateful
for what we give you.

676
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:37,101
We'll send in some snacks--

677
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:39,431
We can send them in
without the reporters knowing.

678
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:42,681
It's possible if we use
the exit in the shrine.

679
00:59:44,441 --> 00:59:46,351
I'll make sure they won't find out.

680
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:12,461
Where's Mr. Lee?

681
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:13,721
Put them in and leave.

682
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:29,651
Put the gun down.

683
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:39,031
Close the door.

684
01:00:59,341 --> 01:01:00,261
What's this?

685
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:01,351
It's chicken!

686
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:13,901
Where's Mr. Lee?

687
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:25,621
God, I can't get used to this.

688
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:28,831
You're standing side by side with a spy.

689
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:30,751
But I feel relieved.

690
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:37,761
Let's eat first.

691
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,721
Why did you tell him I'm your fiancée?

692
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:48,231
You had something to tell me.

693
01:01:51,851 --> 01:01:53,151
But it's true

694
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:55,981
we were engaged.

695
01:02:01,611 --> 01:02:03,071
So you remember that.

696
01:02:06,451 --> 01:02:07,911
But why did you leave me?

697
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:22,721
What's that?

698
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:27,181
What are they doing?

699
01:02:28,431 --> 01:02:29,731
-Oh, no.
<i>-Quiet!</i>

700
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:30,891
Oh, no.

701
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,481
<i>Keep in line.</i>

702
01:02:32,561 --> 01:02:35,611
<i>One, two, one, two. Keep in line.</i>

703
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:39,071
Those who were released yesterday

704
01:02:39,651 --> 01:02:42,321
didn't go home.
They were taken to the ANSP.

705
01:02:43,781 --> 01:02:47,871
Can you see now that this hostage
situation is a scheme for the election?

706
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:52,621
They must want to show
how the students being held by the spies

707
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:55,081
are trembling with fear on TV.

708
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:56,841
Once that is aired,

709
01:02:57,801 --> 01:03:00,171
what do you think
people will begin to think?

710
01:03:00,761 --> 01:03:02,881
"Let's go knock down
those horrendous spies!"

711
01:03:03,381 --> 01:03:04,641
Something like that.

712
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:05,761
That's right.

713
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:07,431
People will hate communists even more.

714
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:10,101
That'll put the ruling party
at an advantage.

715
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:11,851
What will happen to us?

716
01:03:11,931 --> 01:03:14,151
The more likely
the ruling party is to win the election,

717
01:03:14,231 --> 01:03:16,561
the less likely we're to live.

718
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:20,401
Now,

719
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:24,531
how should we look when we're filmed then?

720
01:03:24,611 --> 01:03:27,451
Do you see what I'm trying to say?

721
01:03:28,121 --> 01:03:29,291
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

722
01:03:34,251 --> 01:03:36,461
<i>There are cameras from TV stations too.</i>

723
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:39,171
So let's hang a banner
outside the windows of the lounge

724
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:42,261
that says this is all a scheme
for the election.

725
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:43,801
Are you insane?

726
01:03:45,431 --> 01:03:46,931
Once we hang the banner,

727
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:50,101
the North will think I've betrayed them.

728
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:51,721
Then my sister,

729
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:55,561
Eung-cheol and Joo's families
will all be put in danger.

730
01:03:58,231 --> 01:03:59,691
Do you have any other ideas?

731
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:06,661
Duplicate the recording I gave you,
and send it out to the press.

732
01:04:07,371 --> 01:04:10,701
Will it work? Our agents are stationed
at every newspaper and TV station.

733
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:13,041
We'll directly send them
to managing editors.

734
01:04:13,121 --> 01:04:16,211
They won't stay quiet
if they see hard evidence, would they?

735
01:04:17,211 --> 01:04:20,381
Especially the TV station
that covered the abduction of Han I-seop.

736
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:24,131
Besides,

737
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:27,431
I think that's the only way
to get Gal out.

738
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:30,851
Then let's try that first.

739
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:36,481
Then we should duplicate it first, right?

740
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:38,231
I'll do it.

741
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:58,331
EVERGREEN RECORDS

742
01:05:12,011 --> 01:05:14,101
How much is it? Hurry!

743
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:15,471
It's 2,500 won.

744
01:05:18,771 --> 01:05:20,481
I'm sorry. I'll buy it next time.

745
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,821
<i>I wondered what it'd feel like</i>

746
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:10,321
<i>to fall in love at first sight.</i>

747
01:06:11,661 --> 01:06:14,531
<i>But the moment I saw him,
I felt it right away.</i>

748
01:06:15,741 --> 01:06:18,291
<i>Our hands brushed just briefly,</i>

749
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:20,751
<i>but my heart began to pound.</i>

750
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:24,131
<i>Is this</i>

751
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:26,551
<i>first love?</i>

752
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:30,761
He must like

753
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:32,301
paper airplanes too.

754
01:06:32,841 --> 01:06:37,271
It was such a shame
that I couldn't pick his paper airplane.

755
01:06:37,351 --> 01:06:39,231
It really was.

756
01:06:40,981 --> 01:06:42,981
But at Evergreen Bookstore…

757
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:53,741
Why did we have to bump into each other
then of all times?

758
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:56,241
<i>What if I looked like a fool?</i>

759
01:06:57,701 --> 01:07:00,791
<i>It's all right, Yeong-ro.
It was embarrassing,</i>

760
01:07:02,461 --> 01:07:04,291
but I got to see him again.

761
01:07:12,721 --> 01:07:14,551
I felt like

762
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:16,551
<i>my heart was going to explode.</i>

763
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:20,311
<i>Does this mean</i>

764
01:07:21,231 --> 01:07:23,851
<i>we're meant to be together?</i>

765
01:07:24,771 --> 01:07:26,111
<i>Goodness.</i>

766
01:07:27,321 --> 01:07:28,821
Meant to be together?

767
01:07:29,821 --> 01:07:30,941
Jeong-min!

768
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,071
You fell head over heels for him.

769
01:08:14,401 --> 01:08:15,571
Yeong-ro.

770
01:08:19,121 --> 01:08:20,531
<i>-It's on. Mom!
-Mom!</i>

771
01:08:20,621 --> 01:08:22,121
<i>I didn't gain much weight.</i>

772
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,711
<i>-She's on her second chicken.
-Stop it.</i>

773
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:26,921
<i>This is so yummy.</i>

774
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:29,791
<i>I'll get out of here soon,
so take care until then.</i>

775
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:30,961
<i>Got that?</i>

776
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:34,301
<i>My God, this is so freaking delicious.</i>

777
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:35,971
<i>Thank you for the food!</i>

778
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:39,551
So you filmed them
stuffing themselves with fried chicken?

779
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,011
No, it wasn't me.

780
01:08:42,641 --> 01:08:45,681
I was kept in the basement
until they gave it to me.

781
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:49,151
Those goddamn idiots.

782
01:08:49,771 --> 01:08:52,731
They can't do anything right
except shooting guns.

783
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:56,241
How could they film it like this?
We can't air it on TV!

784
01:08:56,321 --> 01:09:00,411
You should have told him it was for
raising awareness of national security.

785
01:09:01,531 --> 01:09:04,541
But you told him it was for calming
the parents down. So that happened.

786
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:07,211
Right!

787
01:09:08,621 --> 01:09:11,421
It's my fault. It's all my fault!

788
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:13,131
I'm to blame.

789
01:09:13,211 --> 01:09:16,381
Oh, my. I'm so sorry,
Mr. Chief of the OPS.

790
01:09:16,631 --> 01:09:19,431
-Are you okay, sir?
-Hey.

791
01:09:19,511 --> 01:09:21,801
He's been promoted to chief of the OPS.

792
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,721
I'm so sorry, sir.

793
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:25,931
Unlike director positions,

794
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:28,771
chief positions last long, they say.

795
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:30,731
<i>Yeong-ro, say something too.</i>

796
01:09:30,811 --> 01:09:34,821
<i>I'm Eun Yeong-ro, an English Literature
major and freshman from room 207.</i>

797
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:38,701
<i>Dad, all of us are doing well in the dorm.</i>

798
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:40,781
<i>We can't complain.</i>

799
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:44,081
<i>But everyone wants to get out of here.</i>

800
01:09:44,621 --> 01:09:48,251
<i>And me too. I also want to get out badly.</i>

801
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:51,961
<i>We can all get out of here safely, right?</i>

802
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:54,171
<i>When we get out of here,</i>

803
01:09:54,751 --> 01:09:57,551
<i>we'll be able to go home safely,</i>

804
01:09:58,091 --> 01:09:59,091
<i>right?</i>

805
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:02,221
<i>Right, Dad?</i>

806
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,861
Wait. My gosh.

807
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,611
Dr. Kang…

808
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:24,331
Oh, no. She looks all haggard now.
Poor Dr. Kang.

809
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:25,701
Darn it…

810
01:10:58,191 --> 01:10:59,491
Follow them with the chicken.

811
01:11:09,161 --> 01:11:11,291
These Southern guys…

812
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,961
Their fried chicken is…

813
01:11:19,671 --> 01:11:20,801
Come here.

814
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:40,731
An influential spy like you

815
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:43,451
must be confident
that the party will never abandon you.

816
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:45,741
Of course not.

817
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:48,741
I'll be abandoned eventually.

818
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:00,301
Defect to the South,
then the ANSP will protect you.

819
01:12:00,381 --> 01:12:02,721
If you want,
they'll give you a new identity,

820
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:05,051
and you can continue to be a doctor.

821
01:12:09,761 --> 01:12:12,221
For that to happen,
the opposition party must win.

822
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:23,151
If we can let people know this hostage
situation is a scheme for the election,

823
01:12:23,241 --> 01:12:24,571
we stand a chance.

824
01:12:24,651 --> 01:12:27,661
Besides, it's not a rigged election
anymore. People go vote themselves.

825
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:29,581
The transfer of power…

826
01:12:30,991 --> 01:12:32,081
It's possible.

827
01:12:44,471 --> 01:12:45,971
All those revolutions

828
01:12:46,721 --> 01:12:48,051
and missions…

829
01:12:49,971 --> 01:12:52,011
Don't you want to live…

830
01:12:54,811 --> 01:12:56,641
freely without them?

831
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:13,331
Can I have a cup of coffee?

832
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:34,891
What are you doing, Comrade Kang?

833
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:37,521
Are you betraying our country too?

834
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:49,991
Comrade Kang!

835
01:13:53,081 --> 01:13:54,701
Comrade Kang!

836
01:13:58,411 --> 01:13:59,461
Comrade Joo.

837
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:05,801
I know you won't change your mind easily.

838
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:06,711
Shut up.

839
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:08,971
I get that you like that wench.

840
01:14:09,051 --> 01:14:11,931
But how could you choose her
over your family in the North?

841
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:16,391
"Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

842
01:14:16,681 --> 01:14:19,811
So if you sense any change in
his ideology, kill him."

843
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:23,111
I guess I was ordered so for a reason.

844
01:14:26,691 --> 01:14:29,191
Who ordered to kill me?

845
01:14:33,281 --> 01:14:36,331
Even if you get out of here alive,
you can't go back to the North.

846
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:40,001
And you won't be able to live freely
here with that wench either.

847
01:14:42,921 --> 01:14:46,041
Because our country will
hunt you down and kill you.

848
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:54,051
Answer my question.

849
01:14:57,011 --> 01:14:58,181
Who ordered you?

850
01:15:01,391 --> 01:15:03,271
That doesn't matter.

851
01:15:04,561 --> 01:15:07,191
You were a card to discard to begin with.

852
01:15:56,071 --> 01:15:57,201
Wait…

853
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:36,491
<i>Who ordered to kill me?</i>

854
01:16:37,071 --> 01:16:38,661
That doesn't matter.

855
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:42,331
You were a card to discard to begin with.

856
01:18:19,721 --> 01:18:22,761
I wanted to make you some coffee.

857
01:18:50,251 --> 01:18:53,081
My mom used to love this coffee.

858
01:18:56,461 --> 01:18:57,801
My dad's new wife

859
01:18:58,671 --> 01:19:01,471
threw out all of my mom's belongings.

860
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:05,431
But I never let her throw this out
until the end.

861
01:19:11,021 --> 01:19:14,771
Sitting still and
watching the coffee being made like this

862
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,071
strangely makes me feel at ease.

863
01:19:39,961 --> 01:19:42,551
How did you end up
becoming a secret agent?

864
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:53,601
It's just that…

865
01:19:54,641 --> 01:19:57,901
you didn't have to take up
such a dangerous job.

866
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:21,461
No one can choose their country
when they're born.

867
01:20:24,381 --> 01:20:26,261
I was born there…

868
01:20:29,141 --> 01:20:30,931
and given this job.

869
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:39,231
Can't you just quit
if you don't want to do it?

870
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:50,871
<i>Have you ever killed a person?</i>

871
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:54,911
Pull the trigger, and it's over.

872
01:20:55,581 --> 01:20:56,541
No.

873
01:20:57,921 --> 01:20:59,251
It's not over.

874
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:02,751
The eyes of the first person you kill
will haunt you forever.

875
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:06,011
The eyes of the person
whose life slips away…

876
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:08,011
will follow you around

877
01:21:09,051 --> 01:21:10,431
when you eat or sleep.

878
01:21:11,141 --> 01:21:12,511
Even

879
01:21:13,431 --> 01:21:15,311
in your dreams.

880
01:21:50,761 --> 01:21:51,601
You know…

881
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:55,561
To tell the truth,
this isn't any ordinary coffee.

882
01:21:59,901 --> 01:22:01,061
If you drink it,

883
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:06,901
all your bad memories will be erased.

884
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:17,791
Why are you laughing? I'm serious.

885
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:23,251
Whenever something bad happened,
I drank this and erased those memories.

886
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:28,051
What should I erase today?

887
01:22:29,171 --> 01:22:30,511
What should I erase?

888
01:22:40,521 --> 01:22:44,611
I just erased the memories
of me singing at Evergreen Records.

889
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:58,251
Hey. Stop laughing.

890
01:22:58,831 --> 01:23:01,961
Come on. I said I just erased them.

891
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:04,211
But I didn't.

892
01:23:07,591 --> 01:23:10,171
-Then drink it and erase them now.
-I don't want to.

893
01:23:10,471 --> 01:23:12,881
But you should.

894
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:14,301
I don't want to.

895
01:23:17,721 --> 01:23:18,561
Darn it.

896
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:35,491
After you left,

897
01:23:36,451 --> 01:23:40,451
you didn't call once,
so I was upset and hated you for it.

898
01:23:41,871 --> 01:23:43,041
I just erased it.

899
01:24:27,211 --> 01:24:29,501
I held a gun to your head.

900
01:24:36,221 --> 01:24:37,641
I erased the memory.

901
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:13,091
That memory…

902
01:25:20,721 --> 01:25:22,351
I erased it as well.

903
01:26:19,571 --> 01:26:20,661
Then…

904
01:26:28,001 --> 01:26:29,411
erase this memory too.

905
01:27:17,591 --> 01:27:19,461
<i>There's someone spying for us inside.</i>

906
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:21,051
<i>There's a mole in here?</i>

907
01:27:22,091 --> 01:27:23,591
<i>Someone stole chickens.</i>

908
01:27:23,681 --> 01:27:25,721
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

909
01:27:25,801 --> 01:27:27,181
<i>Someone in the dorm.</i>

910
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:28,971
<i>But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.</i>

911
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:30,351
<i>You should search her room first.</i>

912
01:27:31,351 --> 01:27:34,021
<i>-Ms. Oh disappeared.
-Ms. Oh did?</i>

913
01:27:34,101 --> 01:27:35,151
<i>Did you search the cafeteria?</i>

914
01:27:35,731 --> 01:27:36,691
<i>What about the serving area?</i>

915
01:27:39,571 --> 01:27:41,361
<i>Is this bastard…</i>

916
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:43,611
<i>He's trying so hard.</i>

917
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:45,871
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

918
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:47,911
<i>What do you gain by turning against us?</i>

919
01:27:47,991 --> 01:27:49,201
What do we do now?

920
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:52,001
What do you think?
We should kill them all.

921
01:27:53,581 --> 01:27:55,291
<i>Should I pull the trigger?</i>

922
01:27:55,381 --> 01:27:56,921
You think I have anything to fear?

923
01:27:57,001 --> 01:27:59,421
<i>You'll never end up with her.</i>

924
01:28:00,001 --> 01:28:01,091
<i>I don't…</i>

925
01:28:02,221 --> 01:28:03,931
<i>want her to suffer anymore.</i>

926
01:28:10,141 --> 01:28:12,931
