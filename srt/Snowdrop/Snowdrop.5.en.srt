EPISODE 5

3
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:53,343
<i>We're covering
the dorm's front door. Over.</i>

4
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:57,305
<i>We're approaching too as I speak. Over.</i>

5
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,096
Lim Soo-ho!

6
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:45,228
Drop the guns!

7
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:47,397
Lim Soo-ho.

8
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:49,816
You're surrounded.

9
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:53,403
Stay away.

10
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,446
I'll shoot her.

11
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,364
Come down.

12
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:01,953
Stay away!

13
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,079
Stay away!

14
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:05,290
The students will get hurt.

15
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,880
Hey, it's all right.

16
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:14,299
Don't be scared.

17
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,676
It's all right.

18
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,728
Drop the guns.

19
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,235
Do it in three seconds, or she's dead.

20
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:38,614
One.

21
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:43,703
Two.

22
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:51,377
Lim Soo-ho.

23
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:05,975
Three.

24
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:13,900
Comrade!

25
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:45,556
<i>Detective Jang.</i>

26
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,558
Who shoots during a civil defense drill?

27
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,143
Don't tell me

28
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:51,104
war's broken out.

29
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,659
Hang in there, Mr. Lee.

30
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,007
Mr. Lee, just hang in there.

31
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:21,300
You'll be okay.

32
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,224
Damn it.

33
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,605
God damn bastards…

34
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,747
Stop it!

35
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:51,474
I've run out of ammo.

36
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:29,804
-Hold fire!
-Hold fire!

37
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:32,014
Hold fire, you idiots!

38
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,193
Those bastards.

39
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:55,621
<i>Ballistic shields, go!</i>

40
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,640
Damn it.

41
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:27,737
-Aim guns!
-Aim guns!

42
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:06,859
<i>We need backup inside the dorm.
We need backup.</i>

43
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:09,737
<i>The fourth unit, ETA one minute.</i>

44
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:12,323
<i>Shield unit, advance.</i>

45
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:27,421
Watch out!

46
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:28,589
Mr. Lee!

47
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:07,545
He has grenades!

48
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,524
Drop the guns.

49
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:34,029
Lower your guns.

50
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,076
Lim Soo-ho.

51
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,580
She's just a student.

52
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:50,755
Get out.

53
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,548
All of you!

54
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:03,851
Get out.

55
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,104
All units, withdraw.

56
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,152
Wait.

57
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:19,492
You're in charge, right?

58
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,245
You stay.

59
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,372
He's been shot,

60
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:27,291
but you'll hold him hostage?

61
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,459
Listen carefully.

62
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,506
If you attack us,

63
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:37,635
I'll kill him first.

64
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:47,269
All right.

65
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:49,438
I'll stay here,

66
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,065
but let the students go.

67
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:53,692
Are you crazy? You've been shot!

68
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:55,402
You hypocritical bastards.

69
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:57,196
Get out.

70
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,324
I'll never leave without you.

71
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:02,409
He'll never be able to escape anyway.

72
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:04,995
-Capture him if you can.
-Sir.

73
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:05,955
Go now.

74
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:08,457
Get out.

75
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,917
No…

76
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:17,550
No, I can't! Let go of me!

77
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,260
-All units, withdraw!
-No!

78
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:22,012
Let go of me, you bastards!

79
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,602
-No!
-Call for medics now!

80
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:29,937
-Many are injured.
-Let go!

81
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,188
I have to go back!

82
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:34,066
-Let go of me!
-Get the transportation ready!

83
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:45,786
Come with me.

84
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:09,268
What about Professor Han?

85
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:11,812
The other members will take him safely.

86
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:13,981
What do we do now?

87
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:16,817
We must get
to the rendezvous point by 22:00.

88
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:21,196
We'll get out of here
and join the other agents at all costs.

89
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,823
I'll block all of the doors.

90
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,118
Gather all the hostages
in the cafeteria on the second floor.

91
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:28,746
Yes, sir.

92
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,435
Come out.

93
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:52,603
Now!

94
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,480
Come out here!

95
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:57,358
Move it!

96
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:58,776
Move faster.

97
00:13:58,859 --> 00:13:59,818
Faster.

98
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:01,820
Hey, you there.

99
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,281
Move it.

100
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,910
I'm coming.

101
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:11,580
Hey.

102
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:13,248
Come out here.

103
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:17,753
Move it!

104
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,674
You too, idiot. Now!

105
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:42,236
This is crazy. God damn it.

106
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,953
There are men injured. We need medics.

107
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:53,539
Black Tiger's been shot.

108
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:56,458
And he's taken hostage with students.

109
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,253
<i>We need more backup right now. Over.</i>

110
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:01,130
What do you mean?

111
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:04,049
Are you saying

112
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,760
they're holding people hostage
in the dorm? Over.

113
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:09,471
Taedong River 1 threatened
with grenades, so we couldn't help it.

114
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:12,224
<i>But there are just three of them.</i>

115
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,476
It won't be hard to take them down. Over.

116
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,229
Stand by.

117
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,441
Stay put until I give you orders.

118
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:22,901
<i>-Over and out.</i>
-There are men injured.

119
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:24,028
We need medics.

120
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,326
Hold people hostage
in the middle of Seoul?

121
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,662
What, do these bastards have a death wish?

122
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,458
Wait a minute.

123
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,377
If the chairman finds out
that I've sent the forces…

124
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:42,796
Damn it.

125
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,345
Ms. Choi.

126
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:52,806
Ms. Choi.

127
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,683
Don't you know I'm fitting Ms. Hong?

128
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,645
It's your husband. I told him,
but he still wanted to speak to you.

129
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,733
It must be something urgent. Go ahead.

130
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:04,318
Excuse me, then.

131
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:09,823
What is it this time?

132
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,326
What? Spies?

133
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:27,674
<i>Slow down. What's going on?</i>

134
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,011
<i>In the Hosu Women's University dorm,</i>

135
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,764
Northern spies are holding people hostage!

136
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,766
Holding people hostage?

137
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:38,102
<i>In the Hosu University dorm?</i>

138
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:41,730
Wait. Hold on.

139
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:45,275
Whether he'll ascend into the sky
with a magical bead

140
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,028
or die from falling off a horse,

141
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,782
<i>it all depends on 13 young virgins.</i>

142
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,158
Oh, my God.

143
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,829
Then Eun Chang-su
is destined to become king?

144
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:59,957
<i>What the hell are you talking about?</i>

145
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,086
If our chairman finds out
that I sent the forces, I'll catch hell!

146
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,505
Honey.

147
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:09,258
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

148
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:13,512
Eun Chang-su might be able
to become a future presidential candidate

149
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:14,721
instead of Nam Tae-il.

150
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:15,889
<i>What?</i>

151
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,100
The chairman might?

152
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:19,393
How do you know that?

153
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:20,978
This fortuneteller said…

154
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:24,314
Never mind. It's a long story.

155
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:28,235
Anyway, you mustn't get
on Eun Chang-su's bad side from now on.

156
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:29,778
Then.

157
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:33,615
What happened is that Gang-mu
went to catch him against my orders.

158
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:37,786
Of course. It's true
that bastard never listens to you.

159
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,080
Yes, it is! Wait and see.

160
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:41,707
Gang-mu, that bastard…

161
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,792
<i>I'll teach him a proper lesson this time.</i>

162
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,389
I'm going to Nam Mountain.

163
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:58,891
Get the car ready.

164
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,356
You can't pull that out.
If you do, we'll all die.

165
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:12,946
Hold on.

166
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:23,165
If you move, it'll explode.

167
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:32,341
Don't move.

168
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:37,804
Oh, no.

169
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:39,389
Stay still.

170
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:41,266
Don't move.

171
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:16,468
Move!

172
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:18,011
Keep your heads down!

173
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:21,848
Keep your heads down!

174
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:23,267
Stay in line.

175
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:26,311
-Move faster.
-Stay in line!

176
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:29,606
What? There's more?

177
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,149
Move faster!

178
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,235
Keep up!

179
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,127
Go in a single line.

180
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,505
Eyes on the head
of the person in front of you.

181
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,217
Move faster. Keep up.

182
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,678
Move it.

183
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:02,848
In a single line.

184
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:04,725
Keep your heads down.

185
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:10,355
Walk.

186
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,651
Hey, you!

187
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,028
Keep up.

188
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:17,904
Keep your heads down!

189
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:19,865
Keep your heads down.

190
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:22,409
Move it, you bastard.

191
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,666
Put your head on the wall.

192
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,293
Now, you bastard.

193
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,672
Stay quiet with your head down.

194
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,400
I can't find Ms. Pi.

195
00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:59,237
Has anyone seen the hall director?

196
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,283
Maybe she ran alone to save her skin.

197
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,911
-Seriously? No way.
-She abandoned us?

198
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:07,829
What do we do?

199
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,331
Quiet!

200
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:16,421
Lim Soo-ho!

201
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,217
Drop the guns in three seconds,
or she's dead.

202
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,642
Ms. Pi.

203
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,646
Hey!

204
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:37,692
Who are you?

205
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:41,363
What's this?

206
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,324
Are you sure you searched thoroughly?

207
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:46,785
Yes, I searched every floor.

208
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:49,413
Where have you been?

209
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:51,123
I'm the hall director here.

210
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:55,585
Do you think you guys know
about this building better than I do?

211
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:00,132
Shut up!

212
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:05,554
You little…

213
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,851
Ms. Pi.

214
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:12,269
Ms. Pi.

215
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,022
Hush. Stop crying
and pull yourselves together.

216
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:19,067
Even spider webs can become
really strong when put together.

217
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,527
Keep in line!

218
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:23,155
You.

219
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:25,907
And you.

220
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:29,369
-Move!
-You.

221
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:31,872
Keep your heads down!

222
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:33,915
Stand by the windows.

223
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,710
Why? Why do they
have to stand by the windows?

224
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:38,670
Shut your mouth.

225
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,132
Don't be scared.

226
00:22:42,716 --> 00:22:45,635
They're making you stand by the windows
so that they won't be attacked.

227
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:47,679
Hey.

228
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:49,890
You think that'll keep you safe?

229
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:52,058
You obviously stand no chance.

230
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:56,104
Since it's a counterespionage op,
military forces will be sent here.

231
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,149
It will be hundreds of
special forces soldiers…

232
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:02,527
and just three of you.

233
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:05,989
On top of that, you're injured.

234
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,909
Are you sure you can even hold out?

235
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,786
Wouldn't it be better to just surrender?

236
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:33,308
You're the one who shot me, aren't you?

237
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:38,855
If anything goes wrong,
I'll kill you first.

238
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:47,656
Stand by the windows!

239
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:50,534
You three! Move!

240
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,079
Move!

241
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:57,707
You stand over there!

242
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,418
Don't look back.

243
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:03,463
From now on,
I'll kill anyone who annoys me.

244
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:07,509
Understood?

245
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:20,105
<i>Hostages?</i>

246
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:22,315
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

247
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:25,277
In the Hosu University dorm?

248
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:26,444
<i>Yes.</i>

249
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:31,116
I thought it'd be impossible for
13 people to die unless war broke out.

250
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,203
<i>What if 13 young virgins really die?</i>

251
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:37,539
Watch what you say!

252
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,916
<i>They're holding students hostage.</i>

253
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,751
Shouldn't you be more worried about them?

254
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:44,254
How could someone in your position
say that?

255
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:46,840
I…

256
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,593
I apologize, ma'am.

257
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:52,929
I just thought
someone charismatic and noble like you

258
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,349
should be the future First Lady.

259
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:59,978
I was just worried, Ms. Cho.

260
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:02,439
<i>No, you got it wrong. Just wrong!</i>

261
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:04,899
It's not important for me
to become the First Lady.

262
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:08,820
What's important is
for my husband to become president.

263
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:11,781
<i>You better stop being so thoughtless,</i>

264
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:13,533
or I'll switch shops!

265
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:18,872
Wait a minute.

266
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:25,795
What the…

267
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,841
Both of them must take me for a pushover.

268
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:31,301
This is so annoying.

269
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:44,981
PATIENT TRANSPORT

270
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,191
Close it.

271
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,193
MILITARY OPERATION
DO NOT CROSS

272
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,488
-Step back.
-What's going on?

273
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,365
Are my roommates okay?

274
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:54,824
Then we can't go into the form?

275
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,534
No, a military op is being carried out.

276
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,411
So please just go home

277
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:00,705
and wait until further notice.

278
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:04,918
Hey, wait! Tell us what's going on?

279
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:08,838
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:10,090
Did you meet Yeong-ro?

281
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:11,633
Are you with her now?

282
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:12,592
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

283
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:14,302
I see.

284
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:17,514
Then she must be still in the dorm, right?

285
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:20,934
I'm aware of that.

286
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:23,561
Don't worry, and just come back here.

287
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,527
<i>How dare they attack the university dorm?</i>

288
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:32,696
<i>Hosu Women's University</i>

289
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,864
is where our chairman's daughter--

290
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:45,291
This is Mr. Kim. Are you there, Galaxy?

291
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:46,876
Galaxy standing by.

292
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:51,089
<i>Among the hostages, there's a freshman
English Literature major named Eun…</i>

293
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:53,842
Eun… Yes, Yeong-ro.

294
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,552
Check if Eun Yeong-ro is in there.

295
00:26:56,511 --> 00:27:00,473
We're still putting together a list.
We must take out the takers first!

296
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:02,600
She's Mr. Eun's daughter.

297
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:05,103
<i>Let me know once confirmed.</i>

298
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:07,147
And stand by for now. Over.

299
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:25,123
Hang in there, Mr. Lee.

300
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:30,336
What are we waiting for?
We must rescue Mr. Lee.

301
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:34,841
Go check if there's an Eun Yeong-ro
among the hostages.

302
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:37,051
Eun Yeong-ro?

303
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:38,428
Who is that?

304
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:41,514
Number one's daughter. Mr. Eun's daughter.

305
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:43,892
God, this is crazy.

306
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:45,643
If they find out, we'll be in trouble.

307
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:47,520
We should extract her before they do.

308
00:27:48,104 --> 00:27:49,814
First, keep it confidential
over the radio.

309
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:52,817
And get a secure line to the dorm.
A line directly from HQ too.

310
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,110
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,989
And wiretap the whole building.

312
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:04,245
Ammunitions go over there.

313
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,039
Hurry up!

314
00:28:21,054 --> 00:28:22,931
<i>Three hostages by the windows.</i>

315
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:26,226
There are booby traps everywhere,
so it won't be easy to penetrate.

316
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,730
<i>All units, stand by. There are explosives.</i>

317
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,067
So the Northern team Taedong River 1 leads

318
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,529
just left the Port of Incheon
with Professor Han?

319
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:39,072
Finally!

320
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:41,282
As soon as he arrives in the North,

321
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,952
our ship carrying 100 million dollars

322
00:28:44,035 --> 00:28:46,287
will head for Whiskey, November,

323
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:50,583
<i>two, zero, two, three,
one, four, eight, one.</i>

324
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,836
It'll rendezvous with your men.

325
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:56,422
As soon as we receive the money,

326
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:59,801
we'll make Professor Han
officially disclose

327
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:02,554
that the opposition party
is running for president

328
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,681
with our great Supreme Leader's funding.

329
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:08,226
You demanded four times
the original price for Operation Phoenix.

330
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,061
You already got 100 million dollars.

331
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:14,899
And you'll get 100 million more
once the ship gets there. As for the rest,

332
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:17,485
we'll send it to you
once you hold the press conference.

333
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:23,199
After the election is over,
feel free to come visit me.

334
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:28,371
If you want to hold the position for long,
you should visit here at least once.

335
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:31,207
If I visit there myself, it'll look bad.

336
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:34,127
Anyway, we'll be waiting for good news.

337
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:41,259
It wouldn't hurt to be in close touch with
them. Why did you have to

338
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:43,219
turn it down so coldly?

339
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:45,471
It's almost done.

340
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:49,309
Once Han appears on Korean Central TV,
the game's over.

341
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:52,020
We've jumped through hoops for this,

342
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,688
so let's have nice dinner tonight.

343
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:56,399
We'll pop the champagne a bit early.

344
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:58,109
-Let's go.
-Sure.

345
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,819
Mr. Eun.

346
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:02,071
Mr. An wants to talk to you.

347
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:03,489
Chief An?

348
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:08,453
Let him in.

349
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:12,665
I wonder why that dung fly
came to see you.

350
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,177
Sir.

351
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:26,095
What is it?

352
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,222
In the Hosu University dorm,

353
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,308
Northern spies are holding people hostage.

354
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:32,268
A hostage situation?

355
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:36,147
Lee Gang-mu disobeyed your direct orders

356
00:30:36,814 --> 00:30:38,942
and raided the dorm with military forces.

357
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:40,985
Wait. Are you sure they're spies?

358
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:44,489
According to intercepted radio messages,
he must've been sure of it.

359
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:47,450
How dare those communists make a mess
here in this day and age?

360
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:51,162
Call CFC right now and
mobilize all the Capital Defense forces!

361
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:54,207
Tell them to squash them without trace!

362
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,711
But I don't think
Gang-mu went there without a good reason.

363
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:02,966
Well, he went there
to catch Taedong River 1.

364
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:04,676
But Taedong River 1 just left Incheon…

365
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,268
So the students are being held hostage?

366
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,104
What do you keep asking him for?

367
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:17,480
What if articles are released

368
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:20,024
that say Northern spies are
holding students hostage?

369
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,067
People will be shocked.

370
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:25,738
We've put all this together, but if this
gets out, it'll all be for nothing.

371
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,782
We must be in the spotlight!

372
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:30,284
What if we suppress them by force
and the students get hurt?

373
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,328
Will you take responsibility?

374
00:31:34,914 --> 00:31:36,666
Why are you so slow?

375
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:40,169
What I'm saying is
Han's press conference must happen first!

376
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,921
Anyway, it's under my jurisdiction,

377
00:31:42,005 --> 00:31:44,090
so go pop the champagne by yourself.

378
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,926
This is exactly your problem!

379
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,679
You always dilly-dally,
and that's a liability to us!

380
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:55,435
If our plan goes wrong,

381
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:57,311
it's all on you.

382
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,688
I understand.

383
00:32:12,076 --> 00:32:12,910
It's me.

384
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:14,454
Is Yeong-ro there?

385
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:17,957
I sent Mr. Kim to pick her up at the dorm,

386
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:22,211
<i>but he couldn't even go near the dorm,
so he's coming back without her.</i>

387
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:25,757
What if something happens to Yeong-ro?

388
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,508
She'll be okay, right?

389
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:29,844
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

390
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:31,888
Okay.

391
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:50,531
Sir,

392
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:52,867
it's been confirmed

393
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:55,578
that your daughter is
being held hostage too.

394
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:57,163
Are you sure?

395
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:02,543
We've been keeping an eye on her
since she started college as Choi asked.

396
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:06,547
And upon hearing about the hostage
situation, we checked it first.

397
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:18,184
I swear on my life
that I'll rescue your daughter first.

398
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:21,687
Once the Capital Defense forces mobilize,
the press will find out.

399
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:23,981
Rescue all of the students

400
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:25,483
and kill

401
00:33:27,026 --> 00:33:28,486
the spies if necessary.

402
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:31,280
Yes, sir.

403
00:33:31,364 --> 00:33:32,448
We'll be discreet

404
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,450
and take care of it
without anyone knowing.

405
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:41,374
Also, sir…

406
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:45,503
On top of

407
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:49,382
disobeying your orders and
acting rashly to catch Taedong River 1,

408
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:53,177
Gang-mu's been shot
and is now being held hostage.

409
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:56,889
The way I see it,
Gang-mu is solely responsible for this--

410
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:57,849
Hurry.

411
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:00,268
It's not the time to decide
who's responsible.

412
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:01,936
You're right. Right away, sir.

413
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:06,440
-I will save your daughter!
-Get out!

414
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:50,776
Keep your eyes shut!

415
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:52,904
Keep them shut!

416
00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:55,865
Don't come out of the curtain.

417
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:15,051
It's all your fault. This wouldn't be
happening if you hadn't hidden that spy!

418
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:19,472
That spy was Yeong-ro's partner, right?

419
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:22,725
Then has she known he was a spy all along?

420
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:24,518
Of course, she has.

421
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:27,271
They're dating after all.

422
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:30,733
Shut your mouth and stop talking nonsense.

423
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,485
Why is it nonsense?

424
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,487
I was right all along.

425
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,656
You should've let me call the cops.

426
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,532
It's not the time
to decide who's to blame.

427
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:40,493
Just think about how to get out safely.

428
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:42,828
Safely?

429
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:46,582
We might all end up dying in here!

430
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,501
Who is it?

431
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:51,087
Who's crying?

432
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:53,172
Be quiet.

433
00:35:57,718 --> 00:35:59,011
Excuse me.

434
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,472
I need to go to the bathroom.

435
00:36:01,555 --> 00:36:02,640
Me too.

436
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:04,475
Excuse me.

437
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:14,110
What is it?

438
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,530
Could I go to the bathroom?

439
00:36:19,198 --> 00:36:20,491
I need to, too.

440
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:22,159
Don't.

441
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:34,338
Shouldn't we

442
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,133
let them go to the bathroom at least?

443
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:42,805
Close your eyes unless you want to die!

444
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:45,850
Close your eyes!

445
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:49,812
Look. It's a natural process.

446
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:51,605
How are we supposed to hold it?

447
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:57,820
I told you to shut it!

448
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:05,578
Do it. Do it here!

449
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:14,628
It's all your fault.

450
00:37:51,248 --> 00:37:54,502
What on earth is going on?

451
00:37:56,712 --> 00:38:00,716
Don't tell me you're the Northern spy.

452
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:02,510
A Northern spy?

453
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:08,265
Goodness, they say
you can't judge a book by its cover.

454
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:13,396
Are you really
a spy from the North? Tell me.

455
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:19,443
Then Yeong-ro's been fooled too?

456
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:22,113
How do you know this spy?

457
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:27,159
What kind of trouble
did you get yourself into?

458
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:29,328
You're the one
getting in trouble all the time!

459
00:38:30,913 --> 00:38:32,373
-Goodness.
-Hey.

460
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,418
I don't know what happened
between you two,

461
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,795
but I have nothing to do with it.

462
00:38:39,422 --> 00:38:42,341
So please let me go. Then I'll go back

463
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:44,927
the way I came very quietly.

464
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,104
Okay.

465
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,526
So if you'd just sent me the money,
I wouldn't have had to come here!

466
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:09,785
Close your eyes.

467
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,371
Breathe quietly.

468
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:24,758
Excuse me.

469
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:29,472
What?

470
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:31,724
He's bleeding.

471
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:35,186
Can I just stop the bleeding?

472
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:42,526
Are you crazy?

473
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,287
Lie back down.

474
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,209
Lie down!

475
00:40:01,086 --> 00:40:03,464
He's bleeding. Let me stop it.

476
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:04,965
Shut up and lie down.

477
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:06,342
Eun Yeong-ro.

478
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:15,476
My God, what's going on?

479
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,687
Oh, my. What's happening?

480
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:21,607
My goodness.

481
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:28,697
Comrade.

482
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:36,664
What are you doing?

483
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:39,875
She wouldn't listen to me.

484
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,418
He's hurt.

485
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:44,088
Can't you see him bleeding?

486
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:46,924
We should give him first aid at least.

487
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:56,267
Let me go get the first aid kit.

488
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,893
-Are you crazy? Sit down!
-Wait.

489
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:04,567
You're hurt too.

490
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:11,740
Lead the way.

491
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,659
Are you really a spy

492
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,244
from the North?

493
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,709
Did I really

494
00:42:47,544 --> 00:42:49,380
save a spy's life?

495
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:08,565
I'm warning you.

496
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:14,029
Stop being so nosy.

497
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,910
Or you'll get yourself killed.

498
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:52,943
Mr. Eun,

499
00:43:53,026 --> 00:43:55,571
the man leading the hostage situation
in the dorm

500
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:57,322
is Taedong River 1.

501
00:43:57,906 --> 00:43:59,700
Are you sure it's him?

502
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:01,994
What's the status?

503
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:04,788
Okay.

504
00:44:16,383 --> 00:44:17,676
Put me through to Mr. Nam…

505
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:21,138
No, never mind.

506
00:44:23,348 --> 00:44:25,768
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

507
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:45,412
<i>This is Pyongyang.</i>

508
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:46,830
Go ahead.

509
00:44:47,414 --> 00:44:48,540
Mr. Lim.

510
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:53,170
I hear Taedong River 1 is holding people
hostage in the middle of Seoul.

511
00:44:53,754 --> 00:44:55,631
<i>Are you sure he's with Professor Han</i>

512
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:57,466
right now?

513
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,009
What is this?

514
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:01,929
<i>Why does this kind of thing
happen every time?</i>

515
00:45:02,012 --> 00:45:05,015
He was supposed to join the others
after retrieving our weapons.

516
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:06,934
<i>Your men must've chased him!</i>

517
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:09,311
Can't you do your job properly?

518
00:45:09,895 --> 00:45:12,147
You are one to talk!

519
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:15,526
This is the Republic of Korea.

520
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:18,153
Did you think our agents
would just get out of the way?

521
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:20,864
He should've been good enough
to give our agents the slip.

522
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:22,574
Look, Eun!

523
00:45:22,658 --> 00:45:25,953
<i>Don't try to turn this around on me!
How dare you!</i>

524
00:45:26,036 --> 00:45:29,456
If you even lay a finger on our agents,

525
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,000
the deal is off!
Forget about the election!

526
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:36,755
Do everything in your power to get Taedong
River 1 out and send him to the North.

527
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:40,717
<i>To us, he's more important
than the president of South Korea!</i>

528
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:42,135
Understood?

529
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:07,411
<i>So Soo-hyeok's been captured?</i>

530
00:46:20,465 --> 00:46:21,341
Did you call for me?

531
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:23,677
We'll head for Hosu University
in a minute.

532
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,970
With a full security detail.

533
00:46:27,347 --> 00:46:28,640
<i>Eun Chang-su himself?</i>

534
00:46:29,308 --> 00:46:30,934
But why? They're just small-fry spies.

535
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,937
His daughter is in the dorm?

536
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:35,564
After falling for his new wife,

537
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:38,191
he sent his son to the army
and daughter to the dorm.

538
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:40,569
What a funny guy he is.

539
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:43,447
But still,

540
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:45,949
he's the director of ANSP.

541
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,868
How could he go to the scene himself?

542
00:46:48,368 --> 00:46:52,122
He should be pushing his agents to rescue
the others first. What the hell is he…

543
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:58,295
What?

544
00:47:03,842 --> 00:47:05,594
Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?

545
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:09,848
Okay.

546
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:14,144
Keep me posted on Eun's every move.
All right.

547
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:17,814
I need a shirt.

548
00:47:18,065 --> 00:47:19,441
Where's my shirt?

549
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,234
Darn it.

550
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:26,323
He didn't even report to me on it.

551
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:30,327
God damn it! Those damn communists
can't do anything right!

552
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:31,536
Damn it.

553
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:34,414
Do you have to go too?

554
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,292
Well, I don't have to…

555
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:40,045
No! Get it together!
I have to go! Where's my jacket?

556
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:41,254
My jacket!

557
00:47:51,223 --> 00:47:53,892
You're the one who hid him, aren't you?

558
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,237
I'm sorry. I swear I didn't know then.

559
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:11,326
Don't be. It's all right.

560
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:17,416
You didn't know.

561
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:21,044
Helping without knowing
doesn't count as harboring a spy.

562
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:49,114
Oh, no.

563
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:56,204
Does it hurt a lot?

564
00:48:57,622 --> 00:48:58,749
Oh, no.

565
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:35,619
Close your eyes!

566
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:42,334
Hey.

567
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:44,586
Taedong River 1.

568
00:49:47,923 --> 00:49:49,633
So this is how we finally meet.

569
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:56,014
To catch you,
I've been to Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt,

570
00:49:56,098 --> 00:49:57,516
and Warsaw.

571
00:49:59,726 --> 00:50:02,145
In Warsaw,
I almost died while chasing you.

572
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:09,528
Hey, stop right there!

573
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:11,446
Stop!

574
00:50:18,954 --> 00:50:19,996
Stop right there!

575
00:51:00,245 --> 00:51:01,705
You're a veteran.

576
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:04,708
Isn't losing Park Geum-cheol enough?

577
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:08,670
Do you want to lose the rest
while fighting a losing battle?

578
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,799
You must've only fought winning battles.

579
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:19,306
You see, I have so many things
I want to hear from you.

580
00:51:21,057 --> 00:51:23,810
I have to avenge Jin-seong's death too.

581
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:27,397
But I'm so worried
that the military forces

582
00:51:28,023 --> 00:51:29,649
might kill you

583
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:32,903
before I could do any of that.

584
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:58,929
NO OUTSIDERS ALLOWED

585
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:03,099
<i>Not to break in?</i>

586
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,354
Yes, sir. We won't break in rashly.

587
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,564
It might take quite long,
but we must kill--

588
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:12,776
You can't kill them.
All three of them must be unscathed.

589
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:14,069
Capture them no matter what.

590
00:52:15,528 --> 00:52:17,781
I see. I understand, sir.

591
00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:21,368
What's going on?

592
00:52:21,993 --> 00:52:24,663
Why must the spies be unscathed?

593
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:31,836
We need to rescue his daughter
and the spies too? I mean, capture them.

594
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:35,924
Looks like we're the only ones suffering.

595
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:40,887
-Hello, sir.
-Open it!

596
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:43,265
We'll break in from these three points.

597
00:52:43,348 --> 00:52:44,391
Hello, sir.

598
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:56,778
It's been 3 hours and 18 minutes
since he was shot. 3 hours and 18 minutes!

599
00:52:57,487 --> 00:52:58,989
You think I've been slacking off?

600
00:52:59,072 --> 00:53:01,574
I ran over here
as soon as I reported to Mr. Eun.

601
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:04,035
Let's break in right away.

602
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,705
There are just three of them,
and one is injured--

603
00:53:06,788 --> 00:53:07,622
That's enough!

604
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:10,166
Attention.

605
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:12,752
From now on,

606
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:14,546
I'll lead

607
00:53:15,505 --> 00:53:16,923
the operation.

608
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:21,344
Anything about this operation
can't get out of here.

609
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,513
So make sure not to let the press

610
00:53:23,596 --> 00:53:25,390
release any articles about gunfire

611
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:27,809
or a women's university dormitory.

612
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:29,436
Yes, sir.

613
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:31,271
This operation's

614
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:33,982
top priority

615
00:53:34,566 --> 00:53:36,651
is to rescue our director's daughter.

616
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:37,902
So right now,

617
00:53:38,111 --> 00:53:41,781
set up a field phone in front of
the dorm and get me a megaphone.

618
00:53:42,782 --> 00:53:43,825
Get me a bulletproof vest.

619
00:53:53,626 --> 00:53:54,627
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

620
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,424
<i>Lim Soo-ho. Can you hear me?</i>

621
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:10,727
<i>I'm the person in charge of this scene.</i>

622
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:14,439
<i>We just put a field phone
in front of the front door of the dorm.</i>

623
00:54:17,442 --> 00:54:20,403
<i>From now on, I'm the only person</i>

624
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:22,405
<i>you can talk to.</i>

625
00:54:22,906 --> 00:54:25,825
<i>Lim Soo-ho. I know you're listening.</i>

626
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:29,037
He's like a scared street dog.

627
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,581
<i>I am a man of my word.</i>

628
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:33,249
<i>If you guarantee</i>

629
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,460
<i>the hostages' safety,</i>

630
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:37,962
<i>we'll guarantee your safety</i>

631
00:54:38,546 --> 00:54:39,714
<i>at all costs.</i>

632
00:54:41,257 --> 00:54:43,218
We must negotiate with them
to get out of here.

633
00:54:43,301 --> 00:54:44,511
<i>I repeat.</i>

634
00:54:45,345 --> 00:54:46,513
<i>Right now,</i>

635
00:54:46,596 --> 00:54:47,889
I need you to cover me.

636
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:50,100
<i>come pick up the field phone</i>

637
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:52,977
<i>and talk with me to negotiate.</i>

638
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:58,441
Is there any response?

639
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:00,902
Not yet.

640
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:03,655
I don't think I can hold it anymore.

641
00:55:06,366 --> 00:55:08,493
You have to. Hang in there.

642
00:55:09,035 --> 00:55:11,454
I need to pee. My goodness.

643
00:55:11,538 --> 00:55:14,791
Hey, how about
you pee in your pants little by little?

644
00:55:14,874 --> 00:55:16,459
Or just wet your pants.

645
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:17,669
It's all right.

646
00:55:17,752 --> 00:55:19,087
-It's not embarrassing.
-Should I?

647
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,881
The grenade.

648
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:24,634
There's a grenade.

649
00:55:26,261 --> 00:55:27,971
No… No!

650
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:29,431
-I shouldn't move! No!
-Wait!

651
00:55:30,348 --> 00:55:31,474
No!

652
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:43,736
Oh, my.

653
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:52,579
You bastard! Why did you pee on me?

654
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:03,756
You.

655
00:56:06,509 --> 00:56:07,677
Go to the front door.

656
00:56:19,689 --> 00:56:20,815
Go with him.

657
00:56:28,072 --> 00:56:29,073
Stay here.

658
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:30,241
Yes, sir.

659
00:56:41,628 --> 00:56:44,756
God damn it! That prick!

660
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,549
<i>Right now,</i>

661
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,676
<i>come pick up the field phone.</i>

662
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:50,345
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

663
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,597
<i>I am warning you again…</i>

664
00:57:01,856 --> 00:57:03,691
You'll see a phone outside.

665
00:57:03,775 --> 00:57:05,151
Go fetch it.

666
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:09,030
Pardon?

667
00:57:10,156 --> 00:57:11,699
You mean, me?

668
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:16,955
Do anything stupid,
and your girlfriend dies.

669
00:57:22,919 --> 00:57:23,753
Gwang-tae.

670
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:28,841
I love you.

671
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:32,136
You're the only one for me.

672
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,805
You know that, right?

673
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:35,723
It won't be that hard.

674
00:57:35,807 --> 00:57:38,351
Just walk slowly there and bring it here.

675
00:57:38,434 --> 00:57:39,477
Okay?

676
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,938
Go fetch it now!

677
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:44,232
Now.

678
00:57:55,868 --> 00:57:57,787
NO OUTSIDERS ALLOWED

679
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:04,544
Someone's coming out.

680
00:58:05,253 --> 00:58:06,796
Raise your shields.

681
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:24,230
That's not Lim Soo-ho.

682
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,233
I think he's a student.

683
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:30,612
<i>All right.</i>

684
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:32,864
<i>Don't worry.</i>

685
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:36,784
<i>We will not shoot you.</i>

686
00:58:37,785 --> 00:58:38,995
<i>Slowly,</i>

687
00:58:39,537 --> 00:58:41,331
<i>take the phone and go back inside.</i>

688
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:54,218
Gwang-tae, come on!

689
00:59:08,399 --> 00:59:09,942
Lim Soo-ho's behind the door.

690
00:59:10,026 --> 00:59:10,860
Really?

691
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:52,819
Who fired the gun? Who was it?

692
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,375
Hold fire!

693
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,802
We shouldn't shoot them.
Order them not to fire back.

694
01:00:21,013 --> 01:00:24,600
Raise it! And get down. Lower your body!

695
01:00:24,684 --> 01:00:26,060
Raise the shields!

696
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:27,395
Don't shoot.

697
01:00:27,478 --> 01:00:28,604
Tell them not to fire back.

698
01:00:28,688 --> 01:00:30,857
We shouldn't fire back. Hold fire!

699
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:33,735
Pick it up now.

700
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:38,281
Raise the shields!

701
01:00:41,492 --> 01:00:43,661
All right. Pull back!

702
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:45,455
-Pull back!
-Pull back!

703
01:00:45,538 --> 01:00:48,666
Protect me! God damn it.
Keep the shields close!

704
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,877
-Pull back! Hurry up!
-Block me!

705
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,726
-Sir, you should wear the vest.
-Out of my way!

706
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,653
Do you have a death wish or something?

707
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:20,531
Look. I know you're desperate,

708
01:01:20,656 --> 01:01:21,532
but are you crazy?

709
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:24,243
I know you don't care
about Mr. Lee at all.

710
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:27,371
It was the perfect chance to get him.

711
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:29,499
Once we get him, the other two will--

712
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:30,541
What if!

713
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:33,461
What if the other two shoot the hostages?

714
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:36,839
And what if Mr. Eun's daughter dies?
What will you do?

715
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:40,343
Are you the one who shot at them?

716
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:44,889
No, I'm not, sir. It was Han-na.
She was trying to save Gang-mu.

717
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:50,311
Don't you know our agents must put

718
01:01:50,394 --> 01:01:53,147
our people's lives
before our colleagues' lives?

719
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,197
Jang Han-na,
you're banned from this scene.

720
01:02:02,198 --> 01:02:04,992
Until ordered otherwise,
go stay in the office.

721
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:06,619
Mr. Eun. Sir!

722
01:02:06,702 --> 01:02:08,621
I'll be expelled if I have to.

723
01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:10,373
But let me stay at the scene.

724
01:02:10,456 --> 01:02:12,375
Please! Let me stay here!

725
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:13,835
-Get her out!
-Mr. Eun!

726
01:02:13,918 --> 01:02:15,127
Mr. Eun!

727
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:16,712
Mr. Eun!

728
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:20,967
Sir.

729
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:25,012
I risked being sniped at

730
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:27,473
to give them a field phone--

731
01:02:27,557 --> 01:02:28,850
Everyone, out!

732
01:02:29,725 --> 01:02:31,060
Get up, guys.

733
01:02:34,438 --> 01:02:37,567
Why? Will you take care of it by yourself?

734
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:43,281
Were you going to handle it

735
01:02:43,781 --> 01:02:45,491
without even telling me?

736
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:49,412
That bastard's supposed
to be on the West Sea now.

737
01:02:49,495 --> 01:02:51,372
But why is he in the dorm?

738
01:02:52,206 --> 01:02:53,499
Explain.

739
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:14,020
My stomach…

740
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,105
My stomach hurts.

741
01:03:17,106 --> 01:03:18,524
Yeong-ro, what's wrong?

742
01:03:18,608 --> 01:03:19,984
Yeong-ro.

743
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:24,030
Didn't I say I'd kill you
if you said anything?

744
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:27,867
Look. She says she's in pain.

745
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,368
How could you do that--

746
01:03:29,952 --> 01:03:31,829
Didn't you hear the gunfire earlier?

747
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:34,248
Your stomach hurts?

748
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:37,585
Are you faking pain
even after hearing gunfire?

749
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:41,589
Answer me!

750
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:44,759
Are you seriously faking it?

751
01:03:50,514 --> 01:03:54,477
My back! My back hurts too.

752
01:03:55,478 --> 01:03:57,480
No, I'm okay. Don't worry.

753
01:03:58,856 --> 01:03:59,690
Gosh.

754
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:07,281
I'm fine. It's because
I've been lying down for so long.

755
01:04:08,074 --> 01:04:08,991
Come in.

756
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,761
Why did they get changed?

757
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:34,183
Aren't they Seol-hui's pajamas?

758
01:04:37,061 --> 01:04:39,063
-Look at them.
-What's with them?

759
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:40,314
Don't laugh.

760
01:04:42,483 --> 01:04:44,235
We almost died.

761
01:04:57,999 --> 01:05:00,543
We need to kill one of the hostages now.

762
01:05:04,296 --> 01:05:05,214
Just wait.

763
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:21,313
<i>This is the director of ANSP.</i>

764
01:05:21,897 --> 01:05:23,607
Am I speaking to Lim Soo-ho?

765
01:05:25,026 --> 01:05:26,944
You suggested talking then fired a gun?

766
01:05:27,028 --> 01:05:29,363
It was a mistake.
We didn't mean to shoot you.

767
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:30,614
A mistake?

768
01:05:33,826 --> 01:05:36,120
Listen very carefully.

769
01:05:36,203 --> 01:05:38,706
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

770
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:41,709
Because you made a mistake.

771
01:05:42,209 --> 01:05:44,045
<i>Aren't you supposed to rendezvous</i>

772
01:05:44,128 --> 01:05:45,629
at Yankee, Mike,

773
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:47,506
six, two, one, four,

774
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,050
<i>seven, one, two, eight?</i>

775
01:05:52,428 --> 01:05:53,679
<i>Don't worry.</i>

776
01:05:53,763 --> 01:05:56,682
Your agents will accomplish
their mission without a problem.

777
01:05:59,393 --> 01:06:03,397
The person in charge who sent you guys
to Seoul is director Lim Ji-rok, right?

778
01:06:05,316 --> 01:06:07,401
<i>If that's true, just trust me.</i>

779
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:08,694
<i>We have no intention</i>

780
01:06:08,778 --> 01:06:10,404
of harming you.

781
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:13,199
We want to send
all of you back to the North safely.

782
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:17,953
Exactly 30 minutes from now,

783
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:20,706
come out through an emergency exit
in basement two.

784
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:40,935
What did those bastards say?

785
01:06:42,853 --> 01:06:45,147
To come out through an emergency exit
in 30 minutes.

786
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:47,942
They say they'll send us
back to the North safely.

787
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:51,946
How can we ever trust those bastards?

788
01:06:52,029 --> 01:06:53,656
I'll have to check if it's true first.

789
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:55,783
Do you really need to check to know?

790
01:06:55,866 --> 01:06:57,368
It's obviously a trap.

791
01:07:09,004 --> 01:07:11,590
It must be a put-up job, right?

792
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:15,261
"They're supposed
to be on the West Sea now,

793
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:17,972
but why are they in the dorm?"

794
01:07:18,305 --> 01:07:20,307
And he said
something will all be for nothing.

795
01:07:20,391 --> 01:07:24,395
On top of that, he ordered me to capture
them, saying they must be unscathed.

796
01:07:24,478 --> 01:07:26,605
You're right.

797
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:30,609
Eun Chang-su must've arranged something
with the North secretly for the election.

798
01:07:31,235 --> 01:07:32,653
<i>What do I do?</i>

799
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:35,364
It's against the National Security Law
not to investigate

800
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,033
when I'm aware of the charges.

801
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:42,288
Of course, Code 1 must've ordered them!

802
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:44,039
<i>God, you're so frustrating.</i>

803
01:07:44,123 --> 01:07:46,041
Why are you so slow?

804
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:47,877
I mean,

805
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:50,045
how much longer

806
01:07:50,129 --> 01:07:52,548
<i>will you stay an errand boy?</i>

807
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,802
And how much longer
must I stay a maid for them?

808
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:01,390
I don't know!

809
01:08:01,473 --> 01:08:04,768
Whether or not you save Eun's daughter,
I don't care!

810
01:08:04,852 --> 01:08:05,811
Charlotte.

811
01:08:06,478 --> 01:08:07,563
Charlotte?

812
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:10,941
What is it, Ms. Kim?

813
01:08:14,945 --> 01:08:16,947
"Whether or not you save Eun's daughter"?

814
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:20,242
What does that mean?

815
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:24,872
I guess you haven't heard yet.

816
01:08:25,456 --> 01:08:27,041
Mr. Eun's daughter

817
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:30,711
is being held hostage
in the Hosu University dorm.

818
01:08:32,129 --> 01:08:32,963
Oh, my God.

819
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:35,216
Really?

820
01:08:37,176 --> 01:08:40,763
Then he must be desperate
to save his daughter,

821
01:08:40,846 --> 01:08:42,932
forgetting about becoming president.

822
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:44,683
Yes.

823
01:08:45,684 --> 01:08:49,063
Ms. Hong must be really anxious right now.

824
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:51,649
She can neither stop him
nor encourage him.

825
01:08:52,691 --> 01:08:53,525
You're right.

826
01:08:55,277 --> 01:08:57,446
I should go comfort her.

827
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:00,241
Cancel today's mahjong game.

828
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:01,992
Pardon?

829
01:09:06,455 --> 01:09:08,749
What are you doing? Come with me.

830
01:09:10,459 --> 01:09:11,710
Right. Of course.

831
01:10:58,525 --> 01:11:02,988
If this song plays on Pyongyang channel,
it means the instruction has changed.

832
01:11:03,614 --> 01:11:05,574
Remember that and obey the new order.

833
01:11:25,636 --> 01:11:28,722
<i>I will read out the 2,204th message.</i>

834
01:11:28,806 --> 01:11:30,057
<i>Assistant Team Six.</i>

835
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,060
<i>This is a message for Assistant Team Six.</i>

836
01:11:33,227 --> 01:11:35,979
<i>76,373.</i>

837
01:11:36,438 --> 01:11:41,068
<i>20,100. 36,116.</i>

838
01:11:41,568 --> 01:11:44,405
<i>59,789.</i>

839
01:11:44,822 --> 01:11:49,785
<i>40,251. 20,073. That'll be all.</i>

840
01:12:07,636 --> 01:12:11,348
COOPERATE

841
01:12:11,432 --> 01:12:16,103
WITH

842
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:23,819
SOUTH KOREA

843
01:12:36,373 --> 01:12:39,209
The potatoes from our hometown
are the best.

844
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:41,086
Those from the South are too soft.

845
01:12:41,587 --> 01:12:43,797
Would you like some potatoes?

846
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:45,924
Have some.

847
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:54,308
<i>I keep having diarrhea.</i>

848
01:12:57,269 --> 01:12:58,187
Yeong-u.

849
01:13:02,691 --> 01:13:03,984
Yeong-u.

850
01:13:04,067 --> 01:13:06,320
Switch shifts for me just this once.

851
01:13:10,324 --> 01:13:12,242
-Oh, my.
-God, you punk.

852
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:14,244
REPUBLIC OF KOREA MARINES

853
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:18,373
You're an administrative clerk,
but you want to be on a coast patrol boat?

854
01:13:18,457 --> 01:13:20,292
Private Kim isn't feeling well.

855
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,753
So I'll fill in for him.

856
01:13:23,128 --> 01:13:24,296
Really?

857
01:13:24,379 --> 01:13:26,507
Okay, then. Be safe.

858
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:29,092
Salute.

859
01:13:32,346 --> 01:13:33,514
Salute.

860
01:13:38,685 --> 01:13:43,440
I thought he was just one of those who
have powerful dads, but he's quite nice.

861
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:47,736
His father may be the director of ANSP,
but he's a Marine just like any of us.

862
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:50,072
<i>It's impossible
the party has given such an order.</i>

863
01:13:50,656 --> 01:13:53,867
But it's true that
the Pyongyang channel told us

864
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:56,203
to cooperate with the South.

865
01:13:56,286 --> 01:13:58,330
The broadcasting might've been fabricated.

866
01:13:59,623 --> 01:14:01,625
They shot at us after suggesting talking.

867
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:03,710
What if this is another trap?

868
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:09,508
As you say, it might be a trap they set.

869
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:13,679
But what if it is the party's instruction?

870
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:18,517
If we disobey the orders,
it won't stop at our deaths.

871
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,395
Our families in our hometown
will suffer too.

872
01:14:22,521 --> 01:14:25,148
You still want to
ignore their instructions?

873
01:14:26,358 --> 01:14:31,238
The director of ANSP knew
the coordinates of our rendezvous point,

874
01:14:32,489 --> 01:14:35,033
as well as the person
in charge of this mission.

875
01:14:35,909 --> 01:14:37,536
But how could he have found out?

876
01:14:39,746 --> 01:14:41,832
Our country must've made a deal with him

877
01:14:42,624 --> 01:14:44,543
to save our lives.

878
01:14:47,838 --> 01:14:52,009
As you know,
our party would never abandon us.

879
01:14:53,635 --> 01:14:54,636
Understood, sir.

880
01:14:55,429 --> 01:14:57,055
I'll do as you say

881
01:14:57,139 --> 01:14:58,307
no matter what.

882
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:14,906
SERVING WINDOW

883
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:20,454
Exactly 15 minutes from now,
we'll escape through the emergency exit.

884
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:37,679
It's too foggy to see anyone coming.
Will we even be able to meet?

885
01:16:02,412 --> 01:16:04,081
Isn't it time?

886
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:12,381
-They're coming.
-Good.

887
01:16:16,927 --> 01:16:18,011
The sound is different.

888
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:27,187
Reporting.

889
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:28,230
Checking the reception.

890
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:30,065
Wild Goose 2, this is Stone 1. Over.

891
01:16:30,148 --> 01:16:32,025
Stone 1, this is Wild Goose 2. Clear.

892
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:35,904
Wild Goose 2,
we'll proceed with reception, over.

893
01:16:37,948 --> 01:16:39,449
We pulled back the SWAT team

894
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:42,619
and only placed your security detail
in front of the exit.

895
01:16:42,703 --> 01:16:44,371
As soon as they come out,

896
01:16:44,454 --> 01:16:46,748
we'll get them into the car
and get out of here.

897
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:48,583
-Yes, sir.
-Hey.

898
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:50,377
Do you think they'll come out?

899
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,380
Do you really think so?
I wouldn't trust you if I were them.

900
01:16:53,463 --> 01:16:54,339
Don't you think?

901
01:17:06,935 --> 01:17:08,729
<i>There must be no one in front of the exit.</i>

902
01:17:08,812 --> 01:17:11,106
Pull back all of your guys.

903
01:17:11,189 --> 01:17:13,859
We'll come out through the exit
in exactly three minutes.

904
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:21,074
Good. They'll come out in three minutes.

905
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:21,992
Yes, sir.

906
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:26,705
Gosh, you're so lucky, Eun.

907
01:17:26,788 --> 01:17:29,458
We avoided the worst-case scenario.

908
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:33,712
I'm glad we're putting an end
to this case safely.

909
01:17:33,795 --> 01:17:35,881
Deepest congratulations, sir.

910
01:17:48,643 --> 01:17:51,396
<i>Your ship is in the restricted area.</i>

911
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,274
<i>-Please go back to the fishery zone now.</i>
-Damn it!

912
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:57,402
<i>Your ship is in the restricted area.</i>

913
01:17:57,486 --> 01:18:00,030
<i>Please go back to the fishery zone now.</i>

914

<i>Your ship is in the restricted area.</i>

<i>Please go back to the fishery zone now.</i>

918

<i>Your ship is in the restricted area.</i>

919
01:18:16,296 --> 01:18:18,799
<i>Please go back to the fishery zone now.</i>

920
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:20,634
This is the restricted area!

921
01:18:21,092 --> 01:18:25,514
We know that. Our engine
broke down, so we've been drifting here.

922
01:18:26,014 --> 01:18:28,016
Hey, go check if it's working now.

923
01:18:28,099 --> 01:18:29,100
Okay.

924
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:31,895
We're almost done, so we'll leave soon.

925
01:18:31,978 --> 01:18:32,854
Sorry.

926
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,941
-Report that it's a Korean boat.
-Yes, sir.

927
01:18:36,566 --> 01:18:38,485
-At ease.
-At ease.

928
01:18:41,071 --> 01:18:44,199
It's done. It's been fixed. We'll go now.

929
01:18:44,282 --> 01:18:45,534
Thank you.

930
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:46,451
Do you need help?

931
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:48,245
No, it's been fixed.

932
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:49,788
-Get ready.
-Okay.

933
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:52,666
Hey! Come back in here!

934
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:54,459
Damn it.

935
01:18:57,754 --> 01:19:00,257
Help me! Please!

936
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,260
Help me! Please!

937
01:19:24,781 --> 01:19:26,116
Signalman!

938
01:19:26,992 --> 01:19:28,618
Pull back!

939
01:19:28,702 --> 01:19:29,744
Hurry!

940
01:21:08,969 --> 01:21:09,970
<i>What?</i>

941
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:12,847
An engagement near Udo Island?

942
01:21:16,476 --> 01:21:17,769
Udo Island?

943
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,938
What's the exact location?

944
01:21:21,815 --> 01:21:23,400
What about the damage on our side?

945
01:21:23,984 --> 01:21:26,861
Okay. Get back to me
as soon as you find out more.

946
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:28,780
Wait. This can't be…

947
01:21:28,863 --> 01:21:30,240
It must not be

948
01:21:30,949 --> 01:21:32,951
the ship for the spies, right?

949
01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:36,705
Our ship hit and sank it.

950
01:21:42,168 --> 01:21:43,420
God damn it!

951
01:21:58,351 --> 01:21:59,644
Now…

952
01:22:01,646 --> 01:22:03,940
Plan B is the only option now.

953
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:11,239
They're coming.

954
01:22:16,119 --> 01:22:17,412
Everyone, retreat.

955
01:24:02,475 --> 01:24:03,309
Stop.

956
01:24:49,022 --> 01:24:51,149
Eung-cheol!

957
01:24:51,357 --> 01:24:52,442
Are you okay?

958
01:25:06,122 --> 01:25:08,291
<i>We must kill them all.</i>

959
01:25:08,374 --> 01:25:09,834
Are you telling me to commit murder?

960
01:25:09,918 --> 01:25:12,879
No, no. It's not murder. It's execution.

961
01:25:12,962 --> 01:25:14,923
<i>To shoot all the hostages dead</i>

962
01:25:15,006 --> 01:25:17,884
<i>and blow ourselves up in a determined way</i>

963
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:20,094
is the most honorable death for us!

964
01:25:20,178 --> 01:25:22,764
<i>Your life depends on me, your leader.</i>

965
01:25:23,848 --> 01:25:24,849
Don't forget that.

966
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:28,186
<i>Let's just go in and eliminate them all!</i>

967
01:25:28,269 --> 01:25:29,938
What if all the hostages are killed?

968
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:33,191
I'll deal with the communist jerks,
so you stay out of it, scaredy-cat.

969
01:25:33,274 --> 01:25:35,526
<i>If you feel bad for me just a little bit,</i>

970
01:25:36,152 --> 01:25:37,528
<i>let them go. Please.</i>

971
01:25:38,112 --> 01:25:39,781
Let them go.

972
01:25:39,864 --> 01:25:42,909
<i>And I'm planning to release you.</i>

973
01:25:42,992 --> 01:25:46,287
<i>This all happened because of her.
Why does she get to leave?</i>

974
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:47,872
She can't die and I can?

975
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:49,582
Stop!

976
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:50,708
<i>You leave.</i>

977
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:53,002
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

978
