FINAL EPISODE

3
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,082
When I came back here,
I hid the car I drove near the temple.

4
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,459
We'll get out through this window

5
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:28,962
and leave in that car.

6
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:30,380
Okay.

7
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,634
Eun Chang-su will be flustered
when he finds out we're gone.

8
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,471
Don't slow us down out there, okay?

9
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:46,062
Let's hurry.

10
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,314
Mr. Lee! Ms. Pi!

11
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,570
He swore on his late son's honor,
but he fooled us again?

12
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,406
What about Gal?

13
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:00,785
Don't worry.
I'll expose it tonight at all cost.

14
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,412
Yes, you must

15
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:04,122
<i>to stop Eun Chang-su from killing us.</i>

16
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:05,373
But be careful.

17
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:08,126
Han-na, you too. Over and out.

18
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,087
What's the fuss about?

19
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:13,631
Mr. Kim is suspicious.

20
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:17,343
I heard him radio someone
in the records room.

21
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:19,095
What do you mean?

22
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:20,555
Radio?

23
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:24,517
"Eliminate the agents including Lim Soo-ho

24
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:26,602
and return with Moran Hill."

25
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:29,897
Are you sure?

26
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,441
Eliminate Lim Soo-ho?

27
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:32,525
And the others too?

28
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:36,029
Yes. I heard it clearly.

29
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:40,616
And I heard him order someone
to get a vehicle ready by the shrine.

30
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,035
Where is he?

31
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:43,828
I think he's trying to leave the dorm.

32
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,913
I saw him going down to the records room.

33
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:55,673
Where on earth did the old man go?

34
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:56,758
Gosh.

35
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:02,513
Dad?

36
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,416
Soo-ho!

37
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:51,187
Soo-ho, what are you doing?

38
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:55,733
Come out here now.

39
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,439
<i>Lim Soo-ho and his gang near the washroom.</i>

40
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,150
<i>Lim Soo-ho and his gang near the washroom!</i>

41
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,359
<i>We need backup!</i>

42
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,988
Team A, what's going on?
Report now. Team A!

43
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,157
Go after them. Now!

44
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,534
All units, in the direction
of the washroom!

45
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:49,454
All units, in the direction
of the washroom! Move!

46
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,205
Now…

47
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:46,427
To Pyeongtaek Port.

48
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:49,222
-Why are you going there?
-My goodness!

49
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,725
Who the hell is this guy?

50
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:55,269
-You…
-We don't have time!

51
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,482
Damn it.

52
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:05,279
You… Goodness.

53
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:13,621
Soo-ho!

54
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:28,678
They won't kill Soo-ho
as long as he has the 300 million dollars.

55
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,139
But what about Man-dong?

56
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:35,851
He's going after Soo-ho.
Will he really kill him?

57
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,186
Don't worry.

58
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,938
He's a veteran agent.

59
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:41,607
I'm sure he'll be safe.

60
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,740
Your father lied to us again.
All of you 33 hostages are in danger.

61
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:52,159
Now you and I

62
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:54,704
must fight against him.

63
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,427
<i>Put out an APB</i>

64
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,971
and step up inspections at ports.

65
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,266
Set up checkpoints
at the major intersections too.

66
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:35,953
Get out of the car.

67
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,998
Why do you keep telling me to get out?

68
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,626
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

69
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:43,169
You disabled the booby trap.

70
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:46,505
You even ran after all these years
you said you had bad joints!

71
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:50,301
I mean, who on earth are you really, Dad?

72
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:56,349
Just get out of the car, you brat.

73
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:58,768
Get out, and we'll talk.

74
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,770
No.

75
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,396
I won't.

76
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,814
Not before you tell me.

77
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:07,526
Why on earth are you going
to Pyeongtaek this late at night?

78
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,736
We're going to be late.

79
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:19,413
Get out.

80
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:23,626
What does it matter who I am?

81
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:29,507
Get out.

82
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:32,843
Okay.

83
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:44,271
Just consider me dead from now on.

84
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:52,988
Dad…

85
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,410
TAEGEUK HARDWARE STORE

86
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,545
<i>How did I not know he was a Northern spy?</i>

87
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,964
It means he's the one who framed Ms. Oh.

88
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:12,049
But what do you think

89
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,802
he's been doing in the dorm?

90
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:18,597
I'm not sure.
But this is a women's dormitory,

91
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,808
so it must've been
the perfect place to hide.

92
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,520
Do you think they're going to

93
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:26,939
break in tonight?

94
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:30,943
We should be prepared.

95
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:34,029
We should set more booby traps

96
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,409
and do everything we can.

97
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:40,536
I just hope

98
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,789
Gal exposes it in time.

99
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:59,054
RECORDING STUDIO 1

100
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:01,307
This way.

101
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:11,150
We must do it in three minutes.

102
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:13,736
Let's do this.

103
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,821
Though it'll be
the worst broadcast accident ever.

104
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,658
GANG OF 4 NORTHERN SPIES WANTED

105
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,205
Let him through.

106
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,166
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, STOP

107
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,682
If we take a detour,
we'll never get there by two.

108
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,435
There are only two of them.
I'll go kill them.

109
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,231
Then we'll end up giving them the lead.

110
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:53,275
We can't let them find out
where we're headed.

111
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:56,362
We have no choice but to split up.

112
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:59,615
Eung-cheol and Comrade Joo, they
don't know your faces, so take this car.

113
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,160
Comrade Kang and I will go on foot.

114
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,920
But how will you get there by two on foot?

115
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:16,715
I had a ship departing at eight ready
just in case. We'll take that.

116
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,760
You two go first
and wait for us at Qingdao Port.

117
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:25,808
Comrade Kang.

118
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:27,101
Let's go.

119
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,480
Be safe, you two.

120
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:41,532
You have to get there safely.

121
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,450
I'll be waiting.

122
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:49,623
Gyeok-chan.

123
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,627
Let's have a drink there.

124
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:59,008
Are you sure you can handle me?

125
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:20,070
Comrade Joo,
I'll shoot them if anything goes wrong.

126
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:22,698
Don't be nervous.

127
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,708
SECURITY CHECKPOINT
SLOW DOWN FOR INSPECTION

128
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:39,006
There will be a brief inspection.

-Get out of here! Get out now!
-What's going on?

133
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,467
-Get out, you bastards!
-I'm leaving.

134
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,510
-Go.
-Okay.

A WALK THROUGH GREATEST HITS

136
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:44,446
<i>I hope everyone listening to this is well.</i>

137
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:47,408
<i>This is Gal Sang-sik,
a political reporter at JBC</i>

138
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,285
<i>who first covered
Professor Han's abduction.</i>

139
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,246
<i>Since we have concluded</i>

140
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:56,333
that the lives
of the 33 hostages in the dorm

141
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,043
are in danger,

142

<i>we're bringing you breaking news.</i>

143

<i>According to sources from the inside,
the Hosu University hostage situation is</i>

144
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:11,724
<i>an election scheme planned
by the key figures of the administration.</i>

145
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:21,734
<i>I'm the agent who led the hostages out
when they were released.</i>

146
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,569
<i>I… I'm sorry,</i>

147
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:26,447
<i>but there's not much time,
so let me say what I must say first.</i>

148
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,032
Agent Lee Gang-mu!

149

<i>Are you listening?</i>

150
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,496
<i>I…</i>

151
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,127
I'm not a man of conviction
or a patriot like you,

152
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:44,131
but those trying to kill innocent students
to regain power…

153
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:46,300
I can't sit by and watch anymore.

154

<i>I'm going to fight against those bastards.</i>

155

<i>So get out of there alive.</i>

156
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:54,641
<i>And kids, are you listening?</i>

-Yes!
-Yes!

<i>You never give up too!</i>

159
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:04,610
You have hard evidence
that it's an election scheme, right?

160
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:06,653
Yes, I do.

161
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:10,491
<i>When I obtained it, I sent it
to the press, but the ANSP confiscated it.</i>

162
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:13,202
<i>That's why
I've decided to expose it myself.</i>

163

00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,791
<i>-those leading the scheme with the North--
-You have listened</i>

165
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,751
<i>to the JBC network radio channel</i>

166
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:24,254
<i>from Seoul, the capital
of the Republic of Korea.</i>

167
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:27,382
<i>-Thank you for listening.</i>
-What the hell?

168
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:31,261
Why are you here?

169
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:39,978
Anyway, she couldn't finish
what she was saying.

170
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:43,273
Still, she managed to say the hostage
situation is an election scheme.

171
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:46,026
You're right.
An ANSP agent blew the whistle,

172
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,861
so it'll cause a huge stir.

173
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,446
Shouldn't we do something too?

174
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,574
You're right. We can't just sit by
and watch. Don't you agree?

175
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:53,742
You're right.

176
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:56,578
Then how about we hang a banner that says

177
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:59,373
this hostage situation
is an election scheme?

178
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,041
-I'm for it.
-Me too.

179
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,709
-I'm for it too.
-Me too.

180
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,546
I'll help too.
But do we have what we need to make it?

181
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,253
If you make it to another country,

182
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:50,924
what do you want to do?

183
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:03,645
What about you, Comrade Kang?

184
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:12,571
I just want to live

185
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,907
an ordinary life

186
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:18,994
having babies, cooking, doing the laundry,

187
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,582
and nagging at my kids and husband

188
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,919
from time to time.

189
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,756
I want to live like that.

190
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:36,011
Without thinking about things
like country,

191
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:38,138
revolutions, or missions.

192
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,147
Will that be possible?

193
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,489
Yes, you'll live that life.

194
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:38,240
-Save my child! Please!
-Save my kid!

195
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:40,325
STOP THIS ELECTION SCHEME IMMEDIATELY

196
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,244
-Give me back my child!
-Save them!

197
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:45,289
-Let me through!
-Save my kid!

198
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:49,001
-Give me back my child!
-Save them!

199
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,628
-Let me through!
-Give me back my daughter!

200
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,965
Take all of the parents
to the interrogation rooms right away.

201
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:56,258
And…

202
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:58,927
Release An Gyeong-hui.

203
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:00,679
Tell him to get rid of Han-na. Now!

204
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,014
Yes, sir.

205
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:08,979
Understood, sir.

206
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:11,481
I will cover this up at all costs.

207
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:14,234
I will serve you with my life, Mr. Eun.

208
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:21,241
Once those running
with the 300 million dollars are caught,

209
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:23,994
we'll be able to live in luxury
like we used to.

210
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,203
Honey, listen.

211
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,999
This is a heaven-sent opportunity.
You must get it done.

212
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,125
Charlotte.

213
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,168
Yes?

214
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:33,378
Give me my Ray-Ban.

215
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:44,389
Hey, open the door! Now!

216
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:45,891
Open up!

217
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:47,434
-Open up!
-You wench!

218
00:20:47,517 --> 00:20:49,936
-Open the door now!
-Han-na.

219
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,897
-Han-na?
-Yes, sir.

220
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,942
RECORDING STUDIO 1

221
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:05,786
Damn it.

222
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,163
Han-na.

223
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:09,956
You're scaring me.

224
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:33,939
Let go of me, you bastards!

225
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:35,774
What are you doing? Let go of me!

226
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:37,234
-Let go of me!
-Stay still!

227
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:44,741
Are you out of your mind, Gyeong-hui?
You can't do this!

228
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,786
You're a public servant, not a gangster!
You can't--

229
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,538
Mr. Gal!

230
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:53,417
-Mr. Gal!
-Get him out of here.

231
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,751
Mr. Gal!

232
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:55,877
Mr. Gal…

233
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,296
Sang-sik, you got to press it hard
if you want to live.

234
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:00,048
Gun.

235
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:01,716
Mr. Gal!

236
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:11,268
I know your father is
an assemblyman in his third term,

237
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:14,146
but you've gone too far. Don't you think?

238
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,316
Jang Han-na!

239
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:23,905
My goodness.

240
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,074
Sir, please calm down.

241
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:30,328
An… I mean, Mr. An.

242
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:32,497
Thank you for calling me.

243
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:35,542
That bastard Gang-mu is solely responsible

244
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,627
for all this.

245
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:39,254
You know that, right?

246
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,840
Of course.

247
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:43,717
That bastard once pulled

248
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,720
a knife on you before, right?

249
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,098
What are you talking about?

250
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:51,641
The ANSP exists

251
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:54,102
to protect
the security of people in power.

252
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:58,565
I know I dug up dirt on someone I hated,
and destroyed him,

253
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:01,860
but how dare he rat on Director Park,
my right-hand man?

254
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,031
I was almost removed
from office because of that bastard!

255
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:09,159
Was it…

256
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:12,329
Was it because of you, Dad?

257
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,669
I only joined the ANSP to find out
why he left me all of a sudden.

258
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:22,214
But was it because of you, Dad?

259
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:26,301
Why did you have to
fall for a good-for-nothing like him?

260
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:27,636
He was different from you.

261
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:30,847
I fell in love with him
because he was so different from you!

262
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:33,683
Because he wasn't
a good-for-nothing like you!

263
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,352
-You little!
-Calm down.

264
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:37,729
-You!
-Gosh. Whoa, whoa.

265
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,817
-Please.
-Chief An.

266
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:46,112
Take her and beat her to a pulp!

267
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,158
Kill Lee Gang-mu, that bastard.

268
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:53,703
And make sure what she said
won't be in the news.

269
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:58,583
As you wish, sir. Leave it to me.

270
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:03,713
-Take her.
-Yes, sir.

271
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:07,092
Try to kill Gang-mu, and I'll kill you!

272
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,843
Remember that! Okay?

273
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:11,054
God damn it! Let go of me!

274
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:13,598
Let go of me, you bastards! Let go!

275
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:16,226
Han-na, come on, answer me.

276
00:24:18,478 --> 00:24:19,604
Jang Han-na?

277
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:22,482
Han-na.

278
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,486
You fool.

279
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,947
You shouldn't have been so reckless.

280
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:46,881
Yes.

281
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,634
Your sister and I

282
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,179
used to be best friends.

283
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:56,516
Then I found out

284
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:03,273
Yeon-ok was pregnant with the baby
of my fiancé that I loved so much.

285
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:09,029
But I couldn't do anything.

286
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:14,451
I couldn't stand it, so I came back to
Korea in the middle of writing my thesis.

287
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:18,121
And three days later,

288
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:21,291
I was dragged to the ANSP
without knowing why.

289
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:27,547
NAME: PI SEUNG-HUI
I…

290
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:40,644
<i>I didn't know back then</i>

291
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,648
<i>that those evil butchers were</i>

292
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,485
<i>fabricating the North Korean spy case
in Munich</i>

293
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:50,362
<i>to stabilize the administration's power</i>

294
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:51,863
<i>by using the fact that my fiancé was</i>

295
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:55,325
<i>a student of Professor Choi Seong-muk,
a pro-North scholar.</i>

296
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:59,871
<i>I held out for a few weeks,
but in the end…</i>

297
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,210
<i>I made a false confession.</i>

298
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,385
A false confession?

299
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:17,389
They insisted I was the one
who'd been to Pyongyang with my fiancé.

300
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:21,101
And I told them it wasn't me…

301
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:25,397
but Yeon-ok.

302
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:30,443
The woman who fell in love with my fiancé.

303
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,950
So,

304
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,621
my sister died because of you?

305
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,584
Yes, I'm to blame.

306
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:51,631
Because of me, Yeon-ok killed herself
while being tortured, and my fiancé

307
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:55,218
became a vegetable
because of all the torture.

308
00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:58,555
TAXI

309
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:00,390
Safe travels, ma'am.

310
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:07,605
<i>I visited him once a month
and paid his hospital bills.</i>

311
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,316
And I kept you by my side
to look after you

312
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:14,612
and justify what I did over and over
telling myself that…

313
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:19,242
anyone in my shoes would've made
a false confession.

314
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:21,911
That's a lie! You know that's a lie.

315
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,624
You did that to get back at her
for stealing your fiancé.

316
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,588
If you did it because of torture,

317
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:33,923
you wouldn't have been
spying for the ANSP.

318
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:38,303
Right. Maybe…

319
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,599
a part of me wanted to get back at her.

320
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:46,561
Because I resented Yeon-ok.

321
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,606
I resented her so much.

322
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:03,536
So you were going to take it to the grave?

323
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:07,999
I knew it was only right that I should

324
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:13,463
tell you and your parents the truth
and beg for forgiveness someday.

325
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,548
I knew that very well.

326
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:20,637
But I was afraid.

327
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:25,850
I was so afraid, Bun-ok.

328
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:32,482
The ANSP offered me the hall director job
and told me to spy for them,

329
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:34,359
and I couldn't say no.

330
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:38,780
I had no other choice. I…

331
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:42,492
I just…

332
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:50,917
had to live.

333
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:03,179
Didn't you tell me
not to try to only save my skin?

334
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:10,812
I'll never forgive you.

335
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:11,980
I will

336
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:15,400
never forgive you.

337
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,016
Comrade Joo.

338
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:51,853
The ship arrives in ten minutes.

339
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:58,526
Comrade Kang and Comrade Lim
must be on their way, right?

340
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:02,071
They even managed
to march 90km overnight once.

341
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,081
By the way,

342
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:15,835
it seems Comrade Kang

343
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,546
has feelings for Comrade Lim, doesn't it?

344
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:22,675
That must be why she came back
with the 300 million dollars.

345
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:27,180
I got to say,
the power of love is indeed great.

346
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:28,890
Damn.

347
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,062
Anyway,

348
00:30:34,145 --> 00:30:35,813
the moon looks

349
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:38,650
just like a <i>songpyeon.</i>

350
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:42,153
The <i>songpyeon</i> my mom makes

351
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:44,822
was really good.

352
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,952
God, I'm so hungry.

353
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:50,203
I wish

354
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:52,997
I could have a bite
of that Southern fried chicken

355
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,332
before I leave.

356
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,668
Cup noodles for me.

357
00:30:57,627 --> 00:30:58,920
Cup noodles?

358
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:00,588
Comrade Joo.

359
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:03,174
The thing about Southern fried chicken--

360
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:44,424
Where are Cheong-ya and Soo-ho?

361
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,178
Don't tell…

362
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:54,600
my mother about my death.

363
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:02,442
You should've waited until he answered.

364
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,027
Isn't it obvious?

365
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,071
They must've split up
to avoid the checkpoints.

366
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:36,559
What time is it?

367
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:38,978
We should watch the news. Wake up.

368
00:32:39,062 --> 00:32:41,522
It's time for the news. Guys, wake up.

369
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:47,236
Guys, the news is about to start!

370
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,488
Hurry up!

371
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:52,283
<i>Full of indignation about the
opposition party politically exploiting</i>

372
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:54,994
<i>the hostage situation,
the national tragedy,</i>

373
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:58,539
<i>and putting taking power
before the innocent students' safety,</i>

374
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,166
<i>I have</i>

375
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,212
<i>decided to reveal the truth
that was kept to the public</i>

376
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:06,798
<i>as Director Eun Chang-su wished.</i>

377
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:11,010
<i>Director Eun's only daughter Yeong-ro,</i>

378
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:14,430
<i>a freshman English Literature major
at Hosu Women's University,</i>

379
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:17,016
<i>is being held hostage in the dorm.</i>

380
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:21,229
<i>Every ANSP agent as well as Director Eun
has been fighting</i>

381
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:23,523
<i>against those Northern spies</i>

382
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:27,110
<i>as if the hostages were our own children.</i>

383
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,695
-That crazy…
<i>-So how could it</i>

384
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:32,031
<i>possibly be an election scheme?</i>

385
00:33:32,615 --> 00:33:36,202
<i>Respectable citizens,
the ANSP, the military, and the police</i>

386
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:42,208
<i>are doing our best to save those innocent
young lives with our sacred duties</i>

387
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,043
<i>as public servants in mind.</i>

388
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,135
Are you out of your mind?

389
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,595
Now that people know
Yeong-ro is my daughter,

390
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,973
I can't get her out first.

391
00:33:58,182 --> 00:34:00,560
That did occur to me, but…

392
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:02,019
It's not his fault.

393
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:03,521
I told him to do it.

394
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:05,857
What if Yeong-ro gets killed?

395
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,360
Enough with Yeong-ro!

396
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:12,280
I know that 1 a.m. radio show is
for young people,

397
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:13,823
but it aired nationwide.

398
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:16,534
Every ANSP office is
getting calls about it!

399
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:18,578
If you don't put an end to it,

400
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:21,080
what do you think Code 1 will do to you?

401
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,802
This is Eun Chang-su.

402
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:38,890
<i>Now people think
it might be an election scheme.</i>

403
00:34:41,642 --> 00:34:43,644
What's taking so long?

404
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,607
You must finish cleaning
and empty the trash can.

405
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,776
But, Mr. President.
The suspicion has grown

406
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:54,488
that it is an election scheme,
so if we kill all the students,

407
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:57,283
the opposition party
will make an issue of it

408
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,535
until the end.

409
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,746
So I think it's best

410
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:04,123
to save the students.

411
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,501
It'll give us an edge in the election.

412
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,047
<i>Please reconsider, sir.</i>

413
00:35:11,714 --> 00:35:14,217
The press is running wild and bashing us,

414
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,386
<i>but you want to release the 33 hostages?</i>

415
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:21,432
Are you confident
you can keep their mouths shut?

416
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:23,976
Yes, I will make sure

417
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:28,481
they keep their mouths shut.

418
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,650
Trust me, sir.

419
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:32,985
I'll call you back.

420
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,870
So you're trying to save all the students
to save your daughter, is that it?

421
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:47,375
Chief Kim.

422
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,338
-Hey, beat him.
-It wasn't me.

423
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:54,966
No! It wasn't me! I didn't know!

424
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:56,842
I had no idea, you bastard!

425
00:35:56,926 --> 00:35:59,095
How on earth could I know
she was a commie?

426
00:35:59,178 --> 00:36:00,304
Beat him!

427
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:01,639
-Yes, sir!
-No!

428
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:02,682
Mr. Nam!

429
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,686
Why are you still calling him that?

430
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:11,649
The Chief Presidential Secretary
wants to talk to you.

431
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:22,451
Mr. Kim! This is Nam Tae-il.

432
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:25,538
<i>The President wants you
to clean up the mess.</i>

433
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,918
This is your last chance.

434
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:35,840
Thank you!

435
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,928
I swear on my life!

436
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,888
At all costs!

437
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:44,807
No matter what!

438
00:36:45,182 --> 00:36:48,269
I'll clean it up neatly.
Please tell the President that!

439
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:50,187
Thank you!

440
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:23,804
You bastard!

441
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:27,683
You're nothing but the Chief of the
anti-communist investigation department!

442
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:31,604
How dare you beat me up,
this country's number two!

443
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,732
Damn it. I'm Nam Tae-il,

444
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:38,694
the shepherd protecting the President!

445
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:41,864
How dare you treat me
like a freaking commie!

446
00:37:57,254 --> 00:37:58,589
Where's Choi?

447
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:01,467
Hui-jun…

448
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:04,845
Release him right now.

449
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:06,430
Yes, sir.

450
00:38:16,982 --> 00:38:18,401
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

451
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,707
Hui-jun.

452
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:37,837
I'll take Eun down
and make you the director.

453
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:39,672
Tae-il…

454
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,051
I'll serve you with my life.

455
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:48,639
This is our last chance.
We must get it done with our lives.

456
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:55,771
Comrade Kang.

457
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:59,608
This is great.
We still have 30 minutes left.

458
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:05,406
<i>According to an official
from the Blue House,</i>

459
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,367
<i>a wiretapping agent at the scene exposed</i>

460
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:11,996
<i>that Director Eun's daughter
had been actively helping the spies,</i>

461
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,665
<i>and it was the main reason
of Director Eun's dismissal.</i>

462
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:19,503
<i>Let's hear from Secretary-General Nam
Tae-il who will now lead the task force.</i>

463
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:22,882
<i>It's very regrettable
that the ANSP director's daughter</i>

464
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,508
<i>has helped the Northern spies.</i>

465
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:28,846
<i>I promise to completely annihilate them
by the end of today,</i>

466
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:32,308
<i>so I urge our fellow citizens
not to deceived by false rumors,</i>

467
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,518
<i>and to keep calm and carry on.</i>

468
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:41,525
Don't let it bother you.
We have nothing to do with them anymore.

469
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:45,779
I'm sure

470
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,575
Nam Tae-il will try to blow up the dorm

471
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,703
because the hostages know who you are.

472
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:54,246
I told you, it's not your concern.

473
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:03,005
I have to go back.

474
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:07,426
What?

475
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:14,058
Yeong-ro is in danger.

476
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:26,862
You'll die if you go.

477
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:30,866
You will die.

478
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:36,372
Forget her.
Let's forget everything and leave.

479
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:51,762
I've come this far to forget everything.

480
00:40:55,182 --> 00:40:56,809
But I can't seem to do it.

481
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,272
I can't let Yeong-ro die.

482
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:03,107
What about me

483
00:41:04,817 --> 00:41:07,027
who came back to the dorm to save you?

484
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:14,577
Fine.

485
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:17,162
Forget about me.

486
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:19,748
But think about how you've been living.

487
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:22,710
If you leave on the ship,
you can live a new life.

488
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:24,837
You can live in luxury.

489
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:30,467
Do you still want to go?

490
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:45,566
I'm sorry.

491
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:55,951
Get out.

492
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,212
Get out.

493
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:36,784
Make it quick and come to the car.

494
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,167
Move!

495
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:54,885
Was it you?

496
00:42:56,762 --> 00:42:58,055
Not Ms. Oh?

497
00:42:58,138 --> 00:43:01,266
Don't resent me.
I'm just following the party's orders.

498
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:03,602
Eung-cheol and Gyeok-chan…

499
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:06,271
What happened to them?

500
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:09,900
Did you think you could live
after betraying the country?

501
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:19,618
They should've killed their traitor leader
and blown themselves up.

502
00:43:19,702 --> 00:43:21,662
Like revolutionary warriors should!

503
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:28,460
So,

504
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:33,298
You who has been living
a revolutionary warrior's life…

505
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:37,136
Have you been happy?

506
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:41,807
Since you had to hide
your identity from your son,

507
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:46,186
I'm sure you couldn't
have been a good dad.

508
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:48,856
I feel…

509
00:43:51,191 --> 00:43:52,860
sorry for you.

510
00:43:55,028 --> 00:43:56,363
I pity you.

511
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:00,534
If I survive this,

512
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:03,787
am I going to…

513
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,168
have to live like you?

514
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:24,433
I'm not afraid of death.

515
00:44:26,435 --> 00:44:27,644
But…

516
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:33,317
Yeong-ro is in danger.

517
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:38,322
Nam Tae-il has taken control.

518
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:42,618
You know what is

519
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:46,205
going to happen, don't you?

520
00:45:19,905 --> 00:45:21,865
God damn it!

521
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:29,748
Do you know who I was calling?

522
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,505
You know Professor Choi Seong-muk
at Humboldt University in Germany, right?

523
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:42,427
I don't know what you're talking about.

524
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:45,639
When I was studying in Germany,

525
00:45:46,682 --> 00:45:50,227
I'd visit the professor's house
with my friends,

526
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,355
and one day,

527
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:57,568
I brushed by a man leaving after meeting
the professor in the reception room.

528
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:01,905
I think it was about six seconds.

529
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:04,241
Then the professor let us

530
00:46:04,491 --> 00:46:09,329
taste the bear bile liquor
from Bukhan Mountain that guy gifted him.

531
00:46:10,998 --> 00:46:15,252
The smell of the liquor was so strong
that I could never forget it.

532
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:26,555
And I found this

533
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:30,100
in your room yesterday.

534
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:31,059
My goodness.

535
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,479
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I really am.

536
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:38,775
I'm well aware that I can't drink
alcohol in the dorm, but--

537
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:40,736
When I smelled this,

538
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,155
I remembered vividly.

539
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:48,201
That the man I brushed by
in Professor Choi's house…

540
00:46:51,747 --> 00:46:53,040
was you.

541
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:58,170
No, it couldn't be me.

542
00:46:58,253 --> 00:46:59,296
I have

543
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:03,634
been working
as the hall director of this dorm

544
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:07,638
for 10 years, 5 months, and 12 days now.

545
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:12,851
So don't you try to say I'm mistaken
or I must've seen wrong.

546
00:47:26,031 --> 00:47:27,491
So will you report me?

547
00:47:32,788 --> 00:47:36,792
You're dying of terminal cancer.
Why are you being so nosy?

548
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,217
I knew it. My hunch was right.

549
00:47:46,635 --> 00:47:48,303
You're a Northern spy, aren't you?

550
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,689
As Jo Ja-lip in China,

551
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:02,109
as Korean-German Park Seung-cheol
in Germany,

552
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:05,654
as Kanemoto Tatsuya in Japan,

553
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,240
and as Kim Man-dong.

554
00:48:11,326 --> 00:48:13,161
Do you know how I've managed

555
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:16,081
to keep my identity hidden for 30 years?

556
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:22,170
By killing everyone who found out
who I was without mercy.

557
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:26,800
All right.

558
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:30,595
I'll make an exception
and give you a final chance.

559
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:35,142
The chance to contribute
to the unification with me

560
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:38,103
and go down in history
as a revolutionary martyr

561
00:48:39,688 --> 00:48:43,400
rather than die as a mere hall director
that no one would remember.

562
00:48:47,112 --> 00:48:48,363
What do you say?

563
00:48:58,582 --> 00:48:59,708
Is that a no?

564
00:49:03,128 --> 00:49:05,422
If I have to live as a slave
to an ideology,

565
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:07,674
I choose to die as Song Hui-ju.

566
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:09,760
A slave?

567
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:13,096
It's our Supreme Leader's noble love
for the people--

568
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,139
Love?

569
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:17,601
They have no freedom, so how is it love?

570
00:49:18,226 --> 00:49:20,395
He says he loves them,
but he deceives, exploits,

571
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:23,482
-and rules them by fear!
-You damn wench!

572
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:27,778
Even if plucking a strand of someone's
hair would make the world a better place,

573
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:30,113
a wench like you still wouldn't do it.

574
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:32,407
You're wrong!

575
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:35,494
I also

576
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:38,288
used to dream of an equal world.

577
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:42,667
Because I used to
be an enthusiastic Marxist too!

578
00:49:45,337 --> 00:49:46,505
But…

579
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:51,843
The world that exists only for one person?
Does that make sense to you?

580
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:54,137
How is that an equal world?

581
00:49:59,392 --> 00:50:01,186
All for one!

582
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:04,397
And one for all!

583
00:50:05,857 --> 00:50:07,651
That's our party's key slogan.

584
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:10,946
We're all equal and living well
in the North.

585
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:15,200
Don't be absurd.

586
00:50:16,243 --> 00:50:20,539
You must've seen and heard many things
while living as a spy,

587
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:22,082
so you must know

588
00:50:22,165 --> 00:50:26,002
that only one person's truly
leading his own life in your country.

589
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:27,921
You know nothing. How dare you!

590
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:34,845
In this rotten capitalistic land,
all you care about

591
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:39,558
is eating well and living well.
Your bodily life.

592
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,727
But to us, our immortal, political lives

593
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:44,938
are more important.

594
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:49,568
What? Political lives?

595
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:51,528
Immortal?

596
00:50:52,904 --> 00:50:55,198
That sounds like
some pseudo-religious cult.

597
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:58,451
You people don't understand.

598
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:01,121
You'll never understand.

599
00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:13,425
You're all vermin
living without any ideology!

600
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:15,010
So how can you

601
00:51:15,468 --> 00:51:16,928
possibly understand us?

602
00:51:22,434 --> 00:51:23,643
Now I can see.

603
00:51:24,144 --> 00:51:25,687
I feel…

604
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:29,274
so bad for you.

605
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:39,117
I… pity you.

606
00:52:23,536 --> 00:52:25,288
Eung-cheol and Gyeok-chan are…

607
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:29,918
I'm sure they killed them.

608
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:34,256
Like pawns they're done using.

609
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,636
Once you get to Qingdao,

610
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:42,681
you should leave for somewhere safer.

611
00:52:58,613 --> 00:52:59,698
You take it.

612
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:01,866
Comrade Kang.

613
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,201
If you have this,

614
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:05,954
they won't try to kill you rashly.

615
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:10,458
If it can save your life,

616
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:13,128
that's enough for me.

617
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:32,689
You need it to live a comfortable life.

618
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:36,818
Don't make my heart

619
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:39,904
heavier than it already is.

620
00:53:42,782 --> 00:53:44,701
Eung-cheol, Gyeok-chan, and I

621
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:46,870
are all branded traitors,

622
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:50,332
so our families must be in danger.

623
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,585
Please get them

624
00:53:55,086 --> 00:53:57,505
out of the country for us…

625
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:02,135
and help them live comfortably.

626
00:54:04,346 --> 00:54:05,638
I will.

627
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:10,643
I will keep that promise no matter what.

628
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,855
Thank you.

629
00:54:18,026 --> 00:54:19,778
My name is Eun-hye.

630
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:22,072
Kim Eun-hye.

631
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:30,455
I hope…

632
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:34,334
you live an ordinary, happy life

633
00:54:35,627 --> 00:54:37,045
as Kim Eun-hye,

634
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:41,049
leaving behind the lives

635
00:54:42,592 --> 00:54:44,844
you lived as Kang Cheong-ya
and Moran Hill 1.

636
00:54:57,524 --> 00:54:58,650
And I…

637
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:39,524
GIVE BACK MY DAUGHTER

638
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,028
STOP THIS EVIL MASSACRE

639
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:55,248
MILITARY OPERATION
DO NOT CROSS

640
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:16,311
<i>Please.</i>

641
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,398
Please…

642
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:24,152
save the students.

643
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:26,738
<i>Once Nam Tae-il takes over,</i>

644
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,032
<i>he'll try to blow up the dorm right away.</i>

645
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:32,994
<i>So I'll release the students
before he comes.</i>

646
00:56:33,578 --> 00:56:35,747
Keeping people's mouths shut
is the ANSP's specialty.

647
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:38,291
So it won't be a problem.

648
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:40,835
What about you?

649
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:44,464
I…

650
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:48,801
I'll live quietly for the rest of my life.

651
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:52,597
<i>I'll make false statements
if you need me to.</i>

652
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,973
<i>"The ANSP</i>

653
00:56:54,807 --> 00:56:58,102
has persistently strived
to save the students

654
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:02,649
from the vicious armed Northern spies."

655
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:07,237
How can I trust you?

656
00:57:18,122 --> 00:57:21,459
They are just
innocent young college girls!

657
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,004
You know that!

658
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:30,510
<i>If the students can be spared,</i>

659
00:57:31,177 --> 00:57:32,512
I'll betray

660
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:36,099
my conscience and convictions
without hesitation.

661
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:44,148
All right.

662
00:57:44,232 --> 00:57:46,359
Release them in five minutes.

663
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,238
Honey!

664
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:53,825
You're not even the ANSP director anymore!

665
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:57,120
-You must get out of this for the future!
-Chief An.

666
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:01,666
Call the reporters in.

667
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:04,043
Releasing the students
is advantageous to us.

668
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:09,966
Gang-mu.

669
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:12,552
Gang-mu?

670
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,096
Mr. An.

671
00:58:16,472 --> 00:58:17,765
Listen.

672
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,228
You saw the SWAT team was largely
reinforced and the dorm is surrounded.

673
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:24,897
And there are no reporters at the scene.

674
00:58:25,898 --> 00:58:26,941
I'm warning you.

675
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:31,404
Anyone who gets out of the dorm
will be killed immediately.

676
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:48,796
An.

677
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:53,176
I'm sorry,

678
00:58:53,509 --> 00:58:56,095
but I need you to leave the scene now.

679
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:08,024
Let's get out.

680
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:10,985
Nam Tae-il is coming. We must go!

681
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:18,868
ROASTED SWEET POTATO

682
00:59:33,466 --> 00:59:36,219
Hey, wait. You need to pay.

683
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:37,887
No, look at that.

684
00:59:38,554 --> 00:59:39,597
Look over there.

685
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,627
CANDIDATE NO.1, PARK MU-YEOL
A COUNTRY WITHOUT CONFUSION

686
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,199
Crush it.

687
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:43,035
Stop!

688
01:00:44,412 --> 01:00:46,414
Stop!

689
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:11,481
Halt!

690
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:17,403
This is unprecedented.

691
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:20,364
What's the reason you,
the Secretary-General, took a tank here?

692
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:22,575
Is this an operation
that has been planned out?

693
01:01:26,204 --> 01:01:27,455
Fellow citizens,

694
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,248
I'm General Nam Tae-il

695
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:33,878
who led tanks across Han River
and saved the country from the crisis.

696
01:01:34,879 --> 01:01:36,506
And I've come myself

697
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:40,259
to punish the commie bastards
holding people hostage

698
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,179
in the middle of the capital of Korea.

699
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:46,432
I will make sure

700
01:01:46,808 --> 01:01:50,311
to put an end to this completely.

701
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:56,901
Advance!

702
01:01:56,984 --> 01:01:59,362
-My goodness.
-Hey, move.

703
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:01,614
Move aside!

704
01:02:21,884 --> 01:02:25,012
<i>Secretary-General Nam Tae-il
has taken the M48 Patton</i>

705
01:02:25,096 --> 01:02:28,349
<i>to Hosu University
from the Capital Defense Command.</i>

706
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:30,852
<i>If martial law has been declared,</i>

707
01:02:30,935 --> 01:02:34,647
<i>it's likely that troops will be sent
to Hosu University soon.</i>

708
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:38,651
<i>The Ministry of National Defense
hasn't made any announcements yet,</i>

709
01:02:38,734 --> 01:02:41,529
<i>but since the armed spies
can blow themselves up any moment,</i>

710
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:43,531
<i>-the military seems</i>
-Is that a tank?

711
01:02:43,614 --> 01:02:44,699
<i>-to be taking</i>
-It is!

712
01:02:44,782 --> 01:02:47,702
<i>-a hard line on its own.</i>
-Oh, no! What do we do?

713
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:49,871
What I'm seeing right now

714
01:02:49,954 --> 01:02:51,247
is a tank, right?

715
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:53,541
Are they saying the tank is coming here?

716
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:54,750
Are we going to die?

717
01:02:54,834 --> 01:02:56,836
What do we do now?

718
01:02:56,919 --> 01:03:00,673
What now? You're the only person
who can fight with a gun here!

719
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:03,384
I really don't want to die here!

720
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:06,554
Where did the spies go
after making this mess?

721
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,223
-Did they run off
-Calm down.

722
01:03:09,307 --> 01:03:10,933
after putting us in danger?

723
01:03:11,017 --> 01:03:13,060
-I don't want to die!
-Calm down!

724
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:16,397
WE ARE THE VICTIMS OF THE ELECTION SCHEME

725
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:23,195
Before they break in,

726
01:03:25,364 --> 01:03:27,533
we will get out of the dorm.

727
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:34,540
Let's all go to the prayer room. Now.

728
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:36,792
Come on. Let's go!

729
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:38,336
Let's go. Hurry!

730
01:03:38,419 --> 01:03:40,838
-Hurry up!
-I'm so scared!

731
01:03:40,922 --> 01:03:43,174
-I'm scared.
-Let's go.

732
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:48,846
-Salute!
-Salute!

733
01:03:50,973 --> 01:03:53,100
-Welcome back, sir.
-Sir.

734
01:03:58,022 --> 01:03:59,106
Hey.

735
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,192
Why is that bastard still here?

736
01:04:01,275 --> 01:04:02,360
Huh?

737
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:07,657
God, you think
you can be here as you like?

738
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,367
Get them out!

739
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:14,163
-This way, sir.
-Hey, get me the detonator. Now.

740
01:04:14,246 --> 01:04:15,289
Are you looking for this?

741
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,377
You bastard--

742
01:04:36,268 --> 01:04:37,520
Honey!

743
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:39,397
Honey…

744
01:04:40,439 --> 01:04:41,941
You idiot.

745
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:45,486
You know Han-na said on the radio

746
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:48,280
we'd kill all the students

747
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:50,366
We must

748
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:53,119
save all of them to win the election.

749
01:04:53,703 --> 01:04:57,665
We must save the students.

750
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:01,002
The President ordered to kill them all,
you bastard!

751
01:05:01,085 --> 01:05:04,463
-The President ordered to kill them!
-Get them out now!

752
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,091
-How dare you!
-Calm down.

753
01:05:13,597 --> 01:05:15,891
Let's go to the hospital first.

754
01:05:15,975 --> 01:05:17,018
Hold on.

755
01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:19,937
Yes, Seung-jun.

756
01:05:21,105 --> 01:05:23,816
Let Jang Han-na go.

757
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:25,735
Jang Han-na, sir?

758
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:28,696
Are you trying to make an enemy of Code 1?

759
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:30,406
What's wrong with you?

760
01:05:30,489 --> 01:05:34,285
Well, but she's being questioned
about the broadcast.

761
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:35,369
Now!

762
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:37,288
Yes.

763
01:05:37,371 --> 01:05:38,581
<i>Understood, sir.</i>

764
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:47,339
-How did it go last night?
-I lost it all.

765
01:05:49,258 --> 01:05:51,093
-You really lost it all?
-Yes.

766
01:05:51,177 --> 01:05:54,013
Okay, then. It'll be my treat tonight.

767
01:06:10,821 --> 01:06:13,949
-What are you doing?
-Hey, stop!

768
01:06:14,033 --> 01:06:16,994
We must lure the SWAT team
at the shrine to the main door.

769
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:33,260
I'll do it.

770
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:36,764
If I hold the banner that says
this is an election scheme

771
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:38,224
on the rooftop,

772
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:40,976
won't they come up
to the rooftop to get me?

773
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,311
No, that's too dangerous.

774
01:06:42,394 --> 01:06:45,022
It's better to lure them
by radioing An Gyeong-hui.

775
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:50,194
He's the one who killed my sister, right?

776
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:54,532
Let me radio him.

777
01:07:06,627 --> 01:07:07,711
Mr. Lee.

778
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:10,047
Mr. Lee!

779
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:11,715
Mr. Lee!

780
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:16,095
Han-na. What on earth happened?

781
01:07:16,178 --> 01:07:19,598
I'll tell you in person.
I'm driving a bus to the dorm.

782
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:21,600
All right.

783
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:23,352
We'll lure them to the main door,

784
01:07:23,435 --> 01:07:24,854
<i>-so come to the shrine.</i>
-Okay.

785
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:26,730
I'll get there in 15 minutes.

786
01:07:33,028 --> 01:07:34,530
Give me the radio.

787
01:07:57,678 --> 01:07:58,679
Hello?

788
01:07:58,762 --> 01:08:00,139
It's located in the west.

789
01:08:01,682 --> 01:08:04,226
<i>Hello? Sir?</i>

790
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:06,270
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

791
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:09,982
What is it this time?

792
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:11,859
<i>I told you not to radio me.</i>

793
01:08:12,943 --> 01:08:13,777
Listen.

794
01:08:13,861 --> 01:08:17,698
Some of the kids just went up
to the rooftop with a banner that says

795
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:19,283
<i>this is an election scheme.</i>

796
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:22,077
To the rooftop?

797
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:23,662
What about Gang-mu?

798
01:08:27,124 --> 01:08:30,377
He's in front of the door to the rooftop
to protect the kids.

799
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,674
You have to spare me. I must live to--

800
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:37,009
I got it.

801
01:08:37,092 --> 01:08:39,345
Who is she? Can we trust her?

802
01:08:39,428 --> 01:08:42,806
She's the one who tipped me off
that Kang Cheong-ya was a Northern spy.

803
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:48,479
Move all the forces near the shrine
to the main door.

804
01:08:48,562 --> 01:08:50,272
And tell them to go in.

805
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:51,315
Yes, sir.

806
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:57,488
Good job.

807
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:18,092
It's an emergency exit
on basement two, okay?

808
01:09:18,175 --> 01:09:19,718
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

809
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:21,470

Don't you dare to die in there.
I'll kill you if you do.

841
01:12:34,496 --> 01:12:36,623
I'll die at your hands if I have to die.

842
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:41,295
So don't worry, and go without me. Now.

<i>I remember</i>

983
01:33:52,231 --> 01:33:54,692
<i>when I first met you at Rome Coffee Shop.</i>

984

<i>To be honest,</i>

987
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:15,087
<i>I've had feelings for you since then.</i>

988

<i>If I were…</i>

989
01:34:25,097 --> 01:34:26,974
<i>just an ordinary young man…</i>

990
01:34:27,725 --> 01:34:29,435
Wait!

991
01:34:36,692 --> 01:34:37,735
Do you…

992
01:34:39,653 --> 01:34:40,863
want to have…

993
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:42,782
<i>I would have</i>

994
01:34:44,784 --> 01:34:46,994
<i>asked you out on a date that day.</i>

995
01:34:49,038 --> 01:34:50,331
<i>Then we…</i>

996
01:34:53,417 --> 01:34:55,127

01:35:15,314 --> 01:35:16,899

1001

<i>to spend a long time with you.</i>

1002
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:28,244
<i>How did I…</i>

1003
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:32,289
become someone who shouldn't

1004
01:35:33,332 --> 01:35:34,792
stay by your side?

1005
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:39,213

01:36:13,873 --> 01:36:15,082
I will…

1013
01:36:19,628 --> 01:36:21,630
I'll remember you forever.

1014
01:36:30,764 --> 01:36:32,057
Yeong-ro.

1015
