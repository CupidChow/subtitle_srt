EPISODE 7

3
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:20,018
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

4
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,189
You leave.

5
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,108
This is our dorm.

6
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:30,195
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

7
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:34,032
Oh, my goodness.

8
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:35,783
Keep your heads down!

9
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,210
You…

10
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,047
You don't know who I am, do you?

11
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,385
Why can't I hear them?

12
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:57,555
I think she's speaking too quietly.

13
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,598
Turn the volume up then!

14
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:00,058
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,781
I'll tell you.

16
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:22,747
I'm…

17
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,335
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

18
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,679
If you don't believe me,
go check with them.

19
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:44,811
Eun Chang-su,

20
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,730
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

21
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,693
is my father.

22
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,279
-I can't hear her. What's she saying?
-Why is she whispering?

23
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:55,196
I don't know.

24
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,059
Let them go.

25
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,562
Let them all go!

26
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,564
It's working again.

27
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:46,456
<i>You will never…</i>

28
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,044
<i>get a chance to be released again.</i>

29
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,615
Since she doesn't want to leave,

30
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,409
only nine will be released.

31
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,794
You evil bastard.

32
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,505
Release one more person
since I'm not leaving!

33
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:36,672
Who do you think you are?

34
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,883
To me, you are…

35
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:43,846
just…

36
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,851
a human shield.

37
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,152
Comrade Joo.

38
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:00,905
Have her stand by the windows.

39
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,243
Now!

40
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:15,586
Ms. Hall Director.

41
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,077
The daughter of the ANSP director
has been living in the dorm.

42
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:50,538
<i>That must've been bothering you.</i>

43
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:57,211
<i>Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?</i>

44
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,505
I heard the ANSP director is

45
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,258
one of the most
powerful people in the South.

46
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:04,927
And such a person's daughter
living in the dorm?

47
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,514
Did Yeong-ro tell you herself that she is

48
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:10,641
<i>the daughter of the ANSP director?</i>

49
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,769
<i>She was quiet about it</i>

50
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,563
even when she was
being kicked out of here.

51
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:17,857
Kicked out?

52
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,320
It was decided she leave the dorm
as a punishment for hiding you.

53
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,490
She hid him?

54
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:27,325
Hid the communist spy?

55
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,826
Your daughter really did it?

56
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:32,997
<i>She helped you because she believed
she was doing the right thing.</i>

57
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:38,419
<i>So he was willing to accept any punishment
without any regret or reflection.</i>

58
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:42,423
<i>But her courage and sacrifice ended up</i>

59
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:45,218
<i>putting everyone in the dorm in danger.</i>

60
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:51,265
So imagine
how Yeong-ro must be feeling right now.

61
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:54,101
If you can understand that
even just a little bit,

62
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,232
it's only right for you
to release as many hostages as possible.

63
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:02,318
That is…

64
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:07,156
the least you can do for her,

65
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,408
who saved you risking her life.

66
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:19,835
I think I made it very clear
that only nine hostages will be released.

67
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,671
You were her partner at the Open House.

68
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:24,090
I remember that you seemed quite nervous.

69
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:26,175
Was it all for show?

70
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,636
To take full advantage of Yeong-ro?

71
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:29,720
Let's go.

72
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:37,270
I need to go to

73
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,272
the bathroom first.

74
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,540
RESTROOM

75
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:06,882
Eung-cheol doesn't look good.

76
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,509
Can we

77
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:09,885
trust that doctor?

78
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,932
The hall director's in the restroom.
Bring her when she's done.

79
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,921
What are you doing? Hurry up.

80
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,425
Just give me a second.

81
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,535
I can see the students are safe.

82
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:59,745
Now I need to see
if my team leader is okay.

83
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,122
Where's he now?

84
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:03,791
Not now.

85
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,379
He can't have surgery
until his fever breaks anyway.

86
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:14,802
I mean, the doctor's doing nothing, so how
about my team leader get surgery first?

87
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,189
He has a gunshot wound.

88
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:29,275
He needs surgery as soon as possible.

89
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:31,610
-What's wrong with treating him while--
-Hey!

90
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:34,321
Are you kidding?

91
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,574
He shot at me,
and you want us to let him get treated?

92
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:41,996
Keep your word.

93
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,915
You promised to release hostages,
let me check the students' safety,

94
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,543
and let the doctor do surgery
on my team leader.

95
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:51,172
I brought Dr. Kang here
because you agreed on those terms.

96
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:57,928
You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?

97
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:02,850
I'll kill you first if anything goes
wrong, so don't mess with me.

98
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,906
How is he?

99
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,743
His temperature's still 38°C,
and it's not going down.

100
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:50,523
It's because the infection caused
a high white blood cell count.

101
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:53,692
I gave him a fever reducer,
so it'll go down in two to three hours.

102
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,618
<i>SWAT team breaking in soon.</i>

103
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,453
<i>The whole dorm is being wiretapped.</i>

104
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:18,884
Then why don't you treat
their team leader until then?

105
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:21,178
I think that's better as well.

106
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:30,980
The ANSP team leader
will be treated first.

107
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,606
Comrade.

108
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,530
Treat him? We should be killing him.

109
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,744
For now, it's most important
to maintain mutual trust.

110
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,290
<i>Trust?</i>

111
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,376
Their goal is killing us.
How can we trust them?

112
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:58,215
Just keep an eye on the hostages.
That's your job.

113
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,428
Especially those by the windows.

114
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,142
No problem?

115
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,269
No problem?

116
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,354
Didn't you say
there was no problem with her?

117
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:15,733
Yes, according to
all those weekly reports!

118
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,652
That damn Pi.

119
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,946
She even went through
water and electric torture.

120
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,823
How dare she stab me in the back?

121
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:25,469
My goodness.

122
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,596
I got to say,

123
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,848
you are indeed a liability.

124
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,142
A liability to us.

125
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:35,729
Even your child
has become a liability now.

126
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:37,564
Unbelievable.

127
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,191
Oh, right.

128
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,985
-Hey, An.
-Yes, sir.

129
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:45,572
Does hiding a communist spy
count as espionage?

130
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:50,077
To be precise,
it's aiding and abetting espionage.

131
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:51,912
My God.

132
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,163
The ANSP director

133
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,000
should be in the vanguard
of anti-communism and counterespionage.

134
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,085
You're a disgrace to our country.

135
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,878
Don't you think?

136
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,511
I was just kidding.

137
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,519
<i>By the way, ma'am,</i>

138
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:18,814
I know he said
it should be 13 young virgins,

139
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,941
but does it have to be exactly 13?

140
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:24,319
Bingo!

141
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:26,739
As a matter of fact,

142
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:30,409
I was dying to know about that all night,

143
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:34,163
so I called the fortuneteller
first thing in the morning.

144
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:40,419
What did he say?

145
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:43,714
He said it should be

146
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:45,382
exactly 13 virgins.

147
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,509
No more, no less.

148
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:49,303
Exactly 13.

149
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,598
Then it's very unlikely.

150
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,269
I mean, how will the spies kill

151
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:00,397
exactly 13 as if they know about it?

152
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:04,234
There are more than 70 hostages
in the dorm.

153
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:05,861
My goodness.

154
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,654
That many?

155
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:08,697
Yes.

156
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,865
That reminds me.

157
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:12,743
They're supposed to release
some of the hostages today.

158
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:15,829
Release?

159
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:18,207
How many?

160
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,044
Well, as many as the spies want, I guess.

161
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:25,839
Yes, I guess so.

162
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,227
What kind of man is
Eun Chang-su, the ANSP director?

163
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,152
Do you want me

164
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:30,612
to brief you on my boss?

165
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:32,489
<i>Brief a Northern spy?</i>

166
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:35,617
<i>I'm holding tens of students hostage,</i>

167
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:37,411
<i>yet he's fooled me twice.</i>

168
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,788
Is he foolish enough
to try to fool me again?

169
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,791
<i>Was Cheong-ya caught?</i>

170
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,043
<i>Was Han-na caught?</i>

171
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:47,254
<i>The ANSP director is
dealing with you himself?</i>

172
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:49,798
<i>A mere Northern spy like you?</i>

173
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:51,717
The director himself?

174
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,427
His daughter is being held hostage,

175
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,097
so I'm sure he ran over in a rush.

176
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,433
<i>The director's daughter?</i>

177
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:11,862
The whole building is
rigged with C4 bombs,

178
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:13,864
from basement two to the third floor.

179
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,159
<i>If you try to deceive me again,</i>

180
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:19,578
<i>the bombs will go off all at once.</i>

181
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,748
Check if it's true.

182
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,084
If I push this button,

183
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:28,128
you, I,

184
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,631
and the 70 hostages

185
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:33,508
will all die.

186
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:35,969
Then

187
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,138
Director Eun Chang-su

188
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,391
<i>won't even find his daughter's body.</i>

189
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:46,021
How dare that bastard
threaten him like that?

190
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,150
Wait, Eun.

191
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,569
Don't tell me you believe that bulls***.

192
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:53,737
I should.

193
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,989
If the bombs explode
and the students get killed,

194
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:57,032
what will you do?

195
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,743
<i>You'll blow yourself and your men up?</i>

196
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:04,122
Aren't you their leader?

197
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:06,416
Is Geum-cheol's death not enough?

198
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,418
Are you going
to lead the rest to death too?

199
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:13,131
I'll do anything for my men's honor.

200
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:16,718
I won't let them die as traitors.

201
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,305
I'd rather blow ourselves up

202
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,058
to die heroes for my country.

203
00:19:32,776 --> 00:19:33,777
What is this?

204
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,570
Don't tell me

205
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:38,323
what he just said is scaring you.

206
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:40,200
My goodness.

207
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,871
You're too chicken to serve the country.

208
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,790
We can just get them all at once

209
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:49,251
before they blow themselves up.

210
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,795
Get them all at once? How?

211
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:56,091
I knew this might happen,
so I already put another plan into action.

212
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:03,932
Dr. Kang will knock out two
of the communist spies with injections,

213
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,434
so all you need to do

214
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:08,186
is get rid of the booby traps
on basement two.

215
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,274
Then our SWAT team
will go in secretly and kill

216
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:14,818
the last one.

217
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:17,029
I understand, sir.

218
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:20,115
<i>I call it</i>

219
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:23,118
<i>"Operation One-shot-two-kills."</i>

220
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:27,414
<i>Saving your daughter and getting them
at the same time. What do you think?</i>

221
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:29,207
Isn't it a good plan?

222
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,169
Are you insane? They'll blow themselves up
if we fool them again.

223
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:33,128
But what?

224
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:36,381
I can't believe this.

225
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:38,842
My, this is so frustrating.

226
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,429
Teaching at the Military Academy
suits you better.

227
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:44,306
Why are you even the ANSP director?

228
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:54,733
Mr. Lee.

229
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:02,240
Are you all right?

230
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,623
Let go of him!

231
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:14,920
A gun in the medical kit.

232
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,839
SWAT team breaking in
via an emergency exit.

233
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,217
Are you all right, Mr. Lee?

234
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,135
Are you okay?

235
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,231
How could you make him suffer like that?

236
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,441
He's your hostage.
Is this really necessary?

237
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,693
Didn't you people kill Geum-cheol?

238
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:42,823
No, we didn't.

239
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:47,411
He took cyanide and dropped dead
according to that stupid manual of yours.

240
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,085
Drop dead?

241
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,548
Don't speak ill of our late comrade.

242
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:03,468
Do you understand?

243
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:07,848
You idiot!

244
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:12,436
Didn't I tell you
to always keep your temper?

245
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,480
Are you stupid? You're not even armed.

246
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:35,125
Don't cross the line.

247
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:42,716
If you want to maintain our mutual trust.

248
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:48,638
Should I see his wound?

249
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,404
You follow me.

250
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:08,867
<i>I'll release some of the hostages.</i>

251
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,550
Don't shoot!

252
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,015
You can come out.

253
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:34,935
It's all right.

254
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:36,645
Go.

255
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:38,188
It's okay. Don't worry.

256
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:42,567
Let's go!

257
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:51,326
-The hostages are coming out. Move!
-Help them to safety!

258
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,288
Go, go.

259
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,165
Hurry up!

260
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:02,879
Stop.

261
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:06,132
Get them into the ambulance
and the rest into the van.

262
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:07,217
Yes, sir.

263
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,803
Move it!

264
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:14,516
-Hey, leave right away.
-Yes, sir.

265
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,102
-Get them in now.
-Yes, sir.

266
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:22,524
They're all being moved.

267
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:25,151
Make sure they all keep their mouths shut.

268
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:26,486
Yes, sir.

269
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,462
Well, I sent five injured students

270
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,339
to the ANSP-designated hospital.

271
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,301
And as for the remaining four,

272
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:52,178
I sent them to our agency for questioning.

273
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:53,972
-Salute!
-Salute!

274
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:01,062
Thank you for your hard work.

275
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,023
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

276
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,899
What a surprise.

277
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,695
You guys must not have had anything to eat
since last night.

278
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:12,324
Hello, Mr. Nam.

279
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:16,745
Honey.

280
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,585
We were starving, actually.

281
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:27,672
Oh, my, ma'am. It doesn't look like food.

282
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:30,800
It looks like artwork.
It's too pretty to eat.

283
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:36,556
I must say,

284
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:40,185
you sure are full of surprises.

285
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:43,605
You have such a considerate wife.
You're so lucky.

286
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:48,943
All right. Let's dig in.

287
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:52,238
In any case, some of the hostages
have been released.

288
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:54,199
Let's eat and get back
to fighting those spies.

289
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,743
All right, guys. Let's dig in!

290
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:58,745
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

291
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:00,330
Thank you, ma'am.

292
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,335
Come eat.

293
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:15,136
-What is it?
-You should see the news.

294
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:21,726
<i>Controversy arose over Professor Han</i>

295
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,561
-What?
<i>-who was found dead on a Northern</i>

296
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:24,604
<i>-spy boat.</i>
-It's Gal.

297
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:29,150
<i>There was a suspicion that the economics
professor tried to defect to the North,</i>

298
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,820
<i>but decisive evidence has been revealed</i>

299
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:34,030
<i>that the North in fact
tried to abduct him.</i>

300
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:38,034
<i>According to the Catholic Priests
Association for Justice,</i>

301
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:41,830
<i>Priest Kim Hyeon-seung received
a tape recording from Han I-seop,</i>

302
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:45,500
<i>and the tape contains the voice of the spy</i>

303
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,378
<i>who tried to abduct him on November 27.</i>

304
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:51,047
What did you just say?

305
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,676
Where did you say my son is?
He's studying in the US.

306
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,680
Your son isn't in Boston.
He's in Pyongyang.

307
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:00,849
In Pyongyang?

308
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:02,726
Who are you?

309
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:04,310
Who are you people?

310
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:06,688
Did you kidnap my son?

311
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:09,607
If you want to save him,
come with us to Pyongyang.

312
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:10,692
Stop the car!

313
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:11,985
Stop the car!

314
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:15,238
Stop the car! Now--

315
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:20,285
<i>Saying it was likely to be
the spies' second attempt to abduct him,</i>

316
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:23,329
<i>the CPAJ denied the rumor
about him defecting to the North.</i>

317
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:27,500
<i>And the opposition party is claiming that
the current administration is behind it,</i>

318
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:29,794
<i>so it's expected to have a huge impact.</i>

319

<i>Reporting from Yeyeon Cathedral,

321
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:47,687
Why me, sir?

322
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:50,565
I'll fix it.

323
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:52,817
What do you mean, fix it?

324
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:53,902
It's in the news!

325
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,612
How will you fix it?

326
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:57,655
You bastard. It's hot! Stop right there!

327
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:01,534
-First, I'll sue them for defaming ANSP.
-Come here. Why you…

328
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:04,078
-Come here, you bastard.
-And, sir,

329
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:07,874
I'll issue summonses against
the CPAJ and that bastard Gal Sang-sik.

330
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:10,043
-What? You idiot!
-Stop the nonsense and get out!

331
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,548
-Well…
-Everyone, out.

332
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:16,674
Hey.

333
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:18,927
-You should go home.
-Okay.

334
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,136
Get out.

335
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,890
Where are you going, you idiots?
Come back here!

336
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:26,100
Hey.

337
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:27,852
Are you crazy?

338
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:29,771
Why did you tell them to leave?

339
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:34,108
We must press charges, make up evidence
that he was defecting, and make it public!

340
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,861
Hey!

341
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:40,406
Did you find anything useful in Han's bag?

342
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:44,577
Well, we found a letter
from his son in Pyongyang--

343
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:47,789
Why have you still not used it?
Make it public now!

344
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:49,415
Fabricate evidence if necessary!

345
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,458
Shut up!

346
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:53,920
What?

347
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:57,924
"Shut up"?

348
00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,884
Fabricate evidence?

349
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:03,513
We've given the press guidelines
every morning trying to shut them up,

350
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:04,597
but it didn't work!

351
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:09,394
They have hard evidence. You think you can
cover it up with fabricated evidence?

352
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:10,854
Then what?

353
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:12,981
We just let the opposition party
have their way?

354
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:15,692
Our candidate will lose the election
for sure at this rate.

355
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:22,699
Pick it up.

356
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,664
Eun Chang-su speaking.

357
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,669
It seems plan B also failed.

358
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,300
I'm sorry, sir.

359
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:41,551
I'll find the--

360
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:45,054
Come in by five with a solution.

361
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:48,349
Yes, sir.

362
00:29:58,192 --> 00:30:00,737
-What did he say?
-To come in by five.

363
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,530
What? What do we do?

364
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:05,825
This is bad. We'll catch hell
if we go without a solution.

365
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:08,244
Wait, Eun!

366
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:10,121
-Wait.
-Then we should…

367
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:14,459
come up with a solution.

368
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:19,672
We should let the press know

369
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:21,591
about the hostage situation in the dorm.

370
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:24,052
Are you crazy? Yeong-ro is in there.

371
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:28,264
If we also reveal the fact that
they have the ANSP director's daughter,

372
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:30,558
I doubt they'll hurt our Yeong-ro.

373
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,645
But they already know she's my daughter.

374
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,980
They're still willing
to die with the hostages.

375
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:39,984
If they find out we've told the press,
they might blow themselves up.

376
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:42,570
Then we should

377
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,741
make the North order them
not to blow themselves up.

378
00:30:46,824 --> 00:30:49,911
That's impossible.
They want us to send them back unscathed.

379
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:52,705
We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.

380
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:55,208
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars

381
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,919
just to save those expendable spies?

382
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:03,967
The presidential election is in ten days.

383
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,177
You can take care of this
after the election's won.

384
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,887
If we make this drag on

385
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,974
and be in the news every day
up until the election,

386
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:13,977
nobody will pay attention
to Han I-seop's case.

387
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,395
Definitely.

388
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:19,315
Hoping to fight against the Northern spies
holding the girls hostage,

389
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:22,902
I'm sure people will vote
for candidate Park Mu-yeol.

390
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,362
Exactly.

391
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:32,787
I'll talk to Lim Ji-rok then.

392
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,746
Okay!

393
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,374
Withdraw the SWAT team right away.

394
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:38,209
I'll take care of that.

395
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:41,337
So you go do your job.
Hurry up. We have no time to lose.

396
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:44,007
Hey! Get me the radio!

397
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,926
SWAT team, stand by. Don't do anything!

398
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,471
<i>Anyone move a finger,
and I'll kill that bastard myself!</i>

399
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:39,020
Get dressings ready.

400
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:40,396
Okay.

401
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:43,816
Give me the gun.

402
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:46,444
Now.

403
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:07,965
This is bad.

404
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,426
I totally forgot about it.

405
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,179
I'm supposed to meet Antonio
at Rome Coffee Shop at five.

406
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:15,932
What if he thinks I stood him up?

407
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:17,725
Are you serious right now?

408
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:19,268
Antonio?

409
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:23,648
What about your lovers here?

410
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:27,777
Are you seriously worried about that now?

411
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,238
I guess you haven't heard yet.

412
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:33,074
She and Gwang-tae are through.

413
00:33:33,157 --> 00:33:37,161
And she's started seeing Antonio
this month. To learn Italian.

414
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:40,623
Oh, no.

415
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:42,416
The criminal law final is tomorrow.

416
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,293
They must know
we're being held here, right?

417
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:45,795
They won't hold the exam, right?

418
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,470
Did she just laugh? Hey.

419
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,472
What's so funny?

420
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,559
You leech living off the tuition we pay.

421
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:01,227
What?

422
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,229
"Leech living off the tuition we pay"?

423
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:05,148
What? Am I wrong?

424
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,774
That's what you are.

425
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:07,692
Don't you agree?

426
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:09,026
Hey, Polka Dot.

427
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:11,571
Shut your trap.

428
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:27,295
You confidently promised to get
300 million dollars from them in ten days.

429
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:32,258
Rescuing your son
as well as getting 300 million dollars…

430
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,344
Will that be really possible?

431
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:48,065
<i>Despite knowing it's impossible,</i>

432
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:50,568
<i>he's trying to buy time.</i>

433
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,197
<i>The almighty Lim Ji-rok is also</i>

434
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:56,782
<i>just another father who loves his child.</i>

435
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,223
Lim Ji-rok speaking.

436
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:21,807
Mr. Lim.

437
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,686
I'm sorry about last time. I apologize.

438
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,271
It was so urgent that--

439
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:29,190
<i>When on earth are you going to send</i>

440
00:35:29,273 --> 00:35:31,484
our agents in the dorm back to us?

441
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:34,987
It's been exposed that Han was abducted

442
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:37,281
and not defecting to the North.

443
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:40,243
So Aemin Party is
in a tough spot right now.

444
00:35:40,326 --> 00:35:42,286
That's your problem.

445
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,623
Send our agents
back to the North right away!

446
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,375
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this,</i>

447
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,377
but we have no choice but to make

448
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:51,295
the hostage situation public.

449
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:52,880
<i>What?</i>

450
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:54,548
The hostage situation?

451
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,431
What on earth is your big plan
you want to carry out?

452
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,268
As for the spies, how about we kill

453
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:07,270
all three?

454
00:36:07,353 --> 00:36:08,521
Kill all three?

455
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:11,691
Are you seriously
thinking of killing them all?

456
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:14,568
Sir, it's just three spies.
If you sacrifice them,

457
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:16,612
you'll get 300 million dollars.

458
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:19,031
Just three spies?

459
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:22,326
<i>Send our agents back to us unscathed!</i>

460
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,829
Send them back right away! If you don't,

461
00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:26,872
there will be war! You hear me?

462
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:29,917
Sir.

463
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,343
Yeon-hwa!

464
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:44,056
Send them a message

465
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,475
that they must come back alive! Now!

466
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,144
Yes, sir.

467
00:36:48,227 --> 00:36:49,103
Anyway,

468
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:52,523
the Secretary's Office wants
to see you right now.

469
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:54,942
Right now?

470
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:14,337
Mr. Lim?

471
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:18,716
This is Choi Su-ryeon,
the deputy director of MSS.

472
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:20,885
I see.

473
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:23,179
You'll have to negotiate with me
from now on.

474
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:26,515
<i>I'm sure</i>

475
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,393
our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.

476
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:33,397
Kill them.

477
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:09,642
Comrade Choi Su-ryeon just told
the South to kill all of our spies.

478
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:31,247
STOP
SECURITY CHECKPOINT

479
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,919
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

480
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:38,129
What's going on?

481
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,344
You did well.

482
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:52,643
Could you put the rifle away?

483
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,979
Don't you know
about the Geneva Conventions?

484
00:38:55,604 --> 00:38:59,108
Even during war, you can't attack any
of your enemy's medical staff or hospitals

485
00:38:59,191 --> 00:39:00,818
that wounded soldiers are in.

486
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:12,455
What did you do to him?
Why isn't he waking up?

487
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:15,207
Midazolam is

488
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:18,794
a sedative you use before surgery.

489
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,715
Hold on.

490
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,017
Stand up.

491
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:01,212
Look. How could you suspect the doctor?

492
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:04,298
If they wanted to kill you,
they wouldn't have sent in a doctor,

493
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:05,799
but an armed agent.

494
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:12,533
Calm down. She's just a doctor!

495
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:14,118
Stop!

496
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,551
What's going on?

497
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:32,177
Why is there music playing?

498
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:33,929
Why? Fix it! Now!

499
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:35,556
Fix it! Hurry up!

500
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:39,435
Why is there music playing? Fix it!

501
00:41:39,518 --> 00:41:42,354
Fix it, you bastards!

502
00:41:57,953 --> 00:42:00,914
I didn't know. I swear!
I didn't know about it.

503
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:02,875
Comrade.

504
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,668
I found a pistol in her bag.

505
00:42:04,752 --> 00:42:06,003
A pistol!

506
00:42:11,925 --> 00:42:13,344
You found it, so let it go.

507
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:28,901
They've deceived us three times,
but what? "Let it go"?

508
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:32,237
They're looking down on us
because you're so soft!

509
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:05,896
What the hell are you doing?

510
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,332
It's an emergency.

511
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:26,709
<i>The doctor's in danger.</i>

512
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,794
<i>It's an emergency. The doctor's in danger.</i>

513
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:31,880
Which sniper was that?

514
00:43:31,964 --> 00:43:33,674
-Which one?
-It was number 14.

515
00:43:33,757 --> 00:43:36,427
-Go find out where it is. Now!
-Stand by!

516
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,395
It's the back side of Mount Ogong.

517
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:49,982
Stand by!

518
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:01,952
You've deceived us three times!

519
00:44:03,245 --> 00:44:05,456
You're forcing us to kill her!

520
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:08,709
Come here!

521
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:10,878
Don't shoot!

522
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:12,212
<i>Please don't!</i>

523
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:14,006
Don't shoot!

524
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:16,675
Sniper… Sniper!

525
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:19,636
Hey, kill that communist bastard
right now!

526
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,554
Now!

527
00:44:20,637 --> 00:44:22,222
But the doctor's in the way.

528
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:26,852
That little… That piece of…

529
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:29,563
How dare those bastards try to harm my…

530
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,899
F***!

531
00:44:31,982 --> 00:44:34,359
You have to save her!

532
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:35,903
-At all costs!
-Yes, sir.

533
00:44:35,986 --> 00:44:37,571
-You bastards.
-I'm sorry, sir.

534
00:44:37,654 --> 00:44:40,824
If you fail to save Dr. Kang,
I'll kill all of you.

535
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,744
-Save her! At all cost! Understand?
-It's dangerous.

536
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:45,746
You bastard!

537
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:48,749
Cheong-ya…

538
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,548
Are you insane?

539
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:58,634
We need her to save Eung-cheol!

540
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:02,262
Let go of me. We need
to teach them a lesson right now.

541
00:45:03,222 --> 00:45:04,473
Comrade Joo!

542
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:10,521
Ma'am, please do something.

543
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:13,607
Come! Now!

544
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:15,150
Come here!

545
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:19,112
I'll kill her!

546
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:24,993
Let go!

547
00:45:30,082 --> 00:45:30,999
Hey.

548
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,633
Let go.

549
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,176
Let go!

550
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,803
Gyeok-chan.

551
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:44,805
Calm down.

552
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:46,515
Please.

553
00:45:58,652 --> 00:45:59,820
Hey.

554
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:26,263
Stay away!

555
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:36,940
Put it down.

556
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:43,238
Oh, no. Yeong-ro's in danger.

557
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:45,574
-This is bad.
-Hey.

558
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:50,037
Put the gun down. Now.

559
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:51,872
Or you'll get hurt.

560
00:46:58,253 --> 00:47:00,505
Let the doctor go. Now!

561
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:01,506
Do you want to die?

562
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:06,303
Your teammate…

563
00:47:06,386 --> 00:47:09,431
No! Easy, easy.

564
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,730
Your teammate

565
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:19,524
hasn't been treated yet.

566
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:21,985
He'll die if he doesn't get treated.

567
00:47:22,986 --> 00:47:24,112
For sure.

568
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:28,700
Comrade Joo.

569
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:33,705
If you kill the doctor, they'll never

570
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:36,249
send in another doctor.

571
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:40,462
You've been fooled three times.

572
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:43,632
Shouldn't you take advantage
of this chance?

573
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:48,804
They have no choice but to do what you ask
because you might blow yourselves up.

574
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,306
Oh, right.

575
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:53,642
To get out of here safely,

576
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:56,979
you also need
a means of transportation. Right?

577
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:09,866
Comrade Joo.

578
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:13,495
Lower the gun.

579
00:48:17,874 --> 00:48:18,792
Now!

580
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:31,847
Those damn bastards!

581
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:35,642
I'll kill you all!

582
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,187
Hey! Don't fire back!

583
00:48:39,271 --> 00:48:40,689
Everyone get down!

584
00:48:40,772 --> 00:48:42,524
Hold fire! Don't fire back!

585
00:48:49,948 --> 00:48:51,283
Come on!

586
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:17,893
Stop wasting the bullets.

587
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:59,893
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

588
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:09,820
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

589
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:44,479
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

590
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,159
Take your hands off the door.

591
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:06,579
The SWAT team is standing by outside.

592
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:10,417
Take your hands off it
if you want to live.

593
00:53:22,053 --> 00:53:25,890
Even if you shoot me, they'll break in
since I disabled the booby trap.

594
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:31,146
You know what this is, right?

595
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:40,238
If I push this button, you and I,
as well as the hostages, will all die.

596
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:47,704
You want to save your team leader,

597
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,290
don't you?

598
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:54,753
He even got shot to protect you.

599
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:02,969
If you want to save him,

600
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:05,472
go out and stop the SWAT team.

601
00:54:15,857 --> 00:54:18,276
SWAT team, go in! Now!

602
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,736
SWAT team, go in!

603
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:24,240
SWAT team, go in!

604
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,001
SWAT team, go in! You bastards!

605
00:54:41,299 --> 00:54:43,635
<i>Hey, are you sure
the wiretapping is working?</i>

606
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:45,970
Why can't I hear anything?
Turn the volume up!

607
00:54:46,054 --> 00:54:47,138
Turn it up!

608
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,813
Turn it up, you idiots! God damn it!

609
00:54:57,357 --> 00:54:59,401
Eun, how did it go?

610
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:00,735
Did you talk to them?

611
00:55:03,154 --> 00:55:04,697
See? I told you.

612
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:10,537
In any case, I'm worried how much more
Lim Ji-rok will demand this time.

613
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,122
He's not in charge anymore.

614
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:14,332
We negotiate with Choi Su-ryeon now.

615
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:16,543
What? Why?

616
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:19,337
What's going on?

617
00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:21,881
Why are we not sending the SWAT team in?

618
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:24,134
We must send them in!

619
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,301
How dare you--

620
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,974
It's me.

621
00:55:31,057 --> 00:55:33,560
You said you'd send us
back to the North safely,

622
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:36,187
but you're sending the SWAT team in?

623
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,440
Sending the SWAT team in?

624
00:55:38,523 --> 00:55:41,985
Hey! It's all a lie!
Our agent lied to you!

625
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:44,446
She lied to make you surrender!

626
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:45,447
Give it!

627
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:48,867
<i>Listen. First, let Cheong-- No.</i>

628
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:49,993
Let the doctor out.

629
00:55:50,076 --> 00:55:53,204
Let Dr. Kang out right now, you bastard!

630
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:59,878
How did you find out your agent talked
about the SWAT team in the tent?

631
00:56:06,468 --> 00:56:07,469
He wants to talk to you.

632
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:11,347
The hostages' lives are
at stake, but what?

633
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:13,224
It's all a lie?

634
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:14,893
Seriously?

635
00:56:15,477 --> 00:56:17,061
All right.

636
00:56:17,145 --> 00:56:18,521
Get her out of here!

637
00:56:19,105 --> 00:56:21,065
Yes, sir. Come out here.

638
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:23,276
Hey, Choi.

639
00:56:24,194 --> 00:56:25,195
Come here.

640
00:56:25,778 --> 00:56:26,696
Let go of me!

641
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:35,538
There must've been

642
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:37,957
<i>a misunderstanding.
We didn't try to send them in.</i>

643
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,668
-We just wanted to send you back--
<i>-No.</i>

644
00:56:41,377 --> 00:56:44,297
I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.

645
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:51,054
If you don't believe me,
check with the North.

646
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:52,555
Check the instructions.

647
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:58,019
You tell me to check the instructions
whenever you're cornered.

648
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,649
Last time we followed the instructions,
we got shot at upon getting out.

649
00:57:02,732 --> 00:57:06,110
That was because of the engagement
on the West Sea. I told you!

650
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:07,654
Does the leadership in the North

651
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:11,115
know that you tried to kill us?

652
00:57:13,117 --> 00:57:15,620
They do know all three of you are alive.

653
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,209
Seeing how you know our rendezvous point

654
00:57:21,834 --> 00:57:24,546
and the goal of this mission well,

655
00:57:25,129 --> 00:57:27,632
you must be in close liaison
with the leadership in the North.

656
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:33,888
What kind of deal did you make?

657
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:38,101
<i>You'd better be honest with me.</i>

658
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:42,272
Your daughter's in my hands.

659
00:57:43,022 --> 00:57:44,649
You know that, right?

660
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:50,405
<i>You are</i>

661
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:54,033
a spy who must obey
orders from your country.

662
00:57:54,617 --> 00:57:56,995
<i>So check the instructions right now!</i>

663
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:03,376
I wanted us to talk it out
before I make you pay for fooling us.

664
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:04,919
But it's not working.

665
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:07,046
Listen carefully.

666
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:10,967
I'll pick a hostage at random
and kill them in ten minutes.

667
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:12,885
What?

668
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:16,764
And that student's death
will be all on you.

669
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:19,726
Hello?

670
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:21,060
Hello?

671
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:23,146
Turn the volume up!

672
00:58:23,646 --> 00:58:24,689
Turn it up!

673
00:58:24,772 --> 00:58:27,150
"Student"? He definitely said student.

674
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:54,344
Are you really going to kill them?

675
00:58:58,681 --> 00:58:59,724
I should.

676
00:59:00,725 --> 00:59:02,060
Who do you think we should kill?

677
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:08,816
<i>The one who called us communist bastards…</i>

678
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,528
Shouldn't we kill that one first?

679
00:59:12,612 --> 00:59:16,074
So you're saying
we should kill Eun Yeong-ro first, right?

680
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,331
Okay.

681
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:25,875
Kill her.

682
00:59:50,692 --> 00:59:52,402
It's not working, is it?

683
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:53,486
Why can't I hear anything?

684
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,739
The wiretapping in Area 2-4 is cut off.

685
00:59:57,448 --> 00:59:58,574
What?

686
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,165
Eun Yeong-ro's
the daughter of the ANSP director.

687
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:12,672
Which means she's our lifeline.

688
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:22,265
<i>-Area 2-4…</i>
-Area 2-2 is cut off.

689
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:23,933
<i>-Can any sniper see her?</i>
-What?

690
01:00:24,016 --> 01:00:25,643
<i>I repeat. Area 2-4--</i>

691
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,073
-Hey, An!
-Yes, sir.

692
01:00:39,574 --> 01:00:40,533
One moment, sir.

693
01:00:40,616 --> 01:00:42,118
Area 2-3 is not working as well!

694
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:43,035
Forget that.

695
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:45,371
Area 1-1 is not working as well!

696
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:48,040
Don't just say that!
Find the ones still working!

697
01:00:48,124 --> 01:00:49,417
Check if there's any working!

698
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,418
Hurry up.

699
01:00:54,422 --> 01:00:56,090
What the hell are you doing?

700
01:01:17,904 --> 01:01:19,739
Please.

701
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:24,577
Damn it.

702
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:31,751
Hey.

703
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:41,737
I got rid of all the bugs.

704
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:43,698
You can talk freely now.

705
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,075
What's going on?

706
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:02,341
<i>Lim Soo-ho?</i>

707
01:03:02,884 --> 01:03:04,510
<i>This is the ANSP director.</i>

708
01:03:11,893 --> 01:03:13,644
Comrade Joo Gyeok-chan.

709
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:19,525
You were fearless and worthy of the Order
of Military Service Honor you got.

710
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:26,324
I was instructed to come here
to send you back to the North safely.

711
01:03:26,908 --> 01:03:30,077
I'm Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

712
01:03:32,288 --> 01:03:35,374
And I'm also known as Moran Hill 1
in our country.

713
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:39,670
Moran Hill…

714
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,091
The one awarded the Hero of the Republic?

715
01:03:49,555 --> 01:03:51,390
I apologize. I should have recognized you.

716
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:54,310
I provoked you on purpose
to fool the others,

717
01:03:54,393 --> 01:03:55,353
so don't worry.

718
01:03:57,063 --> 01:03:59,273
<i>Lim Soo-ho! Can you hear me?</i>

719
01:04:08,824 --> 01:04:11,494
Lim Soo-ho. You and I may

720
01:04:12,036 --> 01:04:15,414
believe in different things in different
situations, but we want the same thing.

721
01:04:15,498 --> 01:04:17,416
You want your men's safety,

722
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,584
and I want

723
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:21,379
the hostages' safety.

724
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:22,964
Now,

725
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:26,300
<i>the director of the Agency
for National Security Planning</i>

726
01:04:26,384 --> 01:04:29,387
<i>desperately wants to talk with you.</i>

727
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:33,724
Pick up the phone!

728
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,476
You can hear me, right?

729
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:38,312
Let's talk it out! Please!

730
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,273
-Those bastards.
<i>-Lim Soo-ho!</i>

731
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:43,943
They wiretapped us, and what? Talk it out?

732
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:46,487
They can hear me, right?

733
01:04:47,363 --> 01:04:50,574
Actually, the ANSP director told me
to check the party's instructions,

734
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:53,869
so I took you here to check them with you.

735
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:08,634
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

736
01:05:09,552 --> 01:05:11,595
If you kill any of the students,

737
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,015
you'll be disobeying
orders from the North.

738
01:05:14,098 --> 01:05:18,394
<i>We agreed to send you back to the North
safely in ten days, so check right now.</i>

739
01:05:18,477 --> 01:05:21,605
You bastard! Check the instructions first!

740
01:05:25,568 --> 01:05:27,361
He hung up again!

741
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:28,904
Stop provoking him!

742
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:32,366
Hello?

743
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:34,326
They're not answering?

744
01:05:36,495 --> 01:05:37,621
Check them.

745
01:05:39,373 --> 01:05:42,752
<i>It has been the basics review homework--</i>

746
01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:06,317
"Reached an agreement with the South."

747
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:09,403
"Not to kill any hostages."

748
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:12,031
"Guaranteed to be sent back in ten days."

749
01:06:14,325 --> 01:06:15,743
Will we really be able

750
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,996
to go back alive in ten days?

751
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:26,087
Last time we were ordered
to cooperate with them, we almost died.

752
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:28,672
-So from my point of view--
-Your point of view?

753
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:36,305
Since when did you start
questioning the instructions?

754
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:41,644
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

755
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:47,274
The failure to abduct Professor Han
is all on you.

756
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,986
And because of you,
all of our agents on our ship

757
01:06:52,488 --> 01:06:53,781
were killed.

758
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,245
Your new mission is to go back alive

759
01:06:59,328 --> 01:07:01,497
after keeping the hostages for ten days.

760
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,292
Making a contribution
to make up for your failure

761
01:07:05,793 --> 01:07:07,753
is what you need to do from now on.

762
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:11,549
I understand.

763
01:07:22,768 --> 01:07:23,602
Look.

764
01:07:27,022 --> 01:07:29,400
You should feed the students.

765
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:32,695
They haven't eaten for days.

766
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,113
She's right.

767
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:36,657
And Mr. Kim's blood sugar is too low.

768
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:41,245
Let's do that.

769
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:47,960
Well, then I should
go make some rice balls.

770
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:49,336
What ingredients do we have?

771
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,423
Sausages and some tofu…

772
01:07:52,506 --> 01:07:56,093
I should fry them
and cook some <i>doenjang</i> soup as well.

773
01:08:11,066 --> 01:08:11,901
Go back.

774
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:55,069
That's good. Yeong-ro's still alive.

775
01:08:55,152 --> 01:08:56,862
They must've listened to the instructions.

776
01:08:57,154 --> 01:08:59,323
Then should we let the press know, sir?

777
01:08:59,406 --> 01:09:00,741
We should tell Code 1 first.

778
01:09:00,824 --> 01:09:03,535
Let's hurry. You know
how impatient he is. Let's go.

779
01:09:26,558 --> 01:09:27,559
Hello?

780
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,812
Yes. And?

781
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:33,023
What? What are you talking about?

782
01:09:34,775 --> 01:09:35,943
Eun Yeong-u?

783
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,363
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

784
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:41,675
Eat.

785
01:10:45,846 --> 01:10:47,765
Aren't I just a human shield?

786
01:10:48,932 --> 01:10:49,933
So why?

787
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:55,439
I'm not telling you to eat for your sake,

788
01:10:57,858 --> 01:10:59,485
but for our sake.

789
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:06,116
Because the ANSP director's daughter
shouldn't starve to death?

790
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,248
That paper airplane…

791
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:17,336
Why do you have it?

792
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:27,638
Don't tell me

793
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:29,890
you came to the dorm

794
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,812
because of that paper airplane.

795
01:11:46,698 --> 01:11:49,284
<i>Hello. This is JBC breaking news.</i>

796
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:53,539
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

797
01:11:53,622 --> 01:11:57,626
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

798
01:11:57,709 --> 01:12:01,588
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

799
01:12:01,672 --> 01:12:04,925
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

800
01:12:05,008 --> 01:12:07,136
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

801
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:09,555
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

802
01:12:09,638 --> 01:12:11,974
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

803
01:12:12,057 --> 01:12:16,103
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

804
01:12:16,186 --> 01:12:19,481
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

805
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:23,110
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

806
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:24,528
<i>and came to Korea</i>

807
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:27,573
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

808
01:12:27,656 --> 01:12:31,493
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

809
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:34,329
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

810
01:12:49,928 --> 01:12:51,305
Cardiac arrest!

811
01:12:51,388 --> 01:12:52,514
<i>Bring him back.</i>

812
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:55,225
Bring him back!

813
01:12:56,351 --> 01:12:58,187
<i>So the ANSP director's daughter</i>

814
01:12:58,687 --> 01:13:00,814
hid you in this dorm?

815
01:13:01,398 --> 01:13:04,359
<i>But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.</i>

816
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:05,402
The doctor?

817
01:13:05,486 --> 01:13:07,571
I never had any personal feelings for her.

818
01:13:09,281 --> 01:13:11,283
We don't intend to hurt you.

819
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:14,912
<i>We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.</i>

820
01:13:17,164 --> 01:13:18,373
<i>So you must know</i>

821
01:13:18,457 --> 01:13:22,211
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

822
01:13:22,294 --> 01:13:24,755
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

823
01:13:24,838 --> 01:13:26,006
<i>That's a bomb, isn't it?</i>

824
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:29,218
Aren't they going to just kill us all?
Where's Yeong-ro?

825
01:13:29,801 --> 01:13:32,387
<i>Let me out.</i>

826
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,814
BONUS

827
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:48,529
The doctor who treated you

828
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,989
is comrade Kang Cheong-ya

829
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,742
also known as Moran Hill 1.

830
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:02,125
Moran…

831
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:04,253
No. Don't get up.

832
01:14:05,295 --> 01:14:07,422
Get better as soon as possible.

833
01:14:08,006 --> 01:14:10,050
To go back alive in ten days.

834
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:12,344
Comrade.

835
01:14:12,678 --> 01:14:14,429
Am I dreaming right now?

836
01:14:14,555 --> 01:14:16,640
Can you pinch me?
