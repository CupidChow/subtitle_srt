EPISODE 12

3
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:24,981
ON AIR

4
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:27,150
Kids, cameras are over there.

5
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,360
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

6
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:31,654
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

7
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:33,031
-Hi, Rabbit.
-Hey.

8
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:34,490
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

9
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:35,783
-Where are you going?
-Where?

10
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,785
-What?
-He's leaving.

11
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,787
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

12
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,373
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

NEWSROOM CHIEF'S OFFICE

14
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,399
NEWSROOM CHIEF

15
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,799
Mr. Lee, do you copy?

16
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:34,467
<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

17
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:36,678
Hey. Have you delivered all?

18
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:39,889
Yes, to six newspapers
and two TV stations.

19
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:43,851
Good job. Stay safe.

20
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,154
A newspaper or a TV station,
just one of them needs to cover it.

21
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,079
About Kang Cheong-ya…

22
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,249
Well, what do you think of her?

23
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,088
She seems to be wavering,

24
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:15,008
but how can we trust her?

25
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,558
Leave her to me.

26
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,063
Would you like some hot tea?

27
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,816
As I thought…

28
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,907
It was my father, wasn't it?

29
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,417
If you believe
his order to kill me is right…

30
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,724
kill me now.

31
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,939
Director Lim Ji-rok of the UFD…

32
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,360
is your father?

33
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,675
GREAT SUPREME LEADER KIM IL-SUNG…

34
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:09,093
Comrade Director!

35
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,768
We got this message
from Hosu University dorm last night.

36
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,110
SENDER: HAEGEUMSEONG 1

37
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:29,655
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BETRAYED, JOINED HANDS
WITH LEE GANG-MU, TRYING TO RUIN OPERATION

38
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,074
<i>The apple never falls far from the tree.</i>

39
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,119
<i>He's indeed a son of a reactionary.</i>

40
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:42,001
Don't tell Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

41
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,587
Understood, Comrade Director.

42
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,560
Why don't you eat something
and get some sleep?

43
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:07,109
I may have decided not to kill you,

44
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:09,695
but don't trust me too much.

45
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:14,825
Because the party still trusts me.

46
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,662
Do you believe

47
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,248
your life is yours?

48
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:32,426
It's the life the party planned out
for you. It's not the life you chose.

49
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,346
Stop living as Kang Cheong-ya
or Moran Hill 1.

50
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:38,766
Live as your real name.

51
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,146
Tonight,

52
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,608
I'll help you get out through the shrine
without anyone knowing.

53
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,779
Escape here while Nam Tae-il
still believes you're locked in here.

54
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,410
And leave for another country.

55
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:00,705
That's your only way out.

56
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:02,665
Now that…

57
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,008
you've disobeyed the party's orders,

58
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:18,764
going to another country is
your only way out too, isn't it?

59
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,106
I'm sure you already know

60
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,276
that I can't do that.

61
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,043
You got the accounts for the secret funds?

62
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,046
There's not much time.
Get 300 million dollars ready by today.

63
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,675
I will after telling the President.

64
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,764
Are you saying you'll disobey my orders?

65
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,142
Disobey? Of course not.

66
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:04,643
I'm just saying

67
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:07,772
I was appointed as new chief
of the OPC just a few hours ago,

68
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:10,733
so I'm afraid I can't withdraw
such a huge amount of money

69
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,860
without the President knowing.

70
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:16,405
I told you,
you can just put it as working expenses.

71
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:22,244
If it won't be a problem,
why is it top secret

72
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,705
and why must it be kept
between you and me?

73
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:28,125
And why can I not ask
the President for approval?

74
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,962
Before I have answers to those questions,

75
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,591
I can't withdraw
such a huge sum of money just like that.

76
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:36,801
An!

77
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:44,266
I mean, Chief An.

78
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:49,355
That money will be sent
to the North in a week anyway.

79
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:52,274
The President is also aware of it.
I'm just…

80
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:56,070
sending it a little early. That's all.

81
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:58,489
All right, sir.

82
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:02,952
I'll try my best to get approval
from the President and have it--

83
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:03,869
Hey!

84
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,419
God, what an inflexible punk.

85
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:17,508
This is Eun Chang-su.

86
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:21,136
Your agent who's being
held hostage in the dorm

87
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:23,514
is persistently ruining our plan.

88
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:28,185
<i>It seems he's convinced Lim Soo-ho
to turn the dorm into some haven.</i>

89
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:32,314
Are you saying Lim Soo-ho has joined
hands with Lee Gang-mu?

90
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:37,403
<i>It seems those two are trying
to ruin the election scheme together.</i>

91
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:41,574
I got a message that they already started
carrying out their plan to ruin it.

92
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,034
Plan to ruin it?

93
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,373
I understand. I'll see what we can do.

94
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,752
<i>He got a message?</i>

95
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,839
<i>But who sent it from the dorm?</i>

96
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:03,804
You can take your time
to get 300 million ready.

97
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:08,017
Are you going to the scene, sir?

98
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:19,278
That damn bastard!
He joined hands with a communist?

99
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,988
When he came out,

100
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:23,365
we should've just shot him to death!

101
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:27,202
We should jam radio signals first.

102
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:30,623
Hurry up with the jamming
so that no one can contact anyone inside.

103
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,750
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

104
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,627
There's someone spying for us inside.

105
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,295
That's not important right now.

106
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,673
We need them if we want to know
what's going on inside--

107
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,509
That reminds me.

108
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:45,262
The dorm's telephone operator
tried to tell me

109
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,056
something about Soo-ho and Gang-mu.

110
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,559
I think she was trying to say
they joined hands.

111
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,645
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

112
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,562
When was it?

113
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:57,107
-Before we got the camcorder?
-Yes, before that.

114
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:00,027
Then the students probably found out
it's an election scheme.

115
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,446
You're right. I think they did.

116
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:06,200
No wonder they didn't seem scared
laughing and chatting. What do we do now?

117
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,618
What do you think?

118
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:10,829
We should kill them all.

119
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:12,915
Bring in the EOD team

120
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:14,667
and plant bombs all over the dorm.

121
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,752
We'll blow them all up if need be.

122
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,212
Blow them up?

123
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,714
Even if we use high-capacity bombs,

124
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:22,591
we can't guarantee they'll be all killed.

125
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:25,719
Send in the SWAT team
and rescue my daughter first.

126
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:28,722
Then send in an EOD specialist
to plant bombs

127
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,557
and make sure they kill them all.

128
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:33,102
More than 30 people will die.

129
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,312
So we must make it look
like it's the spies' doing.

130
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,147
So that there won't be any controversy.

131
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:39,316
So that we'll be able to win the election!

132
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,278
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:48,492
Hey.

134
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,346
Gye Bun-ok.

135
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,308
Gye Bun-ok! Open the door.

136
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,872
You can't just barge into my room!

137
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:44,298
Where's the radio? Give it to me.

138
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:48,469
The ANSP guy took it,
so go ask him to give it back.

139
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:53,515
Don't do anything stupid again.

140
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,518
We're trying
to get all of us out of here alive.

141
00:15:56,602 --> 00:16:00,898
So don't try to survive alone
or play any tricks.

142
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,275
That's rich coming from you.

143
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,030
Didn't you hide the radio away
to save your own skin?

144
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:14,745
Bun-ok.

145
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:19,374
If you keep being this way,
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

146
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:21,835
Protect me?

147
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:26,590
You ordered me around, looked down on me,
and used me. You call that protecting?

148
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:28,467
Is that why you pulled the trigger?

149
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:34,890
You didn't know it was unloaded?
How stupid.

150
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:39,645
Did that doctor promise
to save your father?

151
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:43,065
She gave you an unloaded gun
because she didn't trust you.

152
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:45,818
She's the one who looked down on you
and used you!

153
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:48,195
Understand?

154
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:29,319
Don't you find Ms. Pi strange?

155
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,155
Why is she like that to Gizzard?

156
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:34,074
Tell me about it.
I thought she'd drag her out right away.

157
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:36,869
"I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?"

158
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:40,372
Yet she couldn't say anything
to that arrogant wench.

159
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:43,375
Yeong-ro, do you know anything about it?

160
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,295
You said Ms. Pi knows
Bun-ok threatened us with a gun.

161
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,838
-Yes, you did.
-Right.

162
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,423
Well…

163
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,595
She saw Bun-ok pointing

164
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:56,889
a gun at me.

165
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:59,057
-Even at you?
-But she and you were very close.

166
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:03,562
Guys, I think
Bun-ok has something big on Ms. Pi.

167
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:08,901
When I was singing in the cafeteria,

168
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:13,447
I saw Ms. Pi and the ANSP guy
whispering and found it weird.

169
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:14,865
Maybe…

170
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:19,453
Gizzard caught them kissing secretly.

171
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:20,370
Hey.

172
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,206
Come on.

173
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:23,582
What?

174
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,587
Who knows?
Being in this kind of crisis together

175
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,756
made them think it was love

176
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,674
and kiss.

177
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:34,343
No one but you would do that.

178
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:37,012
The ANSP might be trying
to kill us out there.

179
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,514
But what? The ANSP guy and Ms. Pi kissing?

180
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:42,851
By the way,

181
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,854
is the ANSP really going to kill us all?

182
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:49,358
They even shot innocent people to death
to win the election.

183
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:50,734
They're capable of anything.

184
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:53,695
Hey! I don't think
they're crazy enough to kill us

185
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,030
to win the election.

186
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,324
The Director must be crazy enough.

187
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,035
-I'm so scared.
-So am I.

188
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,376
Why do you look so down?
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:11,546
I have an upset stomach.

190
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,133
An upset stomach? All you had today
is a bowl of cup noodles.

191
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:18,136
You're right.
Is it the chicken you had last night?

192
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,680
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:28,939
I'm fine.

194
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:32,526
I need to go to the restroom.

195
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:39,616
But will they really kill us
to regain power?

196
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,410
Are you serious?

197
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,537
You still don't know
what they're really like?

198
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:47,499
Anyway, we need to find a way to survive.

199
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:49,543
How? Anything in your mind?

200
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:51,628
I'll think about it from now on.

201
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:53,213
Gosh…

202
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,784
What did you pray for so hard?

203
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:27,140
I prayed that we'll get out of here safely

204
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:31,728
and you'll get to see your sister

205
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:37,067
and live a normal, free life

206
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:41,738
like other guys your age.

207
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:44,991
I prayed for that.

208
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,351
I promise

209
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:14,813
I'll keep you safe.

210
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:24,739
Everyone including your friends

211
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:27,576
will be all right.

212
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,457
At the next Open House,

213
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,711
we should play fun games
and dance together.

214
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,254
Right?

215
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:47,971
But Soo-ho,

216
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:51,433
who will keep you safe then?

217
00:22:56,938 --> 00:23:00,317
Don't worry. You know I'm like Superman.

218
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:14,372
You can't even fly.

219
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,781
Charlotte?

220
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:54,329
Look who's here.

221
00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:59,209
Didn't you say you didn't take
what the fortuneteller said seriously?

222
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:03,171
But you ran over here
as soon as you buried your son.

223
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:05,423
I never imagined it'd be possible

224
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:09,094
for 13 people to be killed
unless war broke out.

225
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:13,515
But ever since
the hostage situation began,

226
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:18,562
I've been getting the feeling
that exactly 13 people will die.

227
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:23,900
Aren't you also here
because you're worried about that?

228
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:27,571
You just lost your child. How could you…

229
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,031
It's not that I didn't know,

230
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:33,577
but you're indeed cold-hearted.

231
00:24:38,707 --> 00:24:39,708
Oh, right.

232
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:44,504
Are you aware
that An has become the Chief of the OPC?

233
00:24:49,092 --> 00:24:53,471
It seems Mr. Eun also didn't know
that An was going to be appointed.

234
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:58,393
He had no idea one of his subordinates
was loved by the President.

235
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:02,314
He might end up
getting stabbed in the back at this rate.

236
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:08,361
The ANSP is not required

237
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:12,782
to disclose the details of the budget to
the Ministry of Finance or the Assembly.

238
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:15,201
But they keep all the money in the bank

239
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:17,329
and receive a puny interest.

240
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:19,456
I think it's such a shame.

241
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:23,293
Pray with all your heart
and pick out a few companies to invest in.

242
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:26,421
I'm sure
the deity will give you directions.

243
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:27,589
Oh, my.

244
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,719
My goodness. Thank you so much.

245
00:25:34,304 --> 00:25:37,307
Well, when I come to see you next time,

246
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:40,894
I should get you a new car key.

247
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:47,734
Hello, sir!

248
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:56,743
You must have a strong stomach.

249
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,371
Have you two made up already?

250
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:02,666
Why don't you just go
if you're done with him?

251
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,545
If I'd known in advance,
I would've sent you some flowers.

252
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:10,632
The President gave my husband
a bouquet when he appointed him.

253
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:14,302
And that's more than enough.

254
00:26:33,697 --> 00:26:36,408
You came to ask me
if 13 people will really die, didn't you?

255
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,577
Oh, my goodness!

256
00:26:40,203 --> 00:26:42,163
How did you know? You're so good!

257
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:46,000
So you want me
to ask the deity about it for you?

258
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:50,588
Let's see…

259
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:06,062
Here. Pick one.

260
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:08,189
There's only one question,

261
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,358
so it's okay for only one of you to pick.

262
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:12,068
Who'll pick first?

263
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:21,870
I outrank you, don't I?

264
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:26,666
It's about the Gonyeo Eun Clan.
I should do it.

265
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,252
You've just been bereaved. It's bad luck.

266
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:34,340
I've had it. How dare you, you wench!

267
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:35,383
Hey!

268
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:40,805
What was that? How dare you do that
in the presence of the deity?

269
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:49,856
It doesn't matter who picks first.

270
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:53,943
It could turn into bad luck
depending on what you pick.

271
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,378
It's very auspicious.

272
00:28:14,756 --> 00:28:16,466
Your wishes will come true.

273
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,051
-My wishes?
-My wishes?

274
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:24,182
Everything will go as you wish.

275
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,017
-As who wishes?
-As who wishes?

276
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,897
The deity always

277
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,858
helps the more desperate one.

278
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:39,656
It means everything depends
on your sincerity and effort.

279
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,659
My goodness. Then,

280
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,452
should I do some rites?

281
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,996
You think rites work every time?

282
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,641
<i>Once you're done
setting up the bombs, radio me.</i>

283
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:19,070
We have set up bombs
all around the dorm. Over.

284
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:26,661
<i>Park Mu-yeol,
the Aemin Party's candidate, said</i>

285
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:31,624
<i>he won't condone the spies' hostage-taking
and will prevent the North's provocations</i>

286
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,419
<i>expected to happen before the Olympics.</i>

287
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:39,340
<i>To hold the Seoul Olympics successfully</i>

288
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:43,177
<i>and make the whole world
remember it forever…</i>

289
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:50,602
I doubt TV stations
gave up on such a scoop.

290
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:52,854
I think something went wrong.

291
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:56,357
Breaking news, my foot.

292
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,277
Nothing related to it is being covered.

293
00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:19,047
Arrest Jang Han-na.

294
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:21,633
Arrest Han-na?

295
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,553
I wondered why a veteran agent like Soo-ho

296
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,722
decided to betray his country.
This was it.

297
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:31,225
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

298
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:35,772
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies.</i>

299
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,609
Reporter Gal must've recorded this.

300
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,319
Soo-ho must have listened to this.

301
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:44,948
They started trying to ruin our plan
by sending this out to TV stations.

302
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:45,865
Wait.

303
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:49,702
They're inside the dorm. How did they--

304
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:54,958
Jang Han-na?

305
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,502
No wonder they kept asking for her.

306
00:30:58,086 --> 00:30:59,337
Arrest her.

307
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,421
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:07,637
Come here.

309
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:10,181
Now.

310
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:36,124
What's up?

311
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,543
Mr. Eun wants to see you.

312
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:39,711
Me?

313
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:42,964
For what?

314
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:46,843
Well, you'll know when you see him.

315
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:51,973
All right.

316
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:06,237
Start the car!

317
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,287
I'm sure
they're watching all the entrances.

318
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,456
But they can't cover all the windows.

319
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:19,125
But we don't know
which windows they're watching.

320
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,335
We can't just test it out.

321
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:36,059
<i>Hey.</i>

322
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:38,978
Is it the recording tape
that makes you this reckless?

323
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:41,689
What?

324
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,524
Didn't you learn you'd be awarded

325
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,943
the Hero of the Republic
if you died for your country?

326
00:32:46,527 --> 00:32:49,614
<i>If you die, your family will live well.</i>

327
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:53,284
So why did you change your mind
and make things more complicated?

328
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:59,540
Stop talking nonsense
and cut to the chase.

329
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:00,750
Cut to the chase?

330
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:03,544
Let me talk to Gang-mu.

331
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,093
<i>Put that communist bastard on the phone!</i>

332
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:19,477
You'll accuse me of being a communist?

333
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:22,605
That makes you a true communist.

334
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:26,484
<i>You schemed with the high-ups of the North
to win the election.</i>

335
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,277
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:30,196
Listen to this guy.

337
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:33,074
You're really something
just like they say.

338
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:37,703
If you're being like that,
I'm going to have to kill you.

339
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,085
Listen carefully.

340
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,421
Bombs have been set up
all around the dorm.

341
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,052
<i>How dare a mere pawn like you</i>

342
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:56,222
<i>try to ruin the scheme for the election?</i>

343
00:33:57,515 --> 00:34:00,351
<i>If you try anything funny,
I'll blow the dorm up.</i>

344
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:02,979
I'll blow all of you to bits.

345
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,281
Soo-ho, you heard him, right?

346
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:17,994
He's threatening to blow the whole dorm
to bits. You think that's possible?

347
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:20,538
<i>The explosive power will be dispersed.</i>

348
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,749
Yes, you're right.

349
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,960
To completely destroy a building,

350
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:29,005
<i>you must install bombs
on pillars inside it.</i>

351
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:31,007
You bastards.

352
00:34:31,465 --> 00:34:33,634
We've set up high-capacity explosives!

353
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,388
Explosives?

354
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:44,729
Then the sound of the explosion
will be really big. That's good.

355
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:48,816
Even kids will know
the bombs exploded outside the dorm.

356
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,737
<i>Then people will find out
it's an election scheme without our help.</i>

357
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:56,532
You know, people in Seoul are quite smart.

358
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,659
You bastards!

359
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:03,539
Gang-mu.

360
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,500
<i>This is Eun Chang-su.</i>

361
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:10,504
<i>We collected all of the recording tapes
that had been sent to the press.</i>

362
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:14,717
<i>Didn't you know our agents were stationed
at all of the newspapers and TV stations?</i>

363
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,635
<i>One more thing.</i>

364
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:20,723
If you're worried about the safety
of Jang Han-na, your messenger,

365
00:35:21,307 --> 00:35:23,726
<i>you'd better not do anything from now on.</i>

366
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:26,103
Mr. Eun…

367
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:35,238
What?

368
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,531
You set up bombs?

369
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:42,453
Only to use them to threaten the spies.

370
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,211
We need to talk.

371
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,050
We could just talk inside.
Why did you have to make me come out?

372
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:57,593
What?

373
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:01,806
Should I pull the trigger?

374
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:05,017
I lost my beloved son,
and my daughter is in there.

375
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,228
You think I have anything to fear?

376
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,607
Listen. I don't intend
to set them off anytime soon.

377
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,735
As you know, Dr. Kang is in there.
She's my doctor.

378
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:17,613
We must send in the SWAT team secretly.

379
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,365
But you told them about the bombs?

380
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:22,159
When we rescue your daughter,

381
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:23,828
we must get Dr. Kang out too.

382
00:36:28,374 --> 00:36:29,834
This is your last warning.

383
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:34,213
We must rescue my daughter first.
No matter what.

384
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:35,840
Okay.

385
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:38,217
All right.

386
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,936
That damn bastard…

387
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:27,892
-Move your car!
-Move it!

388
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:33,356
<i>Our plan was leaked.</i>

389
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:36,192
It means we have a mole inside the dorm.

390
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:40,404
Except you, I, and Yeong-ro,

391
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:43,032
we can't trust anyone in here.

392
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:46,702
If they've set up bombs,

393
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:52,416
Eun Chang-su might send in the SWAT team
to rescue Yeong-ro tonight.

394
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,293
We must find the mole before that.

395
00:37:57,546 --> 00:38:00,674
I'll gather the hostages in the prayer
room. Take care of the southern side.

396
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,177
I'll watch Comrade Kang and my guys.

397
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:25,866
Hey.

398
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:30,830
Hey!

399
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:37,294
-Wait.
-What?

400
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:38,838
This side isn't blocked.

401
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:42,633
-Lead the way.
-Wait, stop.

402
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:44,760
Stop!

403
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:47,388
We're up against
an ANSP team leader and a spy.

404
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:49,640
There must be something here.

405
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,852
I'm sure this is a trap.

406
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:54,186
How is this a trap?

407
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,856
But I don't see any trap here.

408
00:38:58,274 --> 00:38:59,275
Hye-ryeong.

409
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:01,444
There are invisible booby traps too.

410
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:04,238
Depending on how you set them up,

411
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:07,158
-there are many various types.
-Hey.

412
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,743
Don't lie.
You're chickening out, aren't you?

413
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:11,412
I am not.

414
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:13,247
Are you going to escape or not?

415
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,540
Escape?

416
00:39:14,623 --> 00:39:18,210
-How can I escape like this?
-Let's escape!

417
00:39:21,046 --> 00:39:24,467
<i>Everyone in the dormitory,</i>

418
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,302
gather in the prayer room now.

419
00:39:27,303 --> 00:39:28,888
I repeat.

420
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:30,181
Everyone

421
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:31,432
<i>in the dormitory,</i>

422
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:33,184
<i>gather in the prayer room now.</i>

423
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:35,686
<i>…to carry out our duties…</i>

424
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:40,900
Wait!

425
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:48,115
<i>Let's go to the prayer room.</i>

426
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,494
Hey, let's go.

427
00:39:52,745 --> 00:39:54,038
My goodness.

428
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,540
What is it this time?

429
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:58,792
<i>At the moment, agent Lee Gang-mu,</i>

430
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:02,588
<i>the ANSP team leader,
is being held hostage in the dorm.</i>

431
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:05,424
<i>He is a veteran agent
experienced in anti-communism,</i>

432
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:09,345
<i>I'm sure he's trying his best
to save the students from the spies.</i>

433
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:15,351
<i>With our good agent Lee Gang-mu,
we will save the hostages no matter--</i>

434
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:33,327
I spoke with Nam Tae-il on the phone.

435
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:38,958
He already knew
Gang-mu and I had joined hands.

436
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:45,214
No wonder
they're bringing up Gang-mu on TV.

437
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:48,801
They must've decided to kill him.

438
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:51,136
He'll be killed later anyway.

439
00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:54,473
If people think
he's died saving the hostages,

440
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:57,184
they'll think highly of the ANSP.

441
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:00,104
They also know about our plan
to ruin the election scheme.

442
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:06,318
They even set up bombs around the dorm.

443
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:13,826
Are you suspecting me?

444
00:41:18,455 --> 00:41:21,417
I want to give you
a chance to live a new life.

445
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,044
But if you've betrayed me…

446
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:34,221
one of us two must die.

447
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:40,936
Why are you

448
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,316
dying to save the South Koreans
who have nothing to do with us?

449
00:41:47,192 --> 00:41:48,611
Because of Yeong-ro?

450
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:57,036
You'll never end up with her.
You know that.

451
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,329
Yeong-ro…

452
00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:03,083
paid too harsh a price for me.

453
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:07,254
All she did is risking her life
to save my life and helping me.

454
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:10,132
I don't…

455
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:14,678
want her to suffer anymore.

456
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:20,100
So what on earth is your plan?

457
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:23,145
Let's say you get out of here alive.
What's next?

458
00:42:25,939 --> 00:42:27,816
You must think about what's next.

459
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,984
I'll go back.

460
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:32,571
What?

461
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,323
If I don't go back,

462
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,495
my sister Su-hui will be killed.

463
00:42:40,162 --> 00:42:41,372
Are you insane?

464
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:44,083
You think Lim Ji-rok will let you live?

465
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,709
If I go back,

466
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:50,631
he'll let Su-hui live.

467
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:06,105
You must bear with it
until we catch the mole.

468
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:14,655
All right. Everyone is here, right?

469
00:43:15,948 --> 00:43:17,032
Wait.

470
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:19,535
I don't see Ms. Oh.

471
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:25,624
Ms. Pi, have you seen Ms. Oh?

472
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,127
You slept with her last night.

473
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,795
I saw her in the morning.

474
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:31,839
Has anyone seen her since then?

475
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:34,717
I saw her not long ago
in the restroom on the second floor.

476
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:36,260
In the restroom?

477
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:38,512
Ma'am, I'll go.

478
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:51,442
It's an emergency.

479
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,945
All of you should stay here.
That's the safest.

480
00:43:55,028 --> 00:43:57,740
So don't leave the room until I get back.

481
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:00,784
An emergency? What's going on?

482
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:03,662
I'll tell you after finding Ms. Oh.

483
00:44:14,715 --> 00:44:16,717
What did Cheong-ya say?

484
00:44:19,428 --> 00:44:20,888
I don't think it's her.

485
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:22,598
You don't think?

486
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:24,516
Did you question her right?

487
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:28,854
She even got a big shot like Nam Tae-il.
She wouldn't change her mind easily.

488
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:30,814
To be honest,

489
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,275
I suspect her the most.

490
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:38,071
If she'd sent the message,

491
00:44:38,655 --> 00:44:40,783
she would've killed me this morning.

492
00:44:41,658 --> 00:44:43,702
She did have the chance,

493
00:44:44,787 --> 00:44:46,330
but she did not.

494
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:48,707
What about your side?

495
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:55,297
Ms. Oh disappeared.

496
00:44:58,008 --> 00:44:59,218
Ms. Oh did?

497
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:49,351
What are you doing here?

498
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:03,282
Someone stole chickens.

499
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,534
Last night,

500
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:07,286
someone stole chickens.

501
00:46:11,248 --> 00:46:12,457
Come out here. Now.

502
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,001
I can't.

503
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:17,671
Those who steal food are the worst.

504
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:19,548
Wait until I catch them. I'll…

505
00:46:20,048 --> 00:46:21,258
Come out here.

506
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:23,677
But I need to put them back in here.

507
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,430
Or they will thaw.

508
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:36,064
But I must guard the kitchen.

509
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:39,526
Ma'am.

510
00:46:55,918 --> 00:46:56,960
Just a bite.

511
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,381
Chicken from the South is really good.

512
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:02,674
Put that away.

513
00:47:04,092 --> 00:47:06,887
-Just a bite.
-Put that away, you bastard!

514
00:47:11,266 --> 00:47:12,309
Comrade Joo.

515
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,731
Do you have a death wish?

516
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:22,486
You must've had a good night's sleep.

517
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,197
You can hear now.

518
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,494
I understand how you feel.
But surviving is most important right now.

519
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,165
Our team leader's betrayed the country,

520
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,167
so we're done for.

521
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:45,634
Didn't you hear our country
and the South are scheming to kill us?

522
00:47:46,468 --> 00:47:47,928
I trust Comrade Lim.

523
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:50,597
He's trying to save our lives at all cost.

524
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:53,183
Our country decided to kill us,
so how will he save us?

525
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:54,393
He will.

526
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:58,897
I believe Comrade Lim is going to save us.

527
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:02,442
Have you forgotten

528
00:48:03,026 --> 00:48:04,444
he saved the dying comrades

529
00:48:05,237 --> 00:48:06,405
on Mount Puksubaek?

530
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:31,638
Pick up the pace!

531
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:39,855
Damn it.

532
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:55,746
-Please spare us!
-Save us!

533
00:48:57,247 --> 00:48:58,582
Please--

534
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:08,341
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

535
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:12,095
This is your last task.

536
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,766
Those who couldn't kill the traitors…

537
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,684
Kill them all!

538
00:49:19,728 --> 00:49:21,688
Only ten of you

539
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:25,067
will become warriors
who will make our republic proud.

540
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,620
Comrade Geum-cheol…

541
00:49:58,725 --> 00:49:59,893
Didn't you hear my order?

542
00:50:19,412 --> 00:50:20,705
Lim Soo-hyeok!

543
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:22,415
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:31,967
What are you doing, Eung-cheol?

545
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:34,094
Attack him!

546
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:52,737
Lim Soo-hyeok.

547
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,532
I know what your order means.

548
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,663
But I can't kill him.

549
00:51:11,006 --> 00:51:12,799
You little bastard.

550
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:16,261
Are you disobeying the party?

551
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:25,312
I will kill as many traitors
as you want me to.

552
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:29,024
But the person you're ordering me to kill

553
00:51:29,107 --> 00:51:30,609
is a warrior of our country.

554
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:35,071
Everyone here is my comrade
who survived the hellish training with me!

555
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:41,036
Don't you know how important it is
to be mentally armed?

556
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,164
When the party orders you,
you must obey without question!

557
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:45,332
The party…

558
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,879
would never order us to kill our comrades.

559
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:54,132
The party cherishes
every one of its people!

560
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:56,801
It would never abandon
warriors of the Republic

561
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,095
who finished the harsh training!

562
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:05,518
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

563
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:18,865
<i>Ever since then,</i>

564
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:23,370
<i>he's always been likely
to betray our country.</i>

565
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:24,913
<i>Then</i>

566
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:28,208
why did the party not kill him?

567
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,878
They punished the instructor
because they thought Lim was right.

568
00:52:32,879 --> 00:52:34,547
Why did they not kill him?

569
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:36,549
<i>Thanks to his father,</i>

570
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:39,844
he wasn't killed
even after disobeying the party.

571
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:41,972
Remember.

572
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:44,557
Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

573
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:48,436
Watch him closely all the time,

574
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,647
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

575
00:52:52,857 --> 00:52:54,067
kill him.

576
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:57,320
The party abandoned him.

577
00:52:58,238 --> 00:53:00,282
And you abandoned your family for him?

578
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:02,909
If the party finds out you've turned,

579
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,496
all your family members will be taken
to the political prison camp.

580
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,059
Comrade Lim.

581
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:34,190
What'll happen to my family?

582
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:37,902
Don't worry.

583
00:53:39,237 --> 00:53:41,281
I told the party
that I betrayed them alone.

584
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,200
So your family will be safe, Eung-cheol.

585
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,455
You told the party?

586
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:53,168
The North must be aware anyway.

587
00:53:54,085 --> 00:53:56,755
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

588
00:53:58,256 --> 00:53:59,507
Someone in the dorm.

589
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:02,344
There's a mole in here?

590
00:54:11,936 --> 00:54:13,521
Our plan

591
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:17,525
to let people know
about the election scheme.

592
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:19,527
The ANSP already knew about it.

593
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,823
Damn it. Who was it?

594
00:54:24,282 --> 00:54:26,618
Who the hell told them?

595
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:29,371
Come clean.
I'll kill you when I catch you.

596
00:54:29,454 --> 00:54:30,705
Sit down.

597
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,834
Ms. Pi.

598
00:54:35,418 --> 00:54:39,047
Is there any other walkie-talkie
in this dorm that I don't know about?

599
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:43,968
No. Not that I know of.

600
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,181
It's impossible
to contact someone outside without it.

601
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:50,600
From now on,

602
00:54:50,683 --> 00:54:52,102
we'll search your rooms

603
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,646
where you slept last night.

604
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,816
-What? Why do they have to?
-Why?

605
00:54:57,899 --> 00:54:59,984
-Searching our rooms?
-Why?

606
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:01,569
Are they suspecting us?

607
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:04,114
-Searching our rooms?
-Is he suspecting us?

608
00:55:04,197 --> 00:55:05,365
I told you.

609
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:06,741
The radio is Ms. Pi's.

610
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,952
Why are you not suspecting her?

611
00:55:09,035 --> 00:55:10,995
I have that radio.

612
00:55:11,496 --> 00:55:14,290
We need to see
if there are any other radios in here.

613
00:55:18,044 --> 00:55:19,796
We all slept on the second floor.

614
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:23,591
But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.

615
00:55:24,676 --> 00:55:26,052
You should search her room first.

616
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:28,513
Damn it. Stay out of it.
You don't know anything.

617
00:55:28,596 --> 00:55:29,848
Hey.

618
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:32,434
If there's a mole among us,
it must be you. Who else would--

619
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:34,561
Don't you know
Ms. Pi is on the ANSP's side?

620
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,604
Bun-ok. Shut it.

621
00:55:38,106 --> 00:55:41,901
When I turned on the radio,
they said your name. I heard it clearly.

622
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:44,988
You're a spy for the ANSP. Am I wrong?

623
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:49,033
She's a spy for the ANSP?

624
00:55:49,117 --> 00:55:51,786
-A spy for the ANSP?
-But really?

625
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,997
But that doesn't make sense.

626
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,834
Quiet.

627
00:55:58,585 --> 00:55:59,627
Quiet!

628
00:56:01,337 --> 00:56:02,630
Hold on.

629
00:56:03,339 --> 00:56:06,009
Ms. Pi. Is what she said true?

630
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:09,637
You turned a blind eye
to Bun-ok's stealing.

631
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:11,306
So I wondered why.

632
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,141
Is this why?

633
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:17,270
Yes, what she said

634
00:56:18,813 --> 00:56:20,231
is all true.

635
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,735
-It's true?
-What?

636
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,153
What?

637
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:26,613
So it's true?

638
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:30,033
-What, is she out of her mind?
-I can't trust anyone.

639
00:56:30,116 --> 00:56:34,329
They even wiretapped the dorm
and had me keep an eye on you.

640
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,456
Wiretap?

641
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:38,082
God, that's scary.

642
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:40,043
-Is that true?
-Even wiretapped?

643
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:43,421
But I swear I've never sold
any of you out to the ANSP.

644
00:56:45,173 --> 00:56:48,343
If you were not going to do that,
why did you spy for them?

645
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:50,470
I'm sure…

646
00:56:52,347 --> 00:56:55,892
she had to obey them
to protect all of the students.

647
00:56:56,893 --> 00:56:58,144
I see.

648
00:56:58,228 --> 00:57:00,605
You searched all our rooms
with the spare keys.

649
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,398
Was that also to protect us?

650
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:04,359
Was it?

651
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:06,319
Jeong-min, shut it.

652
00:57:07,278 --> 00:57:08,947
We must find the mole first.

653
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,617
I'll watch the students.
You should go search the rooms.

654
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:17,330
I'll leave them to you.

655
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:24,045
-I can't believe this.
-Can you believe her?

656
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:34,514
Bun-ok, stop right there!

657
00:57:36,474 --> 00:57:38,268
One more step forward,

658
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:41,854
and that proves you're the mole.

659
00:57:48,403 --> 00:57:50,154
How am I the mole?

660
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:53,157
You spied for the ANSP.
You must be the mole.

661
00:57:56,202 --> 00:57:57,370
She is not!

662
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:04,586
If Ms. Pi ever wanted to harm us,

663
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:07,255
all the student protesters among us
would've been arrested.

664
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:11,050
Jeong-min and Hye-seong
would have already been arrested.

665
00:58:12,385 --> 00:58:16,306
For now, it's best for all of us
not to leave this room

666
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:19,309
so that Mr. Lee can find the mole.

667
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:22,103
Bun-ok!

668
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:23,438
That damn b****.

669
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:25,523
Hey, you two. Follow me!

670
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:29,944
You little…
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:32,864
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Come here.

672
00:58:32,947 --> 00:58:34,782
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

673
00:58:34,866 --> 00:58:36,826
-Take her inside!
-Come on.

674
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:38,828
I'm really not the mole!

675
00:59:36,177 --> 00:59:37,136
This money…

676
00:59:37,887 --> 00:59:39,138
You gave it to her, right?

677
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:41,641
You made Soo-ho believe you'd turned,

678
00:59:42,558 --> 00:59:44,060
and use her

679
00:59:44,769 --> 00:59:46,521
to inform Nam Tae-il of our plan.

680
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:52,235
Didn't you keep me tied
in the office all night?

681
00:59:53,486 --> 00:59:56,698
I didn't even have a radio.
And even if I did,

682
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:01,077
what if she'd tell Tae-il
that I was a Northern spy?

683
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:03,454
You think I'd risk that?

684
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:07,125
You have another radio, don't you?

685
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:09,961
Where did you hide it?

686
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,176
It wasn't me.

687
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:20,054
I'm not the mole!

688
01:00:21,597 --> 01:00:25,435
Why are you suspecting me and not
the ANSP informant? Am I an easy target?

689
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:28,020
You looked down on me
on the group blind date too!

690
01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:33,818
Apparently, I'm guilty
of the National Security Law violation,

691
01:00:33,901 --> 01:00:37,196
threatening to kill, illegal possession
of firearms, and attempted murder.

692
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:40,700
I resent the fact
that my life's been ruined

693
01:00:40,783 --> 01:00:42,910
because of you,
so I beat my chest all night.

694
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,039
My chest is all bruised.
Do you want to see it?

695
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:51,836
Why the hell did you come back?

696
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:56,632
You left the dorm safely
on the day of the Open House.

697
01:00:56,716 --> 01:00:58,134
Why did you have to come back?

698
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:07,477
Because of Yeong-ro?

699
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:13,441
You came back to see Yeong-ro.

700
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,947
Why do I have to
be sacrificed for your love?

701
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:23,159
Why? This is so unfair!

702
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,133
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORMITORY
OPEN HOUSE

703
01:01:42,386 --> 01:01:43,679
December 3.

704
01:01:44,764 --> 01:01:45,973
The day of the Open House.

705
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:48,810
Did you really leave the dorm?

706
01:01:50,561 --> 01:01:52,605
Yes. Why?

707
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:57,443
"Dormitory has been searched.
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,570
Hoping to go to the North
as soon as possible."

709
01:02:06,828 --> 01:02:09,163
<i>The ANSP wiretapping team
intercepted this message.</i>

710
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:12,250
On December 5.

711
01:02:14,168 --> 01:02:15,002
What?

712
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:17,755
I naturally thought
you sent it from the dorm.

713
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,091
That's why I came here to catch you.

714
01:02:25,888 --> 01:02:27,723
Then even before this hostage situation--

715
01:02:27,807 --> 01:02:29,267
There was a spy in here.

716
01:02:36,023 --> 01:02:37,233
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
01:02:37,316 --> 01:02:38,943
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: TAEDONG RIVER 1

718
01:02:39,026 --> 01:02:40,528
<i>Lim Soo-ho betrayed alone.</i>

719
01:02:41,112 --> 01:02:44,991
<i>Guarantee Su-hui's safety.
If she is harmed,</i>

720
01:02:45,074 --> 01:02:47,910
<i>I cannot guarantee Moran Hill 1's safety.</i>

721
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,832
Is this bastard

722
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:56,460
threatening me right now?

723
01:02:56,544 --> 01:03:00,339
He must be worried you might kill Su-hui
because he's betrayed the party.

724
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:03,718
He wants Su-hui to be the broadcaster
of the numbers station starting today.

725
01:03:04,886 --> 01:03:06,178
Su-hui?

726
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:09,724
<i>For fear we'll kill her
after recording her voice,</i>

727
01:03:09,807 --> 01:03:12,602
<i>he says he'll send us an
additional four-digit number</i>

728
01:03:12,685 --> 01:03:15,229
<i>three hours before every broadcast.</i>

729
01:03:18,858 --> 01:03:20,651
He's trying so hard.

730
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:27,199
I'm not worried about Moran Hill 1.
I'm sure Nam Tae-il will save her.

731
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:31,287
Then I'll leave the numbers station
to the usual broadcaster.

732
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,622
We should.

733
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:37,168
I, Lim Ji-rok, shouldn't let
a puppy like him push me around.

734
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:41,172
Send word to Haegeumseong 1 in the dorm

735
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:44,508
that if the ANSP fails,

736
01:03:44,592 --> 01:03:48,179
they're to kill the traitors
and return to Pyongyang.

737
01:03:49,096 --> 01:03:50,598
<i>Who on earth is it?</i>

738
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:53,100
How can there be a mole?

739
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:55,061
How long do we have to stay here?

740
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:56,729
Be quiet, will you?

741
01:03:56,812 --> 01:03:58,648
I said one sentence.

742
01:03:59,357 --> 01:04:00,608
What if it's among us?

743
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:01,817
Among us?

744
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:22,129
RÉSUMÉ
OH DEOK-SIM

745
01:04:22,213 --> 01:04:24,882
GRADUATED FROM NORTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE
MYEONGCHEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

746
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:31,389
WORKED AT A SAUDI ARABIAN
CONSTRUCTION SITE

747
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:33,766
RÉSUMÉ
KIM MAN-DONG

748
01:04:58,749 --> 01:04:59,750
Anything unusual?

749
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:01,168
Before coming to work here,

750
01:05:01,252 --> 01:05:03,546
he was a construction worker
in the Middle East.

751
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:05,297
What about Ms. Oh's résumé?

752
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:07,925
She came to the South
during the Korean War.

753
01:05:08,009 --> 01:05:10,428
I think she commutes
to the dorm every day.

754
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:12,388
Did you search the cafeteria?

755
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,935
<i>Someone stole chickens.</i>

756
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:21,772
Last night, someone stole chickens.

757
01:06:05,024 --> 01:06:06,358
Soo-ho.

758
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:37,765
Hello?

759
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:46,941
Gang-mu?

760
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:52,196
<i>This is Director Eun.</i>

761
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:59,161
He must've taken it from her.

762
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:06,168
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

763
01:07:06,627 --> 01:07:08,587
What do you gain by turning against us?

764
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,297
<i>You're digging your own grave.</i>

765
01:07:27,189 --> 01:07:28,816
Let me ask you something.

766
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,028
These innocent students…

767
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:36,657
Are you really planning to kill them all?

768
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,701
Why would we kill the innocent students?

769
01:07:38,784 --> 01:07:40,161
You heard the recording.

770
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:41,912
We agreed to save the hostages.

771
01:07:41,996 --> 01:07:44,874
Do you expect me to believe that
when you've set up bombs?

772
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:47,042
They're just for threatening.

773
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:49,086
<i>Don't you trust the ANSP?</i>

774
01:07:51,088 --> 01:07:52,423
My father was

775
01:07:53,424 --> 01:07:55,509
shot to death while chasing a spy.

776
01:07:57,636 --> 01:08:01,557
<i>I followed suit and joined the ANSP
to catch all those communists.</i>

777
01:08:02,266 --> 01:08:03,893
But rather than catching communists,

778
01:08:05,895 --> 01:08:09,273
the agency framed innocent people
for espionage to produce results.

779
01:08:11,483 --> 01:08:12,693
So I ran away.

780
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:17,740
<i>"Fine. All I have to do
is catch real communists."</i>

781
01:08:19,116 --> 01:08:20,492
<i>Telling myself that,</i>

782
01:08:21,702 --> 01:08:23,245
I wandered around.

783
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:26,665
What do you think I should do now?

784
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:30,628
The ANSP is trying
to kill the innocent students.

785
01:08:35,341 --> 01:08:37,426
Where should I run to this time?

786
01:08:44,975 --> 01:08:47,478
You ran away pretending to have no idea.

787
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,191
Do that this time too.
Just as you've been doing.

788
01:09:12,044 --> 01:09:14,046
I don't think we can locate Yeong-ro.

789
01:09:22,513 --> 01:09:24,181
Proceed as planned.

790
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:25,849
Yes, sir.

791
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:36,860
Where do you belong?

792
01:09:40,864 --> 01:09:42,199
I have no idea.

793
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:47,705
I dont know. Why are you doing this to me?

794
01:09:47,788 --> 01:09:49,206
I'm not it!

795
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:50,124
Lady.

796
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:52,626
Stop pretending to be insane!

797
01:09:53,752 --> 01:09:54,628
Stop it!

798
01:09:56,046 --> 01:09:56,964
Look.

799
01:09:57,047 --> 01:09:59,383
Why would she be pretending to be insane?

800
01:10:00,301 --> 01:10:03,095
And she's normally really cold and edgy.

801
01:10:03,804 --> 01:10:06,724
She started behaving that way after
the hostage-taking. Isn't it suspicious?

802
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:10,144
Well, she was always quite moody,

803
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:14,398
and after the gunfire and everything,
she must've been so shocked.

804
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:18,819
Look. It's been so long
since the war ended.

805
01:10:18,902 --> 01:10:20,446
Have you ever been in a war?

806
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:27,077
She's from the North.

807
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:30,080
While fleeing to the South,

808
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:33,208
she lost her father, mother,
and brother from bombings.

809
01:10:33,542 --> 01:10:35,836
Their bodies were ripped
to pieces in front of her.

810
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:39,840
That's why even the sound of airplanes
still frightens her into a fit.

811
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,554
Hey, it's all right.
You can come out here.

812
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:49,016
-Come out now.
-I don't know…

813
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:59,693
I'm sorry…

814
01:11:00,819 --> 01:11:03,781
-Hey, don't cry.
-I'm sorry…

815
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:06,241
I'm sorry…

816
01:11:08,077 --> 01:11:10,120
I'm sorry…

817
01:11:13,207 --> 01:11:16,210
I'm sorry…

818
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,214
<i>Ms. Oh is the mole?</i>

819
01:11:20,297 --> 01:11:22,049
She was a Northern spy.

820
01:11:22,132 --> 01:11:23,133
It's so scary.

821
01:11:23,675 --> 01:11:27,054
Then we've been eating
what a Northern spy cooked?

822
01:11:27,888 --> 01:11:29,098
Anyway,

823
01:11:30,182 --> 01:11:33,394
the mole's been caught,
so you're free to go back to your rooms.

824
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:37,856
But refrain from leaving your rooms
except when you go to the restroom.

825
01:11:46,698 --> 01:11:47,908
It's so scary.

826
01:12:19,648 --> 01:12:20,983
It looks like PTSD.

827
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:23,026
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

828
01:12:23,735 --> 01:12:26,697
A weak-minded person like her was a spy?

829
01:12:27,906 --> 01:12:29,199
Do you believe it?

830
01:12:31,452 --> 01:12:35,122
We weren't able to become spies
because we were strong from the beginning.

831
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:39,751
It's because we were trained so.

832
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:51,597
It's almost time to cook dinner…

833
01:12:54,099 --> 01:12:57,936
This is the end of a secret agent
who dedicated her life to her country?

834
01:13:54,284 --> 01:13:57,287
What's your plan?
Are you going to go to war with the ANSP?

835
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,749
Bombs have been installed around the dorm.

836
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:04,127
The SWAT team might break in
to rescue you tonight.

837
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:11,760
I will

838
01:14:13,136 --> 01:14:14,972
go meet my father.

839
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:19,977
Let me convince him in person.

840
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,565
If he changes his mind,
we'll all be able to live.

841
01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:29,403
No. If you meet him,

842
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:32,864
your father will try to get you out.

843
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:36,577
Once his daughter is out,
they'll blow up the dorm.

844
01:14:38,537 --> 01:14:41,540
But you said
the SWAT team might break in tonight.

845
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:45,586
You're just two. Will you be okay?

846
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:50,007
Before you decide to fight,
we should try everything you can.

847
01:14:50,966 --> 01:14:52,217
Let me do this.

848
01:14:53,093 --> 01:14:54,177
Please?

849
01:15:20,746 --> 01:15:22,956
If you found out
where Yeong-ro and Dr. Kang are,

850
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,459
it would've made this a lot easier.

851
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:28,503
You boasted about your informant,
but what is this?

852
01:15:29,129 --> 01:15:31,089
Gang-mu took her radio from her.
Why is that--

853
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:32,341
Quiet!

854
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:36,053
<i>Ready to go in.</i>

855
01:15:44,603 --> 01:15:45,520
Hello?

856
01:15:45,604 --> 01:15:47,939
Yeong-ro wants to meet you.

857
01:15:48,357 --> 01:15:51,151
<i>Come to the shrine in five minutes. Alone.</i>

858
01:15:51,234 --> 01:15:53,403
<i>If you try anything stupid,
she'll be hurt.</i>

859
01:15:54,738 --> 01:15:56,490
You must come alone.

860
01:16:07,584 --> 01:16:09,836
<i>If anything goes wrong, you might die.</i>

861
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:13,298
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

862
01:16:14,257 --> 01:16:15,509
We have no choice.

863
01:16:17,803 --> 01:16:21,598
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try it.

864
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:44,496
I should bring the minimum number
of agents, or they'll catch on.

865
01:16:44,996 --> 01:16:48,041
I only brought two marksmen, sir.

866
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:51,169
But this could be a trap.
It's dangerous to go in alone.

867
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:52,921
Why don't you wear this bulletproof vest?

868
01:17:03,348 --> 01:17:04,891
I'll go in first.

869
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,102
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.

870
01:17:07,185 --> 01:17:09,604
Then come in through the shrine.

871
01:17:09,688 --> 01:17:12,023
We must kill him.

872
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:14,609
Understood, sir.

873
01:17:17,195 --> 01:17:20,907
<i>Kill the target only. Mr. Eun and
his daughter's safety is our top priority.</i>

874
01:17:20,991 --> 01:17:22,159
<i>Over and out.</i>

875
01:18:20,842 --> 01:18:22,219
Will you be all right?

876
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,953
Yeong-ro.

877
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:08,139
Are you all right?

878
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:12,727
Are you hurt at all?

879
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:19,651
Put the gun down.

880
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:28,326
Have you ever seen
the ANSP director carrying a gun?

881
01:19:37,002 --> 01:19:38,003
Dad.

882
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:39,671
Yes?

883
01:19:43,216 --> 01:19:46,803
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

884
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:51,182
Of course not.
Who told you that? That's absurd.

885
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:53,476
Please stop it.

886
01:19:54,936 --> 01:19:57,772
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

887
01:19:57,856 --> 01:19:59,065
What are you talking about?

888
01:19:59,816 --> 01:20:01,818
I really want to save you.

889
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:04,738
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

890
01:20:04,821 --> 01:20:06,948
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

891
01:20:14,831 --> 01:20:18,710
And they're innocent. You know that.

892
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:22,422
Please save us.

893
01:20:24,883 --> 01:20:26,468
It's all my fault.

894
01:20:28,011 --> 01:20:29,679
Why do you think that way?

895
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:31,097
Don't move.

896
01:20:34,935 --> 01:20:36,519
And my brother…

897
01:20:38,104 --> 01:20:39,522
Yeong-u…

898
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:44,152
died because of me.

899
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:54,412
If my friends die too,

900
01:20:56,623 --> 01:20:58,124
I won't be able to…

901
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:00,293
Yeong-ro.

902
01:21:01,294 --> 01:21:02,379
Please…

903
01:21:03,296 --> 01:21:06,383
I don't have the power
to decide everything on my own.

904
01:21:07,258 --> 01:21:10,553
But I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

905
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:11,888
Don't move!

906
01:21:18,144 --> 01:21:20,021
Can you trust me?

907
01:21:27,445 --> 01:21:28,863
Yeong-ro.

908
01:21:36,538 --> 01:21:37,914
Yeong-ro!

909
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,299
No!

910
01:22:13,491 --> 01:22:15,994
Don't shoot! Yeong-ro!

911
01:22:18,663 --> 01:22:19,581
Come in!

912
01:22:19,664 --> 01:22:20,999
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

913
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:22,500
Move back!

914
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:23,877
Don't shoot!

915
01:22:26,129 --> 01:22:27,964
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

916
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:31,634
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

917
01:22:48,485 --> 01:22:51,404
<i>Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies</i>

918
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:53,740
<i>near the Hosu University dorm.</i>

919
01:22:53,823 --> 01:22:55,700
-How's Eun?
<i>-The wound is severe,</i>

920
01:22:55,784 --> 01:22:57,660
<i>so they'll know for sure
after the surgery.</i>

921
01:22:57,744 --> 01:23:00,163
So? Is he going to make it or not?

922
01:23:00,246 --> 01:23:02,040
<i>Eun is still not conscious.</i>

923
01:23:02,123 --> 01:23:04,459
Since he's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

924
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:07,170
<i>He only cares about saving his daughter.</i>

925
01:23:07,253 --> 01:23:09,047
<i>We can't leave our fate to him.</i>

926
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,091
<i>In ten minutes, we will</i>

927
01:23:11,174 --> 01:23:12,217
retake the dorm.

928
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,052
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

929
01:23:14,928 --> 01:23:19,682
<i>They're making up a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.</i>

930
01:23:19,766 --> 01:23:21,559
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

931
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:22,894
<i>What do we do now?</i>

932
01:23:22,977 --> 01:23:25,939
<i>They'll frame us for killing the hostages.</i>

933
01:23:26,523 --> 01:23:28,942
<i>We should get ready to fight now.</i>

934
01:23:29,526 --> 01:23:31,111
<i>What if they really</i>

935
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:35,406
<i>break in to kill us all?
What do we do then?</i>

936
01:23:38,201 --> 01:23:40,995
