EPISODE 2

4
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:10,633
STEAMED BUNS AND DUMPLINGS

5
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:12,886
I'll beat it.

6
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:15,430
Look, it's snowing!

7
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:18,558
-This calls for pollack stew.
-All right.

8
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:20,101
Are you really okay with it?

9
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:22,520
Sure. Nice, spicy pollack stew
would be perfect.

10
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,801
It's D-day.

11
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:55,762
We must capture him.

12
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,057
-Professor.
-What?

13
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,143
-Are you going home now?
-Hey, Soo-ho. You're still here?

14
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:06,147
Oh, my. This looks quite serious.

15
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:13,947
It's nice of you to give me a ride.
Thank you.

16
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:17,992
They're coming.

17
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:26,084
The river's finally flowing. Over.

18
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,382
Han-na and I will stand by
in front of Building B.

19
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:36,344
Taedong River 1's car must take this road
to get out through the main gate.

20
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:41,432
Go.

21
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,229
And on this road, about 3km from here,

22
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,605
there's a tunnel.

23
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,150
His car will go
through this tunnel for sure.

24
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,920
<i>The road branches off after the tunnel.
We'll be ready for it.</i>

25
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,131
Whichever direction his car takes,

26
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,676
we'll get the car at the next crossroads.

27
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,053
-Il-geun, you stand by at the crossroads.
-Yes, sir.

28
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:21,597
Crash into the car there.

29
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:25,059
<i>We'll get him by any means necessary.
That'll be all.</i>

30
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,729
Where are you taking me?

31
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,856
Tell me.

32
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:51,669
Where are you, Mount Gamak?

33
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,505
Go to the second crossroads. Now!

34
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:56,424
This is Mount Gamak. Right away.

35
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:57,925
Turn the car.

36
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:06,184
Comrade, I think we've shaken the tail.

37
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,209
Comrade Joo.

38
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:32,627
Comrade Joo.

39
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:34,379
Geum-cheol.

40
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,005
Geum-cheol!

41
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,762
Professor!

42
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,978
Comrade Joo!

43
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:54,023
Just run. Now!

44
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:06,744
Lim Soo-ho.

45
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:10,498
Follow me.

46
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,757
<i>-Pine tree, pine tree, green pine tree
-Pine tree, pine tree, green pine tree</i>

47
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:24,554
<i>-Don't be shaken by an east wind</i>
-Soo-ho, you bastard!

48
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,432
<i>-Beneath bars of the prison
-Beneath bars of the prison</i>

49
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,475
<i>-Where you are tied
-Where you are tied</i>

50
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:33,438
<i>-We will meet there alive
-We will meet there alive</i>

51
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:35,648
-Fair election!
-Stop!

52
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:36,732
Lim Soo-ho!

53
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,612
-Fight.
-Fight.

54
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,922
Han-na, go east with Dong-jae.
I'll go west.

55
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:01,424
Radio me once you find him.

56
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:46,511
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

57
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,012
Let's go.

58
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:43,442
OUTSIDER ENTRY RESTRICTED

59
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,533
Seung-jun.

60
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,005
Let's go to the dorm.

61
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:28,172
Bye. We'll be late for roll call.

62
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:29,465
Okay. See you tomorrow.

63
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:21,976
Hey.

64
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:24,562
Wake up.

65
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:25,771
Hey.

66
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,830
Yeong-ro, the hall director-- Oh, my God!

67
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:47,126
That's blood.

68
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:53,924
<i>Sir.</i>

69
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:55,509
That must be it.

70
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:01,474
Move out of the way!

71
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,063
Seung-jun, this way. Dong-jae, that way.

72
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,358
Hey, you can't…

73
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:22,870
TURN OFF HEATING WHEN GOING OUT

74
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,265
Move! Get out of my way!

75
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:45,726
Find him!

76
00:12:02,451 --> 00:12:05,746
Attention. This is an emergency.
Outsiders have broken in.

77
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,790
<i>Everyone lock your doors right now.</i>

78
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:11,669
<i>Until I instruct otherwise,
do not open your door for anyone.</i>

79
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,922
<i>I repeat.</i>

80
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:17,216
<i>Outsiders have broken in.</i>

81
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,803
<i>Wherever you are at the moment,
lock the door right now.</i>

82
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:24,348
<i>Until I instruct otherwise,
do not open your door for anyone.</i>

83
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:25,724
And stay inside.

84
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,143
<i>Ignore the instructions,</i>

85
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:31,897
and you'll be severely punished.
You might get kicked out.

86
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,358
<i>Keep that in mind.</i>

87
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,944
<i>This is an emergency.
Outsiders have broken in.</i>

88
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:42,157
Don't open any doors for the outsiders,
and stay where you are.

89
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:47,454
-Hye-ryeong.
-Hye-ryeong!

90
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:00,217
What's going on?

91
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,552
What happened?

92
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,888
He was already in here
when I came back from the library.

93
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,056
Through the window?

94
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:09,059
I think he's been chased for protesting.

95
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:11,770
This is crazy.

96
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:12,938
What do we do?

97
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:15,441
What do you mean?
Of course, we should hide him.

98
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:19,695
Okay.

99
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,910
But I'm so scared.

100
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:28,287
If we get caught,
we'll all get kicked out.

101
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,955
And we might get arrested.

102
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,790
Let's just tell the hall director.

103
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,500
-Please?
-Shut it.

104
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:34,960
He won't go down alone.

105
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:39,798
Didn't you hear? He's a North Korean spy.

106
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:43,552
Spy? You know the cops frame us
and call us communists all the time.

107
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,054
He's not a spy.

108
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:47,431
He's one of the guys
we went on a group blind date with.

109
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:48,849
What?

110
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,353
Gizzard's partner?

111
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:53,854
Yes.

112
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:56,106
I'm sure he's been chased for protesting.

113
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,484
I saw him being chased that day too.

114
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:00,319
<i>I repeat.</i>

115
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:04,073
<i>Attention. This is an emergency.
Outsiders have broken in.</i>

116
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:06,367
Everyone lock your doors--

117
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:14,249
Tell them to open the doors now.

118
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:19,630
I'm not that patient.

119
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:21,215
Han-na.

120
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:23,884
Now.

121
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:39,358
Everyone…

122
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,908
Everyone lock your doors right now.

123
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:52,037
My goodness.
What on earth is going on here?

124
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:53,163
It only takes 30 minutes

125
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:55,874
to get to the Prosecutors' Office.

126
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:57,960
Go get a warrant.

127
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:00,254
We can just get it after we capture him!

128
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:03,382
If he's in here,
he's like a rat in a trap. So go now.

129
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,358
You.

130
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:26,697
You must be thinking
we're chasing some student protester.

131
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,035
If we catch him in here,

132
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:35,372
we'll arrest you next.

133
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:40,794
Here.

134
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,929
Hey, how could you show them the blueprint

135
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,182
without the hall director's permission?

136
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:55,309
Who cares? They're chasing a spy.

137
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:56,727
The main gate is the only exit.

138
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,480
Don't even let a rat go through the gate.

139
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,731
Yes, sir.

140
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:06,403
Any door to this room from outside?

141
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,239
There is one door, but it's shut down--

142
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,328
They're chasing a spy.
We should cooperate.

143
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,749
Of course,

144
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,294
it's right for us to cooperate.

145
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:26,090
But the hall director wants
to go by the book.

146
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:29,134
Fine. Then let me play it by the book
and tell you this.

147
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:31,220
If you harbor a spy

148
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:34,389
or help him in any way,
you'll face ten years in prison.

149
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:37,017
Please keep that in mind.

150
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,436
Okay. I understand.

151
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,690
Let me know if you need anything else.

152
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,324
Hey, are you awake?

153
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:56,161
-He's awake?
-Is he awake?

154
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:58,831
Open your eyes.

155
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,416
Can you hear me?

156
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,048
Do you recognize me?

157
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:11,593
What do we do? He woke up.

158
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:14,721
It's me. You gave me the cassette tape.

159
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:18,058
<i>One way ticket</i>
<i>One way ticket</i>

160
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,570
Where am I?

161
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,114
This is Hosu University dorm.

162
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:34,783
You came in through that window.

163
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,243
Listen.

164
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:39,079
Four armed cops are here for you.

165
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,836
-I have to go.
-No.

166
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:47,296
If you do, you'll get caught.

167
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:49,464
If I stay here, you'll be put in danger.

168
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,438
Damn it.

169
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,292
Seung-jun.

170
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:31,173
-Sir, I got the warrant!
-Hush!

171
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:42,935
Call for backup now. He's in the dorm.

172
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:44,019
Yes, sir.

173
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:47,439
Jeong-min.

174
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,358
We'll be arrested too.

175
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,152
Do you only care about protesters?
What about us?

176
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:55,072
I need to graduate to go abroad to study!

177
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,741
-Let's get him out of here…
-And?

178
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,828
We should hide him somewhere safe.

179
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:05,207
Where can we hide him
in this girls' dormitory?

180
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:09,336
I got an idea.

181
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,965
I know a place where
the cops won't be able to enter.

182
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:07,394
SEARCH WARRANT
CHARGE: NATIONAL SECURITY LAW VIOLATION

183
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,831
Oh, no.

184
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,751
What do we do?

185
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:38,216
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

186
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:54,626
Hey, did anyone suspicious
come into this room?

187
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:00,006
No, I didn't see
anyone suspicious in here.

188
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,299
Are you here alone?

189
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:03,135
Where are your roommates?

190
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:10,642
SECRETS TO SINGING SOPRANO

191
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:16,565
Where are they?

192
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:19,192
In the public bath.

193
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:20,986
Public bath?

194
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,030
But the hall director told you
to lock the door and stay inside.

195
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,158
They went before she said that.

196
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:28,535
So are you saying they're taking a bath

197
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:30,912
when outsiders have broken in?

198
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,914
There are no speakers in the bath.

199
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:38,044
They might not have heard me.

200
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:49,222
-Follow me.
-Are you even searching the bath?

201
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,892
What are you staring at?

202
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,395
-Look, I'm not that kind of--
-You little…

203
00:22:57,856 --> 00:22:59,816
It's not what you think.

204
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,903
What a pervert. How could he…

205
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:05,989
Ma'am…

206
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:15,248
My goodness.

207
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:24,633
Yeo Jeong-min, that wench…

208
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:44,778
PUBLIC BATH RULES

209
00:24:06,383 --> 00:24:07,384
Move aside.

210
00:24:07,842 --> 00:24:10,595
No. You can't go in there.

211
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,098
Are you insane? I can't let you go in!

212
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:16,601
SAVE WATER FOR THE EARTH

213
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,651
Hey, lift the lid. Hurry.

214
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:31,866
We'll take off our clothes,
so close your eyes. Now.

215
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,745
Listen. If we get caught,
we'll be all done for.

216
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:37,914
Take them off now!

217
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,022
They're 20-year-old college girls.

218
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:06,067
-Do you really have to search the bath?
-Move aside.

Who the hell are you?

232
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:28,400
Girls, calm down.

233
00:26:29,943 --> 00:26:32,987
I'm looking for a guy who snuck
into your room. Have you seen him?

234
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:37,951
What are you talking about?
We came here right after a drama show.

235
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:08,648
You.

236
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,193
Why are you crying?

237
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,492
Because I'm so scared.

238
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:33,214
You're scared?

239
00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:41,931
Why are you scared?

240
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:55,236
Miss!

241
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,449
You barged in with a pistol.
Of course we're scared.

242
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:02,952
Miss?

243
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,294
Right.

244
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:43,535
Hey, hush. You're okay now.

245
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:45,578
It's okay.

246
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,544
Are you sure you searched thoroughly?

247
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:56,506
I even searched the dry sauna
where the girls were naked.

248
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,388
Mount Gamak, this is Black Tiger.

249
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:05,265
<i>Black Tiger.</i>

250
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:08,101
This is Mount Gamak. We're heading
for the company with the package.

251
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:10,103
To the company.

252
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:18,570
No!

253
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:21,406
-Hurry up!
-Come out now.

254
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:23,366
-No!
-Come out now!

255
00:29:25,743 --> 00:29:26,578
Let go!

256
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,541
Come out.

257
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:43,261
Are you okay?

258
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,597
Jeong-min,
the roll call's in five minutes.

259
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,515
Yeong-ro, let's hurry!

260
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,516
In here.

261
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:01,946
You guys go first. I'll be there soon.

262
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,741
Okay. Don't be late. Seol-hui, take them.

263
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:06,618
Okay.

264
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:16,377
Then

265
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:19,047
I'll stay here only for the night.

266
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,882
You think that'll be enough?

267
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:22,926
Stay here until your wound heals.

268
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:25,261
I'll find somewhere safe for you to stay.

269
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,890
How will I ever repay you for this?

270
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:35,313
I'm not helping you for free.

271
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:40,818
This is for the tape.

272
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,863
You bought me the tape. We're even now.

273
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:04,717
I'll come back
as soon as the roll call's over.

281
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:46,092
I told you to stop Lee Gang-mu.

282
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:47,427
I'm sorry, sir.

283
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:50,888
You told me to be very discreet,
so I had no other choice.

284
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:53,808
So what about the North guys?

285
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:56,144
One was arrested
and transferred to the company,

286
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:58,354
and Taedong River 1 and the last one
got away.

287
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,355
Is Han I-seop talking?

288
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:03,109
He keeps claiming that they were giving
him a ride because he had a flat tire.

289
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:06,654
Okay. Keep me updated every hour.

290
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:09,699
Hey, Choi.

291
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,034
Yes, sir.

292
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,297
How did it go?

293
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:30,511
Did they fail?

294
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:32,847
Since Operation Phoenix is top secret,

295
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:34,974
we ran it without Chief An knowing, so…

296
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:38,061
The presidential election is
in three weeks!

297
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,814
What's so hard? We only fund the op,
and the North will take care of the rest.

298
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:46,360
Send Han I-seop,
the best brains of the other candidate,

299
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,196
to the North, take some photos,

300
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,116
and forge some records showing the North
is funding him, and give it to the press.

301
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,035
Then our candidate will become president.

302
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:56,162
How can you ruin it?

303
00:32:56,662 --> 00:33:00,083
Don't you know the public is dying
to elect a president by themselves?

304
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:05,630
Fortunately, Taedong River 1 hasn't been
caught, so I'll talk to the North--

305
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:09,592
Do you really think
those communists will act as we wish?

306
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:14,472
Don't you remember how much money we gave
them to make them sign the agreement?

307
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:17,016
But we can't order our agents

308
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,186
not to catch a Northern spy, can we?

309
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:22,188
I'm the director of ANSP.

310
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:23,272
Even as we speak,

311
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:26,943
the press will talk about
how Han I-seop was almost abducted.

312
00:33:27,026 --> 00:33:30,947
Then the stupid opposition party
will jabber about the North wind.

313
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,200
I will take care of
Han I-seop's case on my own.

314
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:35,910
On your own?

315
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:37,328
On your own?

316
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:39,038
Sir!

317
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:42,875
I need to talk to you.

318
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:48,172
Why did you have to
butt in and ruin everything?

319
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,550
Mr. Nam.

320
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:54,303
As expected,

321
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:57,515
those who are incompetent
and diligent are the worst.

322
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,478
Not only that, you're slow-witted too.

323
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:17,952
So you lost him?

324
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:20,121
I'm sorry, sir.

325
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:22,498
Tell Gang-mu
to take his hands off Han's case.

326
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,084
But we must catch Taedong River 1.

327
00:34:31,674 --> 00:34:32,925
I said, no more.

328
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:40,892
Damn it.

329
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:43,728
<i>This is so frustrating!</i>

330
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:46,480
You should've kicked him in the shin too.

331
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,524
You should've broken it!

332
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:51,235
I really wanted to, but who knows?

333
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,740
Nam Tae-il might turn out
to be our lifeline.

334
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:58,951
-Lifeline?
-Yes.

335
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:05,208
S***! Shut up!

336
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,460
-Shut your trap!
-Calm down, honey. Relax.

337
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:18,846
Listen carefully.

338
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:23,643
I'm making Nam Tae-il's wife our lifeline,

339
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:25,436
-So you…
-Yes, I…

340
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,314
…shouldn't just wait for a lifeline

341
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:29,607
-to come down.
-All right.

342
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,692
You should make your own lifeline!

343
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:32,902
Okay!

344
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:35,404
Wait, what? How will I do that?

345
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:57,051
<i>Pardon? We're closing the case
all of a sudden?</i>

346
00:35:57,635 --> 00:35:59,595
They tried to abduct Professor Han.

347
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:02,348
But he says they didn't.

348
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,016
What can we do?

349
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,269
We must find out why he's doing that.

350
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,271
Don't touch Han, okay?

351
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:11,774
What if you poke him
and it affects the election?

352
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:18,155
Sir, I'm sure he is Taedong River 1.

353
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,865
That's just what you think!

354
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:23,953
Fine.

355
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:27,999
Let's say he tried
to abduct Han as you think.

356
00:36:28,249 --> 00:36:29,250
So what?

357
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:33,879
If you keep this up,

358
00:36:34,463 --> 00:36:36,382
you'll put us all at risk.

359
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,013
We can't have the reputation
that we fabricate cases anymore.

360
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:04,201
There's not a single article about it.

361
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:09,165
Multiple car crashes and gunshots
while we chased him.

362
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,375
But there are
only articles about the election.

363
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,172
It's obvious that the higher-ups are
pressuring us. Are we backing off?

364
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:18,382
Of course not.

365
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:21,677
We are not?

366
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,137
That bastard…

367
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:27,933
is Taedong River 1. I'm sure of it.

368
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,614
You won't even give up
on a mere communist. Why did you give me--

369
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:42,531
Han-na.

370
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:48,079
Keep monitoring Professor Han.

371
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,012
COSMOS TOYS

372
00:38:12,353 --> 00:38:13,771
This guy's your leader, isn't he?

373
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,275
He left his injured subordinate behind

374
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,320
to save his own skin.

375
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:23,280
What a bastard.

376
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:32,123
Long live the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea!

377
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:55,729
He's been operating secretly in Germany.

378
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,817
Why did he come to Seoul?
And why Professor Han of all people?

379
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:02,945
To approach Professor Han,

380
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:06,866
he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University

381
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:10,161
and approached Oh Gwang-tae,
Professor Han's TA.

382
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:12,163
You planned it meticulously.

383
00:39:13,038 --> 00:39:15,458
Why did you try to abduct Han?

384
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:24,508
Hey.

385
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:26,427
Hey.

386
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:28,262
It's cyanide!

387
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:31,640
Spit it out!

388
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:34,560
Spit it out!

389
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,191
Damn it!

390
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:22,399
When does our shift end?

391
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:23,442
In 30 minutes.

392
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:13,909
What a hassle.

393
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:41,729
<i>I'm so scared of the dark tonight</i>

394
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:48,319
<i>Birds' nonchalant chirping
sounds so sad tonight</i>

395
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:51,196
<i>The warm and loving old days</i>

396
00:41:51,697 --> 00:41:56,035
<i>Each other</i>

397
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,411
Darn it.

398
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:00,581
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

399
00:42:00,664 --> 00:42:01,832
Have you gone insane?

400
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,917
Just for a few days.

401
00:42:04,793 --> 00:42:06,295
He reminds me of my brother.

402
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:08,797
If someone had helped him back then,

403
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:11,133
he wouldn't have been caught.

404
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:17,890
I won't hear it anymore.

405
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:20,225
Just tell him to leave at dawn.

406
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:22,561
You're the one who's crazy.

407
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:25,606
He can't even walk properly.
How can we kick him out?

408
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:30,027
So you want to keep him in the dorm?
On the fourth floor, at that?

409
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,571
But that's the safest place, isn't it?

410
00:42:33,322 --> 00:42:34,323
You…

411
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:36,992
Don't you know what that place is?

412
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,495
The late hall director used to live there.

413
00:42:39,578 --> 00:42:41,163
Don't you remember?

414
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:44,708
When we went up to the fourth floor…

415
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:46,585
DO NOT ENTER

416
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:55,469
This place's been shut down for six years.

417
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:58,555
The former hall director
committed suicide in there.

418
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:00,391
Rumor has it…

419
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:07,981
that she still wanders
around the dorm at night.

420
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:12,444
Come on.

421
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:30,879
Look at that.

422
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:32,840
Come here.

423
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:54,903
<i>You still want to hide him there?</i>

424
00:43:57,656 --> 00:43:59,241
What else could we do?

425
00:43:59,575 --> 00:44:01,952
It'll take at least
a few days for him to recover.

426
00:44:02,244 --> 00:44:05,706
If we manage to get him in there,
it will be the safest place for him.

427
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:08,375
But the door's locked.

428
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:14,339
How about we ask Man-dong for help?

429
00:44:14,423 --> 00:44:16,592
I'm sure he'll help us.

430
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:19,595
If you harbor a Northern spy,

431
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:24,016
I heard you'll face ten years in prison.

432
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:26,977
But I even went on a blind date with him.

433
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,771
He's not a spy. I'm sure of it.

434
00:44:28,854 --> 00:44:31,899
But if I end up in jail,
my kids will be in trouble.

435
00:44:32,524 --> 00:44:35,986
The cops always say that protesters
turn the public against the government

436
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:37,237
and promote distrust,

437
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,406
and make every protester
look like a communist.

438
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,699
All the time.

439
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:43,535
Then that must be

440
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:48,832
why the hall director was
so uncooperative to them.

441
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,001
To save the student protester?

442
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:55,214
Exactly. She did it
to save the student protester.

443
00:44:55,297 --> 00:44:57,925
Then I shouldn't tell anyone anything.

444
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:02,137
All right. Let me see.

445
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:13,899
Hey.

446
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:52,396
By the way,
we can never let Bun-ok get wind of it.

447
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:53,981
Why is that?

448
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:58,694
She was very cooperative and
tried to get on the good side of the cops.

449
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:02,030
And she asked me how much money
she'd get for turning a spy in.

450
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:08,120
My Goodness. Go in there!

451
00:46:57,836 --> 00:46:59,254
She's in her room now.

452
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:01,131
God, I was so startled.

453
00:47:01,548 --> 00:47:02,633
Wait a second.

454
00:47:03,842 --> 00:47:07,346
Did you see the things
that wench was wearing?

455
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:09,514
Aren't those the items the students lost?

456
00:47:09,598 --> 00:47:12,392
You're right.
Aren't the shoes Seol-hui's, Yeong-ro?

457
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:15,479
She cried for days
after she lost the shoes.

458
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:17,689
I think so.

459
00:47:18,523 --> 00:47:20,651
All right. Let's hurry.

460
00:48:13,286 --> 00:48:17,207
Every time I come here,
it sends a chill down my spine.

461
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:28,260
I pulled her down.

462
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:30,178
With my own hands.

463
00:48:31,138 --> 00:48:33,098
The late hall director, Ms. Song.

464
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,065
Don't be scared.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

465
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:44,067
-Right, Jeong-min?
-What?

466
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:47,654
Yes, you're right.
Of course, ghosts don't exist.

467
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:52,200
-Gosh, it's so cold.
-Gosh.

468
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:55,579
Turn off the lights.

469
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:08,467
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

470
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,968
Go get some rest.

471
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:23,356
Quiet.

472
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:30,530
You see, right down below is the library.

473
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:33,033
You must be very careful.

474
00:49:33,658 --> 00:49:37,579
Shin Gyeong-ja, the most
sensitive person in the entire dorm,

475
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:41,374
studies in the library
until 2 a.m. every day. Don't forget that.

476
00:50:18,954 --> 00:50:20,914
Can you hold this for me?

477
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:56,176
Nothing unusual happened last night.

478
00:51:56,676 --> 00:52:00,472
Even the protesters you keep tabs on
didn't get any suspicious calls.

479
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:02,349
What about room 207?

480
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:05,060
There's a problem with them, right?

481
00:52:05,143 --> 00:52:08,104
I did notice that they were
acting weird during the roll call.

482
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:10,357
I told you not to run your mouth.

483
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:13,151
What you say can even kill someone.

484
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,490
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-You may leave.

485
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:39,052
-Oh, my God!
-Let me do it first.

486
00:52:39,928 --> 00:52:43,014
What's gotten into you?
You went to bed late and are a late riser!

487
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:45,016
-Let's go get breakfast.
-Breakfast?

488
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,101
What?

489
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:57,821
MENU FOR THIS WEEK

490
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:00,699
Hey, look at her backpack.

491
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:01,908
What's with her?

492
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,994
Is she wearing pajamas?

493
00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:05,495
Is she moving or what?

494
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,580
Why did she bring it here?

495
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,082
You're so funny.

496
00:53:09,499 --> 00:53:11,001
Look at her.

497
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,629
Don't stare at her.

498
00:53:32,814 --> 00:53:35,191
Enjoy your breakfast.

499
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:46,536
You brats!

500
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:50,832
You must not know how sharp-eyed I am.

501
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:52,792
Out of the 360 students,

502
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:56,338
I know exactly
who's had breakfast and who's not.

503
00:53:56,421 --> 00:53:57,630
You can't fool me.

504
00:54:03,386 --> 00:54:04,512
Next.

505
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:07,474
Thank you.

506
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:08,475
Take an apple.

507
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:09,601
Right.

508
00:54:10,226 --> 00:54:11,478
We want more sausages too.

509
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:12,645
Quiet.

510
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:24,783
KO HYE-RYEONG

511
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:33,041
No! I'm not ready yet.

512
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,251
It's me.

513
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,145
We need to come up with a code.

514
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:22,859
Knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock.

515
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:26,571
If you hear two knocks and then three,
it's me, Yeong-ro.

516
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,991
And you need to open
the door right away. Agreed?

517
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:32,869
Agreed.

518
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:37,415
You mustn't have had anything to eat.

519
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:40,752
Eat it. You need to eat to recover.

520
00:56:48,468 --> 00:56:50,178
Could you pick up some batteries for me?

521
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:53,765
Batteries? What for?

522
00:56:55,433 --> 00:56:59,229
I found a radio. I want
to listen to the radio when I'm alone.

523
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:02,690
Okay, I'll pick some up. So eat up.

524
00:57:03,483 --> 00:57:04,609
And some newspapers.

525
00:57:05,276 --> 00:57:06,569
Newspapers?

526
00:57:07,695 --> 00:57:09,239
My comrades are…

527
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:12,700
My friends are being chased too.

528
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:15,203
I want to see what's happened to them.

529
00:57:15,787 --> 00:57:18,164
In case it's in the news.

530
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:23,044
I'll bring some to you.
So don't worry, and eat.

531
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:25,171
And can I know the structure of the dorm?

532
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:31,302
For me to escape without getting caught,

533
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:33,555
I need to know what is where.

534
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:36,432
Seriously.

535
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:41,271
I had to change my clothes
to get breakfast twice.

536
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:43,231
I even wore glasses and tied my hair.

537
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:45,358
One of the ladies
in the cafeteria caught me.

538
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:47,193
See what I went through?

539
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:48,736
So eat now.

540
00:57:52,574 --> 00:57:55,410
All right. I'll eat.

541
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:10,258
You said you have a brother

542
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:13,386
who was caught protesting.

543
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:18,641
Yes. So he was drafted into the army.

544
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,312
I bet he worries you so much.

545
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:24,814
You must be like a big sister…

546
00:58:24,897 --> 00:58:28,067
No, like a mom to him.

547
00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:31,112
How did you know that?

548
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:34,782
I also have a younger sister,

549
00:58:34,866 --> 00:58:36,993
and she acts like my mom.

550
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:39,662
"Don't skip your meals."

551
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:42,165
"Take care of yourself. Don't get hurt."

552
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:43,833
So much nagging.

553
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,294
She's just like me.

554
00:58:47,253 --> 00:58:49,505
I said the same things to my brother.

555
00:58:51,716 --> 00:58:53,384
Your brother in the military

556
00:58:54,636 --> 00:58:58,139
must miss your nagging so much by now.

557
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:01,768
That serves him right.

558
00:59:02,477 --> 00:59:04,854
He always said he'd had enough.

559
00:59:07,607 --> 00:59:11,402
Oh, right. I brought some things.
I figured you might need them.

560
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:23,665
Towels.

561
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,124
Toilet paper.

562
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:30,254
But you're repaying me
too much for the tape.

563
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:33,549
Then repay me for this later.

564
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:39,013
How? With what?

565
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:48,981
Is there anything
you're specifically good at?

566
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:51,651
Like what?

567
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:54,987
Something like dancing or singing.
Something you're good at.

568
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,198
There isn't.

569
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:00,159
Not even one thing?

570
01:00:01,828 --> 01:00:02,912
Not even one thing.

571
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:10,503
Then you should learn things like that
instead of protesting.

572
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:12,964
You're boring.

573
01:00:24,475 --> 01:00:27,228
DO NOT ENTER

574
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:16,027
Oh, my. This was

575
01:01:16,527 --> 01:01:19,530
Jacqueline Kennedy's
favorite necklace. Right?

576
01:01:19,614 --> 01:01:23,326
Gosh, Mrs. Hong.
You indeed are good at picking a gift.

577
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:29,749
Everyone, thank you so much for coming
over and wishing me a happy birthday.

578
01:01:29,832 --> 01:01:31,584
My pleasure.

579
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:34,837
As a wife of a military officer,
as a wife of a politician,

580
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:37,924
and now as a wife
of a future presidential candidate,

581
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:40,718
you're a role model for all of us here.

582
01:01:40,802 --> 01:01:43,054
It's an honor to be invited.

583
01:01:45,097 --> 01:01:48,684
A military officer's wife
must think of his military uniform

584
01:01:48,768 --> 01:01:52,772
as his shroud all the time
and be prepared for the worst.

585
01:01:52,855 --> 01:01:54,273
You all know that, right?

586
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:55,858
-Of course, ma'am.
-Of course, ma'am.

587
01:01:55,942 --> 01:02:00,279
He's ready to sacrifice
his life for our country anytime.

588
01:02:01,405 --> 01:02:02,949
As I've supported him,

589
01:02:03,032 --> 01:02:07,161
what do you think I've realized
about being a good wife?

590
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:11,123
Anyone?

591
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:16,879
I knew it.

592
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,382
Ma'am.

593
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:22,301
My goodness.

594
01:02:25,763 --> 01:02:27,557
-What's that?
-Oh, my.

595
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:36,691
I thought long and hard

596
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:41,445
about what I should give
my guests for a party favor.

597
01:02:41,529 --> 01:02:42,655
And I chose this.

598
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,908
Now, open it, please.

599
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:47,702
My goodness.

600
01:02:48,578 --> 01:02:49,787
Is this a knife?

601
01:02:51,205 --> 01:02:53,749
How amazing!

602
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,586
I can feel the master's touch.

603
01:02:57,086 --> 01:03:00,756
It's an extraordinary
kitchen knife, ma'am.

604
01:03:03,718 --> 01:03:08,806
Engraved on the knife
is "sincerity" in Chinese characters.

605
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,602
That's the answer.

606
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:14,478
Sincerity.

607
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:18,774
You serve your husband with sincerity.

608
01:03:18,858 --> 01:03:21,694
That's the secret to being a good wife.

609
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:26,657
I mean, even my father,
a former four-star general,

610
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:30,077
named me "Seong-sim," meaning sincerity.

611
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:31,621
Oh, my goodness.

612
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:33,331
That's meaningful.

613
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:40,254
All right, then.
Why don't we chant the word together?

614
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:50,556
Sure.

615
01:03:52,683 --> 01:03:54,268
Sincerity!

616
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:55,519
-Sincerity!
-Sincerity!

617
01:03:57,605 --> 01:03:59,065
-This is good.
-Good job.

618
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:08,866
My gosh.

619
01:04:09,909 --> 01:04:10,993
You're perfectly fine.

620
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,455
It's 120 over 73.

621
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,624
-Really?
-Yes.

622
01:04:16,707 --> 01:04:17,625
That's odd.

623
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:21,087
I got furious because of Eun Chang-su,

624
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,047
so I thought it'd be off the charts.

625
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,341
So you're going
to Beijing today, aren't you?

626
01:04:25,424 --> 01:04:27,802
Then things will go as planned.

627
01:04:27,885 --> 01:04:30,221
Who knows if they will?

628
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:33,099
Those communist jerks
never give us what we want easily.

629
01:04:38,187 --> 01:04:41,524
Of course not.
So that they can get more money from you.

630
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,320
In any case, thanks to the failure,

631
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:49,532
Eun Chang-su
got on the bad side of Code One.

632
01:04:49,615 --> 01:04:50,533
Right.

633
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:53,119
You've got nothing to lose in this.

634
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:55,287
What?

635
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:59,333
You wicked little fox.

636
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:04,255
How come all my worries disappear
once I talk to you?

637
01:05:05,256 --> 01:05:06,716
Get up. You're going to be late.

638
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,512
My goodness. I wish I could
fold you up and carry you in my pocket.

639
01:05:11,595 --> 01:05:13,556
So that I can see you whenever I want.

640
01:05:13,931 --> 01:05:16,851
Don't go to the airport directly.
Stop by your house.

641
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:18,352
What's that?

642
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:20,688
It's your wife's birthday today.

643
01:05:22,773 --> 01:05:24,567
Do I really have to do this for you?

644
01:05:26,068 --> 01:05:28,571
You wicked little…

645
01:05:30,072 --> 01:05:32,074
See you when I get back.

646
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:39,874
<i>Be careful.</i>

647
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,335
I think Ms. Pi finds your room suspicious.

648
01:05:43,419 --> 01:05:46,964
What? Why would she?

649
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:50,885
I'm not sure.
Maybe because the cops barged in there.

650
01:05:50,968 --> 01:05:54,388
But she said nothing
in particular during the roll call.

651
01:05:56,182 --> 01:05:57,683
Are you that afraid of Ms. Pi?

652
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:04,273
But then, once you become her target,
it gets really scary. It's understandable.

653
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:07,777
INFORMATION

654
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,153
God, I'm sick of this.

655
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:11,197
I hope the spy gets caught soon.

656
01:06:20,122 --> 01:06:22,166
LEE GANG-MU

657
01:06:27,088 --> 01:06:30,216
They told me to call at this number
if I see someone suspicious.

658
01:06:31,717 --> 01:06:34,762
If the information is useful,
you get 50 million won.

659
01:06:41,435 --> 01:06:43,646
My monthly salary is only 55,000 won.

660
01:06:43,729 --> 01:06:48,484
If I get the reward,
I'll even be able to go to Berlin.

661
01:06:54,365 --> 01:06:55,658
Berlin.

662
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:58,577
-Oh, Berlin?
-Yes.

663
01:06:59,203 --> 01:07:00,704
But why there all of a sudden?

664
01:07:01,288 --> 01:07:02,832
My, didn't I tell you?

665
01:07:03,415 --> 01:07:06,544
Remember my partner
on the group blind date?

666
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:09,463
He's an economics graduate
at Berlin University.

667
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:12,591
He said he'd like me to visit him there.

668
01:07:13,217 --> 01:07:14,802
Maybe I will go.

669
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:21,976
God, I really wish I'd get that 50 million
to go to Berlin.

670
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:33,195
HOSU DRY CLEANING

671
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:41,620
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

672
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:45,666
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

673
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:49,044
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

674
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,005
I see.

675
01:07:54,925 --> 01:07:58,262
<i>You went on a blind date
and had other plans?</i>

676
01:07:58,762 --> 01:08:01,640
Gosh, that bastard. I'm sure he found out

677
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:03,017
that I wasn't a college girl.

678
01:08:08,772 --> 01:08:13,402
I mean, you're well-educated,
so you should contribute to society.

679
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:15,446
Why protest?

680
01:08:15,946 --> 01:08:20,201
What's the point of putting up a fight?
Only the weak get hurt.

681
01:08:20,284 --> 01:08:23,495
Do you have any idea
how worried your family gets?

682
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:28,667
I still think your brother is cool.

683
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,003
Cool, my foot.

684
01:08:37,343 --> 01:08:40,554
Are you saying you're cool too?

685
01:08:42,973 --> 01:08:44,934
Well, I get that a lot.

686
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:58,656
Then you must've gotten that necklace
from a woman.

687
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:01,450
What?

688
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:04,286
This?

689
01:09:14,088 --> 01:09:15,130
Yes.

690
01:09:23,347 --> 01:09:24,515
I see.

691
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:34,566
What's with me? I almost forgot
that I have to write a report.

692
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:37,903
I'll get going.

693
01:09:48,163 --> 01:09:52,293
DO NOT ENTER

694
01:10:13,564 --> 01:10:14,690
Yeong-ro.

695
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:17,860
Yeong-ro.

696
01:10:19,069 --> 01:10:20,529
You told me to wake you up.

697
01:10:20,612 --> 01:10:21,780
What?

698
01:10:22,823 --> 01:10:24,325
It's Sunday.

699
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:27,828
What about his breakfast?

700
01:10:36,795 --> 01:10:41,425
Didn't you buy that lunch box
to deliver meals to him?

701
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:55,189
Darn it.

702
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:21,840
Here.

703
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:27,679
Enjoy.

704
01:11:32,768 --> 01:11:36,897
Well, I'm still not done with my report.

705
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,440
And I need to clean my room.

706
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:41,110
It's Sunday, so I'm a bit busy.

707
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:09,388
Did you hear that?

708
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,597
-Did you hear that?
-Hush!

709
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:23,235
What's going on?

710
01:12:34,037 --> 01:12:36,165
It's nothing. Get back to studying.

711
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:39,084
KEEP QUIET

712
01:13:02,691 --> 01:13:04,109
God, it's so cold.

713
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:06,737
How much longer do we have to do this?

714
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:09,031
He's a legend for a reason.

715
01:13:09,323 --> 01:13:10,949
Until we catch that commie.

716
01:13:11,033 --> 01:13:13,035
But are you sure he's in there?

717
01:13:13,118 --> 01:13:14,119
That's enough.

718
01:13:22,461 --> 01:13:23,545
All clear, sir.

719
01:13:41,647 --> 01:13:43,857
Come take a look, please.

720
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:45,025
NOTICE
OPEN HOURS

721
01:13:45,108 --> 01:13:47,444
No. Come have a look.

722
01:13:47,736 --> 01:13:48,987
This one.

723
01:13:49,071 --> 01:13:52,407
NO MEN ALLOWED

724
01:13:52,491 --> 01:13:53,909
Hey, where are you going?

725
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:56,453
Can't you see? "No men allowed."

726
01:13:56,537 --> 01:13:59,331
So go. Go away.

727
01:14:00,165 --> 01:14:04,169
God, it's such a nuisance. Why do they
have to open the campus on Saturdays?

728
01:14:05,671 --> 01:14:07,339
-Hi!
-Where are you going?

729
01:14:07,422 --> 01:14:08,757
To eat <i>tteokbokki.</i>

730
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,884
-I see. Go enjoy it.
-See you.

731
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:13,971
NO MEN ALLOWED

732
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:15,847
Yeong-ro!

733
01:14:18,767 --> 01:14:19,685
Yeong-ro!

734
01:14:22,437 --> 01:14:23,772
Eun Yeong-ro!

735
01:14:30,237 --> 01:14:31,363
Yeong-u!

736
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:34,783
-Yeong-u!
-Yeong-u!

737
01:14:34,866 --> 01:14:36,201
My brother's here!

738
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:38,161
-Yeong-u!
-He's handsome.

739
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:42,541
Yeong-ro!

740
01:14:58,015 --> 01:14:59,558
Don't run. You'll fall.

741
01:15:04,438 --> 01:15:05,272
How have you been?

742
01:15:07,733 --> 01:15:08,734
Yeong-u!

743
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:12,821
How did you come here?
You said no visits or leaves.

744
01:15:12,904 --> 01:15:14,156
You know how.

745
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,949
I pulled some strings.

746
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:17,743
I felt a little guilty, though.

747
01:15:18,452 --> 01:15:21,580
Don't feel guilty about it,
and take advantage of it.

748
01:15:21,663 --> 01:15:25,042
See how happy your one and only sister is
to see you?

749
01:15:28,128 --> 01:15:29,880
Gosh. It's quite cold, isn't it?

750
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:35,302
It's nice.

751
01:15:35,886 --> 01:15:36,762
Is it warm?

752
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,686
Didn't you say
your brother couldn't take a leave?

753
01:15:51,109 --> 01:15:52,110
Well…

754
01:15:53,987 --> 01:15:55,155
He did.

755
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:57,115
My one and only brother.

756
01:15:58,825 --> 01:16:00,410
-I see.
-He's the most

757
01:16:00,494 --> 01:16:03,080
precious person in the world to me.

758
01:16:12,089 --> 01:16:14,758
When I cried
because my pet pigeon had died,

759
01:16:14,841 --> 01:16:17,636
you made a pigeon-shaped necklace for me.

760
01:16:18,553 --> 01:16:21,056
Saying it'd keep me safe forever.

761
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:24,351
LONG LIVE GREAT SUPREME LEADER

762
01:16:24,434 --> 01:16:26,853
This is the necklace I cherish the most.

763
01:16:28,271 --> 01:16:29,481
But I'm giving it to you.

764
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:36,238
You…

765
01:16:37,698 --> 01:16:39,241
must come back to the North.

766
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:45,247
My sister's
the most precious person in the world…

767
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,000
to me too.

768
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:53,046
Then is that necklace from…

769
01:16:53,964 --> 01:16:55,632
My sister Su-hui gave it to me.

770
01:16:56,216 --> 01:16:58,301
She said this pigeon will keep me safe.

771
01:16:59,928 --> 01:17:01,930
I didn't know that was a pigeon.

772
01:17:05,434 --> 01:17:08,228
All right. Your wound has been cleaned.

773
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:16,236
Thank you.

774
01:17:23,994 --> 01:17:26,204
So your sister's name is Su-hui?

775
01:17:27,914 --> 01:17:30,500
Yes. She's such a tomboy.

776
01:17:33,712 --> 01:17:36,131
Then what's your name?

777
01:17:39,593 --> 01:17:42,888
Oh, I can't believe
I haven't told you my name yet.

778
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:49,394
My name is Lim Soo-ho.

779
01:17:50,687 --> 01:17:52,647
Lim So-ho.

780
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:56,318
Lim So-ho.

781
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,447
As in "protecting my love"?

782
01:18:03,533 --> 01:18:07,746
Oh, then what's your German name?

783
01:18:09,372 --> 01:18:10,248
German name?

784
01:18:13,293 --> 01:18:15,670
<i>Beschütze deinen geliebten.</i>

785
01:18:18,799 --> 01:18:20,842
Be… Belly what?

786
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:22,385
Be…

787
01:18:32,437 --> 01:18:33,939
I should get going.

788
01:18:35,482 --> 01:18:36,858
Oh, no.

789
01:18:39,778 --> 01:18:40,737
Let me.

790
01:18:41,822 --> 01:18:43,865
Then I'll go wash this.

791
01:18:48,453 --> 01:18:50,163
What? Darn it.

792
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:21,695
A ghost using water?

793
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,883
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

794
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:46,803
Damn it.

795
01:19:49,264 --> 01:19:50,599
What are you doing?

796
01:19:51,349 --> 01:19:54,394
-What?
-What are you doing there?

797
01:19:54,477 --> 01:19:56,021
Just go your way.

798
01:19:56,104 --> 01:19:57,689
Eavesdropping?

799
01:20:08,325 --> 01:20:10,160
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

800
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:17,584
Do you have the key
to the room on the fourth floor?

801
01:20:19,002 --> 01:20:22,964
Yes, I do. But why do you ask?

802
01:20:23,048 --> 01:20:24,799
-Follow me.
-Pardon?

803
01:20:28,678 --> 01:20:30,388
Goodness, this is bad.

804
01:20:37,896 --> 01:20:39,439
NO MEN ALLOWED

805
01:20:40,607 --> 01:20:42,776
I'll be easily seen by the cops,
so not that way.

806
01:20:42,859 --> 01:20:44,319
How about basement level two?

807
01:20:44,778 --> 01:20:49,616
The mechanical room
and Man-dong's room are there.

808
01:20:50,325 --> 01:20:52,243
Any way out from basement level two?

809
01:20:52,911 --> 01:20:54,245
I don't think there is.

810
01:20:54,829 --> 01:20:58,458
When I was running late for roll call,
I failed to find a door to the basement.

811
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:00,752
And my roommates said there isn't any.

812
01:21:01,252 --> 01:21:03,630
So the only way out is the main gate?

813
01:21:03,713 --> 01:21:06,049
Yes. I'm afraid so.

814
01:21:17,936 --> 01:21:19,771
To the right is the staircase.

815
01:21:19,854 --> 01:21:23,400
This staircase is
the only way to the rooftop.

816
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:32,200
And no one even goes near this attic.

817
01:21:32,617 --> 01:21:34,703
Because of the spooky story about it.

818
01:21:48,174 --> 01:21:49,300
And this attic--

819
01:22:06,484 --> 01:22:07,652
DO NOT ENTER

820
01:22:23,084 --> 01:22:24,085
Well, I'll…

821
01:22:28,423 --> 01:22:29,549
DO NOT ENTER

822
01:22:42,771 --> 01:22:47,609
Why would you want to check
this place this late at night?

823
01:22:49,235 --> 01:22:51,571
God, it's so dusty here.

824
01:22:54,074 --> 01:22:56,409
Goodness. My legs hurt.

825
01:23:01,664 --> 01:23:02,665
Oh, no.

826
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:16,304
Open it.

827
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,067
<i>There's water on the bathroom floor.</i>

828
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:31,820
<i>Ms. Pi raided this place last night.</i>

829
01:23:31,903 --> 01:23:34,948
<i>I heard water leaked from there.
It's never happened before.</i>

830
01:23:35,448 --> 01:23:36,741
You're hiding something from me.

831
01:23:36,825 --> 01:23:38,201
I need to get out today.

832
01:23:38,284 --> 01:23:40,370
<i>The open house is in a few days.</i>

833
01:23:40,453 --> 01:23:43,873
<i>Male students can enter the dorm that day.</i>

834
01:23:43,957 --> 01:23:46,417
<i>Oh Gwang-tae. Let's talk about Soo-ho.</i>

835
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:48,837
<i>Why are you so desperate
to get Taedong River 1?</i>

836
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,007
<i>That damn communist.
I'll call you as soon as I see him!</i>

837
01:23:55,218 --> 01:23:57,387
<i>Are you crazy? Why did you come in here?</i>

838
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:58,888
<i>Gwang-tae is here.</i>

839
01:24:00,557 --> 01:24:01,808
Those little…

840
01:24:01,891 --> 01:24:04,185
<i>It's safer for you two to go together.</i>

841
01:24:04,269 --> 01:24:06,146
<i>Sir! He showed up.</i>

842
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:07,605
<i>I'm sorry. It's my fault.</i>

843
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:11,609
<i>Who are you really?</i>

844
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:17,782
BONUS

845
01:24:18,616 --> 01:24:20,702
Gyeok-chan, if you accomplish the mission

846
01:24:20,785 --> 01:24:23,454
and are named a hero,
what do you want to do?

847
01:24:25,874 --> 01:24:28,293
What about you, Geum-cheol?

848
01:24:29,294 --> 01:24:30,128
Well,

849
01:24:30,795 --> 01:24:34,591
I really want to drive downtown Pyongyang
with my mother next to me.

850
01:24:34,674 --> 01:24:36,009
That's my wish.

851
01:24:37,135 --> 01:24:39,012
What about you?

852
01:24:41,848 --> 01:24:43,808
I want to go back to my hometown

853
01:24:44,809 --> 01:24:48,021
and hold my sister Su-hui's child
as soon as possible.

854
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:52,609
It'll all go well, right?

855
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:57,071
