ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:08,173
EPISODE 15

3
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:18,433
We're all going to get out alive, right?

4
00:01:24,522 --> 00:01:27,358
I'm relieved that my dad will be able

5
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,904
to make up even a little
for what he did to my friends.

6
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:43,124
I thought about it,

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,007
and it's too dangerous
for you to stay with me until the end.

8
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:08,816
Soo-ho, I'll stay by your side
until the end.

9
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:21,162
By the way,

10
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:26,209
where are you going to go?

11
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:47,897
We will…

12
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:53,361
meet again, right?

13
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:14,757
Don't worry.

14
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,052
As long as we're alive,

15
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,224
we will…

16
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,687
meet again someday.

17
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,469
When we meet again…

18
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,645
I promise

19
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,981
I'll give you this necklace back.

20
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,574
<i>Send the SWAT team into the dorm.</i>

21
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,160
Without anyone finding out,

22
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,747
get my daughter out of there.

23
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:14,127
Even if you have to break her legs.

24
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,754
You must

25
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,507
get her out.

26
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,552
And as soon as she's out,

27
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,932
blow up the dorm.

28
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,601
Honey, about the 13 people.

29
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,353
That's 13 people.

30
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:40,027
I know. I know I'm being absurd
asking you to do this.

31
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:44,991
But I'd do anything
to make you the President.

32
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:47,618
Have you already forgotten?

33
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,126
Nam Tae-il tried to kill you.

34
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,216
First,

35
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,386
let's reassure them

36
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,847
by turning the dorm's power back on.

37
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:11,476
And I'll go to the camp

38
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:15,229
and blow up the dorm myself.

39
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,355
Understood, sir.

40
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,191
And sir,

41
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,237
Mr. Nam's been taken to the agency.

42
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,240
Nam, why?

43
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:32,079
<i>Back in my KCIA days,</i>

44
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:36,876
we used to even arrest
and torture incumbent assemblymen.

45
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,711
Just because

46
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:41,255
our agency was renamed to the ANSP

47
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:43,799
doesn't mean we can't torture

48
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:46,844
or even kill
the ruling party's Secretary-General.

49
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:48,679
Whether you torture

50
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:50,890
or kill me,

51
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:53,059
let's talk alone.

52
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,645
I'm still Nam Tae-il,
the general who used to lead armies!

53
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:00,733
Guys!

54
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,652
Our intrepid general

55
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,112
doesn't want to lose face.

56
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,668
Listen, Chief An.

57
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,215
You know our peckers just do what they do.

58
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:27,385
I had no idea that teasing wench

59
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:29,428
was a Northern spy.

60
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,976
According to
the National Security Law 4-2,

61
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:37,979
you should be sentenced
to death or life in prison!

62
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:39,313
Come on.

63
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,941
You know we're almost there.
We're about to win.

64
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,653
You and I must work together
to help the government regain power

65
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:49,824
and secure peace and prosperity back
to our country, the Republic of Korea!

66
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,244
You and I must work together?

67
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,370
That's right.

68
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,921
Didn't you use to call me a dung fly?

69
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,675
How could a dung fly

70
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:09,927
and a tiger work together?

71
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:13,973
Come on.

72
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,935
Don't you know a dung fly is
stronger than a tiger?

73
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:21,772
If a dung fly flies
towards a tiger's nose,

74
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,316
the tiger hits

75
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,404
his own face with its paws
to try to catch the dung fly,

76
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:32,742
and it ends up with deep wounds
made by its own claws!

77
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,163
Listen to this bastard.

78
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:42,668
So are you saying

79
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,379
I'll still be a dung fly no matter what?

80
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,759
My God! My back…

81
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:53,721
My back hurts.

82
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:58,809
No, that's not what I meant!

83
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:00,728
Mr. An.

84
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:05,274
I'm sure you've heard
of the Lord of the Flies. Right?

85
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,193
The Lord of the Flies!

86
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:11,113
I'm saying you're the man in power!

87
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:16,077
This bastard…

88
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,994
What?

89
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,371
The Lord of the Flies?

90
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:20,706
Mr. An.

91
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,208
Your wife says it's urgent.

92
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,843
Hey. I'm quite busy
interrogating Nam Tae-il. What is it?

93
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,472
<i>Didn't you say you checked
with ABK Partners about Linda Young?</i>

94
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,183
But they say she's never been to Seoul!

95
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,769
Didn't you check? Are you an idiot?

96
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,188
She's never been to Seoul?

97
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:46,774
I only checked if there was a Linda Young.

98
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:50,194
And the fortuneteller vanished
into thin air, that charlatan!

99
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:52,988
<i>What do we do now? We're doomed!</i>

100
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:54,949
Vanished into thin air?

101
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,576
What about the money?

102
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,787
What happened to the company funds?

103
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:03,332
Call the Airport District right now.

104
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,334
-Yes, sir.
-What does Linda Young look like?

105
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,128
Tell me now!

106
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,341
The company funds?

107
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,475
Moran Hill 1 intercepted the money

108
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,853
the South was going to send us.

109
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:25,896
And the ANSP found out her identity.

110
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,192
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: CHONGCHON RIVER

111
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:33,279
"Kang Cheong-ya
would never betray the party"?

112
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:37,116
As if your son was not enough,
and now Kang Cheong-ya?

113
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:40,953
If we won't be able to get the money,

114
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,329
it's all on you!

115
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:52,131
Instruct Chongchon River
to kill Lim Soo-ho right away!

116
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,718
Tell him now

117
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:59,430
we will guarantee his family's safety
if he kills that bastard.

118
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,697
<i>Eliminate Lim Soo-ho.</i>

119
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:19,158
<i>Your family's safety guaranteed.</i>

120
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:43,432
Comrade Joo, what did the party say?

121
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:46,644
There's no way they haven't replied yet.

122
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:49,730
Comrade Joo!

123
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:55,319
"Message well received.

124
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:57,905
Maintain the status quo."

125
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:09,708
MESSAGE WELL RECEIVED.
MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO.

126
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:33,482
Now that they've received the message,
Lim Ji-rok will be dismissed, right?

127
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,234
Most likely.

128
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:39,864
Then they're not going
to kill your sister today.

129
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:43,701
But Comrade Kang's run off
with the money. What do we do now?

130
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:52,918
Eun Chang-su

131
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:57,464
has offered to help us
flee to another country safely.

132
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,845
-What do you guys think?
-Are you insane?

133
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,264
How can we trust him?

134
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:06,891
We can't.

135
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:11,520
We shouldn't trust him,
but we can use his offer to our advantage.

136
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:14,189
The election is in five days.

137
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,526
If we stay here like this, in five days…

138
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,863
we'll all die.

139
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,912
If you guys decide to stay here,
I will too.

140
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:29,413
But…

141
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,625
if you think

142
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:36,545
your family will be safe if you die here,
you're mistaken.

143
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:42,676
We must live

144
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:45,846
to find a way to save our families.

145
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:50,225
I will do as you say, Comrade Lim.

146
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,336
<i>Stand by at the hideout
and kill Moran Hill 1 if she comes.</i>

147
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:24,468
Have you seen this person?

148
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,261
-It's a woman.
-It is.

149
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:29,264
-Look closely.
-Okay. Have you seen her?

150
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,895
TAEGEUK HARDWARE STORE

151
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,769
<i>The North told Soo-ho
they'd kill his sister if he doesn't</i>

152
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,480
blow up the hostages and himself
by midnight.

153
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:02,816
So you must get back in!

154
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:13,470
In any case,

155
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:18,308
it's a relief that we've saved
your sister from Lim Ji-rok.

156
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:25,357
It's too early to be relieved.

157
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,653
The dorm must blow up at midnight

158
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,074
as if we've blown ourselves up
for the North to be completely fooled.

159
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:38,745
And we need Eun Chang-su
to tell the North we've killed ourselves.

160
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:41,874
But will he?

161
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:47,337
I doubt Eun's put aside
his desire for power in this situation.

162
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,760
If only Kang Cheong-ya came back…

163
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,015
We shouldn't have trusted her.

164
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,689
Anyway,

165
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:09,109
if Eun is pretending
to have changed his mind,

166
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,615
he'll kill or take the hostages
to the ANSP even if they're released.

167
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,244
I don't know if this can stop it,

168
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,914
but once the cameras are set up,
Gal is released,

169
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,584
<i>and the parents have arrived,
release all the hostages.</i>

170
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,337
<i>Once all of them are out,</i>

171
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:31,965
<i>my agents and I will get out
with Yeong-ro.</i>

172
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,345
Release them?

173
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,640
Then they'll tell people
that I helped the spies.

174
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:45,145
Darn it.

175
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:50,234
A foreign woman in her 30s.

176
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:51,985
Blonde hair and about 170cm tall.

177
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,614
Tell Airport Security and Customs.
We must catch her!

178
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,495
<i>This is Gye Bun-ok.</i>

179
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,747
Now of all times?

180
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:05,540
What is it?

181
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,877
The spies are planning
to release the hostages.

182
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,380
<i>You know I'm anti-communist to the bone.</i>

183
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:15,217
I'm the one who told you
that Kang Cheong-ya is a Northern spy!

184
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:18,679
Listen carefully.

185
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:22,099
If you contact me again,

186
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,769
I will kill you.

187
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,980
So keep your mouth shut and wait.
Understood?

188
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,943
That damn bastard.

189
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,778
Mr. An!

190
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:42,327
We've found out that Kang Cheong-ya made
an international call from her house.

191
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:46,290
It was to Swiss BR Bank's Tokyo branch.

192
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:49,710
Swiss BR Bank? Kang Cheong-ya called them?

193
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:52,629
Then Linda was…

194
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:58,343
Linda?

195
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:04,099
That damn bastard. He found out
about Kang Cheong-ya thanks to me.

196
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,937
Did you tell him…

197
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:15,360
that Kang is a Northern spy
with that radio?

198
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,657
What is it? You've spied for the ANSP,

199
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,951
but you don't approve of others doing it?

200
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,746
-You have no idea what he's--
-I know he's powerful.

201
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,998
I don't care if he's ANSP or not,

202
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:31,543
as long as he's capable of helping me.

203
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:37,924
I told you not to dare
to think about only saving your skin.

204
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:41,928
What's so wrong with that?

205
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,266
What can you do to end this anyway?

206
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,936
You can't even save one person,
so stop lecturing me.

207
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:52,022
It's starting to bug me.

208
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,779
Gye Bun-ok! Give me that radio.

209
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:02,532
Give me the radio.

210
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:05,786
Give me the radio now!

211
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:08,747
Darn it.

212
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:32,437
Do you even know what you've done?

213
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,398
Kang Cheong-ya should've come back--

214
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,571
Do you know my sister?

215
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:49,329
This is Yeon-ok, my older sister.

216
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,042
How do you two know each other?

217
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:58,422
We met abroad. That's all.

218
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,507
Why did you keep it from me?

219
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:02,884
You must've met in Germany.

220
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,597
You knew I was her sister all along,
didn't you?

221
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:10,809
Why did you pretend not to know?

222
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:12,644
Because she spied for the North?

223
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,813
No.

224
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:18,024
You knew about that from the start.

225
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:20,402
You still hired me.

226
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:33,874
Don't tell me…

227
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,422
Are you a Northern spy like my sister?

228
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,716
No.

229
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,303
Your sister and I never spied
for the North!

230
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:50,682
What do you mean?

231
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,354
What do you mean by that? Tell me!

232
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:00,317
Keep it down.

233
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:04,654
All of us getting out safely
is more important right now.

234
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:08,241
My smart sister Yeon-ok was a traitor

235
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:10,994
who studied in Germany
on a government scholarship

236
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:14,581
but fell head over heels for some commie
and even went to Pyongyang.

237
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:16,124
That's what they said.

238
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,501
That's not true!

239
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:18,835
It was

240
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,172
Professor Choi Seong-muk
who went to Pyongyang, not that man.

241
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:25,592
He was accused of espionage only
because he was the professor's student!

242
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:28,094
That was the only reason the young man,

243
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:30,889
who was against the dictatorship,
was framed!

244
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:36,728
How do you know so well
about my sister's boyfriend?

245
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,064
Because he was my fiancé.

246
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:53,745
Are you satisfied?

247
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,249
Don't try to only save your own skin.

248
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:02,128
You don't care as long as he's powerful
enough to help you? But you know what?

249
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:06,383
He's the one who tortured your sister.

250
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,391
He's the one who tortured and drove her…

251
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,519
to suicide.

252
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:53,346
Why do you keep running to the kitchen
after saying you'd go to the restroom?

253
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,266
My goodness. I already told you.

254
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:58,393
I have to go cook chicken soup.

255
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:01,396
He must be hungry.

256
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:04,065
Fine, okay. Just sit down.

257
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:05,400
-Sit.
-Goodness.

258
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:06,484
Stay seated.

259
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,823
Don't tie too tightly.

260
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:15,869
Hush!

261
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:18,580
Hey, it hurts!

262
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:20,582
This is

263
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,585
all your doing, isn't it?

264
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:29,799
The ruling party's Secretary-General
working with his mistress

265
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:32,052
to siphon off the ANSP's secret funds?

266
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:40,018
If candidate Park Mu-yeol wins
the presidential election

267
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,854
and this grand scandal breaks…

268
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:47,817
that'll bring down Code 1 at once,
won't it?

269
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:50,487
Then, candidate Park would be elated.

270
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:52,030
I mean,

271
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:54,949
he really wants to get rid of Code 1
who has too much power.

272
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:55,867
Isn't that it?

273
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:57,494
That must be it.

274
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:11,007
I guess you've learned many things
working in the agency.

275
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:14,761
Scheming, buck-passing,
and framing people without evidence.

276
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,473
You live up to your reputation.
That's fantastic.

277
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,813
You think it's funny?

278
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:28,983
How about I work on you
to really live up to my reputation?

279
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:34,364
Look,

280
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:36,616
Dung Fly.

281
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:44,165
Don't ever aspire to become the President.

282
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:49,587
A punk like you who doesn't use money
for politics and keeps it for himself

283
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:51,506
should never be a politician.

284
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:56,469
You're a master at framing people.

285
00:26:56,553 --> 00:27:00,140
You must be planning to frame me for this
and take the credit.

286
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,852
You reckless punk.

287
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:08,022
You dare touch Code 1's money?

288
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:11,484
He won't even send you to prison.

289
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:15,572
He'll probably cut off all your limbs
while you're alive and grind you up.

290
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:19,534
Wait, no. That's been done before.
He hates copying others.

291
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,619
Since he's an animal lover,

292
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:26,499
he'll probably throw your wife and kids
to crocodiles without anyone knowing.

293
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,172
Well, I just…

294
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:38,887
tried to increase the amount
as a person in charge of his safe.

295
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,555
You idiot!

296
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:52,942
Will you drag me into this
and plunge into deep water,

297
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:56,237
or will you join hands with me
and soar into the sky again?

298
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:10,210
Mr. Nam, please save me.

299
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:12,796
If you do, my life is yours.

300
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:18,218
Uncuff me first, you bastard.

301
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,735
Kang Cheong-ya…

302
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:38,238
What will you do about her?

303
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:42,408
I'll get rid of all the evidence
related to her!

304
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:51,292
Let me slap you just once.

305
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:04,055
Thank you, sir.

306
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:06,808
-How's it going at the scene?
-There's nothing-- No.

307
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:10,311
The spies say
they'll release the hostages.

308
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:11,646
What?

309
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:14,065
But they all know
Cheong-ya is a Northern spy!

310
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,817
God damn it!

311
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,402
Mr. Nam.

312
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,780
Mr. Nam.

313
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:22,448
When is Mr. Nam coming?

314
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:24,117
I can't reach him.

315
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,326
Where's the detonator?

316
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:26,911
The detonator!

317
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:28,913
You bastards.

318
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:32,000
They're planning to release the hostages,
but you're eating noodles?

319
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,167
Get him the detonator!

320
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:34,836
Before the hostages are released!

321
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:38,631
-Hurry up!
-Be careful.

322
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,043
Captain.

323
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:15,960
Yes, sir.

324
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:19,714
At 22:00 sharp, we will blow up the dorm.

325
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,215
Get it ready.

326
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:23,676
Yes, sir.

327
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:06,219
<i>At 22:00 sharp, we will blow up the dorm.</i>

328
00:31:06,302 --> 00:31:09,639
<i>All units, evacuate. I repeat.</i>

329
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:12,600
<i>At 22:00 sharp, we will blow up the dorm.</i>

330
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,144
<i>All units, evacuate.</i>

331
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,215
What are you doing? It's dangerous.

332
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:52,932
There are no cameras.

333
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:55,476
And there are no parents.

334
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:59,605
I haven't heard from your father yet
that he arrived.

335
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:02,984
Right?

336
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:06,988
It's because my dad hasn't come yet that
there's no sign of any of them, right?

337
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:11,325
The dorm must blow up at midnight

338
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,745
to save your sister.

339
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:22,628
Don't worry.

340
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:26,049
Nothing's going to happen
to my sister tonight.

341
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:30,511
Really?

342
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:56,287
I'm finally accomplishing my mission.

343
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,757
Put your gun down.

344
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:15,473
Put your gun down.

345
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,251
Comrade Joo.

346
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:47,046
Your target is me, not Yeong-ro.

347
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,383
Let her go up to the second floor.

348
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:52,885
They're all going to die anyway.

349
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:55,096
You'll kill the hostages
and blow yourself up?

350
00:33:55,888 --> 00:33:57,265
If you die that way,

351
00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:00,560
you think you'll be awarded
the Hero of the Republic?

352
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:05,565
My mother will be safe at least.

353
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:07,942
You should be the one
keeping your mother safe.

354
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:12,071
You must stay alive no matter what
and find a way to save her.

355
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:13,948
The party's abandoned us.

356
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:17,326
You think they'll look after her?

357
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,828
It's all your fault.

358
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:21,247
You ruined everything!

359
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,291
-If only you hadn't come here--
-Shut up!

360
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,253
You're the one who disobeyed me
and followed me here.

361
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:28,671
No!

362
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:34,510
I was just following the orders
to keep a close eye on you.

363
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:39,182
On whose orders?

364
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:43,769
Who ordered you to keep a close eye on me?

365
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,821
And my superior ordered to kill you
this time too.

366
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:57,825
What?

367
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:08,377
Goodbye, Lim Soo-ho.

368
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:34,987
Comrade Kang.

369
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:49,794
What time is it?

370
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:05,059
All units, stand by.

371
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:06,560
All units, stand by.

372
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:13,484
Mr. Nam Tae-il!

373
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,519
After deceiving the whole country
pretending you were about to die,

374
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:51,230
you come here walking on your own?

375
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:52,565
Are you disappointed?

376
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:55,609
You should've had a better sniper do it.

377
00:36:57,903 --> 00:36:58,738
Arrest him.

378
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,579
Don't come any closer.

379
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:10,333
Don't come closer! This is the detonator.
They all die if I press this.

380
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:20,634
Chief An.

381
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,846
What the hell are you doing?

382
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:28,434
He's violated the Military Secret
Protection Law and National Security Law.

383
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:29,602
He's a criminal.

384
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,188
Do you have proof?

385
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:36,317
Show me the evidence
that I violated those!

386
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,569
How shameless.

387
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:41,864
Kang Cheong-ya,
your personal doctor, is a Northern spy!

388
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:42,907
You little…

389
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,075
Ms. Hong.

390
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:46,702
We looked into that.

391
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:47,995
And we didn't…

392
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,752
find any evidence of Dr. Kang being a spy.

393
00:37:54,835 --> 00:37:55,669
Bingo!

394
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,299
This is

395
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:03,177
slander!

396
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:09,350
He's been loyally serving the country.

397
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,602
But he did what with a commie?

398
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:14,271
That's just wrong!

399
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:16,399
That's just absurd!

400
00:38:16,982 --> 00:38:19,402
-What are you doing here?
-What happened to the 300 million?

401
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:21,153
Look, Ms. Cho Seong-sim.

402
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:22,863
You can't just deny it.

403
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,949
The truth will be revealed eventually.

404
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:26,742
Did you see it?

405
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:28,744
Do you have proof?

406
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:31,831
Lower your guns.

407
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:33,207
Now!

408
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:36,669
How dare you! He's the former Army Chief
of Staff's son-in-law!

409
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:41,257
How dare you point a gun
at the ruling party's Secretary-General?

410
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:43,592
Honey!

411
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:46,303
Arrest all of them for defamation.

412
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:48,597
Lower your guns, you bastards! Now!

413
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:51,183
Lower it! Yes. Now!

414
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:53,436
Damn you!

415
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:56,230
<i>Honey.</i>

416
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:01,068
<i>It's me, Cheong-ya.</i>

417
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:04,155
<i>You're listening, right?</i>

418
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:18,461
You see,

419
00:39:18,544 --> 00:39:22,214
<i>I took a secret Swiss bank account
that has 300 million dollars in it</i>

420
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:26,260
and came back into the dorm with it.

421
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:32,057
<i>So if you blow up the dorm, honey,</i>

422
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,186
this money will be gone too.

423
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:41,692
<i>Well, if you don't care,
go ahead and press the detonator.</i>

424
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,201
<i>We promised to go to the Maldives
for vacation. I'm sorry I can't go.</i>

425
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:53,913
<i>Honey, I love you.</i>

426
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,544
That cunning whore!

427
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,464
Honey, don't be fooled!

428
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,592
She's trying to drag us down with her!

429
00:40:07,092 --> 00:40:09,637
It wasn't me
who lost the 300 million dollars.

430
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,765
It was him! An Gyeong-hui lost it.

431
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:15,518
What? Are you seriously doing this?

432
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,395
What? Are you stabbing me in the back?

433
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:20,727
Everyone heard it, right?
"I love you."

434
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:22,441
"Honey, I love you."

435
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:25,277
You little bastard, how dare you!

436
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:28,614
Didn't you hear
she's trying to drag us down!

437
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:32,034
What do you mean, "little bastard"?

438
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:35,913
I know you're very shocked
by your husband's affair,

439
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:37,748
but you're way out of line!

440
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:42,753
Hey! You took a bribe of a 5-carat
diamond ring from Kang Cheong-ya.

441
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:46,006
You're the one
who gave her the 300 million dollars.

442
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,591
How shameless!

443
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:52,388
That's right. They're the ones
guilty of espionage!

444
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:57,101
You might make up
my son's birthday at this rate. Hey!

445
00:40:57,768 --> 00:41:00,813
We're suffering
because your husband had an affair

446
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:02,439
with a Northern spy!

447
00:41:02,523 --> 00:41:04,942
We were only trying to make an investment

448
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,235
for our country!

449
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:08,904
For our country, my foot.

450
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:11,365
Shut your trap, will you?

451
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,492
What are you guys waiting for?

452
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:14,868
Arrest all of them!

453
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:18,038
Be quiet, woman!
How dare you order them around?

454
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,542
Han-na.

455
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:24,003
Get rid of them.

456
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:26,463
No, you won't!

457
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:27,590
Look.

458
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:30,259
You got shot trying
to rescue your daughter

459
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:33,012
who fell for a damn commie.
Don't pin this on me!

460
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:37,182
I've always been loyal to our country.
I've done nothing wrong!

461
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:41,478
I have nothing to be ashamed of
before our country and people!

462
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:46,400
God damn it.

463
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,826
What?

464
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,209
-No!
-No!

465
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:18,474
My God! You!

466
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:05,396
You bastard.

467
00:43:06,313 --> 00:43:07,940
I'll kill you.

468
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:11,235
You bastard.

469
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:14,113
-Let go of me!
-Stop it.

470
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:16,615
Can't you see how he beat me up?

471
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:19,702
He even tried to kill you.
Why are you treating his wound?

472
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:22,121
That's enough.

473
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,629
That's enough. Eung-cheol.

474
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:33,799
Look at me, Eung-cheol.

475
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:36,760
Eung-cheol.

476
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:43,934
Now that Comrade Kang's here
with the 300 million dollars,

477
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:47,396
we should focus on getting out alive.

478
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:51,608
With that money, we'll be able to rescue

479
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:54,069
our families in the North.

480
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:03,036
If you run with the money,
do you think the party will let you live?

481
00:44:03,912 --> 00:44:06,623
They will hunt down you traitors

482
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:09,918
and kill you mercilessly.

483
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:13,589
You goddamn bastard. I'll kill you.

484
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:14,715
All right.

485
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:17,009
We'll leave him here.

486
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:21,430
No.

487
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:24,725
Leave him here.

488
00:44:30,981 --> 00:44:34,526
You… Do you really want to die in here?

489
00:44:37,112 --> 00:44:39,198
You and I are in the same boat.

490
00:44:40,824 --> 00:44:43,410
You want to die here
and be displayed to people?

491
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,038
And if your body is humiliated,

492
00:44:47,372 --> 00:44:49,166
our country will look the other way.

493
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:51,710
They won't do anything.

494
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:56,590
Because they can't admit
to the presidential election scheme.

495
00:45:02,471 --> 00:45:05,015
If you kill Soo-ho as ordered,

496
00:45:08,268 --> 00:45:10,938
do you think
Choi Su-ryeon will take care of you?

497
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:13,023
Do you?

498
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:19,947
To her, you are…

499
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:26,787
nothing but a pawn on her chessboard.

500
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:39,883
Choi Su-ryeon?

501
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:45,305
The deputy director of the MSS
is Comrade Joo's superior.

502
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,271
You mean…

503
00:45:53,146 --> 00:45:55,816
the daughter of Choi Du-ik,
the former Minister of PAF?

504
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,029
Do you know her?

505
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:27,806
You must be dying to bring me down.

506
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:32,644
If I give you a present before I leave,

507
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:35,856
then I guess we'll be even. Right?

508
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:57,961
What are you trying to pull?

509
00:46:58,837 --> 00:47:01,048
Whenever I look at this painting,

510
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:03,175
I am

511
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:05,802
reminded of you.

512
00:47:06,428 --> 00:47:09,598
"Saturn Devouring…"
I don't remember the name.

513
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:14,895
Lim Soo-ho

514
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:19,816
that you've ordered to kill.

515
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:27,282
I picked him up off the street
18 years ago.

516
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:31,954
And his sister who was about to die.

517
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:39,753
Do you know who he really is?

518
00:47:40,837 --> 00:47:45,926
He's Lee Tae-san,
the son you abandoned to climb the ladder.

519
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:54,059
If you want to save your son,

520
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,939
don't even dream
of removing me from my position.

521
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:02,484
Haegeumseong 1 is in the dorm,

522
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:04,236
so if I say the word,

523
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,947
having your son killed

524
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:09,741
is a piece of cake for me.

525
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:17,374
Send Haegeumseong 1 a message right now

526
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:20,127
and tell them to kill Soo-ho right away.

527
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:28,260
You must be mistaken.

528
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:30,679
My son Lee Tae-san

529
00:48:30,762 --> 00:48:33,181
died 18 years ago.

530
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:36,351
To serve our Supreme Leader with my life,

531
00:48:36,977 --> 00:48:39,187
I abandoned my reactionary husband

532
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:41,898
and all my children.

533
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:45,652
So Lim Soo-ho is your son,

534
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:47,070
not mine.

535
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:49,114
The reactionary who betrayed the country

536
00:48:49,197 --> 00:48:51,533
and took the lead
in stealing our 300 million dollars

537
00:48:51,616 --> 00:48:53,076
with Kang Cheong-ya!

538
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:55,579
And since you're his father,

539
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:59,166
you must be held solely responsible
for this.

540
00:49:07,174 --> 00:49:08,258
Choi Su-ryeon speaking.

541
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:11,219
Understood.

542
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,602
Arrest Lim Ji-rok right now.

543
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:47,422
<i>Mother!</i>

544
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:55,722
From now on,
your mother is the Workers' Party,

545
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:57,140
not me!

546
00:49:57,641 --> 00:50:01,895
Forget the name Choi Su-ryeon. Understand?

547
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,069
<i>Mother!</i>

548
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:46,731
You made the kid

549
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:50,944
you picked up off the street
into a sharp knife to kill me,

550
00:50:51,778 --> 00:50:52,863
but too bad.

551
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:56,533
You stabbed me,
but I didn't shed a drop of blood.

552
00:50:57,492 --> 00:50:58,660
You're right.

553
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:01,955
The biggest mistake in my life

554
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:05,250
was considering you human.

555
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:07,961
As you told me,

556
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:10,589
I sent a message to Haegeumseong 1.

557
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,843
Lim Soo-ho will be killed soon.

558
00:51:16,636 --> 00:51:17,512
Take him!

559
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:33,463
Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon…

560
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:36,716
You know her, don't you?

561
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,260
No.

562
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:43,390
I don't know her.

563
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:03,576
I didn't think you'd really come back.

564
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,168
What's the point
of running with the money?

565
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:16,631
I'll always be chased by someone

566
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:20,010
trying to kill me.

567
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:25,974
That will be like living in a cage.

568
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:30,312
But if it's inevitable,

569
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:34,941
I thought two would be better than one.

570
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,967
We must take
Eung-cheol and Gyeok-chan too.

571
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:04,888
I can't abandon them like our country did.

572
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:12,562
Did you think
I'd ask you to leave alone with me?

573
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:33,875
With this certificate and password,

574
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:36,127
you can withdraw this money too.

575
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:38,838
And the password is…

576
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:45,053
the date we spent the night together
in that foxhole.

577
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:10,120
I've scouted a ship to stow away on.

578
00:55:11,538 --> 00:55:14,165
A cargo ship departing
from Pyeongtaek Port at 2 a.m.

579
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:16,960
At 2 a.m.?

580
00:55:18,169 --> 00:55:19,629
But that's too tight.

581
00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:24,300
I should go call Eun Chang-su first.

582
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:04,424
Nam Tae-il's been arrested.

583
00:56:04,507 --> 00:56:06,259
And Gal will be released soon.

584
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:09,679
Han-na's on her way to the agency
to pick him up.

585
00:56:09,762 --> 00:56:10,805
That's good.

586
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:13,933
It's not bad for us
that Eun Chang-su took over.

587
00:56:17,937 --> 00:56:18,980
Anyway…

588
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:20,982
What's wrong with you?

589
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:23,318
If you were going to come back,

590
00:56:23,943 --> 00:56:26,237
why did you knock Han-na out and run?

591
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,243
If you were so worried about her,

592
00:56:32,327 --> 00:56:34,829
you shouldn't have had her
do such a dangerous job.

593
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:39,000
Why did you have her tail me
and complicate things?

594
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,591
We must leave by midnight no matter what.

595
00:56:46,674 --> 00:56:50,970
Let's tell Ms. Pi to prepare to release
the hostages as soon as Gal arrives.

596
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:52,180
Okay.

597
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:07,820
We should use the 300 million dollars
as bait to get out of here.

598
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:17,038
As soon as Han-na arrives at the agency,
lock her in the interrogation room.

599
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:20,750
And do not let her meet Gal.

600
00:57:21,459 --> 00:57:22,460
Yes.

601
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:32,512
It's me.

602
00:57:32,595 --> 00:57:36,266
If you open the way for us
to leave for another country safely,

603
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:39,561
<i>we will pay you 300 million dollars
for sparing our lives.</i>

604
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:44,691
In return,

605
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:48,820
<i>tell the North that you've killed us
and retrieved the money.</i>

606
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:52,991
It's a win-win.
The North will not chase us.

607
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:56,119
<i>And you'll be able to pay the North
the 300 million dollars.</i>

608
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:59,372
You'll be the one
making the scheme a success.

609
00:58:00,915 --> 00:58:01,874
What do you say?

610
00:58:02,834 --> 00:58:04,127
All right.

611
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:09,007
Okay. For you guys to leave safely,

612
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,093
<i>I'll have the SWAT team back off</i>

613
00:58:12,176 --> 00:58:13,761
<i>and get a car ready.</i>

614
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:16,180
Come out through the shrine
in five minutes.

615
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:19,892
We'll leave after releasing
all of the hostages.

616
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:23,646
So set up cameras
in front of the main gate

617
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:25,565
and bring the parents now.

618
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:30,528
But the situation has changed
since you intercepted the money.

619
00:58:31,446 --> 00:58:36,534
<i>The President has ordered to send in
the SWAT team to capture you right away.</i>

620
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:38,995
So I need some time

621
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:41,748
to persuade him.

622
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,127
I'll give you until midnight.

623
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,378
<i>I can't give you more.</i>

624
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:48,838
In return,

625
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:51,924
when you release the hostages,

626
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:54,802
release my daughter too.

627
00:58:57,764 --> 00:59:00,350
<i>Now that you have 300 million
in your possession,</i>

628
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:03,603
<i>you don't need
to keep holding her hostage.</i>

629
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:08,274
Fine.

630
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:11,944
I'll release her with the others.

631
00:59:13,696 --> 00:59:18,117
At 00:00 sharp,
come out through the shrine.

632
00:59:31,756 --> 00:59:32,840
Yes, sir.

633
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:06,749
Where did I put my lawbook?

634
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:08,876
Come on, Gyeong-ja.

635
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:12,088
Get it together.
You can't pass the bar like this.

636
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,010
Where did I put the book?
It must be in here.

637
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:20,680
Where on earth is it?

638
01:00:22,598 --> 01:00:23,766
Here it is.

639
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:54,714
<i>Instructions?</i>

640
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:58,176
Eliminate the agents including Lim Soo-ho

641
01:00:58,676 --> 01:01:00,344
and return with Moran Hill.

642
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:05,141
<i>We're finally ordered to return!</i>

643
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,692
Constitution Chapter 2, Article 9.

644
01:01:14,776 --> 01:01:17,945
"All citizens shall be assured
of human worth and dignity

645
01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:19,906
and have the right
to the pursuit of happiness."

646
01:01:19,989 --> 01:01:21,949
Get a vehicle ready
by the shrine right now.

647
01:01:22,033 --> 01:01:22,950
Over.

648
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:24,327

Gyeong-ja.

660
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:03,991
I'm sorry for coming

661
01:02:05,117 --> 01:02:06,661
to your room.

662
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,392
Man-dong.

663
01:02:29,976 --> 01:02:31,394
Hey.

664
01:02:31,477 --> 01:02:33,187
It's a relief Gyeong-ja came back.

665
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:35,815
I was on my way to the nurse's office,

666
01:02:36,315 --> 01:02:38,943
but I was scared she might hurt herself,
so I followed her.

667
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:41,112
God, my leg.

668
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:43,656
My goodness.

669
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,200
-It hurts again?
-Yes.

670
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,660
-Gosh.
-Oh, no.

671
01:02:48,452 --> 01:02:51,706
Yeong-ro, I'm sorry, but can you go

672
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:54,000
fetch a painkiller for me?

673
01:02:55,877 --> 01:02:57,920
-Sure. Be back in a minute.
-Thanks.

674
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:07,263
We have it here.

675
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:11,434
That's good.

676
01:03:13,895 --> 01:03:15,104
Here.

677
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:16,314
Thank you.

678
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:20,234
Yeong-ro, do you have water?

679
01:03:21,986 --> 01:03:23,362
Just a second.

680
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:42,673
-Goodness.
-Man-dong.

681
01:03:42,757 --> 01:03:44,592
-Stay seated.
-Okay.

682
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:53,643
Thank you, Yeong-ro.

683
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,562
You should take it easy.

684
01:03:56,646 --> 01:03:57,647
I will.

685
01:04:01,525 --> 01:04:02,693
How clumsy.

686
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:06,405
Darn it.

687
01:04:30,888 --> 01:04:32,223
Gather on the first floor!

688
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:34,225
What?

689
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:37,645
You're here too.

690
01:04:37,728 --> 01:04:40,439
-Yes.
-We're going to get out of here soon.

691
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:41,357
Pardon?

692
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:42,775
Gyeong-ja?

693
01:04:43,943 --> 01:04:45,111
Get up.

694
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:46,237
Come on now.

695
01:04:54,787 --> 01:04:57,832
Thank God. This is great.

696
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:01,961
You guys make sure
to keep your mouths shut.

697
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,714
If you tell anyone
about the election scheme

698
01:05:04,797 --> 01:05:06,841
or anything you heard here,

699
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:09,468
you might end up getting killed. Okay?

700
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:14,932
-I won't.
-Good.

701
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:17,852
-Go now.
-Yes, ma'am.

702
01:05:17,935 --> 01:05:19,812
Goodness. My leg hurts, so…

703
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:46,922
Is everyone here?

704
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:50,718
Once the cameras
and your parents are here,

705
01:05:51,552 --> 01:05:53,304
we'll get out of the dorm.

706
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:00,019
<i>Open this!</i>

707
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:01,228
COSMOS TOYS

708
01:06:01,312 --> 01:06:03,064
You can't do this!

709
01:06:03,147 --> 01:06:05,983
I'm the victim here. The victim!

710
01:06:07,818 --> 01:06:10,613
You should lock up the one who scammed me!

711
01:06:11,197 --> 01:06:12,573
I never

712
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:15,993
imagined a Northern spy

713
01:06:16,077 --> 01:06:18,788
was behind Linda Young!

714
01:06:21,457 --> 01:06:22,458
This is the room.

715
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:26,087
Lead the way.

716
01:06:26,712 --> 01:06:28,881
I'm sure he was beaten to a pulp.

717
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:31,092
You expect me to carry him by myself?

718
01:07:00,704 --> 01:07:02,748
You know how short-tempered I am.

719
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:04,792
Let's go before I put a hole in your head.

720
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:06,502
Where's Gal?

721
01:07:11,132 --> 01:07:13,926
Hey, aren't you tired of this?

722
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:16,470
Let's get this over with and go home!

723
01:07:40,077 --> 01:07:41,745
-Take off your clothes.
-Pardon?

724
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:54,842
Change into these.

725
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:56,719
We're leaving soon.

726
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:13,819
To be honest,

727
01:08:13,903 --> 01:08:18,407
I don't want to take you with us since
you're injured and will slow us down.

728
01:08:19,074 --> 01:08:22,912
But Comrade Lim is adamant
about taking you.

729
01:08:23,495 --> 01:08:27,750
He says he can't abandon you
like our party did.

730
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,090
I'll be back in ten minutes.

731
01:08:36,008 --> 01:08:37,760
If you don't get changed until then,

732
01:08:39,887 --> 01:08:41,347
we won't take you.

733
01:09:03,118 --> 01:09:05,079
Get changed right now.

734
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:06,705
You must get out of here.

735
01:09:17,508 --> 01:09:19,051
You must

736
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,638
stay alive.

737
01:09:25,599 --> 01:09:26,558
Okay?

738
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,019
Come on.

739
01:09:30,271 --> 01:09:31,981
Hurry and change.

740
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:43,075
Are you freaking kidding me?

741
01:09:44,535 --> 01:09:47,371
No cameras or parents? You promised us.

742
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:49,498
What are you trying to pull?

743
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:53,877
Are you really going to…

744
01:09:56,338 --> 01:09:57,673
kill all the students?

745
01:09:58,215 --> 01:10:00,509
Listen to me, Gang-mu.

746
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,512
While I was in the hospital,

747
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:06,223
Nam Tae-il

748
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:09,893
told Code 1
that the students had found out

749
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:14,440
<i>this hostage situation is
an election scheme.</i>

750
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:19,194
<i>He even told him that the spies were</i>

751
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:22,364
<i>disobeying the North's orders.</i>

752
01:10:23,157 --> 01:10:25,284
Code 1 furiously ordered me

753
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:27,870
to blow up the dorm right away.

754
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:29,872
<i>So how can I</i>

755
01:10:30,497 --> 01:10:34,793
<i>set up broadcast cameras
and bring the parents?</i>

756
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,215
You're not trustworthy as I expected.

757
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:43,052
Our deal is off.

758
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:46,305
You'll never get back
the 300 million dollars.

759
01:10:46,388 --> 01:10:47,431
Wait.

760
01:10:49,475 --> 01:10:51,226
After you all

761
01:10:52,686 --> 01:10:54,772
get out of there,

762
01:10:54,855 --> 01:10:56,273
<i>I'm going to</i>

763
01:10:56,732 --> 01:11:02,279
make public that the hostage situation
was an election scheme.

764
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:06,116
<i>On my late son's honor…</i>

765
01:11:06,575 --> 01:11:09,370
<i>No, on my daughter Yeong-ro,</i>

766
01:11:10,454 --> 01:11:11,747
I promise you.

767
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:15,000
<i>Yeong-ro said she wouldn't be able</i>

768
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:19,254
to carry on if the students died.

769
01:11:21,673 --> 01:11:23,300
I can finally see that.

770
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:27,763
<i>I'm doing this</i>

771
01:11:28,347 --> 01:11:31,183
<i>to save my Yeong-ro. So, please…</i>

772
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,477
<i>Please</i>

773
01:11:34,228 --> 01:11:35,771
<i>trust me this once</i>

774
01:11:36,688 --> 01:11:38,315
<i>and you guys</i>

775
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:41,026
get out of there first.

776
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,117
Listen, Director Eun.

777
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,245
Okay. We'll leave the hostages to you

778
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:52,663
and get out first.

779
01:11:53,455 --> 01:11:54,915
Through the shrine at midnight.

780
01:11:58,836 --> 01:11:59,962
Comrade Kang.

781
01:12:01,463 --> 01:12:04,091
I can't trust Eun Chang-su.

782
01:12:04,883 --> 01:12:07,553
We should get out
after releasing the hostages.

783
01:12:10,514 --> 01:12:11,557
I understand.

784
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:15,144
This hostage situation started
because of you,

785
01:12:15,227 --> 01:12:17,938
so you must feel guilty
and want to save them.

786
01:12:19,314 --> 01:12:21,483
But we're running out of time.

787
01:12:24,653 --> 01:12:25,988
Decide.

788
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:27,698
Is it our agents

789
01:12:28,657 --> 01:12:30,200
or the hostages?

790
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:10,240
It is…

791
01:13:13,118 --> 01:13:14,912
my job to save the students anyway.

792
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:26,256
Han-na's picking Gal up.
So don't worry, and just go.

793
01:13:32,638 --> 01:13:33,680
I hope…

794
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:38,810
we never meet again.

795
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:29,987
You have five minutes.

796
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:01,602
We have to leave first to catch a ship.

797
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:15,073
Stay here,
and when the hostages are released,

798
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:17,451
go with them.

799
01:15:23,832 --> 01:15:25,083
And don't worry about me.

800
01:15:27,127 --> 01:15:29,630
They won't kill us
since we have the 300 million dollars.

801
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:33,592
Okay.

802
01:15:34,926 --> 01:15:38,180
I'll get out with my friends.

803
01:15:39,431 --> 01:15:40,974
Don't worry about me.

804
01:15:42,559 --> 01:15:44,353
And be safe.

805
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:11,463
I should go.

806
01:16:12,839 --> 01:16:14,299
Wait.

807
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:37,447
This is…

808
01:16:39,032 --> 01:16:40,283
You know

809
01:16:41,076 --> 01:16:43,620
how much this scarf means to me, right?

810
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:50,210
It's really precious to me.

811
01:16:52,379 --> 01:16:53,880
So next time we meet…

812
01:16:56,591 --> 01:17:00,679
If we meet again,
you have to give it back to me.

813
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:29,666
Why…

814
01:17:30,959 --> 01:17:31,960
Why?

815
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:38,592
If I take it,

816
01:17:41,303 --> 01:17:42,846
I can never give it back.

817
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:51,730
But you…

818
01:17:54,065 --> 01:17:56,109
You said we'll meet again.

819
01:18:00,864 --> 01:18:02,991
You said we'll meet again someday

820
01:18:04,075 --> 01:18:06,328
as long as we're alive.

821
01:18:09,498 --> 01:18:10,499
I'm sorry.

822
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:14,795
You know too that we're never going to

823
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:17,422
see each other again.

824
01:18:22,302 --> 01:18:24,387
-Soo-ho…
-Don't wait for me.

825
01:18:27,724 --> 01:18:29,810
The moment I leave this dorm…

826
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:34,105
I'll forget you exist.

827
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:55,205
Damn it. You're hurting me!

828
01:20:55,288 --> 01:20:56,998
Why do you keep pinching me?

829
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:08,486
Sir!

830
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,238
Sir!

831
01:22:18,872 --> 01:22:20,498
Mr. Kim is suspicious.

832
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,752
I heard him radio someone
in the records room.

833
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:25,587
What do you mean?

834
01:22:26,379 --> 01:22:27,422
Radio?

835
01:22:28,798 --> 01:22:31,342
"Eliminate the agents including Lim Soo-ho

836
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:33,470
and return with Moran Hill."

837
01:22:34,721 --> 01:22:36,222
Are you sure?

838
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:38,224
Eliminate Lim Soo-ho?

839
01:22:38,308 --> 01:22:39,768
And the others too?

840
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:42,520
Yes. I heard it clearly.

841
01:22:42,604 --> 01:22:46,775
And I heard him order someone
to get a vehicle ready by the shrine.

842
01:22:48,318 --> 01:22:49,736
Where is he?

843
01:22:49,819 --> 01:22:51,321
I think he's trying to leave the dorm.

844
01:22:51,404 --> 01:22:53,573
I saw him going down to the records room.

845
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,924
Hurry up.

846
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:15,762
Soo-ho!

847
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:31,444
What's taking so long?

848
01:23:31,528 --> 01:23:34,364
<i>You must finish cleaning
and empty the trash can.</i>

849
01:23:34,447 --> 01:23:37,867
<i>Put Tae-il in charge instead of Chang-su!</i>

850
01:23:37,951 --> 01:23:41,079
<i>I'm sure Nam Tae-il will try
to blow up the dorm,</i>

851
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:43,248
desperate to kill all the hostages.

852
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:44,833
Send in the SWAT team!

853
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:47,794
<i>Do you think they'll break in tonight?</i>

854
01:23:47,877 --> 01:23:49,796
<i>Since we have concluded</i>

855
01:23:49,879 --> 01:23:52,423
<i>that the lives
of the 33 hostages in the dorm</i>

856
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:53,633
<i>are in danger…</i>

857
01:23:53,716 --> 01:23:56,136
Blow up the second floor
where the students are. Now!

858
01:23:59,013 --> 01:24:00,056
<i>I have to go back.</i>

859
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:01,641
Yeong-ro is in danger.

860
01:24:02,475 --> 01:24:03,685
You'll die if you go.

861
01:24:03,768 --> 01:24:06,396
No, Yeong-ro! Yeong-ro!

862
01:24:17,907 --> 01:24:19,367
Soo-ho…

863
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:31,629
