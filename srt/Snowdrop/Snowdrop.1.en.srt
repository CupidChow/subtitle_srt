ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:08,992
SPRING 1987

3
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:15,624
EPISODE 1

4
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,565
Could you put this in your bag?

5
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:45,987
Hey, check this out. Look.

6
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:50,617
-We keep missing each other
-We keep missing each other

7
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,328
-With time passing by
-With time passing by

8
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:57,749
For the long time
there’s a weathered grave wood

9
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:02,712
The rain and winds erased
the name on the wood

10
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:11,888
Room 207.

11
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,934
Room 207.

12
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,227
Get out of my way.

13
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,770
Eun Yeong-ro.

14
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:19,813
There's a call for you.

15
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:30,365
Me? A call for me?

16
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,541
-That hurt!
-I'm sorry.

17
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,377
Hey, move out of the way!

18
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,341
STUDENT HEAD OF DORM

19
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,855
Get out of my way.

20
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:06,318
Five, four, three, two,

21
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:07,485
-Wait!
-one.

22
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,987
Wait. No!

23
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,492
You know you have to
take it in 30 seconds.

24
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,662
-I do.
-Should I make an exception?

25
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:21,499
Should I?

26
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:22,918
I shouldn't.

27
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,471
This is the Hosu Women's University dorm.

28
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:36,932
A student in room 205?

29
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:40,727
Yes. You're calling for Lee Yeon-suk?

30
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:42,395
Okay.

31
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:54,407
Hello?

32
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:04,584
Hey, who was it? It was him, wasn't it?

33
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:07,754
The engineering major
you met the other day, right?

34
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:10,048
I told you,
that long-haired guy and I are done.

35
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:12,175
He didn't even call me after that day.

36
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,720
Then who was it? It was
your first time getting a phone call.

37
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,809
It was my grandma
asking what time I'd be taking the bus.

38
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,227
I really thought it was him.

39
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,773
You know, phone calls are
usually for Hye-ryeong.

40
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:27,899
It was fun to watch.

41
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:30,318
Did you see that?
She thought it was for her.

42
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,279
"Get out of my way."

43
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,574
What?

44
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:39,869
Hey, I told you. It was my grandma.

45
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:42,747
Your grandma…

46
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,335
Yes. It was my grandma.

47
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:53,174
I wonder how she managed to get through.

48
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:57,095
I heard you barely get through
even though you call for two hours on end.

49
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:08,523
A dormitory with 360 students,

50
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:11,443
and only two phones. How ridiculous.

51
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:16,156
The upside of it, though,
is that we get to improve our running.

52
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:19,284
I doubt that.
Two days ago, I ran as fast as I could

53
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,203
only to see Bun-ok
hang up the call in front of me.

54
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:24,164
Saying 30 seconds was over.

55
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:27,417
I guess Gizzard treats us differently.

56
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,627
She doesn't dare hang up calls for me.

57
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,463
The call was for you.

58
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:34,049
You weren't in the room,
so I went there to

59
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,091
Just eat.

60
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:37,344
What?

61
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:39,929
She hung up a call for me?

62
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,724
Darn it. Who does
that Gizzard think she is?

63
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:45,518
Stop calling her Gizzard.
Watch what you say.

64
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:46,770
She has a name.

65
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,816
There you go again, pretending to be nice.

66
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,445
What did you say?

67
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:58,907
Gye Bun-ok means chicken, poop, and house.

68
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,283
In one word, it's "gizzard."

69
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,997
Her name actually means "fragrant bead."

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,874
Okay, Hye-ja?

71
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:12,670
Hey!

72
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:15,215
You wench.

73
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,968
I told you, my name is Ko Hye-ryeong!

74
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:22,055
I told you numerous times
that I changed my name.

75
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,266
How will you oust the dictator?

76
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:28,144
My goodness, don't make me laugh.

77
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,438
Look. Why don't you come to your senses

78
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,732
and fight for your fellow students
in our dorm?

79
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,402
THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIALISM

80
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,830
THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIALISM

81
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,671
THE TERRIFYING MERCENARY BASEBALL TEAM

82
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:56,172
Yeong-ro.

83
00:06:56,256 --> 00:07:01,010
"You will never defeat us. Not even once."

84
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:03,471
"God won't allow it,

85
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:05,598
and neither will Eom-ji."

86
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:12,564
I must say, this comic book isn't
about baseball but about romance.

87
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:25,243
THE TERRIFYING MERCENARY BASEBALL TEAM

88
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,377
He sure is shameless.

89
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,753
Really shameless.

90
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,214
He'll attend this year too?

91
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:41,551
Okay. Keep a close eye on him.

92
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:43,845
Were you talking about Eun?

93
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,932
He didn't even take part in the revolution

94
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:49,809
but wants to be a member of the Society?

95
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,687
That's just absurd.

96
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:55,732
SECRETARY-GENERAL OF AEMIN PARTY
NAM TAE-IL, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 2

97
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,942
You wicked little fox.

98
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,528
You sure know exactly how I feel.

99
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:02,489
You're going to be late.

100
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:05,325
-You should get there before Code 1 does.
-Yes, I should.

101
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,952
Eun Chang-su is definitely a liability.

102
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:09,787
How could he not see that?

103
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:11,915
It's so frustrating.

104
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,469
DIRECTOR OF ANSP
EUN CHANG-SU, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 3

105
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:26,846
I know he's your predecessor as director,

106
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,224
but he's four years your junior.

107
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:33,645
We can't let people think
that you bow to Nam Tae-il, can we?

108
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,523
At today's gathering,

109
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,442
you should show him who's boss.

110
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:43,238
Okay, honey?

111
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,214
Present arms.

112
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:02,715
-Salute!
-Salute!

113
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:28,533
Attention. Present arms.

114
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,118
-Salute!
-Salute!

115
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,212
Sir.

116
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:43,423
You came early.

117
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:44,632
Hello.

118
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,092
It's good to see you.

119
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,427
-How have you been?
-Good.

120
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,346
-All right. Let's have a seat.
-Sure, let's.

121
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,433
HEAD OF AEMIN PARTY
PARK MU-YEOL, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 1

122
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,977
DONGSIM SOCIETY

123
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:08,072
My goodness. It's been a while, everyone.

124
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,423
Look at this bastard…

125
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:26,883
The president is coming.

126
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:38,436
Attention!

127
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,149
Present arms!

128
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,821
Order arms!

129
00:10:57,914 --> 00:11:01,376
All right. Let us all have a glass first.

130
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:13,304
Sir! Let me give the toast today.

131
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:22,814
To the 30th anniversary
of Dongsim Society,

132
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:25,233
and to the president and our nation!

133
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,773
How's Operation Phoenix going?

134
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:50,318
Yes. We'll make it look like
the North abducts Professor Han I-seop,

135
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,861
the economic brains,

136
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:55,448
and the opposition party runs
for president with the North's funding.

137
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:58,159
If word is out that they're running
with the Communists' money,

138
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:01,329
the opposition party
will lose the election for sure.

139
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,832
It can't go awry.

140
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,084
It won't. It's going smoothly.

141
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:09,796
We're making sure that
a peaceful handover of power is possible.

142
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,005
Possible?

143
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:16,344
For you, the honorable leader,
and our Aemin Party,

144
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:19,972
I swear on my life
that our party will retake power!

145
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:27,522
You're indeed something else, Tae-il.

146
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:29,899
As the head of the campaign,

147
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:33,402
you should guide Director Eun well.

148
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:35,530
I will, sir.

149
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:47,083
Hello, ma'am. It's good to see you.

150
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,669
You're here too, ma'am.
Please come inside.

151
00:13:57,927 --> 00:13:59,512
Oh, my.

152
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:03,266
How amazing!

153
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:07,436
I knew it. You were born elegant,

154
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,315
so you look like an elegant French woman.
You look perfect in it.

155
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,525
WIFE OF EUN CHANG-SU, HONG AE-RA

156
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,610
And what do you think, Mrs. Hong?

157
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:17,154
You look so beautiful.

158
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:22,076
A wife of an officer or a politician

159
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,163
should have her own fashion style.

160
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:28,708
Why do you think?

161
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,084
WIFE OF NAM TAE-IL, CHO SEONG-SIM

162
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,044
Well…

163
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:36,549
To become a fashion icon
and show everyone--

164
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:39,343
No, that's not it.

165
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:46,267
To win…

166
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:51,647
the hearts of the public.

167
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:58,029
Because one's fashion,
especially a politician's wife's fashion,

168
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:02,033
is like a message to the people.

169
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,118
What does one's fashion mean?

170
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:05,578
-A message.
-A message.

171
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,197
Bingo!

172
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,176
Thank you.

173
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:22,720
Ma'am.

174
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,101
For your birthday party,

175
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:32,772
would you like to wear hanbok or a dress?

176
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:36,275
A dress. But I don't want it
to be too much.

177
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,194
Not too unique.

178
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:39,987
You know what I mean.

179
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:43,449
I do. Like something
the First Lady would wear.

180
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,702
As you wish, ma'am.

181
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,792
You're so thoughtful, ma'am.

182
00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:00,424
I wish you could be
as thoughtful, Mrs. Hong.

183
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:03,594
But then, she used to be an actress.

184
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:12,561
Yes, ranks are what matter
in the military,

185
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:14,689
but you know it's different in politics.

186
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:17,984
Code 1's faith in you
determines your power and rank.

187
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:23,739
And Mr. Eun seems
to keep forgetting that simple truth.

188
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:28,744
Perhaps you could help him remember that.

189
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,210
He can be quite straightforward.

190
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:39,005
I guess he's made
a mistake to your husband.

191
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:44,802
Please tell Mr. Nam that we're so sorry.

192
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,723
You know I'm always on your side.

193
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:54,687
Anyway, you're
three years older than me, right?

194
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:59,150
As far as I know, she's four years older.

195
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,526
Right?

196
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:02,737
Oh, my.

197
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,614
You're four years older than me?

198
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:11,829
Well, our ages don't matter.
Our husbands' ranks do.

199
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,744
Bingo!

200
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,922
My, Mrs. Hong.
You look much younger than your age.

201
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,760
Charlotte, I'd like to pay for the dress.

202
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:30,097
Sorry.

203
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:41,025
My goodness, ma'am.
You know you don't have to pay.

204
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:42,777
Ms. Kim, here.

205
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,321
I'm just honored to make a dress for you.

206
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,326
How dare that little wench

207
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,752
WELCOME BACK, MR. LEE GANG-MU

208
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:08,135
Mr. Lee Gang-mu?

209
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,730
It's an honor, Mr. Lee.

210
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:23,901
To pick you up, the legendary Black Tiger.

211
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,036
COSMOS TOYS

212
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:53,639
CHIEF AN GYEONG-HUI

213
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,624
APPRECIATION AWARD
PRESENTED TO AN GYEONG-HUI

214
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,460
ANSP

215
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:37,516
Here, ma'am. The photo's come out.

216
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:39,101
Good.

217
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:52,031
INFORMATION

218
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:57,703
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

219
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:24,146
And the evidence?

220
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:26,398
In Hyeseong Hotel--

221
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,361
Who'd dare bug the chief's office?

222
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,410
Didn't you read
the opposition party's interviews?

223
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:40,412
Apparently, their moles
are all over this place.

224
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:43,457
They're even confident
of getting hold of top secret documents.

225
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,626
You must know the man's the Crown Prince.

226
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:46,710
And the women…

227
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:50,798
I'll take care of this case.

228
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:52,675
So get your hands off it.

229
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,554
Listen. How about dinner tonight?
It's been a while.

230
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:59,223
With other alumni.

231
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:03,644
Black Tiger's back.

232
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,648
Lee Gang-mu. You know him well, right?

233
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,610
That brat. He sure is a workaholic.

234
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,737
He wants to brief me right away.

235
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:35,718
From the look of things,

236
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,469
he's been winning them over

237
00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:41,640
while moving from one lab to another
and using different identities.

238
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:46,228
He murders Koreans who try
to escape while being moved to the North

239
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:48,981
without even caring about
the German intelligence agencies.

240
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:51,442
Brutally in cold blood.

241
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:55,070
And while chasing him,

242
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:57,740
one of our agents…

243
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:03,620
GERMANY
2 YEARS AGO

244
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,792
Let go of me!

245
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:20,471
Hello, sir.

246
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,405
-No!
-Leave us alone!

247
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,911
The next cabin!

248
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,041
Move aside, Jin-seong.

249
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:05,766
PRIVATE PROPERTY

250
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:10,771
Jin-seong.

251
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:13,649
Jin-seong!

252
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:15,526
Jin-seong.

253
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:17,528
No, Jin-seong…

254
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:23,992
Jin-seong!

255
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:25,869
His face,

256
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,373
name, and age are all unknown.

257
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,751
Next.

258
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,753
This is his code name.

259
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:38,132
And we got intel that he snuck into Seoul.

260
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:41,343
Then you came back to Korea
to catch Taedong River 1?

261
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,937
He's been acting secretly
all over Germany,

262
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,565
and now he's in Seoul.

263
00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:05,826
He either has to win someone over in Seoul

264
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:09,246
or he was given a mission
the agents here can't pull off.

265
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:11,039
In any case,

266
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,835
we must get him
before he accomplishes his mission.

267
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:18,172
It's much more urgent
than catching small-fry spies.

268
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:19,715
All right.

269
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,592
Any volunteers?

270
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,511
Who wants to work with Gang-mu?

271
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:25,554
Me.

272
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,557
-I want to do it.
-Oh Dong-jae. And?

273
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,684
-I want in.
-So do I.

274
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:32,811
-Any more?
-I want in.

275
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:35,522
-I want in.
-So do I.

276
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:42,029
-What the hell?
-What?

277
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:44,281
-What is it?
-What's going on?

278
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,033
What's going on?

279
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:00,088
Is that what I should do to him?

280
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:02,466
TAEDONG RIVER 1

281
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:08,597
God, that nutcase.

282
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,350
Put your guns down.

283
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:14,811
I said, put your guns away!

284
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:17,773
Well…

285
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:21,109
Sorry about that. You must be startled.

286
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,111
She's our very first female agent.

287
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:24,905
She's obviously not trained properly.

288
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:29,284
Well, she may be hot-tempered,
but she's really good at her job.

289
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:30,953
Her nickname's One Hundred Warriors.

290
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:32,955
-Right?
-I don't need her.

291
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,290
I only need disciplined ones.

292
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:51,932
You little…

293
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:53,517
Have you gone mad?

294
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:02,734
Oh, my. He's so handsome
that I can never get sick of him.

295
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,946
Oh, my. He's killing me.

296
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:08,532
You should grill it nice and crisp.

297
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:11,034
Careful. You're going to burn it.

298
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:13,620
God, you and your nagging. You do it then.

299
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,665
I'm not nagging. I'm just teaching you.

300
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:20,460
I bet you only ate sausages in Germany.
What do you know about pork belly?

301
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,461
Germany?

302
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,589
What? Then he's a Korean-German?

303
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:28,051
Didn't you know? He's a graduate student
of economics at Berlin University.

304
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:30,804
Oh, my goodness. For real?

305
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:32,973
I heard he came to write a thesis

306
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:34,808
on Park Chung-hee's
Economic Development Plan.

307
00:26:34,891 --> 00:26:35,934
Really?

308
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:37,603
-He's so cool!
-That's amazing.

309
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:39,980
These lettuce leaves are really…

310
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:44,568
Come on, Gwang-tae.
You should grill the meat.

311
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:47,112
Why do you make Soo-ho do all the work?

312
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:49,573
He didn't pass the exam. I did.

313
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:52,659
I, Oh Gwang-tae,
am the star of the day, aren't I?

314
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,036
Look at this guy.

315
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,372
You only passed the first round.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

316
00:26:58,123 --> 00:26:59,207
Oh, my goodness.

317
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,544
-Hey.
-Our stingy Ms. Bong may say mean words,

318
00:27:02,628 --> 00:27:03,879
but she cares a lot for me.

319
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:05,756
Look how she threw
this barbecue party for me.

320
00:27:07,382 --> 00:27:09,593
You're three months behind on rent.

321
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:12,429
Why would I throw
a barbecue party for you?

322
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,308
You should learn from him, you brat.

323
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:19,019
Soo-ho paid for all this
to congratulate you.

324
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:20,395
-What?
-What?

325
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,606
-Let me do it.
-What?

326
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,941
-You're the best.
-What are you doing?

327
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,194
-Pour him a drink.
-Sure.

328
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:29,696
-But you said you're the star of the day.
-No, you are.

HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
100TH ANNIVERSARY

330
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:39,122
15 MINUTES BEFORE DORM ROLL CALL

331
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:40,040
Sorry!

332
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,961
-No!
-Run!

333
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,215
Run!

334
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,218
What is it that you want to say?

335
00:27:57,891 --> 00:27:58,892
You know what that means.

336
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:00,477
Hye-ryeong!

337
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:18,704
This is my heart.

338
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:21,331
What's going on?

339
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:24,334
My heart is burning
like the sun for you, Hye-ryeong.

340
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,878
Please accept it.

341
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,257
Hye-ryeong!

342
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,176
Ten minutes…

343
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,094
What?

344
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:37,681
We only have ten minutes.

345
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,516
Hye-ryeong.

346
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:42,602
Hye-ryeong!

347
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:51,319
Wait for me!

348
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:13,008
INDEPENDENT HOSU, ONE HOSU, UNITED HOSU

349
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:18,513
Run, run!

350
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:19,598
No!

351
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,294
-Hye-ryeong. Hurry!
-Darn it.

352
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:50,587
Damn it!

353
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,632
Hye-ryeong. Hurry!

354
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,259
-Hurry!
-Darn it.

355
00:29:57,552 --> 00:29:59,095
Good. Run!

356
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,140
Run!

357
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:06,019
What? No.

358
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,818
-What?
-Just leave it. Hurry.

359
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:17,030
But it's from Grandma.

360
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:19,241
Darn it.

361
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,253
Hey! Move!

362
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:39,469
Jeong-min.

363
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:41,137
Five minutes left.

364
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:50,230
Yeong-ro and Hye-ryeong haven't come back.

365
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:51,857
What? Both of them?

366
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:53,942
Be careful.

367
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:55,652
-Careful.
-Hello.

368
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:58,321
-Hello.
-Be careful. You might hurt yourself.

369
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:01,408
My goodness.

370
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:05,203
KEEP IT BRIEF

371
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:08,498
Damn it.

372
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,086
Why isn't she here yet?

373
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,298
This is bad.

374
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:57,213
Hye-ryeong!

375
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:00,550
Gosh.

376
00:32:01,176 --> 00:32:02,135
What about Yeong-ro?

377
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:06,890
Yeong-ro!

378
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,480
My, what happened to her?
It's already nine.

379
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,731
Mr. Kim.

380
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:18,193
-What are you doing here?
-What?

381
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:21,279
Oh, Yeong-ro's not back yet.

382
00:32:21,947 --> 00:32:23,657
-Yeong-ro?
-Yes.

383
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:31,915
-Oh, no. If the hall director sees her…
-Come on. Hurry!

384
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,964
-Sure. I should close the door.
-Hurry.

385
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:41,841
-Okay.
-This is why I hate working with him.

386
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:50,016
Hello, ma'am.

387
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:58,817
Wait.

388
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:04,447
Ma'am. About what happened yesterday…

389
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:08,076
The hall director is over there.

390
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,327
Hide.

391
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:11,830
Hide.

392
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:15,333
All right, then. I'll do it accordingly.

393
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:20,839
No.

394
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,761
Make sure to close it exactly on the hour.

395
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:28,513
I will, ma'am.

396
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:31,975
It shouldn't be
even a second later than that.

397
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:35,395
Sure, ma'am.

398
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:37,063
DORM MAIN DOOR

399
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,190
Have you fixed the chairs in the sauna?

400
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:41,860
I'm going to.

401
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:46,197
There are so many things
the students ask me to fix, so…

402
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,368
I'll get it done soon.

403
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,209
My goodness.

404
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:00,003
What do we do?

405
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:01,629
Just follow her for now.

406
00:34:01,713 --> 00:34:02,881
Darn it.

407
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,638
Yeong-ro.

408
00:34:11,222 --> 00:34:13,975
Yeong-ro? Where did she go?

409
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:16,728
What's that?

410
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,150
My goodness.

411
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,538
How could you leave her behind?

412
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,248
I missed roll call twice already.

413
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,625
What could I do?

414
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,296
So did she pass the dorm main gate or not?

415
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,423
I don't know!
I just ran without looking back.

416
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,175
-Ko Hye-ryeong!
-What?

417
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,510
Now…

418
00:34:55,593 --> 00:35:00,264
we're all going to get kicked out,
aren't we?

419
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,975
Stop whining and get ready for roll call.

420
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,144
Okay.

421
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,794
Say good night.

422
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,754
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

423
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,728
Say good night.

424
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,022
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

425
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,039
I'm sorry, ma'am.

426
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,994
Hurry and get inside.

427
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,168
CHOCO BALLS

428
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,171
Say good night.

429
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,465
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

430
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,672
Say good night.

431
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,548
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

432
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,179
Go! Go now!

433
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,233
What?

434
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,693
Hurry!

435
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,449
This is why I told her to leave it.

436
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,201
Why did she have to go to pick it up?

437
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,661
-I can't believe her.
-Hye-ryeong.

438
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,873
It may not be a problem for a rich girl
like you, but if we're kicked out--

439
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,335
Yeong-ro might not be able
to afford to rent a room.

440
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,586
What do you know?

441
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,631
She gave out rice cakes
to everyone on the day she moved in.

442
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,717
Her family runs a rice cake store!
She relies on scholarships.

443
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,844
She answers phone calls with Bun-ok.

444
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,353
Guys.

445
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,855
Open it.

446
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,982
-My goodness.
-Open the window.

447
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,693
-Say good night.
-Good night, ma'am.

448
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,863
Darn it.

449
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,081
-What…
-Rat.

450
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,876
I just saw a rat!

451
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,170
-Rat!
-Where?

452
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,589
No. This way!

453
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,299
Get her pajamas.

454
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,512
Where?

455
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,681
-Where?
-This way!

456
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,932
That way!

457
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,227
There's a rat! Grab a broom!

458
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,482
Yeong-ro, give me your bag.

459
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,577
Lift your foot.

460
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,956
Thank you.

461
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,878
What the hell are you doing?

462
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,258
Well…

463
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,930
-Go.
-Let's get back.

464
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,932
-Move.
-I hate rats!

465
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,352
Yeong-ro, hurry.

466
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,686
I'm almost done.

467
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,656
Well, I could've sworn
that I saw a rat there.

468
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,033
I definitely saw one going in there.

469
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,328
Don't you know the dorm rules?

470
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,163
How dare you scream like that?

471
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,124
I'm sorry, ma'am.

472
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,295
You said you saw it,
so make sure to catch it.

473
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,138
By myself?

474
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,326
Eun Yeong-ro.

475
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,287
Yes, ma'am?

476
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,832
Why are you sweating so much?

477
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,880
Well, I ran really hard
to not be late for roll call.

478
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,424
So why did you have to stay out late?

479
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,594
What if your roommates
get kicked out because of you?

480
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,307
I'm sorry. I won't stay out late again.

481
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,269
Room 207.

482
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,564
Recite the dorm rules.

483
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,399
-Abide by the curfew.
-Abide by the curfew.

484
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,193
-No protest. No sleeping out.
-No protest. No sleeping out.

485
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,652
Again.

486
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,779
-Abide by the curfew. No protest.
-Abide by the curfew. No protest.

487
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,948
-No sleeping out. No cooking food.
-No sleeping out. No cooking food.

488
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,366
You know…

489
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,537
your room only has one chance left, right?

490
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,747
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

491
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,457
That'll be all.

492
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,709
Say good night.

493
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

494
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,102
How did you think of climbing the wall?

495
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,187
Don't get me started.

496
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,109
Wait. I forgot the rice cakes.

497
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,537
I wonder Yeong-ro managed to get in.

498
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,206
What?

499
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,124
Mr. Kim.

500
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,125
Look who's here.

501
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,255
So you didn't get caught, Yeong-ro.

502
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,966
That's great!

503
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,179
You were right. He brought it in.

504
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,014
I told you he would.

505
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,100
He can fix or unlock anything.

506
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,643
Of course.

507
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,438
I may be old,
but I'm a jack of all trades.

508
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,943
I bet you're hungry.

509
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,196
Ta-da. They're oat rice cakes.

510
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,323
They're supposed to be good for diabetes.

511
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,076
Oh, my. I'm so grateful.

512
00:42:59,159 --> 00:42:59,994
Hey!

513
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,413
We should go back to our room.

514
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,956
Sure, you should.

515
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,125
Oh, right. Hold on.

516
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,546
Can you give this to Bun-ok on the way?

517
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,799
Tell her I'll smash it
if she asks me to fix it again.

518
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,384
It's such a nuisance.

519
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,719
I will.

520
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,513
-Good night.
-Good night.

521
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,891
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

522
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,229
Right. Hold it for me for a second.

523
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,238
Bun-ok, it's been fixed.

524
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,282
I almost forgot about it.

525
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,994
And this is the honey rice cake you love.

526
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,830
Oh, right.
It was your grandma's birthday, right?

527
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,123
Thank you.

528
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,459
Wait. Bun-ok…

529
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,005
Thank you so much for earlier.

530
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,841
The hall director told me to catch a rat.

531
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,052
By myself, since I'm the one who saw it.

532
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,679
-Really?
-What a wench.

533
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,473
I hope she goes somewhere and drops--

534
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,185
Yes, really.

535
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,729
I'm so sorry, Bun-ok.

536
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,856
Well, I'll have to put on a show again.

537
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,068
I'll beg her saying
I must've seen wrong or cry my heart out.

538
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,536
If you're that sorry,
would you do me a favor?

539
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,499
What is it?
Just name it. I'll do anything.

540
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,965
Get me the English edition
of Romeo and Juliet.

541
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,718
English edition?

542
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,140
What? Is that so surprising?

543
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,102
Because I want an English edition
when I'm not even a college student?

544
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,438
No. That's not what I was thinking.

545
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,899
Even English literature majors
don't read them much.

546
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:58,654
You know how it is.
They're not even that good at English.

547
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,121
I'll give you a copy tomorrow.
I recently bought one.

548
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,581
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

549
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,794
Right.

550
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,339
Let's go.

551
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,225
What do you think is in that room?

552
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,145
What are you talking about?

553
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,731
Come on. Something's really fishy.

554
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:39,111
She opened the door just a crack
in case you looked inside.

555
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,243
Stop talking nonsense and give that to me.

556
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,327
Let's run.

557
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,621
Hey!

558
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,836
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

559
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,264
COSMOS TOYS

560
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,349
This man

561
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,352
is likely to have helped
Taedong River 1 with his mission.

562
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,771
And there's no record
that he came into Korea, so…

563
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,234
Damn it.

564
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:07,324
-Why didn't you tell me about this?
-I'm sure I said that I don't need you.

565
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,078
Who's this guy?

566
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,625
Is he someone connected
to Taedong River 1?

567
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,171
I'll handle Professor Han I-seop.

568
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,592
He's the brains of Choi Dae-yeong,
the leader of the opposition party.

569
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,679
I met him a few times
while monitoring him.

570
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,683
Are you going to keep a close eye
on him when he knows your face?

571
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,479
Oh, that?

572
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,233
He thinks I'm a journalist who was fired.

573
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,738
Who was fired
for strongly condemning the ruling party.

574
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,997
I can infiltrate deep into their party.

575
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,631
This is amazing.
It's the guy I met with you guys!

576
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,300
That's amazing!

577
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,384
Hurry!

578
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,262
-Really?
-Oh, my God!

579
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,555
Let's go open it.

580
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,777
TO YEONG-U

581
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,321
How could he…

582
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,073
He doesn't take a leave or write me back.

583
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,038
HOW COULD YOU

584
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,885
I swear I'll…

585
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,478
You're so mean, Yeong-u.

586
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,242
Come on. Guys in the military
never write back to their sisters.

587
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,577
Only to their girlfriends.

588
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,371
TIMESHEET

589
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,290
But he doesn't have a girlfriend.

590
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,626
He only thinks about me,

591
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,878
so my grandma's so worried about him.

592
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,005
He's in the military.
I'm sure he's doing well.

593
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,926
But he's not just in the…

594
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:36,598
Bun-ok.

595
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,986
Thanks.

596
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,404
Hello?

597
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,406
How do I look?

598
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,409
-Pardon?
-Do I look cool?

599
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,249
People will think I'm
a college girl, right?

600
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,257
No, it's okay.

601
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,093
Hey, keep it short, will you?
The phone's not yours.

602
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,222
Babe, I'm afraid I've got to go.

603
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,932
What? Yes.

604
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,936
Then see you at Harmony at six.

605
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,187
Okay, babe.

606
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,568
What the…

607
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,165
ASPIRING TO BECOME A WORLD-FAMOUS
OPERA SINGER, KO HYE-RYEONG

608
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,343
This is Hosu Women's University Dormitory.

609
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,015
I heard Ms. Ko Hye-ryeong,

610
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,894
a senior in Voice and Music major,
Hosu's Prima Donna who will

611
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,522
become a world-famous opera singer,
stays in Room 207.

612
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,232
Is that true?

613
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,151
Yes, it is.

614
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,787
This is Oh Gwang-tae who stays
in Room 207 at Haedal Boarding House,

615
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:26,708
whose residents have passed
the most difficult national exams.

616
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,961
More than those of any other houses.

617
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:32,881
And?

618
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:38,136
Could I speak to any lady of Room 207?

619
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,056
I'm afraid no one
in that room is here right now.

620
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,600
If you leave a message to me,
I'll make sure they get it.

621
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,690
A group blind date?

622
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,736
A group blind date?

623
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,405
Hold on. Yes, go on.

624
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,367
This Saturday.

625
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,494
At three o'clock. Hold on.

626
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,746
At Rome Coffee Shop
in front of Hosu Women's University?

627
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,790
Wait a second.

628
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,752
The girls of Room 207 might turn it down.
You can't just tell them to come.

629
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,839
We will wait there until they come.

630
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,841
Please tell them that.

631
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,802
Oh, and four girls live
in the room, right?

632
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,013
-Yes.
-Good. Thank you.

633
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,225
HAEDAL BOARDING HOUSE

634
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,769
-You did it!
-This is great!

635
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,020
I love you!

636
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,151
We're going on
a group blind date thanks to Hye-ryeong.

637
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,236
She's indeed
the most popular girl in the school.

638
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,364
But I don't think Jeong-min will go.

639
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,493
Then you're one girl short.

640
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,290
This is a women's university.
I'm sure we'll find one.

641
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,208
How about me?

642
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,919
I live in the dorm too.

643
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,423
Pardon?

644
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,926
Wait, Gwang-tae. Four girls are coming,

645
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,303
but we're three.

646
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,683
Soo-ho!

647
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,689
Do you have time this Saturday?
No, you must.

648
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,984
Why are you always like that?
What is it this time?

649
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:20,280
Soo-ho, you know that I never got to date
because I was too busy studying.

650
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,407
If it's about
a group blind date again, forget it.

651
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:26,995
But it's Hosu.

652
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,246
Go away.

653
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,540
Hosu's Maria Callas is coming.

654
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,626
Go away! Now!

655
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,544
Fine.

656
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,422
Then I won't set you up
with Professor Han.

657
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,885
You have a lot of questions for him.
Say goodbye to your thesis.

658
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,935
So they're from Hosu Women's University?

659
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,189
Just one day…

660
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,982
I don't wish for more.

661
00:53:56,066 --> 00:54:00,237
I just want to live
as a college girl for one day.

662
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,077
I guess that's too much to ask for.

663
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,546
It's too much, isn't it?

664
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,300
It's not.

665
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,972
Then will you convince Hye-ryeong for me?

666
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,516
Okay.

667
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,977
She's ridiculous.

668
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,688
She wants to join us?

669
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,023
Does she have no self-respect?

670
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,110
She wants to pretend
to be a college girl that badly?

671
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,198
I can understand her.

672
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,410
When you hear guys asking girls out
over the phone often enough,

673
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,454
you become envious
and want to go on a date too.

674
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,373
Don't you think?

675
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,917
But not this time.

676
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,836
That's deceiving the guys.

677
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,213
You're right!

678
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,215
I totally agree with you.

679
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,846
But we avoided a disaster
during roll call thanks to Bun-ok.

680
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,599
Well, that is true, but…

681
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,810
But we shouldn't lie to the guys.

682
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,397
God, I can never like you.

683
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,524
How hard is it to join us for once?

684
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,485
You guys go have a lot of fun.

685
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,905
Do you think I'm going because I want to?

686
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,575
I just want to make fun memories
for the freshmen.

687
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,541
Ms. Ko.

688
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,546
I prepared it for you.

689
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,178
Wait. Hye-ryeong, wait.

690
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:54,434
As you said, it's really wrong
to lie to the guys.

691
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,730
It may be nothing special for us,
but it is her dream.

692
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,817
Just this once. Please?

693
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,739
No.

694
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,867
What if…

695
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,787
Well, I doubt she'll go that far…

696
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,041
but what if she won't take
any calls for you?

697
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,926
Go tell her I'll allow it just this once.

698
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,677
Make it clear.

699
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,889
Thank you, Hye-ryeong.

700
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,271
Fun memories?

701
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,442
Are you sure it's not because of
the guy who passed the national exam?

702
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,905
What's so wrong about that?

703
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,241
It's a human instinct to try to find

704
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,035
as good a life partner as possible.

705
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,291
"The guy who passed the national exam"?

706
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,589
It's a human instinct. It's very natural.

707
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,676
Oh, my God! We're really doing this!

708
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,762
By a good partner, you mean
a woman with a good background, right?

709
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,514
Of course.

710
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,101
Only lowlifes marry for love.

711
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:22,939
The ruling class only marries for money.
That's what Engels said.

712
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,275
So using the fact
that you passed the first round,

713
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,069
you're trying to court Hye-ryeong
who you're sure is bourgeois?

714
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,573
You pathetic punk.

715
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,450
You have to keep your word. I mean…

716
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,411
you can't choose Hye-ryeong.

717
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,039
I'm sure she'll choose me,
but just in case.

718
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,668
Fine, I won't. But you have to set me up
with Professor Han properly, okay?

719
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,628
Of course, I will.

720
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:53,761
What are you going to use as your item?

721
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,805
What? What item?

722
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,434
God, I can't believe you.

723
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,188
What's the point
of going to Berlin University?

724
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,189
Let me see.

725
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,773
What are you looking for?

726
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,442
What are you doing?

727
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:08,985
Later…

728
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,612
This is a designer wallet.

729
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,697
-What are you doing?
-I mean…

730
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,492
don't take out
something like this luxury pen.

731
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,205
What? This is perfect.

732
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,250
Soo-ho, this is just perfect. Use it.

733
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,920
A meeting with Professor Han.

734
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,671
Yes. I already told you.

735
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,466
This is really happening!

736
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,262
Hye-ryeong, it's ten to three.

737
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,764
I know.

738
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:41,017
Bun-ok said she'd be
at Rome Coffee Shop by three.

739
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,770
She must've stopped by some salon, right?

740
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,523
It's just putting pearls on a pig, though.

741
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,736
Should I help with this--

742
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,910
They just told us to be there
by three without asking us.

743
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,454
So why do we have to be there
by the time they set?

744
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,166
Romantic relationships begin
with a tug-of-war.

745
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,752
And the best way to win is

746
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,629
to make the guy desperate.

747
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,172
Got it?

748
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,016
ROME COFFEE SHOP

749
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,105
ROME COFFEE SHOP

750
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,982
Darn it.

751
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,400
They're still not here.

752
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,487
-It's them.
-Really?

753
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,322
-Hello.
-Hi.

754
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,407
Welcome.

755
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,201
This way, please.

756
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,205
-It's them.
-Really?

757
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,958
-Hello.
-Not again.

758
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,253
When will they come?

759
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,005
I don't know.

760
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,966
How could they be so late?

761
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,892
Oh Gwang-tae?

762
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,148
-No, I'm--
-Hye-ryeong!

763
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,429
What a shame.

764
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,477
It is. One more match,
and it would've been completed.

765
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,273
But…

766
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,776
only the three of you came?

767
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,693
Three?

768
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,073
Oh, she's not here yet?

769
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,784
She definitely promised to come by three.

770
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,329
I'm sorry. I guess
something urgent came up for her.

771
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,539
One of your guys
will have to do without a partner.

772
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,418
Yeong-ro!

773
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,257
Bun-ok.

774
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,430
I'm sorry I'm late.

775
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,101
Hi.

776
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,815
I'm so sorry I'm late.

777
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,192
Sorry, guys.
Did you introduce yourselves yet?

778
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,611
We didn't, but--

779
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,157
I'm a senior studying English Literature
at Hosu University.

780
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,909
My name is…

781
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,787
Gye Seong.

782
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,926
Enjoy.

783
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,180
All right. Now that all of us are here,

784
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,015
-please introduce yourselves.
-Wait.

785
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:11,352
How about we decide on our partners first?

786
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:18,276
You see, I have two tickets
to a music concert.

787
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,652
If I'm to be there on time,

788
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,904
I should get going soon.

789
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:26,659
And I was hoping
to go there with one of the guys here.

790
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,411
Cutting to the chase. I love it.

791
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,247
All right, then. How about you girls
pick among our items?

792
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,165
No.

793
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,710
Since she's in such a hurry,

794
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,254
we girls will take out our items.

795
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,299
So that a guy who wants
to go with her can pick hers.

796
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,135
Let's do that! I agree…

797
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,847
with Hye-ryeong.

798
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,976
Come on, Seol-hui.
Isn't that too boring and direct?

799
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:55,730
I'd rather leave it to fate.

800
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:56,981
Right?

801
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,986
I also think
we should let fate decide for us.

802
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,531
I agree with you!
What's fun about it if it's so obvious?

803
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,409
Let's let fate decide for us.
All right, then.

804
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,996
Could you girls please close your eyes?

805
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,581
And guys.

806
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,540
-Yes?
-Yes?

807
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,459
Take out your items.

808
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,886
EXAM PASS CERTIFICATE

809
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,430
Now open your eyes, please.

810
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,145
That's a paper airplane.

811
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,818
What? This is perfect.

812
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,986
Use it.

813
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,161
Why don't you pick first, Hye-ryeong?

814
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,759
Oh, my. What exam is this certificate for?

815
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,097
It's for the Civil Service Exam.

816
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:13,933
I passed the first round.

817
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,274
-The first round?
-Yes, the first round.

818
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,026
Seol-hui.

819
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:26,737
Okay.

820
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,074
-You pick first.
-What?

821
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,202
Me first?

822
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:29,967
Come on, Yeong-ro.
Since I'm older, I should pick first.

I can't tell her.

LISTENING BOOTH

832
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,684
She must be so embarrassed.

833
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,896
She's leaving.

834
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,551
What about Bun-ok?

835
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,556
I mean, Seong. Where's Seong?

836
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,768
Didn't you go
to the music concert with her?

837
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:47,980
No, since I'm quite busy.

838
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,902
And you? Did you part ways already?

839
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,452
Yes, since I'm quite busy too.

840
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,131
-How much is it? Hurry!
-How much is what?

841
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,365
How much is it? Hurry!

842
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,574
It's 2,500 won.

843
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,762
I'm sorry. I'll buy it next time.

844
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:10,062
Seriously?

845
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,317
I can't believe this.

846
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,402
Excuse me.

847
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,545
What's this?

848
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,047
Didn't you come to buy this?

849
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,595
Why are you giving it to me?

850
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,140
Because we met earlier.

851
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,186
Just take it.

852
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,272
But

853
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,441
Wait.

854
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,070
Hey!

855
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:01,906
Hey!

856
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,125
What year did you start?

857
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,461
Don't you dare lie.

858
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,046
Are you sure?

859
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,757
-Hey.
-You there!

860
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,430
I can't take it.

861
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:30,726
It wasn't like that.

862
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,979
What? What are you doing?

863
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,314
Just a minute, please.

864
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,210
You jerk!

865
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,798
You went to the music concert with Seong.
You think I don't know that?

866
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,092
Am I wrong? Tell me if I am!

867
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,094
-Tell me!
-I didn't.

868
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,845
Tell me what happened then.

869
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,417
Let's go.

870
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,185
The police are gone.

871
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,090
Are you all right?

872
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,980
You could be an actress.

873
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,858
Not a singer, though.

874
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,992
My big brother was
once arrested at a protest.

875
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,620
So…

876
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,333
I see.

877
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,128
I should get going.

878
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,594
Wait. Just a minute.

879
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,353
Do you want

880
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:21,939
to have dinner…

881
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,290
Thank you.

882
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,477
I hate to be indebted to other people.

883
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:07,025
So let me return the favor.
Meet me at Rome Coffee Shop tomorrow.

884
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,030
At three. Okay?

885
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,869
You have to come. Okay?

886
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,177
Clean the chair properly too, okay?

887
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,845
Sure, sure.

888
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,681
And be careful
not to leave your footprints.

889
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,016
Got it.

890
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,976
Yeong-ro…

891
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,859
Hey, don't run!

892
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:44,915
I wondered what it'd feel like

893
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:47,668
to fall in love at first sight.

He's recently been seen
quite often around Professor Han.

905
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:29,454
He's known as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University.

906
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,749
I've checked it with the university,
and there's no student

907
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,502
by that name.

01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,595
As of now, he's likely
to be Taedong River 1.

911
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,639
Keep a close eye on him at all times.

912
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,724
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:21,631
-Are you going home now?
-Hey, Soo-ho. You're still here?

919
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,594
Oh, my. This looks quite serious.

920
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,477
It's nice of you to give me a ride.
Thank you.

921
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:37,439
They're coming.

Lim Soo-ho!

942
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,214

-Oh, my goodness.
-That's scary.

946
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,901
They're shooting so many tear bombs today.

947
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:53,033
Aemin Party's election campaign
is happening at Songchon Rotary.

948
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,786
I hope she comes back safely.

949
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,538
You mean Jeong-min?

950
01:21:58,622 --> 01:21:59,581
Yes.

951
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,875

Let's go to the dorm.

959
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:19,828
Out of the way!

960
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,917
Seung-jun, this way. Dong-jae, that way.

961
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,546
Hey, you can't

962
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,141
I'm so scared.

963
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,177
Who are you people?

964
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:21,514
We need to search the dorm right now.

965
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,642
What's this about?

966
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,645
A man who's been shot is hiding in here.

967
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:28,897
Show me a search warrant.

968
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,235
-Without a warrant, I won't let--
-Look.

969
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,989
We're chasing a North Korean spy!

970
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:41,618
Without a warrant, I can't allow
any man in this girls' dormitory.

971
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,721
If you don't let us,

972
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:05,350
you'll be violating National Security Law.

973
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:07,435
You know that?

974
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:10,980
You're in Hosu Women's University!

-Are you kidding?

We don't have time for this.

01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,454
Jeong-min!

979
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:27,831
Search thoroughly.

980
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,290
Yes, sir.

981
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:09,873
Hey.

982
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,687
Do you recognize me?

983
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,647
Didn't you hear? He's a North Korean spy.

984
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,815
He's not a spy.

985
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,775
So you want to keep him in the dorm?

986
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,361
Just tell him to leave at dawn.

987
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:44,490
I think Ms. Pi finds your room suspicious.

988
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:48,536
If you're lying about even
the smallest thing, you will pay for it.

989
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,955
We can never let Bun-ok get wind of it.

990
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,000
If the information is useful,
you get 50 million won.

991
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,336
That bastard is Taedong River 1.
I'm sure of it.

992
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:58,922
If he's in here,
he's like a rat in a trap.

993
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,841
Where can we hide him
in this girls' dormitory?

994
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:04,344
We'll be arrested too.

995
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:08,890
It's D-day. We must capture him.

996
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:21,903
BONUS

997
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:45,426
Joyful dreams in this world

998
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:48,972
Snow full of love falls down

999
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:53,726
If there's a song about our love

1000
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,021
Our lives will become beautiful

1001
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,775
Sorrowful dreams in this world

1002
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:04,821
Rain full of loneliness pours down

1003
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:09,450
If you love with all your compassion

1004
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:13,079
There'll be only the truth and faith left

1005
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:17,041
If I'm a silent wanderer

1006
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,045
I'll become a rock in this world

1007
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:25,300
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love

1008
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,594
-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world

1009
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:31,514
-One more time!
-If I'm a silent

1010
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,099
-wanderer
-Wanderer

1011
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:36,853
-I'll become a rock in this world
-I'll become a rock in this world

1012
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:41,482
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love

1013
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:45,278
-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world

1014
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:50,825
-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world

1015
01:28:54,954 --> 01:28:56,039
This song's great.
