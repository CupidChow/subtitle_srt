EPISODE 3

3
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:20,266
Why would you want to check
this place this late at night?

4
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:24,226
God, it's so dusty here.

5
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:33,656
Oh, no.

6
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:38,946
Open it.

7
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:42,036
Yes, ma'am. I'm looking for the key.

8
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:44,666
Which one is it? There are so many.

9
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:45,956
Now.

10
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:48,456
Okay, I found it.

11
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:57,006
The door's quite stiff.

12
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:16,986
Turn the lights on.

13
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:21,076
Yes, ma'am. Where's the switch?

14
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:22,866
There it is.

15
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:35,466
My, what do we do?
The lights are not working.

16
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:37,846
They're not working?

17
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:40,096
The room hasn't been used for six years,

18
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:42,016
so I didn't know.

19
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,906
KO HYE-RYEONG

20
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:38,946
Why did you come here?

21
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:40,326
Just followed her.

22
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:41,786
You should be here.

23
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:45,996
There's water on the bathroom floor.

24
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,456
Someone must be staying here.

25
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:51,286
Well, the ceiling
must've leaked rainwater.

26
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,836
It didn't rain for days. What rainwater?

27
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,966
It must've been trapped in the ceiling.

28
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:00,506
-Hey.
-I'll come check tomorrow morning.

29
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:01,466
The window.

30
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:05,636
Gosh, this place is so spooky.
Could we go down now?

31
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:07,686
Ma'am.

32
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:13,816
I think there's something out there.

33
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,876
Don't look down.

34
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,876
Look at me instead.

35
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,086
Keep looking at me.

36
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:14,786
-Lock the window.
-Yes, ma'am.

37
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,846
I'll keep the keys from now on.

38
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,766
But I need to fix the water leak
tomorrow morning,

39
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,856
so I should keep them.

40
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:04,856
As you wish, ma'am.

41
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,406
Pick them up tomorrow morning

42
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:11,826
and return them once you're done.

43
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:13,286
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:11,966
Are you okay?

45
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:23,856
Who are you really?

46
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:30,196
Are you Superman or something?

47
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:35,996
You got me.

48
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:38,616
I really thought
I was falling to my death.

49
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,256
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

50
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,396
I should get going.

51
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,956
Are you stupid or just slow?

52
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,246
The wound might've gotten worse.

53
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:25,206
Why don't you
take better care of yourself?

54
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,006
Seriously.

55
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,336
Try not to move today.

56
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,716
If the wound gets infected,
it can get really serious.

57
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:46,816
I think I should…

58
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:55,576
Okay, I will.

59
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:57,736
I'll try not to move.

60
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:10,796
Well, then. I should really get going.

61
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,416
This is bad.
It must've been locked from the outside.

62
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,136
I can't, ma'am.

63
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,636
The rest can get kicked out, but I can't.

64
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:06,806
Kick the rest out, not me, ma'am.

65
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,016
I was trying to tell you.

66
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:12,606
It's all Yeong-ro's fault.

67
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:14,526
We should really tell the cops.

68
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,406
I tried to persuade them to call the cops.

69
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:31,586
What do I do?
What if they find out I'm gone?

70
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:36,506
What if Man-dong can't come
to open the door because of Ms. Pi?

71
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:37,926
What do I do?

72
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,216
This is bad.

73
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,346
Everything will be okay.

74
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,556
Don't worry a thing.

75
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:52,356
I…

76
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:56,356
I'm Superman, you know.

77
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:20,926
Man-dong!

78
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,636
It's me, Jeong-min.

79
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:33,396
Are you all right?

80
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:35,106
Yes, I'm okay.

81
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,736
-What are you doing here at this hour?
-What?

82
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:44,866
My goodness. Let's hurry up
and go to them. They must be panicking.

83
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,866
-Hurry.
-Let me hold it.

84
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:47,906
Okay.

85
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:52,786
Why don't you…

86
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,916
sit here for now?

87
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:00,136
I'm fine.

88
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:05,616
Watch this.

89
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,566
Fold there. And…

90
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:12,636
Yeong-ro.

91
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,096
Yeong-ro.

92
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,066
It's me, Jeong-min.

93
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:28,446
Jeong-min.

94
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:34,616
I was so worried. Are you okay?

95
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:39,666
-Man-dong.
-Hey, you must've been scared.

96
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:41,916
I'm sorry, sir. Because of me…

97
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:44,336
Don't worry about it. More importantly,

98
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:47,886
Ms. Pi will keep the keys to this room
from now on.

99
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,386
What do we do?

100
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:50,886
I should get out of here tonight.

101
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,596
-In that state?
-I have to.

102
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,186
Or you won't be safe.

103
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:01,856
But your wound hasn't healed.

104
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:04,946
Sir.

105
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:07,566
Is there any other way out
than the main gate?

106
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:12,236
Well, there is an emergency exit
students don't know about in the basement.

107
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:14,116
Oh, there is?

108
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,246
Yes. I'll unlock the door for you,

109
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,826
so it's best you leave tonight.

110
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,586
But Man-dong…

111
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,496
You brat.

112
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:25,506
If he stays here and gets caught,
all of us are done for.

113
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:26,716
Exactly.

114
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:29,176
For all of us to be safe,
it's really important

115
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,806
that Soo-ho gets out of here safely
without getting caught, isn't it?

116
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:34,466
Yes, it is. But…

117
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:41,186
The open house is in a few days.

118
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:45,026
Yes. Yeong-ro's right.

119
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,856
On that day,
the dorm will be open to outsiders.

120
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:49,106
Why don't you blend in--

121
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:50,316
I need to get out today.

122
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,866
Let's go, sir.

123
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:04,546
-Be careful.
-Okay.

124
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,006
This way.

125
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,140
Hey, you.

126
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,650
No running.

127
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,280
Constitution Article 32, Section 1.
All citizens shall have the right to work.

128
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,160
My gosh, she's sleepwalking again.

129
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,120
…to promote the employment
of workers and to guarantee

130
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,370
optimum wages
through social and economic means and…

131
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,800
All citizens shall have the right to work.

132
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,260
Constitution Article 32, Section 1.
All citizens shall have the right to work.

133
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,220
The State shall endeavor
to promote the employment of workers

134
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,810
and to guarantee optimum wages
through social and economic means…

135
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,480
and shall enforce a minimum wage system
under the conditions as prescribed by Act.

136
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,280
<i>Hey, you.</i>

137
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,410
<i>No running.</i>

138
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,830
Constitution Article 32, Section 1.
All citizens shall have the right to work.

139
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,630
Hurry. Go now.

140
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,020
This way.

141
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,060
Hello, sir.

142
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,980
How did they…

143
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,950
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

144
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,740
See anything suspicious, and radio me.

145
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,660
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

146
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,920
You never know what could happen,
so don't let your guard down.

147
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,330
Keep a sharp lookout.

148
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,040
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

149
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,450
Upon people's entrance,
we'll draw for the Lucky Man.

150
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,280
And we'll have
nice and funny prizes ready,

151
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,830
so please encourage them
to participate in the event.

152
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,370
Just like last year, Speed Typing Game
and <i>Yut</i> will be played on the first floor,

153
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,960
and Paintball and Love Newspapers
on the second floor.

154
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,380
OPEN HOUSE

155
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,550
And Quiz King and Whack-a-Mole
will be played on the third floor.

156
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,560
For the dance party, a folk dance will--

157
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,680
We have an open house only once a year.

158
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,060
Mi-seon, Hyeon-suk, show them.

159
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,830
What are we, six-year-olds?

160
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,450
What's with a folk dance every year?

161
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,370
Hye-ryeong.

162
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,750
The hall director wants it
to be a social dance.

163
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,710
Look.

164
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,500
The open house is an event for us.

165
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,420
Tell her to stay out of it.

166
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,430
I also don't think
Pi should tell us what to do about this.

167
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,390
Then as for the dance party,
I'll ask Ms. Pi again--

168
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,720
Hey!

169
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,100
If we're always to do
as the hall director says,

170
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,810
what do we need an RA for?

171
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,270
Don't you agree?

172
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,520
We'll go

173
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,730
with disco. You hear me?

174
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,030
-Hear, hear!
-Seol-hui.

175
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,570
-Disco!
-Disco!

176
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,340
Oh, right. What are the prizes this year?

177
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,850
They are much better than last year.

178
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,770
Third place, a cassette player.
Second place, a Polaroid camera.

179
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,400
And the winner gets a computer.

180
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,110
-Quiet!
-Silence!

181
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,450
And all of the prizes will be provided
by Yoon Seol-hui's father.

182
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,990
-Yoon Seol-hui!
-Yoon Seol-hui!

183
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,040
-Yoon Seol-hui!
-Yoon Seol-hui!

184
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,880
Next item on the agenda is
the guest singer. Who should we invite?

185
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,090
Kim Wan-sun.

186
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,840
Kim Wan-sun!

187
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,430
Kim Wan-sun.

188
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,350
Kim Wan-sun!

189
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,350
Kim Wan-sun!

190
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,230
Kim Wan-sun!

191
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,650
Kim Wan-sun!

192
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,270
A game booth will be set up
on the second floor,

193
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,190
so it'll be the most crowded area.

194
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,860
<i>It'll be okay
if you come down there naturally</i>

195
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,490
<i>since male students can come
into the dorm that day.</i>

196
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,830
But if male students can come in,

197
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,740
the cops staking out this place
can come in too.

198
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,710
You need an invitation to get in,
so don't worry about it.

199
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,170
The ticket checking will be done by two,

200
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,880
so you should come down after that.

201
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,800
Why though? Didn't you say
the open house begins at one?

202
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,760
Remember your partner
on the group blind date? Bun-ok…

203
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,310
No, Seong will check the tickets.

204
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,730
<i>And she knows your face.</i>

205
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,060
You should only focus
on healing your wound.

206
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,360
Okay?

207
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm sorry.

208
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,620
It's your first open house,
and because of me…

209
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,370
Just think about
how you'll get out safely.

210
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,750
I mean, this isn't
the last open house I'll ever have.

211
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,500
And who knows?

212
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,970
I might end up inviting you next year.

213
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,690
I'm late for class. Darn it.

214
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,690
I'll get going.

215
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,500
HAEDAL BOARDING HOUSE

216
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,460
This is the room?

217
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,210
Yes, it is.

218
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,390
I told you, Ms. Bong.
You shouldn't let strangers in like this.

219
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,100
They said they're cops

220
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,440
and are looking for Soo-ho.

221
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,940
Cops?

222
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,940
Why would cops look for Soo-ho?

223
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,780
"Soo-ho"?

224
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,990
You must be close to him.

225
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,580
Of course,
he and I are the closest in this…

226
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,540
Wait a minute.

227
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,830
Why are you asking me about that?

228
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,710
When did he leave this house?

229
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,790
-He--
-Stop.

230
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,500
If you're really cops, show me your IDs.

231
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,550
Searching a house without a warrant
can get you three years in prison.

232
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,350
What the…

233
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,150
Agency for National Security… ANSP?

234
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,990
Oh, my…

235
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,950
Oh Gwang-tae.

236
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,500
Let's talk about Soo-ho.

237
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,260
That bastard wanted to treat me to
pork belly before going back to Germany.

238
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,260
So I ate it with him and other students
in the boarding house.

239
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,560
That's all.

240
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,020
Aren't you two close?

241
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,440
No, we aren't.

242
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,980
Not at all.

243
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,270
Your friend Soo-ho

244
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,070
will show up around Professor Han again.

245
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,320
All right?

246
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,030
That damn communist.

247
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,790
I'll call you as soon as I see him!

248
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,790
Keep me posted on Han's every move too.

249
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,040
Yes, sir.

250
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,590
But why?

251
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,800
What was that?

252
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,760
Who said you could ask questions?

253
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,390
-I'll keep you posted at all times.
-And about how you were questioned here?

254
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,940
I swear I'll never tell anyone about it.

255
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,810
Maintain the space and formation.

256
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,950
Mount 049-64 Y.

257
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,530
Mount 052-82 B.

258
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,750
What are you doing?

259
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,580
We're looking for a place
they might have used as a stash.

260
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,250
We took their weapons,
so if they're to continue with--

261
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,420
I told you to take your hands off it!

262
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,850
Why on earth

263
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,270
are you telling us to stop?

264
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,770
There's no why. Just do as I say!

265
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,400
Do you hear yourself?

266
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,490
How could the Chief of--

267
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,950
"Obedience to orders."
Don't you know that's our motto?

268
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,370
Obedience to orders?

269
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,790
We have clear evidence here.
Yet you want us to stop?

270
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,250
Even when we made

271
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,710
innocent people spies without evidence,

272
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,920
did you stick
to this "obedience to orders"?

273
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,170
You son of a b****!
Have you forgotten that I'm your boss?

274
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,680
People like you ruin an organization.

275
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,180
Pretending to be all just.

276
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Tumors must be

277
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,390
taken out for an organization to run well.

278
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,060
You're right.

279
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,230
TEAM LEADER LEE GANG-MU

280
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,040
Hey. This is Chief An.

281
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,620
Pull back forces looking for Han
and staking out at Hosu University.

282
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,380
This is Black Tiger.

283
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,840
Search Mount Ogong
for a dead drop from now on. Over.

284
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,130
You bastard.

285
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,900
He must be in there.

286
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,940
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

287
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:18,970
Bun-ok.

288
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,590
What brings you here?

289
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,100
Ms. Pi raided this place last night.

290
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,220
-Here?
-Something doesn't feel right.

291
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,810
Maybe…

292
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,400
the spy is hiding in there.

293
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,440
Come on. I doubt that.

294
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,660
How could he go in there?

295
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,700
It's been shut down for six years.

296
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,750
That's true.

297
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,540
You don't have to help me.

298
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,100
I heard water leaked from there.
It's never happened before.

299
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,640
Ghosts don't use water, do they?

300
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,140
If someone in this dorm helped him,

301
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,230
he might be hiding in there.

302
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,990
Come on, Bun-ok. You're scaring me.

303
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,780
Wait a minute. You're being weird.

304
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,540
You're hiding something from me.

305
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,580
Of course not.

306
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,420
What would I be hiding from you?

307
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,310
You know that the only person
I trust in this dorm is you,

308
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,770
right?

309
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Yes, I know that.

310
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,650
That's good then.

311
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,570
See you.

312
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,550
He's kind of

313
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,680
a behind-the-scenes advisor.

314
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,140
Since President Park,
popular politicians have been

315
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,890
dying to have an audience with him.

316
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,350
He's known for being discreet
about who he meets.

317
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,440
Especially right before elections.

318
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,480
Consider yourselves lucky.

319
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,110
Let's go.

320
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,680
Oh, my goodness.

321
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,240
It's my husband's time of birth.

322
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,830
Your eyes and voice say
you're quite ambitious.

323
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,040
Pardon?

324
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,090
You want to make
your husband president, don't you?

325
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,350
Oh, come on, sir.

326
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,690
You're being too straightforward.

327
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,770
Mrs. Hong must be so flustered.

328
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,740
Oh, my.

329
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,990
It says he's like a dragon ascending into
the sky with a magical bead in his mouth.

330
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
Really?

331
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,750
But this is bad.

332
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,790
He has bad luck this year.

333
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,670
He could be devoured by a tiger.

334
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,680
Meaning, one small mistake,
and he might lose his life.

335
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,350
Sorry?

336
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,930
Then what should he do?

337
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,100
He should get rid of bad luck.

338
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,810
His ancestors' sins can't be

339
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,190
absolved by any rites.

340
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,110
He must rid of them himself.

341
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,370
-His ancestors' sins?
-His family clan is from Gonyeo, isn't it?

342
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,200
Yes.

343
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,200
He's the 27th son of the Gonyeo Eun Clan.

344
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,500
See how good he is?

345
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,120
Once upon a time,

346
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,250
when the Snake God ruled the world,

347
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,090
the people

348
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,300
offered a young virgin as a sacrifice

349
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,140
to appease the Snake God

350
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,180
and to protect their homes.

351
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,220
However,

352
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,640
one day a guy named Gonyeo Eun showed up,

353
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,190
gathered 13 strong men,

354
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,060
and

355
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,820
killed the Snake God.

356
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,780
The people rejoiced.

357
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,240
But Gonyeo Eun died from
falling off his horse on his way back.

358
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,370
You must appease the Snake God's anger
within the year of the hare.

359
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,130
Within this year?

360
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,420
How?

361
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,050
What did I say was offered as a sacrifice?

362
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,590
-A young virgin?
-A young virgin?

363
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,220
If 13 young virgins are
offered as sacrifices,

364
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,850
the Snake God's anger will be appeased.

365
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,620
Are you saying we have to

366
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,540
kill 13 young virgins?

367
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,590
Whether he'll ascend into the sky
with a magical bead

368
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,340
or die from falling off a horse,

369
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,720
it all depends on 13 young virgins.

370
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,430
<i>How will they kill 13 young virgins?</i>

371
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,720
<i>He'll end up dying
from falling off a horse then.</i>

372
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,510
19:50, the director hall arrived
and is heading inside.

373
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,300
<i>Understood.</i>

374
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,820
-Move!
-Oh, my God!

375
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,900
Hello, ma'am.

376
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,740
-Hello, ma'am.
-Gye Bun-ok!

377
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,630
Hye-ryeong's furious.

378
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,680
-"Gye Bun-ok!"
-What's going on?

379
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
What's this about?

380
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,890
My ring and Seol-hui's sneakers are gone.

381
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,480
Come in.

382
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,530
This is bad.

383
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,530
I knew this would happen.
She's in trouble now.

384
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,490
Do you have proof it was Bun-ok's doing?

385
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,960
Do you have proof?

386
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,340
-I--
-Students shouldn't keep expensive stuff.

387
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,260
It's partially your fault!

388
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,680
Stop suspecting someone without proof

389
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,940
and send anything expensive home!

390
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,150
You shouldn't make others
covet what's yours!

391
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,400
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

392
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,460
-Yeong-ro.
-Yes?

393
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,920
Could you tell her to give me
back my ring while I'm being nice?

394
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,420
Are you…

395
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,550
saying that for me to hear?

396
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,430
Bun-ok, how could you--

397
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,640
Jeong-min.

398
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,230
Hey, just forget it.

399
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,300
I'll go get some fresh air.

400
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,470
Come in. Now.

401
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,990
Are you jealous?

402
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,740
Are you jealous of them?

403
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,120
If you steal their stuff
and wear them, did you think…

404
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,420
you could become like them?

405
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,930
Yes, I am.

406
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,180
I am jealous of them.

407
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,720
The fact that I wasn't born into
a good family like them makes me angry.

408
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,650
But do you really think I believe
I can become like them if I wear theirs?

409
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,900
You think I'm that stupid?

410
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,730
That's right.

411
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,740
Your life and their lives are different.

412
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,030
Know your place
and stop trying to be like them.

413
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,330
Put everything back where they belong.

414
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,210
I'll forgive you this once.

415
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,970
But not ever again.

416
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,140
Behave yourself from now on.

417
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,060
Get out.

418
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,040
I can't sleep.

419
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,380
What's wrong with her?

420
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,840
She must've gone insane.

421
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,130
How could she take that thief's side?

422
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,130
Tell me about it.

423
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,430
She searches our room all the time.

424
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,680
But why won't she search Bun-ok's room?

425
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,930
I'm sure her room's
full of stuff she's stolen.

426
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,520
Do you think

427
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,690
Bun-ok has something on Ms. Pi?

428
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,770
Come on.

429
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,480
I doubt that.

430
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,570
You know Ms. Pi would never let anyone
take advantage of her.

431
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,410
3 DAYS BEFORE THE OPEN HOUSE

432
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,460
The prize for second place!

433
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,800
We should never invite him.

434
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
I mean, Gwang-tae.

435
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,680
He knows Soo-ho's face.

436
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,680
You're right.
God, he's such a careless loose cannon.

437
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,810
I'll invite Byeong-tae for Paintball.

438
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
And how about your partner, Seol-hui?

439
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,350
Seok-jun and Gwang-tae are
in the same college club.

440
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,020
Do you think it'll be okay?

441
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,980
Seok-jun doesn't know Soo-ho's face.
It'll be okay.

442
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,440
Oh, right.

443
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,200
Jeong-min, can we
get a bicycle ready that day?

444
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:56,700
Why?

445
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,620
The cops will be guarding the main gate,

446
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,410
so it'll be safer for him
to ride a bicycle than to walk.

447
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,290
You're right. There's one
in my club room. I'll bring it.

448
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,210
Thank you.

449
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,630
We'll be late for class.

450
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,550
What will you do about his clothes?

451
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,640
He'll get caught if he wears his.

452
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,680
Everyone will wear a suit.

453
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,980
I should try to get one.

454
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:58,970
Hello?

455
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,180
This is Yeong-ro.

456
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,060
Oh, my, Yeong-ro.

457
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,900
I heard you're in Seoul.
How could you not come visit me once?

458
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,310
Well, I'm actually calling you about that.

459
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,780
I was wondering
when only you will be at the house.

460
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,280
Then how about tomorrow?

461
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,370
Mrs. Hong is golfing tomorrow,
so she'll be out all day.

462
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,490
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

463
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,010
-Can I get a cup of lemon tea?
-Yes, ma'am.

464
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,770
Hey.

465
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,940
I'm so sorry,

466
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,980
but I can't play golf with you tomorrow.

467
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,110
I have a guest coming tomorrow.

468
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,280
<i>Those damn commie guerillas.</i>

469
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,780
Do they want to negotiate or not?

470
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,450
It's been days!

471
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,830
If they don't come talk to us today,

472
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,040
let's just tell them we'll go back.

473
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,000
What?

474
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,130
Don't you know we're the desperate ones
here? That's ridiculous.

475
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,430
We should take
the initiative in the negotiation.

476
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,800
What they're after is money.
I don't think they'll give it up. Right?

477
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,850
Don't presume or prejudge anything.

478
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,390
What do you know?

479
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,810
And this is happening
because you couldn't control your men.

480
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,280
What?

481
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,990
What did you just say?

482
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,160
Look,

483
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,910
Chang-su.

484
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,620
Don't forget I'm your predecessor.

485
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:50,620
I was the director before you!

486
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,500
You didn't even join the revolution.

487
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,130
You just followed me around. How dare you.

488
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,220
What, you scumbag?

489
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,680
You killed your superior
to climb the ladder, but what?

490
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,100
Shut up, you bastard!
I didn't betray anyone!

491
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,480
I was just serving the country loyally!
Don't call me a betrayer, you bastard!

492
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
You're the one who ruined
this administration!

493
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,980
No, I'm the one who made it possible!

494
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,820
I made this administration possible!

495
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,570
Let go! Let go of it, you bastard!

496
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,660
-You…
-Let go.

497
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,700
What do you know about loyalty?
Let go of my hair! It hurts!

498
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,330
Hold on.

499
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,330
He's here.

500
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,630
My goodness. Beijing has such a nice view.

501
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,130
Tell me about it.

502
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,720
Have a seat, please.

503
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,900
I'm not here to negotiate

504
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,560
but to hear your explanation.

505
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,070
Is it true that ANSP agents were the ones
who chased our agents?

506
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,570
I apologize.
Due to some unavoidable situation--

507
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,490
You think we did it on purpose?

508
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,200
We're also so frustrated--

509
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,500
The South is to blame for the failure.

510
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,080
You're on your own
for the presidential election!

511
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,050
That little son of a--

512
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,610
God damn it!

513
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,940
We'll break in and rescue him at once.

514
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,910
Seeing as ANSP is keeping a close watch,
he must be hiding in the dorm.

515
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,530
If you act rashly,
you might end up getting hurt.

516
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,540
Wait three more days.

517
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,580
<i>If it's not confirmed
that he's alive within exactly 72 hours,</i>

518
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,250
follow the protocol.

519
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,000
Yes, ma'am.

520
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,810
A DAY BEFORE THE OPEN HOUSE

521
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,730
EUN CHANG-SU

522
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,630
Ma'am!

523
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,400
Why are you taking your brother's shoes

524
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,690
and suit?

525
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,610
What's it to you?

526
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,240
They're my brother's.

527
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,490
Look.

528
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,120
You came here
for the first time in ten years.

529
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,160
It's been ten years since you left
to live with your maternal grandma.

530
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,000
I get that you hate me,

531
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,290
but I'm your stepmom.

532
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,920
Shouldn't you say hello to me?

533
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,010
Hello.

534
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,510
You haven't changed.

535
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,220
You haven't changed

536
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,260
at all.

537
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,520
You haven't changed as well.

538
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,230
You always take your guilt out on me.

539
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,280
Did I kill your mom?
Why do you take it out on me?

540
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,550
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

541
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:44,390
THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

542
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,990
It fits me like a glove.

543
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,410
The shoes do too.

544
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,220
Put your clothes in this bag tomorrow.

545
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,600
I'll keep it
and give it to you next time we meet.

546
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,520
How's your leg?

547
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,110
I think it's almost healed.

548
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,080
Thank you for everything.

549
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,540
Thanks to you…

550
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,550
THE DAY OF THE OPEN HOUSE

551
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,030
Shall we go?

552
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,170
NOTICE

553
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:23,196
Hello, ma'am.

554
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:24,526
What were you doing here?

555
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:36,666
He's my partner for the day,
and he wanted to look around the rooftop.

556
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:44,466
Don't you know
the rooftop isn't open to outsiders?

557
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:51,926
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I pestered her to take me here.

558
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:55,976
I'm sorry.

559
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:11,286
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM

560
00:57:11,906 --> 00:57:12,946
How could she…

561
00:57:13,036 --> 00:57:14,496
<i>I'm sorry, Gwang-tae.</i>

562
00:57:14,576 --> 00:57:18,376
I'll invite a military man
to the open house this year.

563
00:57:18,456 --> 00:57:21,876
You understand that, right?
You know I prefer free love.

564
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,506
Free love, my foot.

565
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:27,086
I'll crush that guy today.

566
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:31,096
<i>I'll take a photo for you.</i>

567
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:32,426
One, two, three.

568
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:33,636
Cheese!

569
00:57:34,226 --> 00:57:35,936
Hey, you too. I'll take a photo for you.

570
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:38,896
Smile! One, two, three.

571
00:57:41,106 --> 00:57:42,226
He's my date.

572
00:57:45,356 --> 00:57:47,156
It's checked. Go on.

573
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:48,156
Hey.

574
00:57:48,236 --> 00:57:50,236
Room 209. You know that, right?

575
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:54,156
Sure.

576
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,456
-Go on.
-Thanks.

577
00:58:37,496 --> 00:58:38,576
Cheese!

578
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:41,456
Come for the photo later.

579
00:58:49,046 --> 00:58:49,926
Seol-hui!

580
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,106
Seol-hui.

581
00:59:11,026 --> 00:59:12,406
I'm sorry.

582
00:59:16,576 --> 00:59:17,406
Seol-hui!

583
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,326
-Where's she?
-Excuse me.

584
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,204
-Show me your ticket.
-I'm sorry.

585
00:59:22,286 --> 00:59:24,836
What was her name?
I'm Yoon Seol-hui's date.

586
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:26,586
Yoon Seol-hui?

587
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,836
ROOM 207 YOON SEOL-HUI

588
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,296
Yoon Seol-hui?

589
00:59:33,006 --> 00:59:35,176
Wasn't he seeing Hye-ryeong?

590
00:59:37,846 --> 00:59:39,596
YUT GAME

591
00:59:48,226 --> 00:59:49,816
Time's ticking.

592
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:52,156
SPEED TYPING COMPETITION

593
00:59:56,786 --> 00:59:57,866
Seol-hui?

594
01:00:02,116 --> 01:00:03,496
What's going on?

595
01:00:03,576 --> 01:00:05,166
I'm sorry. Why?

596
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,336
Hey, why are you avoiding me?

597
01:00:10,466 --> 01:00:11,836
Listen.

598
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,096
I'm sorry. I must've surprised you.

599
01:00:15,176 --> 01:00:17,756
You see, Seok-jun has
irritable bowel syndrome.

600
01:00:17,846 --> 01:00:20,516
He must've gotten nervous
right before the open house.

601
01:00:20,676 --> 01:00:22,766
He had diarrhea in the morning.

602
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:25,226
So I came in his place.

603
01:00:25,726 --> 01:00:29,936
But still, you can't just come here
without telling me in advance.

604
01:00:30,776 --> 01:00:34,446
I mean,
you're seeing Hye-ryeong after all.

605
01:00:34,946 --> 01:00:39,236
Hye-ryeong? She says she prefers
free love and dates several guys at once.

606
01:00:39,326 --> 01:00:44,246
So she can't really complain about me
being your date for the open house.

607
01:00:44,746 --> 01:00:45,876
Darn it…

608
01:00:50,206 --> 01:00:51,206
I mean,

609
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:53,376
don't you agree?

610
01:00:55,966 --> 01:00:57,716
Still, you're

611
01:00:57,796 --> 01:01:00,926
not the guy I invited, Gwang-tae!

612
01:01:19,656 --> 01:01:20,946
Goodbye, then.

613
01:01:23,536 --> 01:01:25,666
Hey, he's willing to do the questionnaire.

614
01:01:26,036 --> 01:01:27,326
Seol-hui.

615
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:28,786
Hi, there.

616
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:30,546
Who invited you here?

617
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,426
Hurry up! Now!

618
01:01:40,426 --> 01:01:43,016
I'm good, aren't I?

619
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:44,136
Hurry!

620
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:45,516
I'm a marksman--

621
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:50,016
-That little…
-Byeong-tae.

622
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:53,776
-I'm like the right-arm of the country.
-You're so cool.

623
01:01:53,856 --> 01:01:56,026
-Hye-ryeong, did you see? My right arm…
-Yes?

624
01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:04,286
If you hate me that much,
I'll just leave after seeing Hye-ryeong.

625
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:05,576
Do you know where she is?

626
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:11,796
Then why don't you go wait in room 207?

627
01:02:12,336 --> 01:02:14,876
I'm sure she'll show him
around the room first. This way.

628
01:02:15,546 --> 01:02:16,376
This way.

629
01:02:23,886 --> 01:02:26,096
I'll shoot once more!

630
01:02:27,516 --> 01:02:29,976
All right. Let's see how it'll go.

631
01:02:33,356 --> 01:02:34,276
What are you doing?

632
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:37,196
Hye-ryeong!

633
01:02:37,276 --> 01:02:38,526
-I won!
-He's really good!

634
01:02:38,606 --> 01:02:40,156
I hit every single one!

635
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,156
Hey, you there.

636
01:02:47,706 --> 01:02:48,536
Stop.

637
01:02:54,246 --> 01:02:55,376
Hey.

638
01:02:58,796 --> 01:02:59,876
This is ridiculous.

639
01:03:01,086 --> 01:03:02,096
Byeong-tae.

640
01:03:02,676 --> 01:03:03,756
What are you doing?

641
01:03:04,466 --> 01:03:05,516
Just a second, Hye-ryeong.

642
01:03:09,016 --> 01:03:10,396
It looks easy, doesn't it?

643
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:13,316
Why don't you give it a try?
I'll correct your stance.

644
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:16,986
It's okay. Don't be so shy.

645
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:19,026
Come on.

646
01:03:19,106 --> 01:03:20,946
All right, make way for him.

647
01:03:23,576 --> 01:03:25,236
Are you crazy? Why did you come in here?

648
01:03:25,326 --> 01:03:26,826
Gwang-tae is here.

649
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:28,246
What? Gwang--

650
01:03:28,826 --> 01:03:31,536
Gwang-tae is here? How?
I didn't invite him.

651
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:34,126
Here's the new challenger.
Give it up for him.

652
01:03:36,456 --> 01:03:37,376
Pay attention.

653
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:40,046
Put your left leg forward, turn your body,

654
01:03:40,126 --> 01:03:42,586
hold the pistol with your right hand,

655
01:03:42,676 --> 01:03:44,176
wrap it with your left hand,

656
01:03:44,256 --> 01:03:45,756
and relax your elbow.

657
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:48,476
The horse stance!

658
01:03:52,766 --> 01:03:54,856
All right, I think it's time.

659
01:03:54,936 --> 01:03:59,646
We've prepared a more difficult
version of the game this year.

660
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:01,696
What do you say? Do you want to try it?

661
01:04:02,776 --> 01:04:03,906
Yes.

662
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:06,276
All right, then.

663
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,536
Spin it, please.

664
01:04:13,626 --> 01:04:14,916
Okay.

665
01:04:38,896 --> 01:04:40,606
Applaud!

666
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:43,356
He's this year's best marksman!

667
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:45,986
See?

668
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:48,236
It's all thanks
to the stance I taught you, right?

669
01:04:48,866 --> 01:04:52,326
Hey, wait.
You should take this bear. It's the prize.

670
01:05:34,036 --> 01:05:35,246
Who's that guy?

671
01:05:35,826 --> 01:05:36,996
Yeong-ro's partner.

672
01:05:37,076 --> 01:05:38,166
He's handsome.

673
01:05:56,436 --> 01:05:59,976
Hey, it's starting.
Come on, it's time for the couple's dance.

674
01:06:13,496 --> 01:06:14,786
Hey, handsome!

675
01:06:15,956 --> 01:06:17,206
Baekha Brewery.

676
01:06:17,996 --> 01:06:19,286
Baekha Brewery.

677
01:06:19,746 --> 01:06:21,496
Baekha Brewery. Oh, my.

678
01:06:22,496 --> 01:06:24,546
You must love drinking.

679
01:06:24,626 --> 01:06:27,836
A calendar and a table clock
from Baekha Brewery.

680
01:06:27,926 --> 01:06:29,586
It's my dad's company.

681
01:06:30,296 --> 01:06:31,506
Your dad's company?

682
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:36,886
Then

683
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:39,516
the president of Baekha Brewery

684
01:06:40,516 --> 01:06:42,266
is your father?

685
01:06:51,406 --> 01:06:55,866
You know,
the only alcohol I drink is Baekha Soju.

686
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:57,996
I see.

687
01:06:59,576 --> 01:07:03,126
The couple's dance contest
is happening in the cafeteria.

688
01:07:03,206 --> 01:07:04,746
I'm sure Hye-ryeong is there.

689
01:07:04,836 --> 01:07:06,166
Seol-hui.

690
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:15,386
You know something?

691
01:07:18,596 --> 01:07:20,396
On the day of our blind date,

692
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:23,976
I really hoped

693
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:27,816
you would pick my exam pass certificate.

694
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,196
Really?

695
01:07:35,236 --> 01:07:38,286
Seok-jun had diarrhea in the morning
today of all days,

696
01:07:38,366 --> 01:07:40,326
and Hye-ryeong didn't invite me.

697
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:43,536
Do you think it's all a coincidence? No.

698
01:07:45,206 --> 01:07:46,706
No, it's not.

699
01:07:48,336 --> 01:07:51,836
I'm telling you. We're meant to be.

700
01:07:54,006 --> 01:07:55,306
It's our

701
01:07:56,216 --> 01:07:57,466
destiny.

702
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:02,476
Have you seen Yeong-ro? Why hasn't she--

703
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:07,856
Do you want to go out and have some tea?

704
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:16,866
Right, Yeong-ro.

705
01:08:16,946 --> 01:08:17,866
<i>Guys.</i>

706
01:08:17,946 --> 01:08:19,446
Let's do this!

707
01:09:14,126 --> 01:09:17,846
A hearty welcome
to everyone who came to this party!

708
01:09:18,846 --> 01:09:20,926
We proudly present today's DJ!

709
01:09:21,016 --> 01:09:24,096
DJ Blue Jacket!

710
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:26,606
Go try it too.

711
01:09:27,186 --> 01:09:28,856
Make some noise!

712
01:09:39,026 --> 01:09:40,786
Go try it too. Go dance.

713
01:09:40,866 --> 01:09:43,286
-No.
-Why? Just go!

714
01:09:43,366 --> 01:09:44,406
I'm good.

715
01:09:54,626 --> 01:09:55,876
Oh, it's okay.

716
01:09:55,966 --> 01:09:57,086
I'm good.

717
01:10:01,636 --> 01:10:03,266
Go dance!

718
01:10:05,346 --> 01:10:08,646
-Eun Yeong-ro.
-Eun Yeong-ro.

719
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:12,776
-Eun Yeong-ro!
-Eun Yeong-ro!

720
01:10:12,856 --> 01:10:16,236
-Eun Yeong-ro!
-Eun Yeong-ro!

721
01:10:16,316 --> 01:10:19,446
-Eun Yeong-ro!
-Eun Yeong-ro!

722
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:22,576
-Eun Yeong-ro!
-Eun Yeong-ro!

723
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:24,366
-Eun Yeong-ro!
-Eun Yeong-ro!

724
01:11:03,736 --> 01:11:05,156
Go for it!

725
01:12:58,566 --> 01:12:59,566
Hey, Yeong-ro.

726
01:13:01,026 --> 01:13:01,946
Yeong-ro?

727
01:13:05,196 --> 01:13:06,366
Yeong-ro.

728
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:08,786
Stop ruining the mood and get out.

729
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:34,186
<i>Wall C, clear.</i>

730
01:13:47,816 --> 01:13:49,946
-What took you so long?
-I'm sorry.

731
01:13:53,786 --> 01:13:54,616
Thank you.

732
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:59,706
I'll keep it. You should go now.

733
01:14:14,176 --> 01:14:15,556
Yeong-ro, get on it too.

734
01:14:16,136 --> 01:14:16,976
What?

735
01:14:17,056 --> 01:14:19,606
It's safer for you two to go together.

736
01:14:20,226 --> 01:14:21,226
Now!

737
01:14:35,746 --> 01:14:37,036
Go!

738
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:45,876
Have a nice time together!

739
01:14:58,186 --> 01:15:00,186
Those little…

740
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:02,726
<i>Hye-ryeong invited another guy.</i>

741
01:15:03,186 --> 01:15:06,276
How could she… I'm not
interested in her anymore. I mean it.

742
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:08,486
But still,

743
01:15:09,106 --> 01:15:10,736
if she finds out--

744
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,326
I told you, Seol-hui.

745
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:15,576
We're meant to be.

746
01:15:44,726 --> 01:15:45,566
Here.

747
01:15:56,196 --> 01:15:57,036
This is Lion.

748
01:15:57,116 --> 01:15:59,326
We found Taedong River 1's pistol.

749
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:38,746
You know the dorm's phone number, right?

750
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:49,206
And you know that I live in room 207,

751
01:16:49,836 --> 01:16:51,006
right?

752
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:03,266
I'll have to give you back your clothes.

753
01:18:06,826 --> 01:18:10,206
I'm relieved to see you go,
but it feels weird.

754
01:18:18,636 --> 01:18:19,756
I'll get going.

755
01:18:20,926 --> 01:18:22,136
Take care.

756
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:46,076
Seol-hui, I'm telling you,

757
01:18:47,286 --> 01:18:48,826
we're meant to be.

758
01:19:12,686 --> 01:19:13,686
That damn communist.

759
01:19:14,066 --> 01:19:16,856
I'll call you as soon as I see him!

760
01:19:17,816 --> 01:19:19,356
That bastard.

761
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:24,076
I need to go to the restroom.

762
01:19:36,296 --> 01:19:37,376
Hello?

763
01:19:37,466 --> 01:19:39,426
Lim Soo-ho's here!

764
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:42,296
Soo-ho showed up
in front of Hosu University's main gate.

765
01:19:42,386 --> 01:19:44,256
Yes. Hurry up!

766
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,776
Be safe.

767
01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:19,296
<i>Sir!</i>

768
01:20:19,876 --> 01:20:20,756
Sir!

769
01:20:22,006 --> 01:20:23,296
He showed up.

770
01:20:24,046 --> 01:20:25,216
Come again.

771
01:20:25,676 --> 01:20:28,016
<i>I repeat. This is Mount Geumso.</i>

772
01:20:28,096 --> 01:20:31,136
<i>We got intel that Lim Soo-ho's
on a bicycle in front of the main gate.</i>

773
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,266
<i>-Over.</i>
-Let's go.

774
01:22:52,196 --> 01:22:54,286
<i>Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.</i>

775
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:56,076
<i>She saw a guy that she'd never let in.</i>

776
01:22:56,156 --> 01:22:58,826
<i>That's right.
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.</i>

777
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:00,416
<i>That guy is…</i>

778
01:23:00,496 --> 01:23:01,706
the spy?

779
01:23:01,796 --> 01:23:04,876
She'll never let it slide.

780
01:23:05,466 --> 01:23:08,466
<i>They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.</i>

781
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:11,046
<i>Don't you think you're such easy prey?</i>

782
01:23:11,136 --> 01:23:12,176
<i>"Hosu Women's University…"</i>

783
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,516
<i>"Having been searched.
Hoping to go to the North."</i>

784
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:15,926
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

785
01:23:16,516 --> 01:23:18,846
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

786
01:23:19,436 --> 01:23:20,766
<i>Just once.</i>

787
01:23:23,526 --> 01:23:24,856
<i>Just once.</i>

788
01:23:25,436 --> 01:23:26,526
<i>We need to capture him.</i>

789
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:30,866
<i>But if you're about to lose him,
you're allowed to kill him.</i>

790
01:23:33,866 --> 01:23:35,036
<i>Soo-ho…</i>

791
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,206
BONUS

792
01:23:47,046 --> 01:23:49,466
Oh, my God. You're so pretty.

793
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:52,096
What do you think, Dr. Kang?
Do you like it?

794
01:23:53,346 --> 01:23:55,136
Well, I rarely wear skirts, so…

795
01:23:55,216 --> 01:23:58,016
Charlotte recommended it herself.

796
01:23:58,096 --> 01:23:59,346
So just wear it.

797
01:23:59,436 --> 01:24:00,646
It's a gift for me.

798
01:24:01,856 --> 01:24:03,936
I appreciate the gesture,

799
01:24:04,016 --> 01:24:06,436
but I can't accept this.

800
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:09,736
Besides, I only wear loose pants.

801
01:24:15,326 --> 01:24:16,826
See how she is?

802
01:24:17,406 --> 01:24:19,916
She's so simple and frank.

803
01:24:26,206 --> 01:24:29,216
So she's Mr. Nam's doctor?

804
01:24:29,296 --> 01:24:30,126
Yes.

805
01:24:30,216 --> 01:24:35,346
If I were you, I wouldn't let such
a pretty, young girl be with my husband.

806
01:24:35,926 --> 01:24:37,426
My husband's blood pressure is high.

807
01:24:37,516 --> 01:24:40,636
He once collapsed on a plane
on his way back from the US,

808
01:24:40,726 --> 01:24:42,556
and Dr. Kang saved him.

809
01:24:42,646 --> 01:24:44,606
But still.

810
01:24:44,686 --> 01:24:46,186
She's so pretty.

811
01:24:46,266 --> 01:24:47,936
You think I'm an idiot?

812
01:24:48,026 --> 01:24:52,406
I asked that fortuneteller
with her time of birth,

813
01:24:52,736 --> 01:24:53,986
and he said

814
01:24:54,066 --> 01:24:57,076
I should have her
stay by his side like a talisman.
