EPISODE 4

3
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,826
But this is…

4
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,406
Your sister gave it to you.

5
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:06,116
I think I can only leave…

6
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,706
without worrying about you

7
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:13,966
when I know you're wearing it.

8
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:30,476
But you need to wear it to stay safe.

9
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,726
I'm not the one being chased.

10
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,196
Just keep it.

11
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,826
It's the only thing I can give you.

12
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:55,126
Lim Soo-ho…

13
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,586
What's taking them so long?

14
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,506
They're going to miss him.

15
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:00,756
Damn it.

16
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:11,856
Gwang-tae, don't tell me
you called the cops.

17
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:13,856
If you know who he really is--

18
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:17,146
If he gets caught, I'll be arrested too!

19
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,906
Why will you be arrested?
You have nothing to do with him.

20
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,826
My roommates

21
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,826
have been hiding him.

22
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,876
He came into our room,

23
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:36,006
so we've been hiding him.

24
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,296
Darn it.

25
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,756
You traitor!

26
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,516
Yeong-ro!

27
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,396
Gwang-tae saw him!

28
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,066
Hurry up. Go now!

29
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,786
Will you be okay?

30
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,876
I'll be okay. So go.

31
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,336
Go now.

32
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:27,636
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

33
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:29,806
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

34
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:31,306
THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

35
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,146
Hey!

36
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:49,906
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

37
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:52,746
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

38
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:55,286
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

39
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,626
Don't you dare to lie.

40
00:05:57,296 --> 00:06:00,006
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

41
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:01,006
Since what time?

42
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:04,176
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

43
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:07,136
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

44
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,406
Damn it. This punk.

45
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:27,866
Maybe he saw wrong.

46
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,906
Let's question him first.

47
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:36,206
I think

48
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,996
since the last time I was here,

49
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,506
I've been traumatized.

50
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:45,756
I admired investigators like you so much

51
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:50,426
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

52
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,806
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

53
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,186
So you thought a guy

54
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,266
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

55
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,026
but you were wrong?

56
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:06,356
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:09,236
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

58
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:12,616
for the communists' dead drop…

59
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:19,246
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

60
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:22,046
I'm so sorry.

61
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,546
I didn't know you were so busy.

62
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,776
I'm suddenly

63
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,196
not sure which side you're on.

64
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:49,026
You might be on our side,

65
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:52,076
on Soo-ho's side,

66
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:59,746
or on the side of someone protecting him.

67
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,956
Which side are you on?

68
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,046
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,636
That hurts!

70
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:16,516
My ribs!

71
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:21,226
I'm so sorry.

72
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,726
Please don't kill me.

73
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:26,106
What did you do wrong?

74
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,156
Actually…

75
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:36,956
BAEKHA BREWERY

76
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:39,616
<i>Seol-hui's Baekha Brewery's
president's daughter.</i>

77
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:42,286
<i>It's the perfect chance to win her heart.</i>

78
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,496
Gwang-tae.

79
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:49,126
Actually?

80
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,466
Actually what?

81
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,426
What, you idiot?

82
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,516
I'll be discreet.

83
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:58,636
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

84
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,856
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,736
I'm so sorry.

86
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,626
<i>To actualize the ideals
of the Seoul Olympics…</i>

87
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,546
Why are you so late?

88
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,626
-I'm sorry.
<i>-The Seoul Olympics</i>

89
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,506
<i>-will be a global festival…</i>
-Go in.

90
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:35,056
<i>…for the whole world to enjoy,
and not a mere sports competition.</i>

91
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:40,386
<i>So for the first time ever,
Korea will be holding the largest…</i>

92
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:19,636
Comrade.

93
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:29,776
Where's Geum-cheol?

94
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,656
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

95
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:36,736
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

96
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:38,986
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

97
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:44,576
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

98
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:48,996
I should report first.

99
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,136
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

100
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:05,516
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

101
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:08,646
don't hesitate…

102
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:12,236
to kill him.

103
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,776
What happened?

104
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,866
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

105
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:25,866
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

106
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:28,126
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

107
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,756
What are you talking about?

108
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,846
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

109
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:40,966
It's not likely to succeed.

110
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:44,596
Your face is well known now,

111
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:48,356
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

112
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,736
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

113
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,486
EUN YEONG-U

114
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:42,076
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

115
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,616
They're my brother's.

116
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,956
I wonder if they fit you.

117
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:52,166
Why don't you try them on?

118
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:04,426
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

119
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:06,886
He was so hot!

120
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,136
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

121
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,606
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

122
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,646
What are you talking about?

123
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,606
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

124
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,186
He was so manly.

125
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:19,486
What's he majoring in?

126
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,406
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

127
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:24,576
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

128
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,996
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

129
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:29,496
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

130
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,096
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

131
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:53,306
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

132
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,736
EUN YEONG-RO'S

133
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:04,986
Bun-ok.

134
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:08,616
We need to talk.

135
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,516
How long has it been?

136
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:38,186
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

137
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,446
You must've been mocking me.

138
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:50,946
I don't follow you.

139
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,286
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

140
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,166
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

141
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:02,716
and told me to come because he missed me,

142
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:06,756
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

143
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:09,306
I'm so sorry.

144
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:12,226
You must've looked down on me so much

145
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:16,936
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

146
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,776
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!

147
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:29,616
Did you call him first?

148
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,116
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

149
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:40,586
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

150
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:42,546
I ran into him.

151
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,836
At a record shop?

152
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,046
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

153
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:51,096
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

154
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:57,146
That bastard…

155
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,306
He told me he had other plans.

156
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:03,606
You told him I wasn't a college student,

157
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,276
didn't you?

158
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:07,986
No. I never did.

159
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,656
Why would I tell him that?

160
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,626
Right. You did nothing wrong.

161
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:25,376
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

162
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:29,636
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

163
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,846
I'll know my place from now on.

164
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:42,066
Thanks.

165
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,956
Damn it.

166
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:09,126
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM
OPEN HOUSE

167
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:12,176
NO ONE WILL BE
ALLOWED IN WITHOUT INVITATION

168
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:20,096
OPEN HOUSE
GUEST LIST

169
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:23,516
Room 207…

170
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,936
Room 207…

171
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:30,316
ROOM 207, EUN YEONG-RO

172
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:37,746
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

173
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,496
That's right.

174
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:44,836
Maybe…

175
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,256
the spy is hiding in there.

176
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,336
Come on. I doubt that.

177
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:51,546
DO NOT ENTER

178
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:55,596
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

179
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,346
Hold on.

180
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:01,306
That means that guy is…

181
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:05,896
the spy?

182
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,239
Hold on.

183
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:16,199
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

184
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,249
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

185
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,369
She must be so mad.

186
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,419
The way Gizzard sees it,

187
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:25,129
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

188
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:29,419
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

189
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,799
Darn it.

190
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,549
Wait.

191
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,469
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

192
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,479
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

193
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,099
She'll find it suspicious.

194
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,519
What if she finds it out?

195
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:49,529
She'll never let it slide.

196
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,529
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,409
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

198
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,069
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

199
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,539
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

200
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,199
Anyway, that guy's gone.

201
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,289
And there's no proof that we hid him.

202
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,879
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

203
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,209
Say good night.

204
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,879
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

205
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,399
Yeong-ro.

206
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,779
Yes?

207
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,909
Why are you so startled?

208
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,199
Did you do something wrong?

209
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,579
No, ma'am.

210
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:49,129
I didn't.

211
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:52,629
Pull yourself together.

212
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,469
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

213
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,219
The open house is over.

214
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,019
Get it together,

215
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:05,269
or you might mess up your exam.

216
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,189
Understood?

217
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:07,809
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,439
That'll be all.

219
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,519
Say good night.

220
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:13,279
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

221
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,789
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

222
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,379
I'm sure she found out.

223
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,749
And she's not the type to let it slide.

224
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,299
I'm sure she's up to something.

225
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:36,339
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

226
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,929
Oh, that.

227
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,679
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

228
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,969
Right?

229
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,769
Where do you think is safest?

230
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,269
It's me, son. How did it go?

231
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:32,559
<i>What do you think?</i>

232
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,649
I put my organs as collateral.

233
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,029
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

234
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,779
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

235
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:43,949
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

236
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:46,289
How could you say that to your father?

237
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:50,079
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

238
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:51,959
You and your nagging again!

239
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,129
I'll go see you in two days,

240
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:55,749
so get the money ready.

241
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,349
All right. I'm back with money.

242
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,819
Go back in. I'll be okay.

243
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,299
Constitution Article 32…

244
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,479
…optimum wages

All citizens shall have the right to work.

246
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:59,109
The State shall endeavor to promote
the employment of workers

247
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:00,859
and to guarantee optimum…

248
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,199
All citizens shall have the right to work.

249
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,369
You should sleep in your room.

250
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:12,749
The State shall endeavor to promote

251
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:17,959
the employment of workers
and to guarantee optimum wages

252
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:21,299
through social and economic means…

253
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,259
Hey, you.

254
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:27,349
No running.

255
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:40,189
God, I was so startled.

256
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:42,489
What's up?

257
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:47,779
My goodness. So they are

258
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:50,449
the clothes that guy left behind?

259
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:53,119
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

260
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:55,789
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

261
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,709
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

262
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,339
Sure, let's do that.

263
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,469
The hall director never comes down here,

264
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,639
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

265
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:11,969
Thank you so much.

266
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,929
What's that now?

267
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,059
It's sweet potato!

268
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:18,439
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

269
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,479
I'll put it here, so have it later.

270
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,319
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,949
All right.

272
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:31,119
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

273
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,739
He managed to get out safely,

274
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:35,659
and it's all thanks to you.

275
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,169
I mean it.

276
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:38,919
Come on. I didn't do much.

277
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,289
Don't worry, and go back now.

278
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,209
Okay.

279
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:28,219
NO NAME

280
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,049
<i>Geum-cheol.</i>

281
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:10,629

never forget what you did.</i>

ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATIONS 1
TEAM LEADER

283
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:28,779
There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

284
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,609
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

285
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:35,119
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

286
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:41,329
Take it.

287
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,039
What's all that?

288
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:46,289
You haven't eaten yet, right?

289
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:49,259
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

290
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:52,179
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

291
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:54,089
What's with the orchid?

292
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:01,389
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

293
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:04,439
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,279
I thought you were out of my team.

295
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,169
I joined the ANSP

296
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:27,039
for only one reason.

297
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:36,509
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

298
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:40,889
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

299
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,439
I only joined to ask him why.

300
00:27:46,939 --> 00:27:51,689
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

301
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,069
waiting for him for six years.

302
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,909
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

303
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:05,249
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

304
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,209
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

305
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:12,049
Why…

306
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:15,719
Why on earth…

307
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,189
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

308
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:35,529
I had our agents tail him closely.

309
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,489
So stay out of it.

310
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:38,909
Our agents?

311
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,239
You think they're loyal to you?

312
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,789
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

313
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:06,309
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

314
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:14,649
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

315
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:19,609
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

316
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,079
She's so generous, isn't she?

317
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:39,219
Hello?

318
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:42,849
I called to ask you something.

319
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:47,269
You said

320
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:50,559
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

321
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:53,939
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

322
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:55,859
how much will I get?

323
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,649
The same amount?

324
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,869
Why are you curious about that?

325
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:08,329
Pardon?

326
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:10,539
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

327
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:12,669
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

328
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,249
Gye Bun-ok.

329
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,849
Because I'll turn someone in.

330
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,009
What?

331
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:27,559
Turn in?

332
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:31,479
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

333
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:34,609
What are you talking about?

334
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:37,569
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

335
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,319
Come on.

336
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,119
Why are you going through that?

337
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:48,159
What's going on?

338
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,329
That's…

339
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,589
I'm sorry.

340
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,429
Well, this is…

341
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:12,729
I mean,

342
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:16,189
what happened is that…

343
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:18,109
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

344
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:22,109
Thank you for everything.

345
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:25,819
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

346
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:29,119
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

347
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:33,249
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

348
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,919
I was so thoughtless.

349
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,129
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

350
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,919
Oh, no.

351
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:44,679
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

352
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,929
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

353
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:50,019
My goodness.

354
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:15,789
The guy they hid

355
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:18,959
isn't a spy but a student protester.

356
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:24,169
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

357
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,469
Fine. Let's say he is.

358
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,059
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

359
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:39,059
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

360
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,899
I'm not doing this for money.

361
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:45,359
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

362
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:47,029
That's our duty.

363
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:49,659
Duty? So what if you do?

364
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,619
You think they won't question you?

365
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:59,289
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

366
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:03,759
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

367
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:06,719
I mean,

368
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:10,349
you're a communist's sister.

369
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:17,769
I am not.

370
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:20,439
My sister is not a Northern spy!

371
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,479
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

372
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,949
50 million won?

373
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,619
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

374
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:34,159
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

375
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:37,499
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

376
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,549
If it weren't for my old teacher,

377
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,759
I'd have never hired you.

378
00:33:58,229 --> 00:33:59,479
If you understood,

379
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:03,609
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

380
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:48,359
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

381
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,069
It's all my fault.

382
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,489
I begged them to hide him.

383
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:57,659
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

384
00:34:57,739 --> 00:34:59,579
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

385
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,539
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

386
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:04,959
I couldn't ignore him.

387
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,509
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

388
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,839
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

389
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:13,969
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

390
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:16,889
They can easily make you guys spies.

391
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:18,889
No, they can easily make

392
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:21,519
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

393
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:32,899
Room 207.

394
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:37,199
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

395
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,789
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

396
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:45,209
They all told me we should call the cops,

397
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:48,419
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

398
00:35:48,499 --> 00:35:51,969
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

399
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,299
Please let me be punished.

400
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:55,889
Please let me be solely responsible!

401
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,229
Fine, if you say so.

402
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:06,439
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.

403
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:18,329
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

404
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,039
I'll leave instead.

405
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,329
I helped him too--

406
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:22,699
Of course,

407
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,919
she couldn't have done it by herself.

408
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,009
But…

409
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:36,259
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

410
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,639
He was

411
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:43,389
your partner, right?

412
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:52,649
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

413
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:56,239
Your father will be disappointed.

414
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:04,789
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

415
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,249
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

416
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:10,879
From this moment on,

417
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:14,299
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

418
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:15,969
Pardon?

419
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:17,879
Even a phone call?

420
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,179
Get out!

421
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:41,239
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:45,749
Did you see it?

423
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,079
Did you?

424
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,749
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

425
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:51,419
Who do you think you are?

426
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:55,009
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

427
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:56,879
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

428
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:01,639
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

429
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:11,439
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

430
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:14,359
who pretends to be a college girl.

431
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:21,069
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

432
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:24,779
Stop.

433
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,949
Let's go.

434
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,749
What's her problem?

435
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:29,539
You crazy b****!

436
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:30,869
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

437
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:34,289
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

438
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,299
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:39,009
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

440
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,449
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

441
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,579
But I feel so bad for her.

442
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:15,209
Let's go.

443
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:20,719
This is Hosu University dorm.

444
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,259
My wound's been healed.

445
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,349
I'm ready for the operation.

446
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,719
I'm relieved.

447
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,149
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,819
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

449
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:40,069
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

450
00:39:40,149 --> 00:39:43,909
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

451
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,909
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

452
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,579
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

453
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:51,289
You must accomplish this mission

454
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,539
at all costs, okay?

455
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:55,539
I'll remember that.

456
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:58,709
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

457
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:01,379
have their guns pointed at me.

458
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:06,549
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

459
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,179
Don't forget that.

460
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:10,179
I've never forgotten that.

461
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,389
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

462
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:30,369
What did I tell you?

463
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:33,829
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

464
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:35,579
In any case,

465
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:38,209
I'm glad that he's alive.

466
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:45,429
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

467
00:40:46,129 --> 00:40:47,339
But Comrade,

468
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,719
we decided to send in a new team.

469
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:55,269
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

470
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:09,529
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.

471
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,869
BEIJING, CHINA

472
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:37,849
Now we're on the same page.

473
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:41,649
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

474
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:45,359
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

475
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,449
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

476
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,699
Our nationalities may be different,

477
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,869
what matters is

478
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,039
that our hearts are one.

479
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,709
I couldn't agree more.

480
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:59,869
All right. I think it's time

481
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:02,459
to clink our glasses.

482
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,599
Not just this time

483
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:17,519
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

484
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:21,019
In that sense, I want to say something.

485
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:23,359
-What?
-You can say it.

486
00:42:26,149 --> 00:42:30,029
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

487
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:34,699
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

488
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,459
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

489
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:44,459
You worry too much for your own good.

490
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:48,089
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

491
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:49,049
Right?

492
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:58,479
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

493
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:08,069
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

494
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:24,999
Why the hell

495
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,549
are you ruining what's almost done?

496
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:31,589
What he demands is four times as much.

497
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,719
What's the use of winning the war

498
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:36,599
when we're going to be left with no money?

499
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,599
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

500
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:42,599
What is wrong with you?

501
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,399
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

502
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:51,649
What?

503
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,579
I understand.

504
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:00,949
I get what you mean.

505
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:06,039
If we lose this election,

506
00:44:06,129 --> 00:44:08,039
Code 1, Code 2,

507
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:10,419
and you and I are all done for.

508
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:15,889
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

509
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:18,389
This is just an insurance.

510
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:22,229
No one knows until the election's over.

511
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:24,809
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

512
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:26,479
All of us.

513
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:36,279
We'll rob the vault.

514
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:40,449
The vault?

515
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,749
Lost money that even Code 1

516
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:50,379
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

517
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:57,509
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

518
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:13,689
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

519
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:18,109
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

520
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,069
<i>Pong!</i>

521
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,989
Let me join you often.

522
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,579
I'll come whenever you call me.

523
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,289
I'll drop out after this one.

524
00:45:29,419 --> 00:45:34,459
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

525
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:39,719
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

526
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:41,139
No?

527
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:44,599
Right. I guess you're right.

528
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:49,099
Unless 13 young virgins die…

529
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:50,399
Stop it.

530
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:54,649
You should watch what you say.

531
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,199
What is that about?

532
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:06,579
Unless 13 young virgins die,

533
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:09,919
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

534
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:12,209
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

535
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:16,719
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something

536
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:18,589
I should pay attention to.

537
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,559
How could you say that?

538
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:28,309
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

539
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:35,359
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

540
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:37,359
Unless war breaks out,

541
00:46:37,439 --> 00:46:39,609
you can't kill 13 virgins.

542
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:41,619
Besides, this is your second marriage.

543
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,199
So if your husband dies,

544
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,449
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

545
00:46:57,049 --> 00:46:59,929
Your future is whatever you make it.

546
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:03,049
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

547
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:04,759
to become king

548
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:08,519
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

549
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:13,649
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

550
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:16,189
Your future is whatever you make it.

551
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,449
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

552
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,959
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

553
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,259
that you have to leave while we stay.

554
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:42,549
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

555
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:45,599
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

556
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,139
Have you decided where to go?

557
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:54,309
Your cousin's house?

558
00:47:56,689 --> 00:47:57,979
My father's house.

559
00:47:58,779 --> 00:47:59,859
Your father?

560
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:01,699
Your father lives in Seoul?

561
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,989
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

562
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,909
he married this really annoying woman.

563
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:18,379
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

564
00:48:20,169 --> 00:48:22,629
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

565
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:28,219
Come on. I'm all right.

566
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:31,059
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

567
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:33,229
Cheers.

568
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:35,809
Goodness.

569
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:38,439
Yeong-ro…

570
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:41,229
Stop crying.

571
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:43,609
Stop.

572
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:58,129
Since I moved into the dorm,

573
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:02,129
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

574
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,049
big sisters to me.

575
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:10,469
I have been really happy
living here with you.

576
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:20,019
Thank you guys so much for everything.

577
00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:22,899
I mean it.

578
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:36,289
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

579
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:39,539
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

580
00:49:39,629 --> 00:49:41,669
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

581
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:48,219
I'll come visit you often.

582
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:57,849

<i>What do I do now?</i>

584
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:14,039
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

585
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:19,619
<i>Before I leave,</i>

586
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:23,549
<i>could you please grant my wish?</i>

587
00:50:25,879 --> 00:50:29,799
<i>Please make Soo-ho call me.</i>

588
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,259
<i>Please. Just once.</i>

589
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,889
<i>Please?</i>

590
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:45,569
TAEGEUK HARDWARE STORE

It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

604
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:33,929
It's been a while.

605
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,309
Professor Han I-seop.

606
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,740
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

607
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,040
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

608
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,540
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

609
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,090
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

610
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:12,710
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

611
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,390
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

612
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,020
I'm sure you looked into it.

613
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,020
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

614
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,480
from Austria myself.

615
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,710
I can show you a letter your son sent.

616
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,000
Min-jae sent a letter?

617
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,340
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

618
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,390
that your son is in Pyongyang.

619
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,720
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

620
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,640
And once they do,

621
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,190
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

622
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,190
As I told you many times,

623
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,660
your son willingly went to the North.

624
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:25,910
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

625
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,000
for your sake, Professor.

626
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,880
Your son…

627
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,640
misses his father so much,

628
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,600
Professor Han.

629
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,860
TAXI

630
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,740
Let's go.

631
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,230
What? Why are you taking this route?

632
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,900
Hey, driver!

633
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,530
Hey, driver!

634
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,170
Hey!

635
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,220
Damn it!

636
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,890
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

637
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,430
-What the hell?
-Move!

638
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,560
"Move"?

639
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,810
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

640
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,780
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?

641
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,110
Are you listening? You can't leave!

642
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,570
I lost them.

643
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,370
Kill me first if you want to leave.

644
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,030
How will you compensate?

645
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,540
-How?
-My goodness.

646
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,790
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

647
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,080
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

648
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,790
This is Galaxy.

649
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,260
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

650
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,560
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

651
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,580
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

652
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,950
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

653
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:17,130
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

654
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:20,130
I grew up with a single mom.

655
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,670
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

656
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,010
I must succeed.

657
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,100
So why would I help a communist?

658
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,020
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

659
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,650
I'll be discreet

660
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,740
and make sure to get the job done.

661
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,570
Let him go.

662
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,120
Yes, sir.

663
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,830
I'll return your kindness one day!

664
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,870
Sir!

665
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,800
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

666
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,970
If we can decipher--

667
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,160
He moved to some quiet suburb.

668
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,540
What does it mean?

669
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,960
"The scenery is so beautiful

670
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,290
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

671
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,960
What are you doing?

672
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,350
Professor.

673
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:06,990
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

674
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,740
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

675
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,030
he's been trying to escape.

676
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,120
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

677
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,660
Go to the North

678
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,830
and get out of there with him.

679
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,340
What?

680
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,630
We'll help you get out with him

681
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,430
safely and in secret

682
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,010
before the CIA finds it out.

683
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,950
What do I have to do in return?

684
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,870
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

685
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,250
that if you do what the North wants,

686
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,540
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

687
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,000
I'll give you my word.

688
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,880
Get some rest here.

689
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,950
You guys go first with Professor Han.

690
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,530
Are you not coming with us?

691
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,200
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

692
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,710
Tonight at 22:00,

693
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,130
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

694
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,750
So I'll be there before then.

695
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,380
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

696
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:56,140
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

697
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,430
<i>don't hesitate…</i>

698
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,440
to kill him.

699
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,450
If we don't get this done,

700
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,700
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

701
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,580
We must accomplish the mission.

702
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,210
Understood?

703
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,920
-For our country and people!
-For our country and people!

704
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,880
COSMOS TOYS

705
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,310
"Hosu Women's University… Dormitory…"

706
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,860
"I've been searched.

707
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,650
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,410
Hoping to go to the North

709
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,070
as soon as possible."

710
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,910
So it was the dorm.

711
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,500
Let's go.

712
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,310
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

713
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,360
What? On the phone?

714
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,150
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

715
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,620
Oh, that? It was my friend.

716
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,580
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

717
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,290
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

718
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,500
By the way, how will she move all this?

719
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,090
I called Byeong-tae.

720
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:20,340
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

721
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,680
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

722
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:27,140
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

723
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,650
What's that? Where did you get it?

724
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,860
It's nothing.

725
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,700
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

726
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:49,450
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

727
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,170
How could he? He's being chased.

728
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:03,300
<i>Room 207.</i>

729
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,680
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

730
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:42,300
Hello?

731
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,630
I heard it from the hall director.

732
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,010
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

733
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:50,180
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

734
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:55,520
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

735
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,810
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.

736
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:58,870
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

737
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,540
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

738
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:08,220
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm today.</i>

739
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,100
<i>It's not that</i>

740
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,390
<i>I miss you.</i>

741
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,660
<i>In case he runs towards Mount Ogong,</i>

742
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,040
you and Dong-jae

743
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,250
should head toward the dorm.

744
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:06,420
Yes, sir.

745
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,840
We need to capture him.

746
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,050
<i>But if you're about to lose him,</i>

747
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:12,880
you're allowed to kill him. Over.

748
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:52,630
-Have you all filled your glasses?
-Yes!

749
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:55,180
To our Yeong-ro's future!

750
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,390
-To her future!
-To her future!

751
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,680
My goodness, Yeong-ro.

752
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,270
You won't have a curfew anymore.
I'm jealous.

753
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:05,850
-I'm jealous too.
-You're free now.

754
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,020
Bye, Yeong-ro.

755
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,770
Why don't we leave here too?

756
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,110
-I can't believe you said that.
-What?

757
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,650
By the way,
has anyone been to Munhwa Coffee Shop?

758
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:16,610
-Munhwa Coffee Shop?
-I went there!

759
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,070
For a blind date. And the guys there

760
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,530
looked so handsome.

761
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,580
And he asked me out!

762
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:41,260
Yeong-ro!

763
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,890
Yeong-ro…

764
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,600
She's not actually going anywhere.

765
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,730
Don't cry.

766
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:33,110
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER

767
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:35,030
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE DORM TODAY

768
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,740
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

769
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,080
Hey!

770
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:51,960
What a pervert.

771
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,790
Where do you think you're peeping?

772
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,380
That punk.

773
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,300
Are you a pervert?
Peeping into a women's university?

774
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:04,220
You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

775
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,930
And what's that look, you jerk?

776
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,310
Where are you going?

777
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:13,810
You bastard. Come here.

778
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,440
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

779
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,610
God damn it!

780
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,660
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

781
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,040
Are they after me?

782
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,750
What's going on?

783
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:37,840
I can't get caught.

784
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:48,060
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

785
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,980
That hurt. Damn it.

786
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,480
Okay. I must get in here.

787
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:09,620
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

788
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,330
Darn it!

789
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,830
God, my hips.

790
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:25,010
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

791
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,930
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

792
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,150
They must be near here.

793
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,980
So call for backup and stand by here.

794
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,520
Everyone stand by.

795
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,860
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

796
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,110
Are they really here for my organs?

797
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,660
Those bastards. There's some time left.

798
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,910
Those cold-hearted bastards.

799
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,250
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

800
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,580
Maybe they're after this pervert.

801
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:41,630
Hey, what's your deal?

802
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:44,380
Wait a minute.

803
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,680
How dare you follow me in here?

804
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,760
Did you just hit me?

805
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,430
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

806
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,190
Come here.

807
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:00,610
I'll teach you a lesson.

808
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,440
My God.

809
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:45,480
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

810
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:47,530
Seol-hui.

811
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,530
I didn't tell them anything.

812
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,580
To protect you, Seol-hui,

813
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,080
I endured all sorts of torturing

814
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:57,580
and…

815
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:04,130
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

816
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,760
Don't cry.

817
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,570
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

818
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:36,870
Dad.

819
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,960
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

820
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:43,920
What's going on?

821
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,630
What's going on?

822
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:49,970
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

823
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,850
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

824
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,680
Hey, pal.

825
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,310
Are you Oh Gwang-tae?

826
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:13,240
-Yes, what's your problem?
-What?

827
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:37,300
-Hey, give me back my hat.
-Just a minute.

828
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:40,680
Hey.

829
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,850
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,600
Check upstairs.

831
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,990
Lim Soo-ho!

832
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,250
Drop the gun!

833
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,630
Stay away.

834
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,380
Drop the gun in three seconds,
or she's dead.

835
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,680
One.

836
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,810
Two.

837
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,410
Three.

838
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:56,090
<i>Are you saying they're
holding people hostage in the dorm?</i>

839
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,840
<i>In the middle of Seoul?</i>

840
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,350
<i>Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?</i>

841
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:08,520
Just crush him without anyone knowing.

842
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,100
<i>The priority of this operation is
to rescue the chairman's daughter.</i>

843
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,650
<i>All of us might end up dying.</i>

844
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,440
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

845
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,320
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

846
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,650
Plan B is the only option now.

847
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,950
<i>Kill them all if need be.</i>

848
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,950
<i>So you're really</i>

849
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,290
<i>a spy from the North? Did I really</i>

850
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,750
save a spy?

851
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,000
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

852
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:45,390
BONUS

853
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,410
Yeong-ro.

854
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,330
Everyone's ready.

855
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:23,340
-Hurry, Yeong-ro!
-Come on, Yeong-ro!

856
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:27,430
All right. Turn your shoulders.

857
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:29,260
And make sure you show your faces.

858
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,680
-Closer.
-Okay.

859
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,350
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

860
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,020
All right. There we go. One, two, three!
