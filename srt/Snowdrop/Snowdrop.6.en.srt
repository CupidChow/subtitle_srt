ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,964
EPISODE 6

3
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,973
Now…

4
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,851
Plan B is the only option now.

5
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,353
And in order for it to succeed,

6
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:25,440
we must kill them all.

7
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,154
As soon as they come out,

8
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:33,781
-kill them all.
-Mr. Nam,

9
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:37,785
even if we go with plan B, if we kill
them, the North won't sit back--

10
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:38,703
What if they won't?

11
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:41,080
We made a deal--

12
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,258
You think they'll disclose
that we made a deal?

13
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:54,761
We have no choice but
to exaggerate the engagement.

14
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:57,764
If the North throws a monkey wrench
into the works, it'll fail!

15
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,391
You think they're that stupid?

16
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:03,394
You think they'll refuse the chance
to make huge money every election?

17
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,689
But if it fails,
the hostages' lives will be in danger!

18
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:07,774
God damn it!

19
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:11,402
What are you waiting for? Kill them!

20
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:13,947
Everyone, retreat.

21
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,757
This is HQ. Ambush team,
we're going in for the kill.

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,759
Once the targets are in the zone,

23
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:36,302
kill them at all costs.

24
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:21,639
The targets appeared. All units,
they're approaching the kill zone.

25
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:22,807
Stand by.

26
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:32,066
Let's go.

27
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,488
Stop.

28
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:55,840
Three targets, armed with AK-47s.

29
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:29,082
A change of plan. Open fire.

30
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:35,963
Eung-cheol!

31
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,357
Everyone, calm down.

32
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:57,819
I think they're trying to escape
through the exit in basement two.

33
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:00,446
And I'll go after them right now.

34
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,407
So everyone stay here.

35
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:06,452
Let's go.

36
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:29,308
Eung-cheol, hold me.

37
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,784
You bastards!

38
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:49,537
It's a grenade! Get down!

39
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,543
All units, fire!

40
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,887
Get out of here! Hurry up!

41
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,151
Four of our guys are injured.

42
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,403
It looks like the plan failed.

43
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,367
I'll kill them all.

44
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,388
Eung-cheol!

45
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:50,723
Get it together.

46
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:26,509
<i>We're going in.
We'll go in and secure the targets.</i>

47
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:27,927
Hey, halt! Halt!

48
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,971
This is the director of ANSP. Halt!

49
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:40,648
If the students are killed,
we'll be doomed!

50
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,819
Why do you think
this happened in the first place?

51
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:47,280
Exaggerating the engagement won't help us!

52
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:50,157
Let's just go in and eliminate them all!

53
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,994
Are you insane?
What if all the hostages are killed?

54
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:55,454
I'll deal with the communist jerks,

55
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,873
so you stay out of it, scaredy-cat.

56
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,167
SWAT team, listen--

57
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:03,254
If you stab them in the back twice,
how will you negotiate with them?

58
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:06,007
You think you can bury this
without anyone knowing?

59
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,912
You made sure
no one will talk about this, right?

60
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:21,582
If anyone asks about this
hostage situation, just lock them all up!

61
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,833
We already

62
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,170
took necessary measures just in case.

63
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:28,214
We told the shop owners

64
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:31,801
that we were catching deserters.
And we made sure

65
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,386
to keep the press quiet about it.

66
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,596
But your daughter…

67
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:45,106
Do you think the other hostages are okay?

68
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:47,900
Put me through to the dorm.

69
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,091
You bastard.

70
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:37,783
You son of a b****!

71
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,297
You murderer.

72
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:55,050
You bastard!

73
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,639
How dare you kill my husband?

74
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:12,485
Who gave you the right to kill him?

75
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:20,451
You murderer!

76
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:23,245
How dare you!

77
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:27,458
Bring her here.

78
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,003
You're all right. Calm down.

79
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:17,967
Twice.

80
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,553
They deceived us twice!

81
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,473
You wasted our precious bullets.

82
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:28,143
It's always an emotional prick
like you that ruins a mission.

83
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:32,565
You need to be coolheaded
in a situation like this.

84
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,360
If you keep this up,
I won't need you anymore.

85
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:45,369
Everyone go back to the cafeteria.

86
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:49,999
Now!

87
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:05,514
I'll watch the cafeteria.
You go bring Eung-cheol.

88
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,642
And lock him in another room.

89
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,271
You two.

90
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:15,065
Follow me.

91
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:20,779
Yes, sir!

92
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:38,714
Yes.

93
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:41,425
Sir.

94
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:42,927
It's the military situation room.

95
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,147
Hey, have you looked into the casualties?

96
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,399
Ask about Han I-seop first.

97
00:13:57,483 --> 00:14:00,736
Yes, sir!
All of the armed spies were killed.

98
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:05,741
And Professor Han who was with them
was killed by one of the Northern spies.

99
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:06,784
Is he dead?

100
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,371
How about our casualties?

101
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,874
One killed in action
and four injured, sir.

102
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,919
Yeong-u!

103
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,338
Yeong-u, stay with me!

104
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:23,384
You'll be okay. Hang in there.

105
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:37,106
Don't tell their families just yet.

106
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,733
And ask the press for a news embargo.

107
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,239
Here. We need help here.

108
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:49,535
Chief An.

109
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:52,413
Tell the press that Han I-seop died
while defecting to the North.

110
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:54,832
-Defecting to the North?
-Yes.

111
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:57,418
<i>But he was the
opposition party's mentor in economics.</i>

112
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:58,585
An.

113
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,547
Just tell them the North abducted him
and we tried to rescue him.

114
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,508
Inspiring the people's sense
of national security will help us--

115
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,387
You want to stop there
when we can win the game?

116
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,849
If the opposition party raises an issue,
we will be counterattacked.

117
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:23,444
Counterattack?

118
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:28,407
Making up evidence with a dead guy is
just a piece of cake. What counterattack?

119
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:32,995
Will the higher-ups be content with
inspiring a sense of national security?

120
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:40,544
Do it.

121
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:43,547
I'll tell them right now
he was trying to defect to the North.

122
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:46,341
<i>Of course, he'd kill them.</i>

123
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,510
<i>You know how people are willing</i>

124
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,304
to kill their own family,

125
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:53,557
cousins, and even children
if it helps them become king.

126
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,392
So why would he be any different?

127
00:15:55,976 --> 00:16:00,439
Come on. You know how much
Ms. Hong care for his daughter.

128
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,692
Your own child means

129
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,903
more than anything in the world.

130
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:11,950
I feel like a horrible person.

131
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,495
As soon as I heard
about the hostage situation,

132
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:16,830
the first thing I thought of
is the fortuneteller.

133
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:21,043
She's not even your own daughter.

134
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:24,213
I must say,
you're such an angel, Ms. Hong.

135
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,841
Are you

136
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:31,428
very worried that 13 people will die

137
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,514
in the dorm?

138
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:36,391
What?

139
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:40,354
That must be why
you ran over here so late at night.

140
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:42,356
I ran over here

141
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,441
so late at night?

142
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,238
They say you can never hide
your humble origins.

143
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:50,823
How could you be so rude?

144
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:54,660
Don't you know my husband is
your husband's superior?

145
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:56,078
Charlotte.

146
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:59,873
You know that my husband graduated
from the military academy

147
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:01,333
four years earlier than him?

148
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:03,460
Pardon?

149
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,714
Well, yes. That's…

150
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,510
Yes, I'm aware of that.

151
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:15,639
They say the boughs that bear the most
hang the lowest.

152
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,934
I know the higher-up likes your husband,

153
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:21,478
but he might end up paying dearly

154
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:25,482
for disrespecting his senior.
I'm quite worried.

155
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,527
Worried?

156
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:30,904
You're worried?

157
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:32,906
You wench!

158
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,909
How dare a lowly entertainer like you
threaten me?

159
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:38,745
I'm a daughter of a general.
A four-star general!

160
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:44,543
My goodness. Ma'am, please calm down.

161
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,256
Hey, your husband rose
from humble origins.

162
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,510
Mine has many high-ranking in-laws.
You think they're on the same level?

163
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,556
Your husband becoming president.

164
00:17:58,348 --> 00:17:59,808
Don't even dream about it.

165
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,228
It's not something
a lowlife like you can covet!

166
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,281
Ms. Hong, I'll get going too.

167
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:35,677
<i>He definitely ordered us
to cooperate with the South.</i>

168
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:42,059
<i>Father must've made a deal with
the director of ANSP to save our lives.</i>

169
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,111
<i>Then why did they…</i>

170
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,865
<i>try to kill us?</i>

171
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:25,477
I laid Comrade Lee down
in the next room. He's severely injured.

172
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,145
I'll go to him with the first aid kit.

173
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,277
You.

174
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:40,909
Follow me with the first aid kit.

175
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,881
-Why is he taking her?
-I don't know.

176
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,009
Keep your heads down.

177
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:05,809
Eung-cheol.

178
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,563
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:21,199
Wait.

180
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,292
I said, wait.

181
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:42,763
I'm okay, sir.

182
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,765
No, you're not, you punk.

183
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:11,958
Fortunately,
you didn't hurt any arteries or veins.

184
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:15,337
I could even take
an axe blade with my abs.

185
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,006
So this wound is nothing.

186
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,008
I can survive this.

187
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,270
It should be treated.

188
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,420
Let everyone go.

189
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:50,974
If you feel bad for me just a little bit,

190
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:54,978
let them go. Please.

191
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:03,236
Let them go.

192
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,127
Tomorrow morning, I'll demand a doctor
who will treat Eung-cheol's wound.

193
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,547
They'll demand the release of a hostage.

194
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,175
And I'm…

195
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,638
planning to release you.

196
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,769
To repay you for what you've done
for me these past few days.

197
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,689
We'll be even then.

198
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:46,112
"Even"?

199
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,457
Go back to the cafeteria.

200
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:26,319
Look at her.

201
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,530
Her hand is bandaged.

202
00:24:28,655 --> 00:24:31,575
-What? Bandage?
-She's right.

203
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:32,993
He treated her?

204
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:35,203
But why treat only her?

205
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:26,588
Lim Soo-ho?

206
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,215
Are you guys okay?

207
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:31,843
I'll speak to the person in charge.

208
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:35,597
There are people who don't agree with me,
so it went awry.

209
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,183
<i>But I'm still willing to get you out</i>

210
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:39,809
safely and--

211
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:42,937
I'll talk to the person
who ordered to kill us.

212
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:45,649
I'm the person in charge here.
I'm the director of ANSP.

213
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:52,656
So you're the one
who ordered to kill us, you bastard?

214
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,407
What? "Bastard"?

215
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,993
How dare this communist call you that?

216
00:25:57,077 --> 00:26:00,288
Give it. I'll teach him a lesson. Give it!

217
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:02,207
Stop it, you idiot!

218
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:09,047
Don't deal with him. Why don't you
go home? I'll take care of this.

219
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,757
You'll take care of this?

220
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,008
Why don't you go home?

221
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:14,803
You're not coolheaded,
desperate to save your child.

222
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:15,720
You little…

223
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:19,891
Are you trying to get her killed?

224
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:23,186
If they find out,
what do you think they'll do?

225
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:31,277
What're you looking at?

226
00:26:36,783 --> 00:26:40,829
There was an engagement on the West Sea
at around 22:00.

227
00:26:42,706 --> 00:26:43,665
An engagement?

228
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:47,377
<i>The ship for the North was
stupid enough to be get caught.</i>

229
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:52,382
The navy found the ship,
so there was nothing I could do.

230
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:55,135
And my colleagues?

231
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:56,052
<i>Before that…</i>

232
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:59,180
I heard gunfire. Are the students okay?

233
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,229
If you wanted them safe,
you shouldn't have deceived us twice.

234
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,234
What happened to my colleagues?

235
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,570
Unfortunately,

236
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:17,198
everyone was killed
including Professor Han.

237
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:19,826
Everyone?

238
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:23,788
How can I believe you?

239
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:25,331
Whether or not you believe me,

240
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,626
I want to help you.

241
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,671
<i>Give me a bit more time,
and I'll come up with a plan--</i>

242
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:33,214
When you tried to kill us,

243
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,179
had the North approved it?

244
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:41,639
Of course not. We had no time for that.

245
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,351
Remember this.

246
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:50,982
Once we're convinced we're never
going back alive, we'll blow ourselves up.

247
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,110
And all the hostages will die too.

248
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:18,343
<i>You must accomplish
this mission at all costs, okay?</i>

249
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:22,639
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

250
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:24,891
<i>are pointing a gun at me.</i>

251
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:29,312
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

252
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:30,647
Don't forget that.

253
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:46,996
Mom…

254
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:47,260
PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR KIM IL SUNG,
DEAR LEADER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE

255
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:52,056
Because your son failed the mission,

256
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,392
we lost 300 million dollars.

257
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,310
The party's 300 million dollars.

258
00:31:57,061 --> 00:31:59,897
Have you forgotten our Leader
ordered us to get it done at all costs?

259
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,692
It's too early

260
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,611
to say the mission has failed.

261
00:32:07,697 --> 00:32:08,865
Too early?

262
00:32:09,782 --> 00:32:12,243
You think your son,
who's holding people hostage

263
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:13,870
in the middle of Seoul,

264
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,248
will come back with 300 million dollars?

265
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:23,296
The party will make a decision soon.
Prepare yourself.

266
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:33,306
We failed our mission,
so there's only one option left for us.

267
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:37,185
To kill them all

268
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:40,730
and blow ourselves up.

269
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:47,028
It's too early for that. We must try
our best to go back alive until the end.

270
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,322
I'll buy as much time as--

271
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:52,200
We shouldn't beg them for negotiation.
Blowing ourselves up…

272
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:57,538
is the only way
to defend the honor of our Leader.

273
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,213
We'll be dying for nothing.

274
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:08,007
Dying for nothing?

275
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,104
You son of a b****.

276
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,773
You dare to call it dying for nothing?

277
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,653
To shoot all the hostages dead

278
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:31,405
and blow ourselves up in a determined way

279
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,991
is the most honorable death for us!

280
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,538
I'll decide if we must die or not.

281
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:40,832
I'm your leader.

282
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:44,544
You're just a soft guy
from a powerful family. How dare you

283
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:46,129
disrespect the revolutionary spirit?

284
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,133
It would've gone smoothly
if you hadn't come to the dorm!

285
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:01,727
Hey, Yeong-ro. Do something.

286
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:04,105
You and he must be close.

287
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:05,815
Do something for us!

288
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:07,567
What could she do?

289
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,778
we were also fooled.
She didn't know he was a spy either.

290
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:11,904
She didn't?

291
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:14,240
Look what she got us into.
"I didn't know" won't cut it.

292
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:17,076
You guys from room 207
are accomplices. So be quiet.

293
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,788
Accomplices?
Look, I'm also mad at Yeong-ro.

294
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,291
I told you we shouldn't have hid him!

295
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:30,339
But it is true that we really thought
he was a college student we met on a date.

296
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:32,633
And you met him with us.

297
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:36,512
She's right.
And he was your partner that day.

298
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:37,930
-Partner?
-Bun-ok's partner?

299
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,182
She joined them?

300
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:41,893
So you think you did nothing wrong?

301
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:43,519
Stop arguing!

302
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,396
The ANSP agent was just dragged out.

303
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,149
We must find a way to get out alive.

304
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:49,525
Why take it out on me?

305
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:52,320
You think we can find any way
in this situation?

306
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:55,990
Byeong-tae!

307
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:57,533
Do something.

308
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:00,870
You'll be commissioned soon.
Will you just sit back?

309
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,915
Isn't there any manual
for a situation like this?

310
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,000
Actually…

311
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:11,297
There's nothing in particular.

312
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:15,927
But…

313
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:21,515
With my great leadership

314
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,518
and sense of duty to save your lives,
let me tell you something.

315
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:28,522
In 1972, there was a hostage situation
during the Munich Olympics.

316
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:32,401
And the West German police
dealt with it in such an idiotic way,

317
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:33,611
so all the hostages

318
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:35,404
were killed.

319
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:38,491
-Oh, no.
-All of them?

320
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:42,161
You didn't know?
It's a well-known tragedy.

321
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:46,707
Anyway, even the West German
police failed like that.

322
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,001
So the Korean police and ANSP…

323
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:53,005
We should never count on them.

324
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,387
For now,

325
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:01,847
those bastards…

326
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:03,599
We should

327
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:07,478
do as those bastards say
if we want to stay alive.

328
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,647
God, you idiot!

329
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:12,275
-You stupid…
-What?

330
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:13,609
You idiot.

331
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:15,778
You little…

332
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:19,740
Keep quiet!

333
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,287
How will you handle
the consequences of the failed mission?

334
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:28,624
I'm the leader.
I'll take full responsibility.

335
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:30,918
You did nothing wrong.

336
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:33,504
I'll go back alive at all cost
and take responsibility.

337
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:34,630
Responsibility?

338
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:39,927
You're a coward begging for your life
even after being fooled twice.

339
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,430
How will you do that?

340
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:53,607
Comrade Joo.

341
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,239
Don't forget the party
ordered you to obey my orders.

342
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,922
You think the party trusts you,
but you're mistaken.

343
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:21,969
If I sense any change
in your ideology, I can--

344
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:05,471
Why did you disobey my orders
and follow me into Mount Ogong?

345
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,560
If you disobey my orders again,

346
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,854
then…

347
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,359
I won't shoot here.

348
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:23,280
I'll shoot here.

349
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:27,159
Your life depends on me, your leader.

350
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:30,579
Don't forget that.

351
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:45,344
Comrade Lim…

352
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:54,103
The rifle!

353
00:39:17,585 --> 00:39:19,170
Ms. Oh?

354
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:27,928
Oh, no.

355
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:50,784
Bang!

356
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:55,039
Bang!

357
00:39:56,165 --> 00:39:58,250
Bang!

358
00:39:58,834 --> 00:39:59,710
Bang!

359
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:06,175
Bang!

360
00:40:06,258 --> 00:40:09,678
My goodness. My arm hurts so much.

361
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:11,931
-Gosh.
-She's not herself right now.

362
00:40:12,014 --> 00:40:13,891
The rifle is so heavy.

363
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,727
Stop it and come here.

364
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,899
Yes. All right. Just sit down.

365
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:22,816
Sit now.

366
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:34,662
Lim Soo-ho?

367
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:36,872
We have an injured person.

368
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:39,583
-Send a doctor in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

369
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:42,503
But how about you release
some of them in return?

370
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:45,381
You have too many hostages
for the three of you anyway.

371
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:49,093
Send in a doctor in ten minutes.

372
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:50,844
We need more time.

373
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:54,723
We'll find a doctor as soon as possible,
so release some of them first.

374
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,183
You have 20 minutes.

375
00:40:56,892 --> 00:41:00,187
<i>If a doctor doesn't come in here by 9:44,</i>

376
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,441
I'll execute
one hostage every ten minutes.

377
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:12,199
Hey, find a doctor right away.
We only got 20 minutes.

378
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,534
20 minutes?

379
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:16,203
Even our agency doctor
can't get here in 20 minutes.

380
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,371
What?

381
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:20,874
I see.

382
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:26,630
Those damn bastards, are they trying
to train us like some freaking dog?

383
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:31,218
Why are you dilly-dallying when you can
just break in and wipe them out?

384
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,597
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

385
00:41:36,265 --> 00:41:37,641
Kang Cheong-ya speaking.

386
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:38,809
Hey, where are you?

387
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:40,561
<i>What do you mean?</i>

388
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:42,062
You called me at the hospital.

389
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:44,356
That's good. Come
to the Hosu University dorm right now.

390
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,525
Yes. It'll take
less than ten minutes, right?

391
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:48,068
<i>Why do you want me there?</i>

392
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:52,531
The spies' hostage situation?

393
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:56,660
<i>Come over here right now! To the scene!</i>

394
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:19,475
We'll escort you.

395
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:24,938
Open it!

396
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,067
-Hurry up!
-Open it!

397
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:35,532
<i>I'll disguise</i>

398
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:37,451
Han-na as a nurse, send her in,

399
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:40,996
and rescue your daughter first
no matter what.

400
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,167
But if we act rashly,
it'll put the hostages in more danger.

401
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,919
This is the perfect chance.

402
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:50,506
If this drags on and they find out
she's your daughter, then it will…

403
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,926
I'm sorry to say this,

404
00:42:54,677 --> 00:42:56,804
but something tragic might happen.

405
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:04,603
But Han-na wasn't very prudent yesterday.

406
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:06,647
Is she reliable?

407
00:43:08,649 --> 00:43:10,526
Disguise myself as a nurse?

408
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:12,194
But they must know my face.

409
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:13,821
None of them knows your face.

410
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:15,698
They saw you briefly during the shoot-out.

411
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,244
I even spoke with them.

412
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:22,621
Do you remember
when I lost Han while tailing him?

413
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:24,289
I'm sure they set us up.

414
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:26,667
They must know my face.

415
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:29,545
In any case, go in with the doctor

416
00:43:29,628 --> 00:43:32,715
and rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

417
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:36,176
And how will I do that?

418
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,847
It might put the rest in more danger.
Don't you know that?

419
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,891
How am I supposed to pull off
the special op without equipment?

420
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:46,478
You're known for this kind of thing.

421
00:43:46,562 --> 00:43:48,981
You don't need any equipment.
Use your brain.

422
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,319
<i>Sweetie,</i>

423
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,030
you know how much I love you, right?

424
00:43:57,614 --> 00:44:00,743
Cut to the chase. I came because
you said it was urgent. What is it?

425
00:44:00,826 --> 00:44:04,455
Don't tell me
I have to treat those Northern spies.

426
00:44:09,835 --> 00:44:13,380
There are three spies in there,
and two of them are injured.

427
00:44:13,964 --> 00:44:14,882
Spies?

428
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:15,924
Forget it.

429
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:16,967
Wait.

430
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,178
If I take care of this well,

431
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:21,221
my party will support me in the future.

432
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:23,974
And it'll help me become president.

433
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:26,101
You said you wanted to see me become one.

434
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:28,687
If you, my beloved sweetie,

435
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:33,192
kill two of them with injections
pretending treating their wounds,

436
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:35,360
-then only one will be left.
-"Kill"?

437
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:39,990
Are you seriously
telling me to commit murder?

438
00:44:40,073 --> 00:44:41,325
No.

439
00:44:41,408 --> 00:44:43,744
It's not murder. It's execution.

440
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:47,122
There are 60 innocent college girls
being held in there.

441
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:49,333
By executing those spies,

442
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:52,836
you'll be saving the 60 innocent people.

443
00:44:57,299 --> 00:45:00,177
You thought I'd be moved by such nonsense?

444
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:06,642
If I become president of this country,

445
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:09,311
I'll be able to abandon
my four-star father-in-law

446
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:11,605
and leave my dumb wife.

447
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,858
I doubt that.

448
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:18,278
My life wish is

449
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:22,866
to keep you by my side 24/7

450
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,201
for the rest of my life.

451
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:26,453
You know that.

452
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:31,959
Let's say I've taken care of the two.

453
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:34,461
What if the last one tries to kill me?

454
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:40,467
Do you really think I'd put you in danger
without any contingency plan?

455
00:45:41,343 --> 00:45:42,761
Contingency plan?

456
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,890
<i>Soon, the whole building</i>

457
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,142
<i>will be wiretapped.</i>

458
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:51,895
<i>Once you take care of the two,</i>

459
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:54,648
<i>just say, "I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."</i>

460
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:58,235
<i>Once we hear you say that,
our forces will break in secretly</i>

461
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:00,404
<i>and kill the last one.</i>

462
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:06,034
But they're just three spies.

463
00:46:06,118 --> 00:46:08,871
Do you have to pull this kind of trick?

464
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:14,209
What I want is simple.
I just want to break in and kill them all.

465
00:46:14,835 --> 00:46:16,378
But…

466
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:21,425
it turned out Eun's daughter
is one of the hostages.

467
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,971
Mr. Eun's daughter?

468
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:31,268
I can't just do as I want
beside the anxious father.

469
00:46:32,394 --> 00:46:33,854
So it came to this.

470
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:41,153
Even if you're asking, I'm a doctor.
I can't kill a person. No, I won't.

471
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:44,281
Please. Do this for me, honey.

472
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:45,657
-Please.
-Instead,

473
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:48,994
I'll add sleep-inducing element
to the painkiller

474
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:50,579
and make them unconscious.

475
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:57,127
You wicked little fox.

476
00:46:58,587 --> 00:46:59,630
Repeat the code phrase.

477
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,052
"I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."

478
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,553
Good.

479
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:12,684
Area 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5

480
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:14,770
are ready to be wiretapped.

481
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:19,274
Eun!

482
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,068
-Sir.
-Hurry up.

483
00:47:23,862 --> 00:47:25,155
It's nice to meet you.

484
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:26,740
You too.

485
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:28,659
Director Eun and Chief An.

486
00:47:29,618 --> 00:47:33,914
As far as we know, two of the spies
and one agent of ours are injured.

487
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:37,751
Judging by the gunfire, some of
the students might've gotten hurt too.

488
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:40,295
Will you be okay by yourself?

489
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,674
Dr. Kang's such an excellent doctor.

490
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:46,593
I noticed that one of the hostages
is a nursing major.

491
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:48,303
She can have them help her.

492
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:51,139
I'll be okay by myself.

493
00:47:52,557 --> 00:47:55,560
We'll do our best to get you out safely
once you're done.

494
00:47:56,061 --> 00:48:00,899
And agent Jang Han-na
will assist you well.

495
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,099
This is the list of the captured students.

496
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:41,648
Does any of them have an illness?

497
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:43,650
Why?

498
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:46,194
Just tell me if there's anyone
who must get out.

499
00:48:53,744 --> 00:48:55,912
Those with illnesses are hard to handle,

500
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:58,957
but there are other students
harder to control.

501
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,960
This one sleepwalks every night.

502
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:06,214
And this one fearlessly protests
while throwing petrol bombs.

503
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,761
And this one's a nut job who always does

504
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:13,096
what I tell her not to do.

505
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:25,233
Think about it.

506
00:49:25,317 --> 00:49:27,819
They knew they'd be kicked out
if they broke the rules.

507
00:49:27,903 --> 00:49:32,199
But they still deceived me
as well as ANSP agents…

508
00:49:33,158 --> 00:49:35,744
They hid you inside the bench
in the sauna, didn't they?

509
00:49:35,827 --> 00:49:37,829
Being all naked. Who does that?

510
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:40,791
They're so daring.

511
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:44,211
Yes, they're obedient for now,

512
00:49:44,795 --> 00:49:47,255
but as time passes by,
they'll be hard to control.

513
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,674
If you think the girls are easy to handle,

514
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:51,218
you'll get in trouble.

515
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,393
It doesn't have to be students, does it?

516
00:50:02,312 --> 00:50:03,688
<i>I said, shut your mouths!</i>

517
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:06,900
I'm sorry.

518
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,044
I will keep my mouth shut.

519
00:50:26,128 --> 00:50:27,462
Keep your heads down.

520
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:36,596
Everyone raise your heads.

521
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:50,110
I'll release some of you right now.

522
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:57,534
As for the rest of you, I'll release

523
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:01,204
those who are cooperative
next time or the next time after that.

524
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,251
But for those who disobey us

525
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,837
and are uncooperative,

526
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:13,049
there will be no release.

527
00:51:13,842 --> 00:51:16,303
I, Oh Gwang-tea, will always

528
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:18,972
be cooperative.

529
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:20,515
I swear.

530
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:25,520
If you understood, be wise about it.

531
00:51:40,285 --> 00:51:42,287
If your name is called,

532
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:44,497
stand up.

533
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:56,718
Mr. Eun, they're calling names.

534
00:52:03,058 --> 00:52:04,392
Yeo Jeong-min.

535
00:52:09,022 --> 00:52:09,940
<i>Ko Yu-na.</i>

536
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:11,274
Thank God!

537
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,904
-Shin Gyeong-ja.
-Here.

538
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:19,032
Ko Hye-ryeong.

539
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:23,078
I knew it!
I knew this wouldn't be the end of me.

540
00:52:29,876 --> 00:52:30,835
Seo Eun-gyo.

541
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:32,712
Thank you!

542
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:33,713
Kim Ye-won.

543
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:36,508
<i>-Park Seon-ja.
-Here.</i>

544
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:38,051

545
00:52:39,261 --> 00:52:40,220
Yoon Seol-hui.

546
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,307
Thank you!

547
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:47,477
Three from room 207?

548
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:49,396
It's suspicious.

549
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:50,438
You're right.

550
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:51,856
It must be because of Yeong-ro.

551
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,693
What's this? Yeong-ro's roommates
are being treated specially?

552
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:56,611
This is so unfair.

553
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:59,197
Tell me about it. It's so obvious.

554
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:01,574
-That can't be.
-It's possible.

555
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:02,826
Of course it is.

556
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:07,163
Quiet!

557
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,502
Excuse me, sir.

558
00:53:13,086 --> 00:53:16,381
Can I tell you about myself a bit?

559
00:53:17,132 --> 00:53:19,134
I, Oh Gwang-tae, grew up

560
00:53:19,217 --> 00:53:22,095
with a single mom,
and like that wasn't enough,

561
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:26,266
I've gotten hepatitis A.

562
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:27,559
If I stay here--

563
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:29,477
-Shut up.
-Yes, sir.

564
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:31,521
We'll never release you.

565
00:53:32,272 --> 00:53:33,898
But I'm telling the truth.

566
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:36,568
-I really have it. I swear.
-Stop.

567
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:37,944
Forget what I said.

568
00:53:38,528 --> 00:53:39,738
You're such a loser.

569
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,578
Eun Yeong-ro.

570
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:53,460
That's it.

571
00:53:55,462 --> 00:53:56,463
Eun Yeong-ro?

572
00:54:03,178 --> 00:54:04,304
Eun Yeong-ro.

573
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:11,186
You can't do this.

574
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,022
Be quiet, Bun-ok.

575
00:54:14,105 --> 00:54:15,357
You didn't ever hear us out.

576
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,442
Why are you only releasing students?

577
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:21,446
What about me, Mr. Kim, and Ms. Oh?
We can't even get a chance?

578
00:54:22,197 --> 00:54:23,490
This is unfair!

579
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,659
On what grounds did you decide on this?

580
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:29,621
On what grounds!

581
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:30,872
Shut your mouth!

582
00:54:30,955 --> 00:54:33,291
She's so feisty.

583
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:37,587
This all happened because of her.
Why does she get to leave?

584
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,965
She can't die and I can?

585
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:57,649
She's right.

586
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:01,152
Bun-ok is right.

587
00:55:02,654 --> 00:55:04,114
<i>I'll stay here.</i>

588
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,450
<i>Release someone else.</i>

589
00:55:09,702 --> 00:55:11,871
How can I leave when they can't?

590
00:55:13,373 --> 00:55:14,791
That's not right.

591
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:20,797
I'll stay too.

592
00:55:23,216 --> 00:55:24,843
I played a big part too.

593
00:55:25,427 --> 00:55:26,719
If Yeong-ro stays,

594
00:55:26,803 --> 00:55:29,556
I can't just leave her here
to save my skin.

595
00:55:31,391 --> 00:55:33,893
Why don't we just draw lots?
That'll be fair.

596
00:55:39,149 --> 00:55:40,900
I totally agree!

597
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:42,819
-I agree.
-So do I.

598
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:56,082
Shut up! Quiet!

599
00:56:10,054 --> 00:56:12,390
RÉSUMÉ
KYE BUN-OK

600
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:18,438
She's our telephone operator.

601
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,274
She's looking after her sick parents.

602
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:24,903
She's a poor girl
who's the sole breadwinner.

603
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:28,406
I really hope you'll release her.

604
00:56:29,908 --> 00:56:31,826
You were the last one.

605
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:39,626
But not anymore.

606
00:56:57,101 --> 00:56:59,729
You'll never get a chance to be released.

607
00:57:11,324 --> 00:57:13,910
When I said those who disobey us
and are uncooperative

608
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:17,413
wouldn't be released,
you should've taken it seriously.

609
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,252
Drawing lots?

610
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:27,298
I decide who gets released.

611
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:33,054
Anyway…

612
00:57:33,137 --> 00:57:34,973
Hold on. Wait!

613
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,231
In any case, we're being released, right?

614
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:53,575
Hey!

615
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,127
Because of that stupid Gizzard…

616
00:58:07,672 --> 00:58:08,840
What a wench!

617
00:58:49,422 --> 00:58:51,007
AREA 2-1
WIRETAPPED

618
00:58:58,264 --> 00:58:59,140
Mr. An.

619
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:05,396
Gang-mu must be locked up
and sending us a message.

620
00:59:10,693 --> 00:59:13,946
It seems
the hostages are locked in the cafeteria

621
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:18,117
and Gang-mu is
locked in room 203 separately.

622
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:22,455
I think he's tied up in a separate room.

623
00:59:23,498 --> 00:59:26,834
According to the blueprint, the distance
between the cafeteria and the room

624
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:29,629
is about 30 meters and…

625
00:59:36,344 --> 00:59:38,471
I have a favor to ask.

626
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:41,724
Of course, you don't have to do it

627
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:45,520
because if we get caught,
you'll be put in danger too.

628
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:49,524
If that's the case,
let me hear you out first.

629
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:54,696
This.

630
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,032
I want to give this to Mr. Lee.

631
00:59:58,616 --> 01:00:01,994
How about we hide it in the medical kit?

632
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:05,623
They know who I am,
so it's impossible for me to bring it.

633
01:00:11,671 --> 01:00:13,673
-Is the doctor ready?
<i>-Before that,</i>

634
01:00:13,756 --> 01:00:16,384
I need to check if the students are safe.

635
01:00:16,467 --> 01:00:17,927
What are you trying to pull again?

636
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,762
To check if they're safe

637
01:00:19,846 --> 01:00:21,848
and to protect the doctor,

638
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:23,933
one of our agents will accompany her.

639
01:00:24,016 --> 01:00:26,227
And please let the doctor
treat our agent too.

640
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,645
Look.

641
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:32,692
I can't guarantee what will happen
if they try anything else.

642
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:36,904
I give you my word.

643
01:00:56,716 --> 01:00:57,759
Jang.

644
01:00:57,842 --> 01:00:58,843
Yes, sir.

645
01:01:00,928 --> 01:01:03,014
They promised to let Gang-mu be treated.

646
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:05,558
So check if the students are okay first.

647
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:06,809
Yes, sir.

648
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,841
Stop there.

649
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:07,513
Put down the bag.

650
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:22,570
Open it.

651
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:34,332
Now.

652
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:49,013
Step back.

653
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,780
They're medical tools.

654
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:08,574
Please be careful not to contaminate them.

655
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:37,019
Go upstairs.

656
01:04:46,195 --> 01:04:47,655
Go over it.

657
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:56,414
Just follow me.

658
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,347
Where are the hostages?

659
01:05:24,984 --> 01:05:27,069
Gang-mu is with them, right?

660
01:05:27,153 --> 01:05:28,487
Shut it.

661
01:05:30,031 --> 01:05:31,741
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

662
01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:37,371
<i>And Gang-mu is</i>

663
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:39,874
locked in room 203 separately.

664
01:05:44,003 --> 01:05:44,837
To your left.

665
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:08,569
Comrade Lim.

666
01:06:39,308 --> 01:06:41,143
Move faster.

667
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:56,992
Comrade Joo, get the doctor here first.

668
01:07:00,621 --> 01:07:02,081
I need someone to assist me.

669
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:05,000
I heard there's a nursing major here.

670
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:08,379
Kim Dong-ji.

671
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:09,630
Yes, ma'am.

672
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:12,633
She's the one.

673
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:16,011
Can you help me?

674
01:07:21,725 --> 01:07:23,686
He's been running a fever since dawn.

675
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:41,579
If he's over 38°C, he can't have surgery.

676
01:07:41,662 --> 01:07:43,747
I must give him
a fever reducer and antibiotics

677
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:45,499
to reduce the fever first.

678
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:51,338
I heard two of you are injured.

679
01:07:52,047 --> 01:07:53,174
Where's the other one?

680
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:56,594
Comrade Joo.

681
01:08:08,105 --> 01:08:09,231
Get treated.

682
01:08:37,468 --> 01:08:41,222
Hello, sir. This is
Hong Ae-ra. You remember me, right?

683
01:08:41,305 --> 01:08:43,474
I called to ask you something.

684
01:08:44,475 --> 01:08:48,562
You told me the other day
that for my husband to become president,

685
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:51,941
13 young virgins must
be offered as sacrifices, right?

686
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:00,199
But does it have to be exactly 13 people?

687
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:06,121
Oh, I see.

688
01:09:07,206 --> 01:09:10,751
Thank you. I'll come visit you soon.

689
01:09:15,256 --> 01:09:17,925
Ma'am, it's all ready.

690
01:09:32,314 --> 01:09:34,566
I can see all of the 64 hostages are safe.

691
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,694
How many of them will you release?

692
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:44,285
Rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

693
01:09:46,203 --> 01:09:49,123
The doctor needs to treat them anyway,

694
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:52,960
so why don't you just release them too?

695
01:09:58,132 --> 01:09:59,883
I think that'll be better for both of us.

696
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:05,514
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

697
01:10:06,265 --> 01:10:07,141
Here!

698
01:10:07,224 --> 01:10:08,309
What's going on?

699
01:10:08,392 --> 01:10:11,020
Hey, Ms. Oh. Are you okay? What's wrong?

700
01:10:11,103 --> 01:10:12,313
-Oh, no.
-Are you okay?

701
01:10:12,896 --> 01:10:13,814
Hold on.

702
01:10:14,606 --> 01:10:16,275
Drink water.

703
01:10:16,942 --> 01:10:19,403
What's wrong?
Do you have trouble breathing?

704
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:20,487
Attention.

705
01:10:23,157 --> 01:10:25,701
I'll select people who will be released.

706
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:35,753
<i>If you disobey me this time again,</i>

707
01:10:37,129 --> 01:10:38,672
you won't get out of here alive.

708
01:10:47,348 --> 01:10:48,390
You.

709
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:53,896
You.

710
01:10:56,065 --> 01:10:56,940
<i>You.</i>

711
01:10:58,317 --> 01:10:59,568
<i>You.</i>

712
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:01,445
"You"? Damn it.

713
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:04,114
Why isn't this bastard
calling their names?

714
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:06,492
Who is he picking?

715
01:11:06,575 --> 01:11:09,078
Don't you think we need to find it out?

716
01:11:10,412 --> 01:11:13,415
Damn it. My blood pressure.

717
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,459
The six of you will get out too.

718
01:11:24,426 --> 01:11:26,095
God damn bastard.

719
01:11:26,178 --> 01:11:28,347
Everyone I selected, come out.

720
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:38,148
Yu-na.

721
01:11:38,232 --> 01:11:39,817
What's wrong, Yu-na?

722
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,361
-He's having trouble breathing.
-What's wrong?

723
01:11:42,444 --> 01:11:45,030
-Are you okay?
-Yu-na.

724
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:48,367
-Go get a plastic bag. Now!
-I'll go.

725
01:11:51,453 --> 01:11:53,372
Yu-na, you're okay.

726
01:11:53,455 --> 01:11:56,083
You won't die. Everything will be okay.

727
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:57,793
Have her breathe into it. Hurry.

728
01:11:58,836 --> 01:12:00,963
Breathe. Breathe deeply.

729
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:04,716
Deeply and slowly.

730
01:12:07,469 --> 01:12:10,764
I'm so scared.

731
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:14,810
I think the stress is too much for her.

732
01:12:15,853 --> 01:12:18,105
Can't you release her too?

733
01:12:18,772 --> 01:12:20,149
Me too!

734
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:22,067
-I can't stand it any longer!
-Me too!

735
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:24,778
-Me too!
-Me too!

736
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:25,988
-Me too!
-Me too!

737
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:28,449
-Me too!
-It should be us!

738
01:12:28,532 --> 01:12:30,409
-This is a women's dorm!
-Me too!

739
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:32,411
-Why do I have to keep quiet?
-Me too!

740
01:12:32,494 --> 01:12:35,831
-Listen to what we have to say too!
-Me too!

741
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:38,959
-Let us men go too!
-Me too!

742
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:40,586
-God damn it!
-Me too!

743
01:12:40,919 --> 01:12:42,880
-Why do we have to be here?
-Me too!

744
01:12:42,963 --> 01:12:44,214
Enough!

745
01:12:46,383 --> 01:12:48,135
Who wants to die first?

746
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:49,803
Who?

747
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:50,929
Stop!

748
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:14,620
Who are you to decide who gets to live?

749
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:19,666
<i>Only I will be enough.</i>

750
01:13:22,377 --> 01:13:23,879
<i>I'll stay, so release all of them.</i>

751
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:25,672
Let them all go!

752
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:37,851
Keep your heads down!

753
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:44,525
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

754
01:13:49,655 --> 01:13:51,031
You leave.

755
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:56,370
This is our dorm.

756
01:13:57,454 --> 01:13:59,414
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

757
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,418
Oh, my goodness.

758
01:14:05,504 --> 01:14:07,589
-You're not done.
-Let go.

759
01:14:07,673 --> 01:14:09,341
I'll kill this damn wench.

760
01:14:39,413 --> 01:14:41,957
Please let them go. They're innocent.

761
01:15:03,854 --> 01:15:04,855
You…

762
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:08,734
You don't know who I am, do you?

763
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,959
I'll tell you.

764
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:32,174
I'm…

765
01:15:34,843 --> 01:15:36,595
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

766
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:47,522
Eun Chang-su,

767
01:15:48,023 --> 01:15:50,359
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

768
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,196
is my father.

769
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:30,148
She hid him? Hid the communist spy?
Your daughter really did it?

770
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:33,860
<i>Does hiding a spy count as espionage?</i>

771
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:38,365
<i>You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?</i>

772
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:42,369
You son of a b****!

773
01:16:42,452 --> 01:16:44,830
<i>I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.</i>

774
01:16:44,913 --> 01:16:46,498
What kind of deal did you make?

775
01:16:46,581 --> 01:16:49,584
<i>We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.</i>

776
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:51,837
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars?

777
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,590
<i>I'm sure our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.</i>

778
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:57,676
Kill them.

779
01:16:57,759 --> 01:17:01,430
Director Eun Chang-su won't
even find his daughter's body.

780
01:17:02,472 --> 01:17:03,682
Please.

781
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:05,350
Kill me.

-One, two.
-Careful.

786
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:28,373
We must take them down
before they blow themselves up!

787
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:31,668
What if we break in rashly
and get the hostages killed, you bastard?

788
01:17:31,752 --> 01:17:33,044
What? "Bastard"?

789
01:17:33,128 --> 01:17:34,421
How dare you call me that?

790
01:17:34,504 --> 01:17:37,758
Just get lost. This is my jurisdiction!

791
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:40,135
You always dilly-dally and are indecisive,

792
01:17:40,218 --> 01:17:43,472
and that's why all this has happened.
You're a liability to us!

793
01:17:43,555 --> 01:17:47,392
You always blame others,
and that's why this is happening!

794
01:17:47,726 --> 01:17:49,478
Whose fault is this?

795
01:17:49,561 --> 01:17:52,439
A soft boy like you can
never serve the country well.

796
01:17:52,522 --> 01:17:55,358
You killed your former superior
on the pretext of serving the country.

797
01:17:55,442 --> 01:17:56,985
Do you call that serving the country?

798
01:17:57,068 --> 01:18:00,071
What do you know about revolution?

799
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:02,783
Just discipline your son better.

800
01:18:02,866 --> 01:18:05,869
You piece of s***, how dare you talk
about my son with your dirty mouth?

801
01:18:05,952 --> 01:18:10,791
What did you say? Do you want to die?
I must've gone too easy on you!

802
01:18:10,874 --> 01:18:12,501
<i>What? "Gone easy on me"?</i>

803
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:14,669
<i>-You God damn bastard!
-Let go, you s***!</i>

804
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,754
<i>I'll just--</i>

805
01:18:15,837 --> 01:18:17,798
<i>-Get lost already!
-God damn it!</i>
