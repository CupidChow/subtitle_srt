EPISODE 14

3
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:17,891
BLOW YOURSELVES UP WITH THE HOSTAGES BY
MIDNIGHT, OR LIM SU-HUI WILL BE EXECUTED

4
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:33,740
<i>Who said anything about the agency?</i>

5
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:37,202
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

6
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:40,330
That's the only way to save the hostages

7
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:43,458
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

8
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:03,478
Are all Southern bastards
backstabbing sly rats like you,

9
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,689
just as I heard?

10
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:13,738
Betrayal or not, I still have to do it.

11
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,531
I'm going to arrest you

12
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:17,533
and make you defect.

13
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:18,826
Don't get ahead of yourself!

14
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:24,540
I only joined hands with you to survive.
That doesn't mean I've chosen the South.

15
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:27,418
But you can't go back anyway
since you're branded a traitor.

16
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:28,378
I…

17
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:33,925
Even if I want to, I can never defect
to the South because of Su-hui.

18
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,637
Fine.

19
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:39,639
I understand.

20
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:41,766
I really do.

21
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:46,271
So let's lower our guns.

22
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:49,315
We can't afford to fight among ourselves.

23
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,859
Don't you agree?

24
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:17,510
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

25
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:20,513
We will blow up the dorm at midnight.

26
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,434
Understood, sir.

27
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:29,063
Make up some excuse
and kick the reporters out of the campus.

28
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,649
And make it look
like the commies blew themselves up.

29
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:34,444
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,946
But if we do that,

31
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,449
the hostage situation will be over.

32
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,076
Should we pay the North right away?

33
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,077
Of course not!

34
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,413
They don't deserve to be paid early.

35
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,957
The payment's supposed to be made
after the election anyway.

36
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,167
Let's take our time.

37
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:53,254
Put it off as late as possible
to make them anxious.

38
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,466
-As late as possible to make them anxious.
-That's right.

39
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:05,683
Hello?

40
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,604
It's Choi, sir.

41
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:13,775
What is it?

42
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:16,861
<i>Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon
of the MSS wants to talk to you, sir.</i>

43
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:19,947
Choi Su-ryeon?

44
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:23,534
<i>So just trust Kang Cheong-ya and wait?</i>

45
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,040
With that huge amount of money,

46
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:31,918
she could live a new life
in any country in the world.

47
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:34,462
A luxurious life, at that.

48
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,840
But we just trust her
to come back to this bomb-rigged dorm?

49
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,426
I mean, do you think

50
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,346
she's an angel?

51
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:45,473
Or a saint?

52
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:50,603
Yes,

53
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:52,772
you're right.

54
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:55,691
I'm as anxious as you are.

55
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:59,654
It's hundreds of billions of won.

56
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,532
She might flee to another country with it.

57
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,033
No,

58
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:07,370
she might talk Nam Tae-il
into killing us all

59
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,789
and manage to keep her identity hidden.

60
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:14,168
So if she finds out
we're tailing and watching her,

61
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:17,088
how do you think she'll react?

62
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:21,008
What you're doing

63
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,636
is the same as forcing her

64
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,972
to betray us. Okay?

65
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,865
Now, I have no choice…

66
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,536
but to trust and wait for Comrade Kang.

67
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:57,003
I have no other choice.

68
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:33,122
BLOW YOURSELVES UP WITH THE HOSTAGES BY
MIDNIGHT, OR LIM SU-HUI WILL BE EXECUTED

69
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:46,677
Once the meeting with Choi Mi-hye is over,
someone from Swiss BR Bank will come.

70
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:47,803
Okay.

71
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:52,475
Your job is to go to the bank with them
and wire the money to the paper company.

72
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:53,601
Got it.

73
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,735
Didn't you tell them
not to clean the room until checkout?

74
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:03,903
I did.

75
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:40,856
What are you doing?

76
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:48,359
If I pray,

77
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,487
will it be answered?

78
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,332
Is something

79
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,835
wrong?

80
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,340
No.

81
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,843
It's all right.

82
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,940
I'm sorry I've put you

83
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:30,985
through all this.

84
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,537
If you hadn't met me,

85
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,167
you wouldn't be suffering all this pain.

86
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:52,256
But you are…

87
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,677
not doing this by choice.

88
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:01,599
If…

89
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,312
If you and I were

90
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:08,856
just ordinary people,

91
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,568
what would it have been like?

92
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:44,683
I probably…

93
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:52,316
would be singing at some music cafe.

94
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:02,284
Singing?

95
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,331
I wanted…

96
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,836
to become a musician like my dad.

97
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,631
Even after we were
kicked out to the coal town,

98
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,593
he would make songs

99
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:23,681
about flowers, wind, and love
and sing them to us.

100
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:29,687
Su-hui and I would sing along.

101
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:40,030
And I think that's what kept us smiling…

102
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,826
even in that cold, barren place.

103
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:48,622
So I also…

104
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,252
want to live

105
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:57,673
singing such songs to the people I love.

106
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:13,105
If…

107
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:16,942
you sing at a music cafe,

108
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:22,239
I'll go to that cafe every day…

109
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,493
Every single day,

110
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:29,413
whether it rains or snows.

111
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:49,266
I'd love to hear

112
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,977
you sing.

113
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:10,704
<i>It's a shame
what happened to Director Eun.</i>

114
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:15,250
But technically, your agent persuaded
my agent to betray us.

115
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,294
Your side is also to blame.

116
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,797
Look, Comrade Deputy Director.

117
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,173
Are you serious?

118
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:24,510
Your guy shot our ANSP director,
for God's sake!

119
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:26,887
This scheme is worth 300 million dollars,

120
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,056
but you sent some soon-to-be traitor!

121
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,558
And you blame us? Are you kidding me?

122
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:35,270
The hostage situation can't drag on
any longer, so we took special measures.

123
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:38,941
I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't

124
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:41,235
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

125
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:43,070
So trust me and be patient.

126
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,739
By midnight today?

127
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:50,327
He may not the most loyal soldier,

128
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:53,080
but he's extremely devoted to his sister.

129
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:54,790
I'm sure he'll blow himself up.

130
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,543
So as soon as he does,

131
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:00,087
wire the 300 million dollars as promised.

132
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:17,229
This is great!

133
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:19,398
Them blowing themselves up from inside?

134
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,734
That'll make things a lot easier for us.

135
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,402
Absolutely, sir.

136
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,030
It seems everything's going smoothly.

137
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:28,907
ANSP DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

138
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:31,201
If this last one thing's taken care of,

139
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:34,621
it'll really be all good.

140
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:38,208
What is it, sir?
Is there something bothering you?

141
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,547
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

142
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:52,306
VIP ROOM

143
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,350
<i>What do we do about Eun?</i>

144
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,811
If he wakes up, we'll be in trouble.

145
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:01,315
Because he must know who shot him.

146
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:14,161
Honey! No…

147
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:17,956
You can't leave me behind like this.

148
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:22,461
Our Yeong-ung is only nine years old now.

149
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,506
And our dear Yeong-u

150
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,218
was killed by those bastards too.

151
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,720
If you die too…

152
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:35,516
Hello?

153
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:39,978
Mr. Nam, it's Choi again.

154
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:44,858
Hello?

155
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:45,901
Tae-il.

156
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,987
You should turn on MBS News right now.

157
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,864
MBS News?

158
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:58,789
<i>The longer he is in shock
due to excessive bleeding,</i>

159
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:02,042
<i>the less likely he is to survive.</i>

160
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:03,794
<i>So we can't</i>

161
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,839
<i>be sure yet if he's going to make it.</i>

162
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:10,175
That means he may not make it.

163
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,887
-My goodness. That's such a shame.
<i>-Honey, no!</i>

164
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,890
<i>I don't think
we have to do anything to get rid of him.</i>

165
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:18,308
Don't worry.

166
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:19,977
Okay, I understand.

167
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:23,981
<i>-Honey!</i>
-Goodness.

168
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,649
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU
IN CRITICAL CONDITION

169
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:28,193
-I feel so bad for him.
<i>-You can't die like this.</i>

170
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:30,404
He's always put our country and people

171
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:33,574
before his family, you know.

172
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:42,958
The password is

173
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,169
your birthday.

174
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:49,965
If anything goes wrong, I'm dead meat.
Literally. You know that, right?

175
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:52,301
God, don't be such a coward.

176
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:54,845
You said you looked into it too.

177
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,263
Yes.

178
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:59,892
There really is a fund manager
named Linda Young at ABK Partners.

179
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,018
See?

180
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:05,898
She's the precious person my fortuneteller
told me about. He can't be wrong.

181
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,275
What about the company bankbook and seal?

182
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:13,447
I opened it in a rush as you said, but
why do we need a corporate bank account?

183
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,616
It's such a huge amount of money.

184
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:17,492
So we'll send the money abroad

185
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,204
as if this corporate is investing
in the paper company.

186
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,707
Then the paper company will invest
the money in the private equity fund.

187
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,544
This won't do. I'll go with you.

188
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:30,631
The Chief of the ANSP OPC
should be present so that they can't--

189
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:32,424
You can't be serious!

190
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:37,596
Do you want everyone to know
you're using the ANSP secret fund?

191
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:40,098
You're right.

192
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,645
The company's
in the name of Ms. Kim, right?

193
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,397
Of course. In the name of Kim Ye-ni.

194
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:51,526
I got to say,
you're as clever as Hannibal.

195
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,695
It's like you knew this would happen

196
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:57,616
and hired a Korean-American
as your secretary. You're amazing.

197
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,035
Stop saying silly things.

198
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:02,871
Just a week.

199
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:06,166
In just a week,
we will make 90 million dollars.

200
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,628
That's 71.3 billion won!

201
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:13,757
All you need to do is
buy me one week's time.

202
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:15,342
Okay?

203
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,593
Don't worry.

204
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:21,890
Nam Tae-il told me to take my time
before sending the money.

205
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:29,273
This is the bankbook
with 300 million dollars.

206
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:33,068
And this is the seal I mentioned.

207
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:35,737
Thank you.

208
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:38,907
I put the password inside the envelope.

209
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:49,418
And this is the corporate bankbook.

210
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:51,336
Yes.

211
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,631
And lastly, this is the seal
you asked for.

212
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:55,924
Yes!

213
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,427
Well, everything has been checked.

214
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:04,391
Now, this is the certificate for the fund.

215
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:08,478
All you have to do
is to sign your name here,

216
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,398
and you, Mrs. Choi,

217
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:15,110
will officially be a member
of our private equity fund.

218
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,778
Once you sign it,

219
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,822
you'll be a member
of the private equity fund.

220
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,032
I know.

221
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:43,263
Everything is in order.

222
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:45,307
Now,

223
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,353
this is just a small token
of our appreciation.

224
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,318
What is...

225
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,279
Just a small token.

226
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,375
Oh, my god!

227
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:16,129
Thank you. Thank you very much!

228
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:22,052
This is the bankbook
with 300 million dollars in it.

229
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:26,598
And this is the personal seal.

230
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,019
This is the corporate bankbook
you requested.

231
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,438
Again, along with the seal

232
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:36,024
is the password I will put
in this envelope.

233
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,696
All right. I think that's everything.

234
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:52,249
We are honored to have you
as our valued client.

235
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:28,034
<i>Promise me…</i>

236
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,706
you'll leave with me if I come back.

237
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,814
It's me.

238
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,866
I got the pocket change
that was to be sent North.

239
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:14,331
Great job.

240
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,124
You must…

241
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:19,586
come back by midnight.

242
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:23,757
Put Lee Gang-mu on.

243
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:34,392
Speaking.

244
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:38,396
Mr. Lee, I understand
you did what you had to do,

245
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:41,399
<i>but I'm quite offended.</i>

246
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,318
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

247
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,487
No more tailing me.

248
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:49,658
Jang Han-na.

249
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:51,159
<i>Understood?</i>

250
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,998
Damn it. What do I do?

251
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,252
You're going to support me now, Han-na.

252
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:03,505
<i>Once I'm gone,
Nam Tae-il will find it strange.</i>

253
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:05,882
<i>Just in case,</i>

254
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:08,843
<i>we must find evidence that can stop him.</i>

255
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,346
Bring a SWAT team uniform

256
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:13,765
to my hideout exactly in an hour.

257
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,476
<i>If you understood, Gang-mu, put Soo-ho on.</i>

258
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:27,320
We'll distract them
for you to come back in safely.

259
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:31,449
No, I'll find a way to get in on my own,
so don't bother.

260
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,578
I'll come in by 2200 hours at the latest.

261
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:47,966
You even bugged her?

262
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:56,474
Do you still not trust her?

263
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,979
Before she shows up in front of me,
honestly, no.

264
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:10,071
It needs recharging.

265
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:18,913
Where the heck is it?

266
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,006
Ma'am.

267
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,967
Does the wiretapping room
still have power?

268
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:33,261
This needs recharging.

269
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,472
Yes. I'll do it for you.

270
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:10,340
So soon?

271
00:26:10,423 --> 00:26:13,009
But she went out only yesterday.

272
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,636
She did it in a day?

273
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,805
She even managed
to become Nam Tae-il's doctor.

274
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:19,766
She must have substantial intel.

275
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,727
She'll come back tonight. Han-na's
watching her, so let's wait and see.

276
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:24,979
But will she really come back?

277
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:27,565
I mean, what's in it for her?

278
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:29,317
I'm not sure.

279
00:26:30,944 --> 00:26:35,156
I guess love is more important to her
than ideology or principles.

280
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:40,578
Of course, love is more important
than ideology or principles.

281
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:47,419
Whether you're a man or a woman,
that's the truth of life.

282
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:53,925
If Kang Cheong-ya really comes back,

283
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,847
I should learn a lesson from her.

284
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:14,154
<i>Comes back?</i>

285
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:18,992
<i>Wait a second.
Did Kang Cheong-ya get out of the dorm?</i>

286
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:02,327
A charger must be somewhere in here.

287
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,061
Darn it.

288
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,298
Hello?

289
00:28:58,925 --> 00:28:59,843
<i>Who is this?</i>

290
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:01,719
The telephone operator?

291
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:04,097
Yes. This is Gye Bun-ok.

292
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:06,891
Yeong-ro and I are really close.

293
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:09,727
I can help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.

294
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:14,190
Watch what you say.
Who said we'd only get her out?

295
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:15,900
Stop talking nonsense and turn it off.

296
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,610
Wait!

297
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:21,114
You'll be promoted
if you catch the Northern spy, right?

298
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:22,907
Do you want my help?

299
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:28,538
You can help me catch Lim Soo-ho?
How will you do that?

300
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:32,166
Well, I will give you
very useful information.

301
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:35,086
In return, you must help me later.

302
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,927
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
of Hankuk Central Medical Center

303
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,138
is a Northern spy.

304
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:56,107
What did you just say?
Kang Cheong-ya is what?

305
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,234
She is a Northern spy!

306
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:01,237
<i>She must be out of the dorm right now--</i>

307
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:05,617
Hello? Hey!

308
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:07,660
Darn it.

309
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:23,009
Where on earth
did my precious little fox go?

310
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:24,719
I can't reach her all day.

311
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,896
Seung-jun!

312
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,981
That startled me.

313
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:40,193
What's wrong with that bastard?

314
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:43,446
Chief An? It's me.

315
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:46,908
Can you come to my husband's
hospital room right now?

316
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:50,745
I'm quite busy at the moment.

317
00:30:51,204 --> 00:30:52,914
Can't we just talk over the phone?

318
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,834
I'm asking you to come here

319
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:59,921
because it's not something
I can tell you over the phone.

320
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:00,922
Ma'am.

321
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:05,176
I'm carrying out an important task
with our country's honor on the line.

322
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:07,387
I've got to go.

323
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:10,807
Chief An!

324
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:15,687
How rude…

325
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:24,445
Nam planted his man right under your nose.

326
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:27,532
How come you don't have
anyone loyal to you?

327
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:30,827
Loyal to me?

328
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:33,496
Do you know agent Jang Han-na?

329
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,418
She told me
that Nam Tae-il's the one who shot you.

330
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,336
How about we use her?

331
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:44,966
Jang Han-na…

332
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:15,955
God damn it.

333
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:17,141
Come on. Pick up the phone!

334
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,909
Cheong-ya, get out of there!
An Gyeong-hui's going up to get you!

335
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:15,533
Search thoroughly.

336
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:25,418
Kang Cheong-ya!

337
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:39,473
Damn it. Why is it so narrow?

338
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:43,477
Look at this.

339
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,376
CHOI MI-HYE

340
00:35:11,255 --> 00:35:12,340
Cheong-ya, get in!

341
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:14,634
Hurry up!

342
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:17,053
What are you waiting for? Get in! Now!

343
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,027
<i>This is why I told you to arrest Han-na!</i>

344
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:37,365
Put Cheong-ya on the no-fly list
and put out an APB on her. Han-na, too.

345
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:39,825
Damn it.

346
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:57,885
We found this.

347
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:58,970
What is it?

348
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:05,476
What?

349
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:29,875
What on earth are they up to?

350
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,753
They'll never let
the ANSP director's daughter die.

351
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:59,030
The ANSP director's daughter?

352
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,747
What does that mean?

353
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:11,208
"They'll never let
the ANSP director's daughter die"?

354
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:16,964
No, it's nothing.

355
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:20,217
You damn wench.

356
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:22,094
Hey.

357
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:24,722
Are you still looking down on me?

358
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:28,768
There's no commie to save you in here.

359
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:33,814
Talk while I'm asking nicely.

360
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:35,483
Now.

361
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:40,738
The truth is…

362
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,672
Gosh,

363
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:00,591
the song's really great.

364
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:02,385
How holy.

365
00:38:09,016 --> 00:38:10,142
Sir.

366
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:12,728
Wake up, sir!

367
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:16,273
The ANSP director's daughter is in here.

368
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:20,694
Why the hell are you not using
that amazing card?

369
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:25,157
What are you talking about?

370
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:28,035
The ANSP director's daughter is in here?

371
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:36,585
I mean,

372
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:40,464
you could use the daughter
and demand a bus or something.

373
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:43,259
Why are you not using her
to get out of here?

374
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:46,303
So who is it?
Who's the ANSP director's daughter?

375
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:48,556
No way, that's impossible.

376
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,016
Why would the ANSP director's daughter
live in a dorm?

377
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,812
Well, the hall director must know
if that's true.

378
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:02,945
What…

379
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:04,613
Well,

380
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,867
speak of the devil.

381
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:15,374
What?

382
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:21,172
What's going on?

383
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,799
Yeong-ro.

384
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,431
Your father is the ANSP director?

385
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:37,188
No.

386
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:40,399
Guys, that can't be true.
You know her father runs a rice cake shop.

387
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:43,360
-She gave out rice cakes, remember?
-Hey!

388
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:44,778
You be quiet.

389
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:48,199
I asked her. You better tell the truth.

390
00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:50,326
Is your father the ANSP director?

391
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,293
It must be true.

392
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:01,295
The director's name is Eun Chang-su.

393
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:04,173
Yeong-ro's the only one in here
whose family name

394
00:40:04,256 --> 00:40:05,674
is Eun.

395
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,843
No way.

396
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,638
Eun Yeong-ro.

397
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:13,641
Is it…

398
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:16,268
Is it really true?

399
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:26,237
Jeong-min, I'm sorry.

400
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:28,447
I didn't mean to lie to you--

401
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:33,118
Did you tell us your parents ran
a rice cake shop to keep it from us?

402
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:36,705
No, that's not it.
My grandma does run a rice cake shop.

403
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:39,542
Isn't the ANSP director
the one trying to kill us all?

404
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,627
Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?

405
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,836
That's so creepy!

406
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:46,298
This must be why she didn't tell you.
Don't you think?

407
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:48,759
Are you taking her side
since you're an ANSP spy?

408
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,303
Eun Yeong-ro.

409
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:54,640
Listen carefully.

410
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:58,644
My brother used to weigh 78kg,

411
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:01,730
but after a month
of being locked up in the ANSP,

412
00:41:02,356 --> 00:41:03,774
he's now 50kg.

413
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:07,653
He was so ashamed that he'd given in

414
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,697
that he blamed himself

415
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:13,242
and went insane in the end.

416
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:17,204
The head of those
who strive to torture innocent people

417
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:19,540
is her father?

418
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,709
Yes.

419
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:25,254
The one who gives them incentives

420
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:28,549
to encourage them to dedicate themselves

421
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:31,468
to their country and people

422
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:34,054
must be her dad.

423
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:39,768
Hey.

424
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:43,188
Your dad's trying to kill us all
even when you're in here?

425
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:44,857
Of course not.

426
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:47,484
He must be trying
to save only his daughter.

427
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,446
He's the powerful ANSP director after all.

428
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:52,448
That's obvious.

429
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:07,713
Eun Yeong-ro.

430
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:09,882
Don't you

431
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:12,676
ever come into our room.

432
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,806
Let's go, girls.

433
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:28,400
-And she gets a scholarship?
-She's really something.

434
00:42:28,484 --> 00:42:31,070
-She's really scary.
-What an amazing dad you've got.

435
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:33,656
How could you lie about such--

436
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,449
What's the use of talking to such a liar?

437
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:37,201
I'm disappointed, Yeong-ro.

438
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,623
Yeong-ro. I can't believe that's true.

439
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,920
There's no one to trust in this world.

440
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:51,382
She's so creepy.

441
00:42:55,135 --> 00:42:56,303
I really thought

442
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:59,765
you were a nice person.
How could you fool us all this time?

443
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:13,487
How could you…

444
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:19,243
How could you lie to me too?

445
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:22,371
Seol-hui.

446
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,338
Are you okay?

447
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:22,973
I'm… I'm fine.

448
00:44:23,515 --> 00:44:26,894
It's true I've kept it from them
that I'm the ANSP director's daughter.

449
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:30,647
And it's true that my dad did bad things.

450
00:44:32,816 --> 00:44:36,361
They're just on edge
with all they've been going through.

451
00:44:36,445 --> 00:44:38,322
They will understand you

452
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,741
someday.

453
00:44:42,242 --> 00:44:43,744
Thank you.

454
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:25,637
I'm really fine.

455
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,935
<i>I doubt it was someone in the dorm
that ratted on me.</i>

456
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,361
After ratting on me,

457
00:48:05,612 --> 00:48:07,489
you helped me escape.

458
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,868
What are you trying to pull?

459
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:21,086
Look, doctor.

460
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:24,089
You must go back
into the dorm for Gang-mu to live.

461
00:48:24,756 --> 00:48:26,425
Why would I rat on you?

462
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:37,436
The North told Soo-ho
they'd kill his sister if he doesn't

463
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,022
blow up the hostages and himself
by midnight.

464
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:42,357
So you must get back in!

465
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:47,738
So you should've done as I said.

466
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:50,198
I warned you to stop keeping an eye on me.

467
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:53,243
And the ANSP raided my hideout
now of all times?

468
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:55,370
Wow.

469
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:58,582
This is what I get for saving you?

470
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:01,460
You didn't get caught, did you?

471
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,818
This is Charmant.

472
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:31,573
Ma'am. It's your husband.

473
00:49:33,825 --> 00:49:36,828
God, he's such a coward.
I'm getting tired of this.

474
00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:39,039
How many times has he been calling me?

475
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:43,418
What is it this time?

476
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:45,462
What's the relationship
between you and Cheong-ya?

477
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:47,255
Who the hell is Cheong-ya?

478
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,883
You know, Nam Tae-il's doctor.

479
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:52,302
The one that's being held hostage
in the dorm.

480
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,888
<i>She had photos of you.</i>

481
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:56,348
Don't be surprised.

482
00:49:57,432 --> 00:50:01,228
It turns out, she's a Northern spy.

483
00:50:01,311 --> 00:50:03,188
Dr. Kang is?

484
00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:05,524
Oh, my goodness.

485
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:08,610
Are you serious? Is it really true?

486
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:10,487
Hello.

487
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,030
<i>I'm serious.</i>

488
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:15,242
<i>You really have
nothing to do with her, right?</i>

489
00:50:15,325 --> 00:50:18,036
She even kept watch on you and me.

490
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,748
Oh, my God. She's kept watch on me?

491
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,543
Well, I…

492
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:27,337
Playing mahjong with her
a few times is all.

493
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,507
Don't worry a thing, honey.

494
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:33,093
Yes, that's all.

495
00:50:36,888 --> 00:50:39,015
By the way, our Mr. Nam

496
00:50:40,016 --> 00:50:42,060
must be in trouble now.

497
00:50:42,144 --> 00:50:43,436
Yes.

498
00:50:44,896 --> 00:50:47,607
Go easy on him, honey. Okay?

499
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:49,151
Go easy on him.

500
00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:50,652
Bye.

501
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:58,702
What's going on? He's in trouble?

502
00:50:59,911 --> 00:51:01,913
Did something happen to my husband?

503
00:51:03,623 --> 00:51:04,958
Goodness.

504
00:51:08,837 --> 00:51:10,213
It's about Dr. Kang.

505
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:14,968
Mr. Nam's doctor.

506
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:21,016
It turns out,

507
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:23,476
she's a Northern spy.

508
00:51:25,854 --> 00:51:28,106
What? A Northern…

509
00:51:29,482 --> 00:51:31,067
A Northern spy?

510
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:35,864
I told you, didn't I?

511
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:39,618
That you shouldn't let
such a pretty, young girl

512
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,119
beside your husband.

513
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:44,998
Goodness. She must've done everything
to get on his good side,

514
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:47,792
so they must be quite intimate.

515
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,213
Quite intimate?

516
00:51:51,296 --> 00:51:52,255
What--

517
00:51:58,595 --> 00:51:59,930
Ms. Kim.

518
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,891
<i>Honey!</i>

519
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:05,185
Why did you leave the door wide open?

520
00:52:05,268 --> 00:52:08,855
What if someone comes
and steals away my precious little fox?

521
00:52:13,526 --> 00:52:15,987
You bastards! What are you doing here?

522
00:52:20,158 --> 00:52:21,576
Are you crazy?

523
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:26,748
Show him.

524
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:41,638
The dorm telephone operator tipped me off

525
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:44,766
that Kang Cheong-ya

526
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:47,185
is a Northern spy.

527
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:53,608
What?

528
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:55,568
Kang Cheong-ya's real name is

529
00:52:56,236 --> 00:52:57,570
Kanemoto Riko.

530
00:52:58,446 --> 00:53:00,657
The fact that
she's a Korean-Japanese would be

531
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,909
enough for me to make her a Northern spy.

532
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:07,580
But she so kindly left us
plenty of evidence.

533
00:53:11,876 --> 00:53:15,005
Chief An, there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

534
00:53:15,088 --> 00:53:17,382
She and I are nothing

535
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:19,301
but a doctor and a patient.

536
00:53:19,384 --> 00:53:20,802
We're not what you think--

537
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:33,982
Guys, why do you think

538
00:53:34,065 --> 00:53:37,360
Mr. Nam has kept it from us
that Kang got out of the dorm?

539
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:42,324
Number one, because the pretty spy
persuaded him to join her side.

540
00:53:42,407 --> 00:53:43,366
Number two,

541
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,328
because the pretty spy
sexually convinced him.

542
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:47,662
Number three,

543
00:53:48,288 --> 00:53:49,956
because he is

544
00:53:50,248 --> 00:53:52,375
in love with the pretty spy.

545
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,089
You bastard.

546
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,676
How dare you treat me like this?
I'm Nam Tae-il!

547
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,763
I'm Nam Tae-il,
the President's right-hand man!

548
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:10,560
Arrest him.

549
00:54:11,603 --> 00:54:14,105
How dare you touch my body, you bastards!
Let go of me!

550
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:15,690
Do you have a death wish?

551
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:26,701
Should I do it like you'd do it?

552
00:54:27,202 --> 00:54:30,705
How about I shoot you to death right here

553
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:34,959
and frame the Northern spy
Kang Cheong-ya for it?

554
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:39,631
Just like you did to Eun Chang-su.

555
00:54:47,472 --> 00:54:50,642
<i>I had no other choice
since it happened so fast.</i>

556
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:52,644
<i>I think she ran away.</i>

557
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:55,105
<i>I searched everywhere,
but I can't find her.</i>

558
00:54:57,065 --> 00:54:58,066
All right.

559
00:54:58,149 --> 00:55:01,903
You helped a Northern spy, so your father
won't be able to help you this time.

560
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:04,489
Go hide somewhere.

561
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,450
Be safe. Over and out.

562
00:55:25,093 --> 00:55:26,302
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:30,890
You must be hungry.

564
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:49,033
Eat this. Come on.

565
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:51,703
What are you doing? Put that away.

566
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:57,000
I'm not hungry at all.

567
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,752
So you have this.

568
00:56:00,712 --> 00:56:02,088
Come on.

569
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:08,470
My dear son…

570
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:11,473
My little puppy.

571
00:56:13,558 --> 00:56:15,560
Come on. Eat this.

572
00:56:16,394 --> 00:56:17,770
Open up.

573
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:21,566
Come on.

574
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:28,615
Come on. Open up.

575
00:56:35,747 --> 00:56:36,915
Mom.

576
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:43,880
Come on, you must be hungry. Eat it.

577
00:56:44,464 --> 00:56:46,090
Open up.

578
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:06,861
Comrade Lim.

579
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,085
Comrade Joo.

580
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,129
Comrade Kang

581
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:29,842
went out to intercept the money
they're going to send the North,

582
00:57:31,386 --> 00:57:33,012
and the ANSP found out about her.

583
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:35,974
Is that really true?

584
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:39,269
She's one of Lim Ji-rok's people.

585
00:57:40,186 --> 00:57:42,689
Even if I tell him about this,

586
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:46,317
he'll try to cover up her betrayal.

587
00:57:46,818 --> 00:57:49,612
I don't care what happens to traitors.

588
00:57:50,738 --> 00:57:54,325
Comrade Kang went out
to intercept the money to save us

589
00:57:55,034 --> 00:57:56,661
when our country abandoned us.

590
00:57:58,246 --> 00:57:59,539
With that money,

591
00:58:01,082 --> 00:58:03,167
we might be able
to cut a deal with Lim Ji-rok.

592
00:58:11,426 --> 00:58:13,094
Your superior…

593
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:17,473
must be rivals with Lim Ji-rok.

594
00:58:17,932 --> 00:58:20,268
We must inform your superior of this

595
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,437
to get Lim Ji-rok.

596
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,573
You've got some nerve.

597
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:38,578
You want to take down the head of the UFD
when you're surrounded by enemies?

598
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:45,293
Lim Ji-rok told me

599
00:58:47,253 --> 00:58:49,213
if we don't blow ourselves up by midnight…

600
00:58:51,466 --> 00:58:53,843
that he'd kill my sister.

601
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:57,347
I will never let him have his way.

602
00:59:04,395 --> 00:59:06,731
It must be great
to have a powerful father.

603
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:13,821
Are you sure you can kill him?

604
00:59:20,787 --> 00:59:21,871
Gyeok-chan.

605
00:59:25,249 --> 00:59:26,668
My father…

606
00:59:29,587 --> 00:59:32,382
was a coal miner
in North Hamgyong Province.

607
00:59:33,424 --> 00:59:35,426
And a mine roof collapse

608
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,471
killed him.

609
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:45,019
I've been fighting
for our country and people,

610
00:59:46,312 --> 00:59:50,900
not for those who consider
our agents' lives as expendable.

611
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:57,573
Lim Ji-rok has us cornered.
We must get him first

612
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:00,243
to find a way to survive.

613
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,585
I'm sure your superior will welcome…

614
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:14,424
any intel that can bring Lim down.

615
01:00:26,018 --> 01:00:27,061
Untie me.

616
01:01:00,178 --> 01:01:02,096
Moran Hill 1 intercepted the money

617
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,474
the South was going to send us.

618
01:01:04,557 --> 01:01:06,517
And the ANSP found out about her.

619
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,813
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: CHONGCHON RIVER

620
01:01:10,897 --> 01:01:13,900
"Kang Cheong-ya
would never betray the party"?

621
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:18,154
As if your son was not enough,
Kang's screwing us over too?

622
01:01:19,155 --> 01:01:21,574
If we won't be able to get the money,

623
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:23,034
it's all on you!

624
01:01:29,499 --> 01:01:32,877
Instruct Chongchon River
to kill Lim Soo-ho right away!

625
01:01:50,061 --> 01:01:51,938
That damn wench.

626
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:55,566
Shredding her body to pieces
wouldn't be enough.

627
01:01:57,276 --> 01:01:59,987
How dare she fool me all this time
and seduce my husband!

628
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:02,573
I'm sure

629
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:04,909
he had no idea.

630
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:07,537
How could he have known
he was a Northern spy?

631
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:09,539
Even I was completely fooled!

632
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:15,378
Whether he knew or not,
he violated the National Security Law.

633
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:18,631
No, that's wrong. That's just wrong!

634
01:02:18,714 --> 01:02:22,677
The one who lied is to blame.
Not the one who was fooled.

635
01:02:24,011 --> 01:02:25,388
That fortuneteller…

636
01:02:25,721 --> 01:02:28,266
He must be a charlatan!

637
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:30,560
He said I should

638
01:02:30,768 --> 01:02:34,981
have her stay by my husband's side
like a talisman!

639
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:37,275
For him to live a long, healthy life

640
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:39,861
and make his dreams come true!

641
01:02:43,447 --> 01:02:46,117
Why are you blaming the fortuneteller?

642
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,369
He's a really good fortuneteller.

643
01:02:52,915 --> 01:02:56,627
You know what? I knew something was off

644
01:02:56,711 --> 01:03:00,006
when he told Ms. Hong
exactly 13 people would die.

645
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:04,802
I mean, he's still unconscious in bed.
How is he going to become the President?

646
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:08,306
He must be a charlatan.

647
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:09,974
A charlatan!

648
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:15,229
<i>The number you have called
is not in service.</i>

649
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:18,274
<i>-Please check the number and try again.</i>
-Not in service?

650
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:24,697
Wait a second. Isn't it 041-387-1234?

651
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,450
You must've dialed the wrong number.
Give it.

652
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:28,784
My goodness.

653
01:03:34,957 --> 01:03:37,460
<i>The number you have called
is not in service.</i>

654
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:39,879
<i>-Please check the number…</i>
-What?

655
01:03:40,546 --> 01:03:42,715
This is weird. It can't be.

656
01:03:43,549 --> 01:03:45,051
What's going on?

657
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,311
Ms. Kim!

658
01:03:56,938 --> 01:03:57,772
Yes, ma'am?

659
01:03:57,855 --> 01:03:59,482
Call Hong Kong.

660
01:03:59,565 --> 01:04:02,902
Ask them for Linda's number
in New York. Now.

661
01:04:02,985 --> 01:04:03,861
Yes, ma'am.

662
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:07,531
Do it here! Right now!

663
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:10,076
Hold on.
What's with Hong Kong and New York?

664
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:11,619
Shut up!

665
01:04:15,164 --> 01:04:18,167
Hi. Can I get a hold of
Linda Young's New York contact?

666
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,252
She was recently in Seoul.

667
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:25,132
I am sure that her name is Linda Young.

668
01:04:26,884 --> 01:04:29,011
What do you mean,
she's never been to Seoul?

669
01:04:29,762 --> 01:04:32,515
Now, what are you talking about?
We've all met her.

670
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,185
Hello?

671
01:04:39,814 --> 01:04:42,900
What? Why did they hang up like that?

672
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:46,278
I even signed the certificate
for the fund. What is wrong?

673
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:49,156
Well, they said
Linda Young's never been to Seoul.

674
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,741
They even yelled at me.

675
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:53,786
What do you mean, she's never been here?

676
01:04:55,037 --> 01:04:57,832
She even gave me this 5-carat diamond.

677
01:04:57,915 --> 01:04:59,417
As a token of their appreciation

678
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,713
since I became a VVIP
at ABK Partners! But what?

679
01:05:05,756 --> 01:05:06,966
Oh, my God.

680
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:09,051
Five carats?

681
01:05:09,885 --> 01:05:11,053
Let me see.

682
01:05:11,137 --> 01:05:13,305
We can easily tell if it's real

683
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,641
by watching the condensation evaporate.

684
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:18,436
The condensation on a diamond
evaporates quickly.

685
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:35,411
It's fake.

686
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:38,664
It's just a cubic zirconia.

687
01:05:54,472 --> 01:05:56,307
My goodness.

688
01:05:57,266 --> 01:05:58,934
Sir!

689
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:00,686
Sir…

690
01:06:11,197 --> 01:06:12,031
What…

691
01:06:18,204 --> 01:06:21,916
What the hell is this? This can't be!

692
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:25,544
Where the hell did he go?

693
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:27,296
Where did he go?

694
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:30,633
Hong Ae-ra wants to meet me.

695
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:31,926
What should I do?

696
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:36,222
Hong Ae-ra? Maybe she's pulling tricks
to catch Cheong-ya.

697
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:38,224
The director's still unconscious,

698
01:06:38,307 --> 01:06:40,643
so I doubt she's interested
in catching Cheong-ya.

699
01:06:40,726 --> 01:06:42,394
I mean, she's not Nam Tae-il's wife.

700
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:43,813
But it might be dangerous.

701
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,606
You're wanted now.

702
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:51,278
If Lim Soo-ho doesn't blow himself up,
Nam will

703
01:06:51,862 --> 01:06:53,697
set off the bombs for sure.

704
01:06:54,073 --> 01:06:56,450
Time's running out,
so we must do everything we can.

705
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,244
All right.

706
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:30,609
Mr. Eun.

707
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:37,533
You're the one

708
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:43,122
who brought the recording tape
inside the dorm, aren't you?

709
01:07:45,624 --> 01:07:48,377
You did it to save the students,

710
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:52,673
so I won't punish you for it.

711
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,759
I…

712
01:07:57,469 --> 01:07:58,929
must…

713
01:08:04,101 --> 01:08:06,020
save my daughter.

714
01:08:09,106 --> 01:08:12,610
The North told Soo-ho
that they'll kill his sister

715
01:08:12,693 --> 01:08:15,571
if he doesn't blow himself
and the hostages up by midnight.

716
01:08:15,779 --> 01:08:18,866
So we must rescue the hostages
before midnight.

717
01:08:20,659 --> 01:08:22,912
I need to talk to Lim Soo-ho.

718
01:08:23,454 --> 01:08:24,496
<i>This is Taedong River.</i>

719
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:28,417
Moran Hill, do you copy?
This is Taedong River.

720
01:08:29,418 --> 01:08:31,754
She turned off her radio.
I'm sure she backed out!

721
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,758
<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

722
01:08:37,801 --> 01:08:38,802
Yes, I'm here.

723
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:46,769
Gang-mu.

724
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:49,438
<i>This is Eun Chang-su.</i>

725
01:08:57,947 --> 01:08:59,615
I heard you were in critical condition.

726
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:02,493
Was it fake news again?

727
01:09:06,413 --> 01:09:08,332
Is Lim Soo-ho with you?

728
01:09:18,884 --> 01:09:20,386
<i>What do you want?</i>

729
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,431
I want to help you.

730
01:09:26,267 --> 01:09:30,521
<i>If you release all the hostages
including my daughter,</i>

731
01:09:31,897 --> 01:09:34,275
I'll have a car ready

732
01:09:34,858 --> 01:09:36,735
in Mount Ogong

733
01:09:37,486 --> 01:09:39,571
for you guys to escape.

734
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:43,200
<i>I'll do everything in my power</i>

735
01:09:43,993 --> 01:09:45,953
<i>for you to flee</i>

736
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:48,539
<i>to another country safely.</i>

737
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:52,334
<i>After everyone gets out,</i>

738
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:55,045
I'll blow the dorm up

739
01:09:55,129 --> 01:09:57,715
and tell the press

740
01:09:58,632 --> 01:10:00,718
<i>the spies have blown themselves up.</i>

741
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,637
<i>And I'll inform the North</i>

742
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:06,181
that you're dead.

743
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:09,601
Then your sister

744
01:10:11,103 --> 01:10:13,230
<i>will be safe.</i>

745
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:16,817
The students know

746
01:10:17,693 --> 01:10:20,696
about the election scheme,
but you want us to release them?

747
01:10:21,363 --> 01:10:24,033
Can you guarantee the students' safety?

748
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:27,536
I'll have it broadcast live

749
01:10:28,412 --> 01:10:31,415
and let them return to their parents
in the campus.

750
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,376
Won't it be enough?

751
01:10:35,085 --> 01:10:37,046
<i>And I'll release Reporter Gal</i>

752
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:40,215
<i>and have him cover it.</i>

753
01:10:41,008 --> 01:10:42,051
How about

754
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,348
you tell the press yourself that
this is all part of the election scheme?

755
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:53,020
<i>That won't save
Soo-ho's sister in the North.</i>

756
01:10:53,687 --> 01:10:56,106
<i>I must stay in power</i>

757
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:58,692
to send you guys

758
01:10:59,276 --> 01:11:01,904
<i>to another country safely.</i>

759
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:21,924
I'll think about it.

760
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:33,435
The students know about the election
scheme. If they're released,

761
01:11:33,519 --> 01:11:36,980
the ruling party might lose the election,

762
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:39,775
and you're likely to be put in danger.

763
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,946
I know it's great to have power,

764
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:49,451
but I'll never
trade my child's life for it.

765
01:11:55,457 --> 01:11:57,459
No one,

766
01:11:57,543 --> 01:12:00,129
including Nam and An, can find out

767
01:12:00,212 --> 01:12:02,256
that he has awoken.

768
01:12:05,008 --> 01:12:07,177
I understand. Don't worry.

769
01:12:21,066 --> 01:12:24,153
He must know Nam Tae-il's the one
who ordered to shoot him.

770
01:12:25,571 --> 01:12:29,450
But he's giving up power
so easily like this?

771
01:12:30,993 --> 01:12:31,994
You're right.

772
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:35,873
The ruling party's winning right now.
He can't be giving up.

773
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:41,628
If it's broadcast live
and the parents wait for him,

774
01:12:43,464 --> 01:12:45,299
the students will be safe.

775
01:12:47,092 --> 01:12:50,387
But you were ordered
to kill the hostages too.

776
01:12:51,555 --> 01:12:55,601
If it's broadcast live, the North will
watch it too. Will it be okay?

777
01:12:57,895 --> 01:13:00,564
I'm sure the North's aware
Comrade Kang's cover's been blown,

778
01:13:01,064 --> 01:13:02,608
so I don't think it'll matter.

779
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:06,195
I still have a bad feeling about this.
They might be

780
01:13:07,362 --> 01:13:09,406
setting a trap to save Yeong-ro only.

781
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:17,748
If my dad is planning to rescue only me,

782
01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:20,876
there's a way to stop it.

783
01:13:24,588 --> 01:13:26,924
Let me talk to my dad.

784
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:35,307
What did you say?

785
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:38,894
<i>After all the hostages have been released,</i>

786
01:13:41,647 --> 01:13:44,441
I'll get in the car with Soo-ho.

787
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:48,612
Until he's left the country safely,

788
01:13:49,696 --> 01:13:52,241
<i>I will stay by his side.</i>

789
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,953
You can't trust me

790
01:13:57,037 --> 01:13:58,580
that much?

791
01:13:59,957 --> 01:14:01,250
<i>I will</i>

792
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:03,919
do everything in my power

793
01:14:05,629 --> 01:14:07,965
to save Soo-ho's life.

794
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:14,763
I'm sorry, Dad. But I need to see
Soo-ho leaving the country safely

795
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:17,516
with my own eyes.

796
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:29,069
I understand.

797
01:14:31,154 --> 01:14:32,948
Get in the car with him.

798
01:14:33,699 --> 01:14:37,327
<i>I'll let you see him leaving safely</i>

799
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:39,705
with your own eyes.

800
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:55,804
She wants to stay with him
until he leaves.

801
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:00,642
So you follow them and bring my daughter

802
01:15:01,643 --> 01:15:03,604
back to me safely.

803
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:06,064
I will, sir.

804
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:08,150
Go to the dorm

805
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:10,902
right now.

806
01:15:11,903 --> 01:15:14,364
I'll radio you as soon as it's ready.

807
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:16,533
So go stand by.

808
01:15:16,617 --> 01:15:18,201
Yes, sir.

809
01:15:33,925 --> 01:15:34,843
What a fool she is.

810
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:40,849
Why on earth is she taking the side
of those commies who killed her brother?

811
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:47,939
Honey.

812
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:52,277
You're at the most important crossroads
of your life right now.

813
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:56,615
If Yeong-ro's acting like this,
we won't be able to get her out.

814
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,619
And if you try to fool them
and anything goes wrong because of her,

815
01:16:00,994 --> 01:16:02,412
your life will be ruined

816
01:16:02,996 --> 01:16:05,123
as well as Yeong-ung's.

817
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:08,752
You think it'll be okay

818
01:16:09,294 --> 01:16:12,089
if you work with their parents
to keep their mouths shut?

819
01:16:13,006 --> 01:16:14,174
Of course,

820
01:16:14,383 --> 01:16:17,678
some sensible parents
will keep their children quiet,

821
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,638
but who knows?

822
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:23,183
There are always troublemakers
like Reporter Gal.

823
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:28,313
To be honest, I'm worried about Gal too.

824
01:16:28,397 --> 01:16:31,817
You must think
you can keep him under control

825
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,819
by threatening to kill his mother.

826
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:36,279
But who knows what'll get into him?

827
01:16:36,363 --> 01:16:40,367
What if he chooses justice
over his own mom?

828
01:16:45,872 --> 01:16:46,998
So,

829
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,335
stop thinking about it,

830
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,172
have the hostages released…

831
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:57,759
and when exactly 13 remain,

832
01:16:59,052 --> 01:17:01,555
blow up the bombs.

833
01:17:05,183 --> 01:17:06,393
Ae-ra…

834
01:17:21,992 --> 01:17:23,160
Hello?

835
01:17:24,703 --> 01:17:25,829
Mr. Kim.

836
01:17:26,997 --> 01:17:28,874
Okay. Just a second.

837
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:34,379
The President wants to talk to you.

838
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:37,382
I told the First Lady that you'd woken up.

839
01:17:40,343 --> 01:17:41,970
Hello, sir.

840
01:17:43,889 --> 01:17:45,432
Mr. President, this is Eun Chang-su.

841
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:49,728
<i>Eun, is it true that
your daughter's held in the dorm?</i>

842
01:17:51,688 --> 01:17:53,190
A long time ago,

843
01:17:53,774 --> 01:17:56,067
General Gyebaek
even killed his wife and children

844
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:58,361
before he went out to war.

845
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:02,365
Remember that we are also at war.

846
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:23,261
We're all going to get out alive, right?

847
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:32,270
I'm relieved that my dad will be able

848
01:18:32,562 --> 01:18:35,732
to make up even a little
for what he did to my friends.

849
01:18:46,201 --> 01:18:47,619
I thought about it,

850
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:56,795
and it's too dangerous
for you to stay with me until the end.

851
01:19:11,935 --> 01:19:16,147
Soo-ho, I'll stay by your side
until the end.

852
01:19:29,244 --> 01:19:31,913
Blow the dorm up right away.

853
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:48,054
<i>The election is in six days.</i>

854
01:19:48,138 --> 01:19:49,723
<i>If we all stay here like this,</i>

855
01:19:49,806 --> 01:19:51,433
we'll all die.

856
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:54,019
<i>"Eliminate Lim Soo-ho."</i>

857
01:19:54,102 --> 01:19:56,980
<i>If you run with the money,
do you think the party will let you be?</i>

858
01:19:57,147 --> 01:19:59,900
<i>They will hunt down every traitor</i>

859
01:19:59,983 --> 01:20:02,277
<i>and kill them mercilessly.</i>

860
01:20:03,028 --> 01:20:04,154
<i>Captain.</i>

861
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:05,989
At 22:00 sharp,

862
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:09,993
we will blow up the dorm. Get it ready.

863
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:11,453
<i>How dare you…</i>

864
01:20:12,913 --> 01:20:13,997
<i>Decide.</i>

865
01:20:15,165 --> 01:20:16,249
<i>Is it our agents</i>

866
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:18,293
<i>or the hostages?</i>

867
01:20:18,877 --> 01:20:20,128
<i>Soo-ho…</i>

868
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:22,756
<i>You said we'll meet again.</i>

869
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:26,217
<i>You said we'll meet again someday</i>

870
01:20:26,801 --> 01:20:29,095
<i>as long as we're alive.</i>

871
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:30,722
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

872
01:20:31,973 --> 01:20:35,936
<i>You know too that we're never
going to see each other again.</i>

873
01:20:36,436 --> 01:20:37,896
Soo-ho!

874
01:20:44,694 --> 01:20:47,614
BONUS

875
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:26,820
Thank you.

876
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,912
Is this your first time in Poland?

877
01:21:37,288 --> 01:21:39,624
I'm a trader working in Berlin

878
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,127
and came to visit here
to check on something.

879
01:21:42,752 --> 01:21:44,045
Then…

880
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:47,966
I was chased by some gangsters.

881
01:21:51,302 --> 01:21:53,221
If you don't mind me asking,

882
01:21:54,264 --> 01:21:56,808
may I know your name?

883
01:22:00,562 --> 01:22:03,106
You saved my life after all.

884
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:07,736
But I have so many names

885
01:22:08,528 --> 01:22:11,990
since I've been traveling
around the world to sell goods.

886
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:16,911
Oh, I see.

887
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:33,887
I wish you good luck.

888
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,986
