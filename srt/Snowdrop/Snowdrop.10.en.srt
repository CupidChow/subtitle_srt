1
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,666
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:07,956
EPISODE 10

3
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,466
Everyone stop.

4
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:12,966
Comrade Kang.

5
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:22,146
Don't move.

6
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:25,606
If anyone moves…

7
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,566
What is this?

8
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,196
You want us all to die together?

9
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,786
Damn it.

10
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:46,836
What the hell.

11
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,056
<i>A situation occurred. Sector 2 reporting.</i>

12
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:00,016
An explosion at Area 2-5.

13
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:03,136
Sector 3 reporting.
An explosion at Area 2-3 too.

14
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:04,186
Damn it!

15
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,436
How are the hostages?

16
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,516
Snipers, report.

17
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:08,726
Suppression team, stand by.

18
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:10,566
-Suppression team, stand by!
-Are you insane?

19
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:13,406
All units stand by
until we find out what's going on!

20
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,256
Drop the gun.

21
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,436
Drop the gun.

22
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:06,207
Everyone, hands over your heads.

23
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:09,377
Hands over your heads!

24
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:56,587
What, the whole dorm would explode?

25
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:00,427
I was a fool to believe you.

26
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:06,427
Everyone get up.

27
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:08,307
Get up!

28
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:23,407
Now.

29
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,407
Go to the lobby.

30
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,577
Go to the lobby!

31
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,367
Sit.

32
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:30,227
It was you, wasn't it?
Where did you hide the money bag?

33
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:31,807
Is that important right now?

34
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:33,767
Can't you see they failed to escape?

35
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,107
You little…

36
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:37,067
I don't know where it is either.

37
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,147
I know you hid it.

38
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:41,147
Do you have a death wish?

39
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:43,157
Why don't we go get the bag now?

40
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:45,657
Keep your heads down.

41
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:50,247
Damn it!

42
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:57,337
I'll go check the second floor.

43
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:08,467
You little bastard.

44
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:22,857
Follow me.

45
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:27,407
Isn't that Sang-beom?

46
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:30,947
Sang-beom, what's going on?

47
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:33,287
Are you okay?

48
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:37,917
What did you do this time?

49
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,337
Where's Eung-cheol?

50
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:47,297
Once everything's settled,
block the secret passage first.

51
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:48,217
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,057
You fool.

53
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:06,857
We released 30 hostages,
yet you tried to escape?

54
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:10,077
Who put you up to it?

55
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:13,287
The ANSP?

56
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,127
Or the hall director?

57
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:21,417
Yes.

58
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,467
It was me.

59
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,297
The students just did as I said.

60
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,557
Is that so? You.

61
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:33,677
Were you hiding as she told you?

62
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:43,897
No.

63
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:48,107
That's not true.
I suggested escaping first.

64
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:49,697
Be quiet, Yeong-ro.

65
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:51,697
My brother's being buried today.

66
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,447
I wanted to go there.

67
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,117
I really wanted to be there,

68
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:56,827
so I asked her.

69
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,997
It was you again.

70
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,457
Because of you…

71
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,877
<i>my cover's been blown.</i>

72
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:11,637
Are you really a Northern spy?

73
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:15,557
Trying to help us and caring for us…

74
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:17,767
Were you putting on an act?

75
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:10,777
Eung-cheol!

76
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:13,447
Eung-cheol.

77
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:21,037
Eung-cheol!

78
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,497
Hey!

79
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,167
Eung-cheol!

80
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:29,507
Wake up, Eung-cheol!

81
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,257
Eung-cheol!

82
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:44,687
Eung-cheol! Wake up!

83
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,187
Comrade!

84
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:50,857
I can't hear you! Please speak louder!

85
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:55,907
Eung-cheol. Can you get up?

86
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:58,327
Hold me!

87
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,037
Let's go.

88
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,507
Comrade.

89
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:14,297
Our bag we hid in the lounge disappeared.

90
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:16,967
Move Eung-cheol first. Hurry!

91
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:33,737
Eung-cheol.

92
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,067
Eung-cheol!

93
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:36,817
Eung-cheol.

94
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,747
Comrade. Where are the hostages?

95
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,457
Did they escape?

96
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,167
No.

97
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:45,787
Everything's okay.

98
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,047
Don't worry.

99
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:54,627
Hang in there!

100
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:49,227
Sector 2-3 reporting.
We see Lim Soo-ho moving by the windows.

101
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,267
Sniping him is possible. Over.

102
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:53,897
<i>Hold fire.
Hold fire unless ordered otherwise.</i>

103
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,737
<i>Keep an eye on Lim Soo-ho
and keep me posted. Over.</i>

104
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,657
Move the phone to room 207

105
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:02,577
and set booby traps in front of
the cafeteria and between 204 and 211.

106
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:05,747
We must find our bag to set any bombs.

107
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:07,917
You know the guy who was after our money.

108
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,717
Why do they keep telling us
just to watch him?

109
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:22,257
How would I know?

110
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,557
Just do as told.

111
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:17,067
<i>They have no intention of breaking in
despite the explosion.</i>

112
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:21,657
Send in every unit available
and suppress them right away.

113
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:26,117
<i>The bombs exploded in the cafeteria
where the hostages were kept</i>

114
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:28,997
<i>and in room 203
where the ANSP agent was kept.</i>

115
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:31,787
If anyone is injured,
we must get them out first.

116
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:36,247
The bomb exploded in the cafeteria
where the students were kept!

117
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:39,127
There's no way
they would've killed the hostages.

118
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:42,297
Think about it. They obey
the orders even if they have to die.

119
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,007
<i>You think they'd kill them?</i>

120
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:46,807
Someone must have touched
the booby traps by mistake.

121
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,977
Listen, you bastard.
My son's being buried today.

122
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:52,517
Are you going
to get my daughter killed too?

123
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:54,267
Honey.

124
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:56,517
The burial isn't important right now.

125
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,277
What if something happens to Yeong-ro?

126
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:00,437
You should go to the scene yourself. Now.

127
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:01,607
Hurry.

128
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:02,817
Hello?

129
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:10,367
FUNERAL OF STAFF SERGEANT EUN YEONG-U

130
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:14,167
Only 13 must die.

131
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:15,837
Exactly 13.

132
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:19,047
No more, no less. Exactly 13.

133
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,587
Exactly 13. Please.

134
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:24,757
Sir. Please.

135
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,137
Sang-beom.

136
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,847
I'm telling the truth.

137
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:31,847
I'd open up my heart
and show you if I could.

138
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:35,187
I did find the money bag.

139
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:37,477
But I don't know where it is now.

140
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,227
Gye Bun-ok!

141
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,107
That wench hid it away!

142
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:43,817
That damn wench!

143
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:46,907
Bun-ok, please!

144
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,987
Just tell them.

145
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:51,407
You don't want to die, do you?

146
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:54,077
The habit of stealing from the students

147
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,377
must've made you steal their money too!

148
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,087
Did you see it?

149
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:00,957
I didn't do it.

150
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:03,167
You didn't?

151
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,217
Bun-ok.

152
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:13,347
Please.

153
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,067
-Sang-beom!
-I'll ask you one last time.

154
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,777
Answer on the count of three.

155
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,367
Please.

156
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:31,787
Or he dies.

157
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:38,707
-One.
-Bun-ok, please!

158
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:42,587
You fool. Will you come clean
after someone dies because of you?

159
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:46,177
Bun-ok… Please, Bun-ok.

160
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,137
Bun-ok…

161
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:53,467
Two.

162
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:55,137
No. Please!

163
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,647
Please…

164
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,567
It's in the restroom!

165
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:08,527
Where the cleaning supplies are.

166
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:18,537
I saw it.

167
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,127
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

168
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:27,587
He was hiding the bag

169
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,297
in the restroom, and I saw it.

170
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,387
You b****.

171
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:40,267
I'll rip your mouth--

172
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:46,607
You saw him threatening and telling me
not to tell anyone, right?

173
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:47,857
Comrade Joo!

174
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:54,117
Set the booby traps first. Hurry up.

175
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,577
Eung-cheol's hurt.

176
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,037
I laid him down in room 212.

177
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,267
I told you…

178
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:23,397
I clearly told you
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

179
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,777
Now you will

180
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:33,067
never be released.

181
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:36,907
Dead or alive,

182
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:42,327
we're in the same boat now.

183
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:01,887
<i>No casualties have yet to be confirmed.</i>

184
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:04,977
<i>People are deeply concerned
that the late initial response might</i>

185
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:06,727
<i>lead to injured hostages, if any,</i>

186
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:08,937
<i>-missing the golden hour…</i>
-My goodness.

187
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:11,277
What if the hostages all died?

188
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,947
Bombs exploded. I don't think

189
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:16,407
only 13 people died.

190
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,447
But exactly 13 girls might have died

191
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,157
just like the fortuneteller said.

192
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,167
Come on, ma'am.

193
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:27,417
When did the fortuneteller say
13 girls would die?

194
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,007
He said 13 should die.

195
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,127
You think I don't know that?

196
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,587
I'm so worried

197
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:37,547
because I have a feeling
that exactly 13 girls died.

198
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:38,807
Exactly 13.

199
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:40,267
Darn it.

200
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,847
<i>Chief An just came out.
Let's hear from him!</i>

201
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:50,317
<i>We can't rule out additional explosions.</i>

202
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,027
<i>So we're approaching very carefully…</i>

203
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:53,737
Is that your husband?

204
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:55,763
It looks perfect.

205
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:58,697
Your husband must be a natural on TV.

206
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:03,247
I mean, he had so little presence,

207
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,667
he was practically invisible.

208
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:08,037
But when he's in front of the cameras,

209
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,087
he becomes a different person.

210
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:11,957
My husband

211
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:13,837
mentioned that too.

212
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:20,387
Mr. An's really popular these days.

213
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:23,727
Even his fashion style is popular now.

214
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:27,857
Thanks to that, Ms. Choi has been
getting a lot of interview requests.

215
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,897
I'm not surprised.

216
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,897
Charlotte styles him after all.

217
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:40,657
I heard the sunglasses he wears sell well
even though it's winter. Right?

218
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:44,457
Those sunglasses?

219
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:47,617
The hostages' lives are put…

220
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:48,957
They're popular?

221
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:50,877
Try them on.

222
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,887
<i>Rescuing the hostages safely is</i>

223
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,467
<i>our top priority.</i>

224
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:03,137
<i>The President has already
instructed us to do everything</i>

225
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:05,477
<i>in our power</i>

226
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:09,307
<i>to rescue all of them safely…</i>

227
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,437
I'm sure I've seen that bastard somewhere.

228
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:18,567
In any case,

229
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,867
I owe you big time.

230
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:24,577
Don't mention it.

231
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,657
The ANSP exists

232
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:28,957
to protect sovereignty.

233
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:31,747
Sure.

234
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:37,047
Then it's also your job to protect me
to make my dad feel at ease, right?

235
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,757
You are right, sir.

236
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:46,347
That's the single
most important job for me,

237
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:48,187
An Gyeong-hui.

238
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:50,307
Right.

239
00:20:53,437 --> 00:20:54,567
It's him!

240
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:58,357
He was quite clumsy back then.

241
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:00,607
Hey, give me the phone.

242
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:09,077
<i>You bastard. Are you an idiot?</i>

243
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:10,957
Did you forget about the plan?

244
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:14,377
I told you it must look like
you guys are making this drag on!

245
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:17,837
But what do you do?
You go ahead and blow up bombs?

246
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,837
Maybe I should've let them go.

247
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:23,967
The ANSP team leader was
about to escape with all of the hostages.

248
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:27,267
God, Lee Gang-mu, that bastard.

249
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:28,347
-Salute!
-Salute!

250
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:33,107
You're meddling here again?

251
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:35,567
-Again? Huh?
-Get the suppression team ready.

252
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,317
All units stand by!

253
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:43,407
Lee Gang-mu, one of your men, was
about to escape with all of the hostages,

254
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:45,907
so they had no choice
but to blow up the bombs.

255
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:48,747
This is Eun Chang-su.

256
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:52,077
Once the suppression team goes in,
you'll all die in five minutes.

257
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:56,297
So tell me the truth.
Is Yeong-ro safe? And any casualties?

258
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,167
Calm down. I know this is a scheme.

259
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:05,047
All of the hostages
including your daughter are all safe.

260
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:09,307
Listen carefully. Seeing how
you unexpectedly blew up some bombs,

261
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:11,517
I can't let my daughter stay there.
Release her now.

262
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:13,807
What?

263
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:15,807
Are you insane?

264
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:18,977
Are you going to show
rescuing your daughter only

265
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,987
when all of the press cameras are here?

266
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,897
You were against it earlier!

267
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:27,157
Our agreement doesn't say
my daughter must be held hostage!

268
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:35,707
What about you?
You said we'd just rescue my daughter

269
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,297
if things got dangerous.
Why are you so worked up?

270
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:41,127
But we need some kind of insurance.

271
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:45,467
In case the word gets out.

272
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:51,727
If they find out your daughter is
also being held hostage,

273
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:54,267
who'll suspect it might be a scheme?

274
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,357
You son of a--

275
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:10,037
I, the ANSP director,
guarantee your safe return.

276
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,407
So release my daughter right now.

277
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:17,577
To return safely,
we need your daughter here.

278
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,877
Release her right this instant!

279
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:23,087
Be patient. I will in eight days.

280
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,627
You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?

281
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:29,547
I can prove that your daughter is safe.

282
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:33,017
All right. In exactly five minutes,

283
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:35,227
bring her to the cafeteria.

284
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,857
She'll stand by the windows in the lounge.

285
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:44,777
The press is watching us. They'll
see me only checking my daughter's safety.

286
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,777
Bring her to the cafeteria!

287
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:48,617
Or I'll send in the suppression team!

288
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:54,157
Get the snipers ready. Tell them to
kill him as soon as he brings my daughter!

289
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:55,997
Sniper team, this is Captain.

290
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:58,287
What are you doing?
Are you going to break in?

291
00:23:58,377 --> 00:24:01,957
They even blew up bombs. We should act.
If we hesitate,

292
00:24:02,047 --> 00:24:06,087
people will find it suspicious.
They might find out it's a scheme!

293
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,467
That's just what you think.

294
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,967
I already told our boss
this will drag on until the election.

295
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:12,927
Order them!

296
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:17,767
Kill Taedong River 1
as soon as he brings the hostage.

297
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:23,857
<i>Without my permission?</i>

298
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:28,527
You'll show Yeong-ro to them
without my permission?

299
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:33,617
Because of the explosion,
Eun's taking an offensive approach.

300
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:34,997
We should calm him down--

301
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:38,037
The bombs exploded
because Gang-mu tried to escape!

302
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:39,577
And even my cover--

303
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:49,217
Eun should be begging us for forgiveness,
so why do what he demands?

304
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:52,467
Comrade Kang.

305
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:55,677
We may be in the South

306
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:57,677
and occupying this place,

307
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:01,517
but we're in a third zone where
we must respect both countries' agreement.

308
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:05,687
In here, the ANSP director
isn't the leader of our enemies.

309
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:11,617
He's a friend who will send us back safely
by fooling the people in the South.

310
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:15,537
We can't trust him completely, of course.

311
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:16,577
So

312
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,577
we can't release Yeong-ro.

313
00:25:19,657 --> 00:25:22,497
That's why we need to let him see
that his daughter is safe.

314
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:29,337
Are you sure
you can handle the consequences?

315
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:35,347
Yeong-ro's such a daring girl.
You think she won't try something?

316
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,517
The election is in eight days.

317
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:45,397
Calming Eun Chang-su and buying time
takes priority for now.

318
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:54,117
All right. Do as you wish, then.

319
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:07,417
<i>How dare you lock me in the basement?</i>

320
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,417
You want to die?

321
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:15,047
Do you want to die?

322
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:34,607
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, sir!

323
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:40,657
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:45,037
I didn't do it because I wanted to.

325
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:51,877
He told me to do it,
so I had no other choice.

326
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:56,637
In the South,
you must do as the ANSP says,

327
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:58,097
or you die.

328
00:26:58,177 --> 00:26:59,927
Please don't kill us.

329
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:02,427
We had no idea.

330
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:07,357
You know why I'm beating you.

331
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:11,067
How dare you lock me in there?

332
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:20,197
Let go.

333
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:22,077
Let go!

334
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:24,787
Stop it!

335
00:27:50,977 --> 00:27:51,977
Stop?

336
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:03,237
So someone got your back?

337
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:07,617
You think I'll go easy on you
like comrade Lim?

338
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:12,417
Eun Yeong-ro.

339
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,167
Follow me.

340
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:22,967
Get on my nerves again, and I'll kill you.

341
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:25,977
Eun Yeong-ro.

342
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:51,417
If Yeong-ro tries to tell them who I am,
you can shoot her.

343
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:53,287
But don't kill her.

344
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,967
Your father wants to see if you're safe.

345
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:03,637
My dad?

346
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:09,687
Let me talk to him over the phone.

347
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:15,687
Let me talk to him.

348
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,887
Do as I say.

349
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,517
If you say anything stupid,

350
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:38,687
you'll die.

351
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:58,247
-Give me the field glasses.
-Here, sir.

352
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:58,057
Yeong-ro.

353
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:03,692
Yeong-ro!

354
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:07,782
Dad.

355
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:17,922
That's enough.

356
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:19,832
Dad…

357
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:22,302
Dad!

358
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:23,342
Yeong-ro!

359
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:24,962
Yeong-ro!

360
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:28,972
I'm okay!

361
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:30,932
Okay, Yeong-ro!

362
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,562
My brother…

363
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:40,482
Send Yeong-u off well!

364
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:43,272
Yeong-ro!

365
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:45,652
Come here now.

366
00:32:57,712 --> 00:32:58,832
Do you want to die?

367
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:02,712
Come here now.

368
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:11,892
Save us!

369
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:13,932
I can't trust anyone!

370
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:19,642
Hold fire!

371
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:32,032
Hey! Hold fire!

372
00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:33,162
Hold fire!

373
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:34,492
Stop shooting!

374
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:46,882
Don't shoot!

375
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:48,842
Yeong-ro!

376
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:23,832
She said she couldn't trust anyone

377
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:25,842
and was about to say who you were.

378
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:29,262
We're okay.

379
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,772
I told you to do as I said!

380
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:06,962
Comrade Lim, move aside.

381
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:53,802
Comrade Joo.

382
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:56,182
Lock this brat in the basement.

383
00:35:56,592 --> 00:35:58,472
Don't even give her water.

384
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:26,462
Go calm Eun Chang-su down first.

385
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:29,632
Okay.

386
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:44,522
<i>The spies fired first, so we fired back.
No casualties confirmed.</i>

387
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:48,562
Why did he even go there? That soft idiot.

388
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:51,402
You couldn't kill anyone, right?

389
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:54,732
Anyway, it was an attempt at suppression.
Let's leave it at that.

390
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,612
How dare you fire a gun? How dare you!

391
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:00,282
Release my daughter right now!

392
00:37:00,872 --> 00:37:03,782
We can't release her
until our mission's over.

393
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:06,662
I'm warning you.

394
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,922
If you're planning to break in,

395
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:13,382
you should be prepared for her death.

396
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:15,002
You lunatic!

397
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:19,052
If you even lay a finger on my daughter…

398
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:23,802
If this is how you're playing it,
I have no choice but to talk to your boss.

399
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:35,822
Talking to their boss or not,
just leave this to me.

400
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:37,942
Just go see your son off.

401
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:42,992
I mean, you need to go cry
while burying your son

402
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:45,582
for us to get more sympathy votes.

403
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,122
Right?

404
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:50,502
Right!

405
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:52,292
God damn it!

406
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:55,292
-You bastard!
-What?

407
00:37:56,842 --> 00:38:00,592
My son died and my daughter's being
held hostage because of this operation!

408
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:06,062
If this ends up failing,
I'll kill you first!

409
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:11,732
Stop thinking about the sympathy vote
and take care of that clamor first!

410
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:15,272
What if this hostage situation
ends up doing us harm?

411
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:20,612
We must win it by a landslide!

412
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:22,242
Am I wrong?

413
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:24,662
You're right.

414
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:26,082
Understand?

415
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:27,872
Yes.

416
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:47,892
<i>Hye-ryeong! Your mom's here!</i>

417
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:51,102
<i>Let me go see if she's okay!</i>

418
00:38:52,352 --> 00:38:53,392
RESTRICTED

419
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:56,902
RESTRICTED, SECURITY CHECKPOINT

420
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:03,282
Why is this happening to us? Seol-hui!

421
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:05,112
Seol-hui!

422
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,532
Seol-hui!

423
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:09,872
-Seol-hui! Dad's here!
-If something happened to my daughter,

424
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:11,412
what will you do?

425
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:13,872
-This is crazy!
-What are you doing?

426
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:15,922
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

427
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:17,342
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

428
00:39:20,302 --> 00:39:21,132
Seol-hui!

429
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:24,972
I'm in front of Hosu University where
explosions and a gunfight took place.

430
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:29,102
As you can see, the parents' cries
and rage are filling the place.

431
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:32,142
The hostages' families are
desperate to know if they're safe,

432
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:36,272
<i>the ANSP keeps
telling them to trust them and wait.</i>

433
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:40,862
<i>There is a public uproar
against the government's lousy response</i>

434
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:42,942
<i>because it might cause more casualties.</i>

435
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:44,612
Lousy?

436
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,952
How dare he?
Hey, who's that bastard's boss?

437
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,452
I'll go wring his neck.

438
00:39:50,032 --> 00:39:51,832
Leave that to me, sir.

439
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:54,212
I think you should
calm the parents down first.

440
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,712
<i>…more prompt response</i>

441
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:58,422
<i>-is needed at the moment…</i>
-God, it's a pain in the neck.

442
00:39:58,502 --> 00:39:59,592
Turn that off.

443
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:12,352
Hey, are you sure all 34 are safe?

444
00:40:15,692 --> 00:40:17,312
I can prove it if you want.

445
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:21,862
<i>I'll send in a camcorder,
so film every one of them.</i>

446
00:40:21,942 --> 00:40:23,732
Don't leave out Dr. Kang. Okay?

447
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,532
Have Han-na bring it.

448
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,992
Hello? Have whom? Hey!

449
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:38,502
I can't even laugh it off anymore.
My goodness.

450
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,962
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

451
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:44,052
Roll up your sleeve.

452
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:51,602
You're bleeding!

453
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:12,622
You still don't take care of your body.

454
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:23,252
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

455
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:26,962
He threatened me
saying they can kill us all

456
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:33,512
and that they have an astronomical amount
of money the North can never refuse.

457
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:35,352
That Nam Tae-il.

458
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:38,982
So?

459
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:42,942
Threatening to kill Gang-mu,

460
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:47,492
I had Han-na obtain proof
of their true intentions.

461
00:41:47,652 --> 00:41:50,322
But the party guaranteed our safe return.

462
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:52,412
Do you doubt our party?

463
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:58,042
Stop using my loyalty to the party

464
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:02,082
to put down my reasonable doubt.

465
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:05,542
What?

466
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:11,842
I had to risk my life
trying to abduct Professor Han.

467
00:42:12,682 --> 00:42:15,812
I never imagined it was
for the ruling party of the South

468
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:18,682
to regain power.

469
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:26,362
Comrade Park Geum-cheol took
his own life by taking cyanide.

470
00:42:28,152 --> 00:42:30,742
And our agents died
during the engagement in the West Sea.

471
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:33,612
I'm sure they never imagined

472
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:35,992
they died for the South administration

473
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:38,872
to regain power.

474
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:45,172
The party will secure
a huge amount of money.

475
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:48,462
With that money, Geum-cheol and the others

476
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,592
-will become heroes--
-If they do

477
00:42:52,722 --> 00:42:54,222
become heroes of our republic,

478
00:42:55,932 --> 00:42:58,762
I'm sure their families will live well.

479
00:43:03,272 --> 00:43:05,272
But what parent can live happily

480
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:07,982
with money they got
for their children's deaths?

481
00:43:16,532 --> 00:43:18,622
I must go back alive.

482
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:24,332
And Eung-cheol must go back alive
to live happily with his mother.

483
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:28,632
That's all the more reason
why I need to know…

484
00:43:30,712 --> 00:43:33,262
what kind of deal
the North and the South made,

485
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:38,802
and if that huge amount of money
includes the price of our lives.

486
00:43:40,102 --> 00:43:41,972
I must find out.

487
00:43:51,032 --> 00:43:52,072
Comrade.

488
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:58,742
Do you know who helped me get in here?

489
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:06,172
The President's favorite guy,
the ruling party's secretary-general,

490
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:07,252
Nam Tae-il.

491
00:44:10,132 --> 00:44:12,172
He's a future presidential candidate.

492
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:17,722
To become his doctor…

493
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:19,552
No.

494
00:44:20,932 --> 00:44:23,682
To have him wrapped around my finger,

495
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:28,482
it took me as many as 17 years.

496
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:36,572
And yet,

497
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:40,122
the party ordered me to risk my life

498
00:44:40,202 --> 00:44:43,832
to come in here and send you,
Taedong River 1, back to the North safely.

499
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:48,042
Now tell me.

500
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:50,672
Will the party abandon you guys?

501
00:44:56,922 --> 00:45:00,052
I will not condone any more doubt.

502
00:45:03,682 --> 00:45:06,392
Those who led the escape,
take them to the hall director's office.

503
00:45:07,482 --> 00:45:08,442
Now.

504
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:35,502
You ANSP agent,
how did you find out about me?

505
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:38,592
You just came out of that room.

506
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:41,262
You still don't know?

507
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:44,852
Through wiretapping?

508
00:45:45,932 --> 00:45:47,772
A hall director of a women's dorm

509
00:45:48,352 --> 00:45:51,812
put a bug on her students
and reported to the ANSP?

510
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:57,992
How did our lofty hall director
end up spying for the ANSP?

511
00:46:00,572 --> 00:46:03,322
The doctor the ANSP sent in
turned out to be a Northern spy.

512
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:06,582
I can't hold a candle to you.

513
00:46:12,122 --> 00:46:15,502
We were really going
to let you all go in eight days.

514
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:24,642
Now that my cover's blown,

515
00:46:25,142 --> 00:46:27,722
I wonder what instructions
the party will give me.

516
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:32,192
What kind of order regarding security,
Mr. ANSP Agent?

517
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:35,232
Don't tell me
you'll kill all the students.

518
00:46:35,312 --> 00:46:39,492
If they want to keep everyone quiet,
they'll have to kill every single one.

519
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:44,412
But do you think
that'll keep your cover hidden forever?

520
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,292
Your true identity
will be revealed someday like me.

521
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,452
And when that happens,

522
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:52,372
you'll realize you've lived for nothing.

523
00:46:53,122 --> 00:46:55,252
If you kill the innocent students,

524
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:58,092
how will you carry that guilt
for the rest of your life?

525
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:11,022
I wonder if you can keep being
hypocritical when faced with death.

526
00:47:11,102 --> 00:47:12,182
Should I test it?

527
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:13,192
Look.

528
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:16,482
I'm the one who planned the escape.
I coaxed them into it.

529
00:47:16,562 --> 00:47:18,232
She didn't do anything wrong.

530
00:47:18,322 --> 00:47:19,442
She tried to stop me.

531
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:20,482
Shut up.

532
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,362
If we must kill a hostage,
you're the first.

533
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:34,922
Lock them in the basement for now.

534
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:51,012
Ms. Pi.

535
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:52,562
Are you okay?

536
00:47:53,142 --> 00:47:54,022
Mr. Lee.

537
00:47:54,102 --> 00:47:55,272
Are you okay?

538
00:47:57,562 --> 00:47:58,732
I'm okay.

539
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:12,912
The Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center

540
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:14,872
is an undercover spy?

541
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:19,422
And the ANSP sent her in here.
It means she even penetrated the agency.

542
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:21,422
You think so too, right?

543
00:48:22,842 --> 00:48:24,882
To keep her cover hidden,

544
00:48:26,882 --> 00:48:28,722
she'll kill all the hostages.

545
00:48:30,102 --> 00:48:33,142
You tried to escape knowing all that?

546
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:36,062
Should I have done nothing
trusting a frustrating enemy?

547
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:38,062
So what difference did it make?

548
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:56,162
Your stupidity has put
the hostages in more danger.

549
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:06,422
You want to save Yeong-ro too, right?

550
00:49:11,352 --> 00:49:13,102
I want to save her too.

551
00:49:13,762 --> 00:49:16,732
I know you don't want
the hostages to get killed. Neither do I.

552
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:25,192
She must be still loyal to the North
like any veteran spy would be.

553
00:49:25,782 --> 00:49:28,532
But if she finds out they traded
their agents' lives for money,

554
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:30,492
I'm sure she'll change her mind.

555
00:49:31,622 --> 00:49:32,912
Bring Han-na in.

556
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,202
She obtained the proof.

557
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:38,122
I know they locked her up,
but if you specifically ask for her,

558
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:39,372
they'll have to send her in.

559
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:42,462
Even if they took her recording,
she must've heard something.

560
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:43,712
Right?

561
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:46,512
Bring her in
and listen to what she has to say.

562
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:48,842
You're the only one I can trust.

563
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:52,762
Please save the students' lives.
You know they're innocent,

564
00:49:53,432 --> 00:49:54,852
don't you?

565
00:50:18,202 --> 00:50:19,082
Help us.

566
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:23,502
Please.

567
00:50:31,172 --> 00:50:32,262
Lim Soo-ho!

568
00:51:13,222 --> 00:51:14,262
Comrade Lim!

569
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:15,722
Eung-cheol!

570
00:51:16,262 --> 00:51:17,142
Careful.

571
00:51:19,102 --> 00:51:20,722
My eardrums ruptured.

572
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:22,732
But it's temporary!

573
00:51:23,522 --> 00:51:24,732
Temporary!

574
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:30,692
That's a relief!

575
00:51:32,032 --> 00:51:33,242
The partition

576
00:51:35,112 --> 00:51:36,742
must've blocked the blast.

577
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:40,702
The hostages are
in the prayer room, right?

578
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,372
I keep being a burden to you.

579
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:47,172
I'm so ashamed, Comrade.

580
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,672
That's not true!

581
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:58,472
You must be hungry.
Is there anything you want to eat?

582
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,602
Oh, something I want to eat?

583
00:52:10,652 --> 00:52:14,192
I think a bowl of chicken soup
will heal me. No, it's okay!

584
00:52:23,162 --> 00:52:26,672
Wait just a moment. I'll get it for you!

585
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:29,002
No. It's okay!

586
00:52:36,132 --> 00:52:37,382
A camcorder?

587
00:52:37,472 --> 00:52:41,722
They want to see
if all 34 of the hostages are safe.

588
00:52:43,062 --> 00:52:45,272
So Nam Tae-il said
he'll send a camcorder in.

589
00:52:46,812 --> 00:52:48,192
I'll make sure

590
00:52:48,272 --> 00:52:50,612
your true identity doesn't get leaked.

591
00:52:55,532 --> 00:52:56,572
Let them send it in.

592
00:52:57,572 --> 00:52:58,662
But,

593
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:01,702
don't bring Han-na in.

594
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:09,582
But it must be Jang Han-na.

595
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:13,002
I clearly warned you.

596
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:14,002
I…

597
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:17,382
am the leader,
and my men's lives depend on me.

598
00:53:18,052 --> 00:53:20,552
Even if I end up being punished
for doubting the party,

599
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:23,472
I must find out the truth.

600
00:53:39,452 --> 00:53:40,532
Must you?

601
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:45,792
Answer me!

602
00:55:05,031 --> 00:55:07,701
<i>You bastard. Are you joking with me?</i>

603
00:55:07,781 --> 00:55:11,831
Send Han-na in with a camcorder.
I'll film all 34 of them.

604
00:55:12,581 --> 00:55:13,831
Han-na?

605
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:16,671
She was caught with Reporter Gal.

606
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:19,501
Wait, Han-na is not
at the scene right now.

607
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:21,421
I'll send in another agent.

608
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:25,301
No. If you want to check their safety,
send in Han-na.

609
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:29,761
Listen to this guy.
Do you have a thing for her or something?

610
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:32,431
In 30 minutes, I'll be at the shrine.

611
00:55:32,521 --> 00:55:34,981
In 30 minutes? That's not going to happen!

612
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:39,021
Give me an hour.
In return, make sure to film Dr. Kang.

613
00:55:39,111 --> 00:55:40,321
<i>Got it?</i>

614
00:55:42,651 --> 00:55:45,661
He hung up on me again. God, this bastard.
I hate this guy.

615
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:00,551
Han-na!

616
00:56:01,211 --> 00:56:02,051
Han-na!

617
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:05,591
Han-na, wait!

618
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:28,911
These are the students' dorm records
you asked for.

619
00:56:46,801 --> 00:56:48,221
GYE BUN-OK

620
00:56:48,841 --> 00:56:51,181
HOSU UNIVERSITY TELEPHONE OPERATOR

621
00:56:51,261 --> 00:56:53,061
She's a telephone operator?

622
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,811
She's perfect for watching the hostages.

623
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,981
They're just 34 people.
I can watch them by myself. Why--

624
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:04,151
You need you to keep an eye on Soo-ho.

625
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:08,571
Leave it to me
if you need to get rid of Lim Soo-ho.

626
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:14,661
Don't get ahead of yourself.
That's not what I meant.

627
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,791
I was given a secret order.

628
00:57:17,871 --> 00:57:20,041
To keep a close watch on him

629
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:23,291
and kill him without mercy
if I sense any change in his ideology.

630
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:25,591
Kill him without mercy?

631
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,721
Not just observe each other's ideology?

632
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:32,891
She said Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

633
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:35,811
Who said that?

634
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,731
The Ministry of State Security,

635
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,441
Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

636
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:51,111
Deputy Director Choi did?

637
00:57:53,071 --> 00:57:55,831
And he seems to know
I'm allowed to kill him.

638
00:57:56,541 --> 00:58:00,371
Despite knowing that, he still
sticks up for Yeong-ro in front of me.

639
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:02,961
I understand.

640
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:06,801
Go bring her to me for now.

641
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:18,271
Choi Su-ryeon…

642
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:23,351
She's not even in charge of Soo-ho. Why?

643
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:27,281
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

644
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:30,821
Moran Hill 1's cover has been blown.
Action needed for security.

645
00:58:34,741 --> 00:58:37,201
If we want Moran Hill 1's cover
to stay hidden,

646
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:39,701
we must kill all of the hostages.

647
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:41,961
But the South won't let it slide.

648
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:45,881
The deal is to let the hostages live
in return for 300 million dollars.

649
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:52,181
Since when did we

650
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:55,181
only do as agreed with the South?

651
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:57,851
Besides, the South's goal is

652
00:58:57,931 --> 00:58:59,351
to win the election,

653
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:01,681
not to save the hostages' lives.

654
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,271
Because of your son,

655
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:09,231
I reported to the party that
you were not fit to make a wise decision.

656
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:11,651
What?

657
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:14,031
Until the presidential election is over,

658
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:15,991
I'm the director
of the United Front Department!

659
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:17,331
I make decisions--

660
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:19,371
The socialism in Eastern Europe
is in crisis.

661
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:23,161
If this deal goes wrong, our party
will also face a crisis. You know that.

662
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:26,961
You'll remain as director
of the UFD until the election is over.

663
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:29,501
But I'll make all operational decisions.

664
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:32,131
That's the party's decision.
Do you understand?

665
00:59:32,221 --> 00:59:33,421
You…

666
00:59:36,641 --> 00:59:38,471
Don't worry about your son.

667
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:41,221
If he sacrifices his life for the country,

668
00:59:41,641 --> 00:59:43,771
he'll be titled a Hero of the Republic.

669
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:45,851
And if that happens,

670
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:49,521
you'll be acquitted
of failing this mission.

671
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:52,281
Aren't you happy?

672
00:59:56,661 --> 01:00:00,661
SERVE THE COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE!

673
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:09,591
I should be happy

674
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:12,761
to be acquitted
thanks to my child's sacrifice?

675
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:18,801
If one of our spies in the dorm
were your son,

676
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:24,561
would you have made the same decision?

677
01:00:24,641 --> 01:00:25,641
Of course.

678
01:00:26,311 --> 01:00:29,311
As a revolutionary warrior
of our dignified independent country,

679
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:31,981
that's the most honorable death
anyone could ask for.

680
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:39,701
Send Taedong River 1 a message.

681
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:44,791
To protect Moran Hill 1's identity,

682
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,671
the day before the presidential election,

683
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:50,631
he is to kill all of the hostages.

684
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:54,011
Right away, Comrade Deputy Director.

685
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:45,011
Most people wouldn't

686
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:48,061
even dare to touch Northern spies' money.

687
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:53,231
I guess you really needed money.

688
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:56,281
I'm…

689
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:59,651
I'm so sorry. Please spare me.

690
01:02:03,661 --> 01:02:04,581
Do you want to live?

691
01:02:09,251 --> 01:02:11,001
Then from now on,

692
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:15,131
manage and keep an eye on the hostages.

693
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:18,171
Pardon?

694
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:21,051
You mean,

695
01:02:21,131 --> 01:02:22,801
me?

696
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:25,261
What? Do you not want to?

697
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:44,911
I wasn't giving you a choice.

698
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:47,121
I was ordering you.

699
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:56,751
I had an older sister.

700
01:02:58,591 --> 01:03:02,261
She was smart enough for the country
to send her abroad to study.

701
01:03:03,891 --> 01:03:07,181
So my parents treated me
like some good-for-nothing.

702
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,021
They only…

703
01:03:11,061 --> 01:03:12,731
cared about my sister.

704
01:03:15,101 --> 01:03:17,191
But when she was in Germany,
a Northern spy--

705
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:24,661
A North Korean persuaded her to join them.

706
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:29,041
Then while she was questioned
for espionage, she died.

707
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:33,751
My dad collapsed because of the shock

708
01:03:33,831 --> 01:03:36,001
and has been in the hospital
for seven years.

709
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:38,961
So if I help you

710
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:42,341
and end up getting arrested
for espionage too…

711
01:03:46,551 --> 01:03:50,641
No one outside the dorm will ever find out
that you've helped us. Don't worry.

712
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:54,731
But the kids will know.

713
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,271
Well…

714
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,571
As I said, don't worry.

715
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:14,711
To show that I appreciate
the value of your labor…

716
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:16,211
Comrade Joo.

717
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:18,881
Give her ten years' salary all at once.

718
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:28,301
This will

719
01:04:29,471 --> 01:04:30,931
keep you safe.

720
01:05:06,011 --> 01:05:10,301
No one outside the dorm will ever find out
that you've helped us. Don't worry.

721
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,971
She must be planning to kill all of them.

722
01:05:17,191 --> 01:05:18,191
If

723
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:22,441
I don't accept this offer…

724
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:27,991
I'm sure she'll kill me.

725
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:37,521
Hey, is Jang Han-na not here yet?

726
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:40,311
What's taking her so long?
She left there ages ago!

727
01:06:40,391 --> 01:06:42,521
Why isn't she here yet?
Do you want to die?

728
01:06:42,601 --> 01:06:44,561
-Do you? I'll kill you!
-No, sir.

729
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:47,611
Just ten minutes ago,
they said she passed the main gate.

730
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:49,281
-Ten minutes ago?
-Yes, sir.

731
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:51,781
Ten minutes? You bastard!

732
01:06:51,861 --> 01:06:53,991
You let your subordinate
walk all over you,

733
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:55,951
but you want to stand out
in front of cameras?

734
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:57,831
-Huh? Is that it?
-Mr. An.

735
01:06:58,451 --> 01:06:59,951
This is the Rhine.

736
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:03,671
Hey, Pi.

737
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:08,381
<i>Pi!</i>

738
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:13,841
She cut me off.

739
01:07:13,931 --> 01:07:15,261
She cut me off!

740
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:17,471
How dare she!

741
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:19,971
You bastard! Go bring Han-na now!

742
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:21,481
Bring Han-na!

743
01:07:22,141 --> 01:07:23,141
Damn it.

744
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:24,601
Hey!

745
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:27,901
God damn it!

746
01:07:39,411 --> 01:07:42,661
This belongs to Pi?

747
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:08,611
<i>Was it</i>

748
01:08:09,651 --> 01:08:11,861
because of Yeong-ro?

749
01:08:14,031 --> 01:08:15,741
Since she's the director's daughter,

750
01:08:15,821 --> 01:08:18,491
they made you
a tapping room for security reasons?

751
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:21,331
In case he joined a protest,

752
01:08:22,451 --> 01:08:24,291
they asked you to watch her?

753
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:28,711
Did my agency threaten you
to make you do that,

754
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:30,801
Ms. Pi?

755
01:08:34,971 --> 01:08:36,051
Ms. Pi.

756
01:08:37,721 --> 01:08:39,681
-Was it really because of me?
-Of course not.

757
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:44,311
Don't try so hard to understand.

758
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:47,271
An inflexible stickler for the rules

759
01:08:47,851 --> 01:08:50,191
turned out to be spying for the ANSP.

760
01:08:50,611 --> 01:08:51,941
That's the truth.

761
01:08:53,821 --> 01:08:54,861
But…

762
01:08:55,901 --> 01:08:59,201
Jeong-min's been protesting,
but you let her be.

763
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:14,511
Repeat after me.

764
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:17,681
Spies come in chaos,

765
01:09:17,761 --> 01:09:19,841
and prosperity comes in peace.

766
01:09:22,891 --> 01:09:23,971
You tenacious wench.

767
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:25,981
How many more times do I have to tell you?

768
01:09:26,731 --> 01:09:28,601
If we… No, if I say

769
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:32,111
you're a spy, then you are a spy.

770
01:09:32,191 --> 01:09:34,481
A trial? That's just a formality.

771
01:09:37,031 --> 01:09:39,701
What are you doing? Look down properly!

772
01:09:43,031 --> 01:09:44,621
If you don't change your mind,

773
01:09:44,701 --> 01:09:47,081
you'll get swept away down there

774
01:09:47,581 --> 01:09:49,461
without a trace.

775
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:56,171
It's so cold, isn't it?
Let's make it quick.

776
01:09:57,131 --> 01:09:59,971
All right. You've been

777
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:02,011
to Pyongyang.

778
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:05,311
With your boyfriend. Right?

779
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:13,481
As I make someone a spy,

780
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:17,611
I feel like I'm lovesick.

781
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:24,951
I've been only watching you
for the last few months.

782
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:29,041
I've been working so hard
to make you a spy!

783
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:32,581
You're a spy, right?

784
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:42,181
You're the one, aren't you?

785
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:44,391
You're the one who went to Pyongyang

786
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:46,721
with your lover! Who else would it be?

787
01:10:48,271 --> 01:10:49,521
Tell me!

788
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:54,311
I'll tell you.

789
01:10:54,401 --> 01:10:57,901
I'll tell you everything! I swear!

790
01:11:05,371 --> 01:11:06,871
I'll tell you.

791
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:08,991
I'll tell you everything!

792
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:10,331
I swear!

793
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:18,751
I get the feeling

794
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,421
that you have
an ill-fated relationship with the ANSP.

795
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:26,261
A relationship? Being pestered
by evil men isn't a relationship.

796
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:33,441
After framing two innocent people
for espionage and getting them killed,

797
01:11:33,521 --> 01:11:36,561
you people were awarded medals
and prize money!

798
01:11:36,651 --> 01:11:40,231
For serving the country loyally!
You think I'll ever forget it?

799
01:11:44,781 --> 01:11:46,031
For serving…

800
01:11:58,751 --> 01:12:01,131
The one who tortured me the most cruelly…

801
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:08,261
shed tears in front of the people
on the day I was released.

802
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:13,731
With the look on his face just like yours.

803
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:06,651
Starting today, Bun-ok

804
01:13:07,401 --> 01:13:09,991
will manage and watch all of you.

805
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:12,701
-What? Why?
-She'll manage us?

806
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:13,991
What's going on?

807
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:15,001
Why Gizzard?

808
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:17,331
Quiet.

809
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:21,541
You must obey Bun-ok's orders.
Don't talk back to her.

810
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,921
Whoever disobeys her

811
01:13:24,551 --> 01:13:26,511
is disobeying me.

812
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:29,051
So I'll kill them without mercy.

813
01:13:41,111 --> 01:13:43,361
That vicious wench.

814
01:13:55,491 --> 01:13:57,081
-What's going on?
-Tell me about it.

815
01:13:57,161 --> 01:13:58,041
Bun-ok.

816
01:13:58,121 --> 01:13:59,831
-What does she think she is?
-Are you

817
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:02,631
on the spies' side now?

818
01:14:04,341 --> 01:14:05,341
On their side?

819
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:06,921
Watch what you say.

820
01:14:07,631 --> 01:14:10,181
I'm just supervising you in Pi's place.

821
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,311
Supervising, whatever.

822
01:14:22,401 --> 01:14:23,861
Who is she to supervise us?

823
01:14:24,651 --> 01:14:26,021
What are we, kindergarteners?

824
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:36,081
You've now even become
a lackey for the Northern spies?

825
01:14:36,661 --> 01:14:39,501
Listen. This is way worse than stealing.

826
01:14:40,211 --> 01:14:41,711
Once we're all released,

827
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,211
I'm sure you'll go to jail
for helping the spies.

828
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:46,921
People will throw stones at your family.

829
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:55,601
That crazy wench.

830
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:10,441
Yes.

831
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:12,531
I'm a thieving wench.

832
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:18,951
Countless rings that you got
from this guy and that guy.

833
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:23,251
Pairs of dress shoes
you bought but wouldn't wear.

834
01:15:23,331 --> 01:15:26,381
Designer clothes you wore once
on a blind date and forgot about.

835
01:15:29,131 --> 01:15:31,381
I'm a thief who didn't feel guilty

836
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:33,591
about stealing them.

837
01:15:37,351 --> 01:15:39,561
What are you jabbering about?

838
01:15:40,311 --> 01:15:41,731
Boasting about stealing?

839
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:44,521
When did you ever treat me like a human?

840
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:47,271
You treated me like some machine

841
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:51,741
that took calls for you without any
emotions or desires, and laughed at me.

842
01:15:53,031 --> 01:15:55,451
Like I wasn't human
since I wasn't a college student.

843
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,621
-When did we do that?
-We didn't.

844
01:15:58,701 --> 01:16:00,041
-No, we didn't.
-No way.

845
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:09,041
I'll return the favor.

846
01:16:10,751 --> 01:16:14,631
See how it feels like
to be bullied by Gizzard.

847
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:17,511
You should feel it.

848
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:21,181
That's only fair.

849
01:16:21,851 --> 01:16:22,811
Don't you agree?

850
01:16:25,391 --> 01:16:26,481
Ko Hye-ja?

851
01:16:31,281 --> 01:16:33,151
Hands over your head with your face down.

852
01:16:36,911 --> 01:16:38,661
Heads down, all of you!

853
01:16:57,631 --> 01:17:01,181
Film every single hostage
including the doctor.

854
01:17:01,261 --> 01:17:02,851
An hour will be enough, right?

855
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:05,101
I'll radio you once I'm done.

856
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:07,641
What about the proof?

857
01:17:12,901 --> 01:17:15,281
I need to see my team leader first.

858
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:17,571
Your fiancé is safe, so don't worry.

859
01:17:19,031 --> 01:17:20,321
It'll only take a minute.

860
01:17:20,991 --> 01:17:23,661
I risked my life to get this.
You can't even allow me a minute?

861
01:17:27,411 --> 01:17:30,211
All right, fine. I'll just give it to you.

862
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:43,931
In order to obtain this, a person is

863
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:47,311
dying in the interrogation room
of the ANSP.

864
01:17:49,021 --> 01:17:50,101
So listen to it carefully.

865
01:17:51,191 --> 01:17:53,021
I've brought this to you

866
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:55,441
because I think you're different

867
01:17:55,531 --> 01:17:57,741
from Geum-cheol
who killed himself with cyanide.

868
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:09,461
Hey.

869
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:14,501
Shouldn't you at least give water
to Yeong-ro and Ms. Pi?

870
01:18:16,341 --> 01:18:17,921
How long will you keep us tied up?

871
01:18:26,221 --> 01:18:27,771
Comrade Kang wants to see you.

872
01:18:28,391 --> 01:18:30,021
Tell her I'll radio the party first.

873
01:18:33,191 --> 01:18:34,401
Lim Soo-ho.

874
01:18:34,481 --> 01:18:36,651
We're rats in a trap!

875
01:18:37,361 --> 01:18:38,741
Rats in a trap.

876
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:57,841
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

877
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:02,181
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

878
01:19:02,431 --> 01:19:04,971
<i>and saving the hostages. Right?</i>

879
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:10,771
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

880
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:15,271
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies.</i>

881
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:22,901
<i>Enemies are everywhere.</i>

882
01:19:23,411 --> 01:19:26,701
Those who have power
all thanks to their family name

883
01:19:26,781 --> 01:19:28,911
have their guns pointed at me.

884
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:33,501
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

885
01:19:33,581 --> 01:19:35,001
Don't forget that.

886
01:19:38,671 --> 01:19:40,841
If my father has been suspended…

887
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:43,341
<i>Right.</i>

888
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:45,511
<i>That must be it.</i>

889
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:48,471
<i>It must have been someone else's decision.</i>

890
01:19:49,931 --> 01:19:51,561
<i>There's no way my father would…</i>

891
01:20:37,311 --> 01:20:38,861
Ryesong River 1, can you hear me?

892
01:20:39,981 --> 01:20:42,151
<i>Ryesong River 1, loud and clear.</i>

893
01:20:44,571 --> 01:20:46,491
Any change in the location
of Mount Myohyang?

894
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:12,431
What were you doing?

895
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:16,101
I radioed the message about your cover

896
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:18,481
being blown and asked what to do about it.

897
01:21:18,651 --> 01:21:20,861
But there was no reply,
so I was about to do it again.

898
01:21:24,191 --> 01:21:25,651
It's an important matter,

899
01:21:25,741 --> 01:21:27,951
so it must be taking them
quite a while to discuss.

900
01:21:29,321 --> 01:21:30,201
Oh, right.

901
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:34,911
Does the party know
the ANSP director's daughter is here?

902
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:38,251
They do.

903
01:22:23,421 --> 01:22:24,751
This is Eun Chang-su.

904
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:27,881
You know my daughter's
being held hostage, right?

905
01:22:29,261 --> 01:22:33,301
Could you order your agents
to release my daughter right away?

906
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:37,021
Then meet our demand first.

907
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:40,141
Send us 300 million dollars in three days.

908
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:41,351
Pardon?

909
01:22:42,021 --> 01:22:44,811
But you agreed to receive it
after the operation was over.

910
01:22:44,901 --> 01:22:47,191
If you don't send it to us in three days,

911
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:49,401
all of the hostages will die.

912
01:22:49,491 --> 01:22:50,491
What?

913
01:22:51,321 --> 01:22:52,611
Are you kidding me?

914
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:55,241
Remember. You have three days.

915
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,621
Hello?

916
01:23:00,871 --> 01:23:01,711
Hello?

917
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:54,341
KILL ALL HOSTAGES DAY BEFORE ELECTION

918
01:24:16,281 --> 01:24:18,991
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

919
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:30,711
God damn it!

920
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:04,161
<i>No change in Mount Myohyang's location.</i>

921
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:07,581
No change in Mount Myohyang's location.

922
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:11,461
<i>My father is still
the director of the UFD.</i>

923
01:25:14,761 --> 01:25:16,051
<i>Then he has…</i>

924
01:25:17,881 --> 01:25:19,221
<i>abandoned me?</i>

925
01:25:36,691 --> 01:25:38,741
Please give me a ride to Pyongyang.

926
01:25:38,821 --> 01:25:41,831
My sister's sick. Please help her!

927
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,081
Come on.

928
01:25:47,161 --> 01:25:49,581
-We have no time for that.
-Yes, sir.

929
01:25:50,251 --> 01:25:53,591
My father died trying to save other people
when the mine collapsed.

930
01:25:53,671 --> 01:25:58,431
So in my father's place,
shouldn't the party save my sister?

931
01:26:03,971 --> 01:26:06,061
What are you doing? Go away!

932
01:26:06,851 --> 01:26:09,391
Please give me a ride to Pyongyang.

933
01:26:09,481 --> 01:26:12,231
We even got kicked out
of the train because we had no pass!

934
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:16,991
If you give us a ride,
I'll make sure to repay you.

935
01:26:17,071 --> 01:26:18,951
-Come here!
-Please help us!

936
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:21,201
Please! My sister's sick!

937
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:23,161
Please help her!

938
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:29,871
If you give us a ride,
I'll make sure to repay you.

939
01:26:31,001 --> 01:26:32,211
Repay me?

940
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:33,631
How?

941
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:36,211
I will do anything.

942
01:26:37,211 --> 01:26:39,381
If you tell me to die, I will!

943
01:27:17,211 --> 01:27:18,591
You're hungry, aren't you?

944
01:27:19,421 --> 01:27:22,631
This won't do. Demand some more food.

945
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:32,061
Stand up.

946
01:27:43,781 --> 01:27:44,951
Put your hands up.

947
01:28:22,741 --> 01:28:24,241
You son of a b****.

948
01:28:30,871 --> 01:28:32,661
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

949
01:28:32,751 --> 01:28:36,211
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

950
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,791
<i>The more likely
the ruling party is to win the election,</i>

951
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:40,211
<i>the less likely we're to live.</i>

952
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:43,171
<i>I feel like I can hear
the approval rating going up.</i>

953
01:28:47,471 --> 01:28:48,511
How is it in there?

954
01:28:48,601 --> 01:28:49,551
Actually,

955
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:51,971
Lim Soo-ho the spy…

956
01:28:52,061 --> 01:28:53,981
Who ordered to kill me?

957
01:28:54,061 --> 01:28:56,731
<i>You were a card to discard to begin with.</i>

958
01:28:56,811 --> 01:28:58,191
Be careful.

959
01:28:58,271 --> 01:29:00,151
<i>If you don't send
300 million in three days…</i>

960
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:02,281
<i>Bun-ok…</i>

961
01:29:02,361 --> 01:29:04,321
<i>Your daughter will be killed first.</i>

962
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:07,571
<i>I must get out of here alive.</i>

963
01:29:09,821 --> 01:29:10,871
<i>Yeong-ro.</i>

964
01:29:17,921 --> 01:29:20,671
BONUS

965
01:29:20,921 --> 01:29:22,421
I'll check the food first.

966
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:23,461
6 MONTHS AGO

967
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:25,211
You may go in.

968
01:29:51,451 --> 01:29:55,451
My, my. You guys did
a variety of drugs here.

969
01:29:57,871 --> 01:29:58,751
Look who's here.

970
01:29:58,831 --> 01:30:01,921
Isn't this Ms. Lee Yu-rim,
the most popular singer?

971
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:03,341
Nice to meet you!

972
01:30:03,711 --> 01:30:05,591
Miss, over there. Strike a pose!

973
01:30:06,131 --> 01:30:07,131
Good.

974
01:30:07,221 --> 01:30:10,261
Our handsome Crown Prince,
strike a pose too!

975
01:30:10,341 --> 01:30:11,721
Great.

976
01:30:11,801 --> 01:30:13,101
Hey, you two,

977
01:30:13,181 --> 01:30:14,601
you look great.

978
01:30:15,431 --> 01:30:16,931
Damn it!

979
01:30:17,521 --> 01:30:18,811
Pose!

980
01:30:18,891 --> 01:30:20,771
Great.

981
01:30:21,351 --> 01:30:24,071
Hey. Kick him out.

982
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:25,731
Guard…

983
01:30:28,191 --> 01:30:29,491
Guard!

984
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:45,961
This?

985
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:47,801
Are you insane?

986
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:20,661
Whether the President's son does meth
or his wife cheats,

987
01:31:21,251 --> 01:31:23,331
we'll take care of it, so stay out of it.

988
01:31:23,421 --> 01:31:25,211
Who are you? How did you know I was here?

989
01:31:33,341 --> 01:31:35,641
There are so many
other news stories to write.

990
01:31:36,801 --> 01:31:38,511
So stop here.

991
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:43,311
No… Don't do it!

992

A BELOVED ACTRESS
WHOSE PASSION FOR ACTING SHONE BRIGHTLY

995
01:31:57,116 --> 01:31:59,952
AND ONLY WISHED
TO SHARE THE GOOD WITH OTHERS…
