00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,853
-It's open in front of you!
-Run!

2
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,188
That's it! Hey, Woo-min! Go!

3
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,232
-Jeez.
-It's okay.

4
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,026
Nice, you did well!

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,193
Great work!

6
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,403
Will you not tell me?

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,488
The girl in the photo.

8
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,615
How persistent. Just play ball.

9
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,325
Was she someone you had a crush on?

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,285
Or is it stalking?

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,369
Hey, this way!

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,620
-Okay!
-Good.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,621
Hey, Woo-min!

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,622
-Hey!
-Use your feet!

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,749
-Hey!
-Kick it!

16
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,251
It's going up!

17
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,003
You should've finished it well.

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,088
Hey, Woo-min, you're too slow!

19
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,340
Come on. Just tell me.

20
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,509
Who's the girl in the photo album?

21
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,761
Why are you so curious?

22
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,222
I wonder how real this love is.
You scrapped every moment.

23
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,476
Go to the side!

24
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,811
-Move!
-Your feet!

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,485
Come on.

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,029
Stop following me.

27
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,490
Why don't you show her the pictures?

28
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,576
I'm sure she'll be touched.

29
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,994
When it comes to memories,

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,499
it's pathetic to keep them to yourself,
but it's romantic when you share them.

31
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,878
I don't know if I'm playing soccer
or getting relationship counseling.

32
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,216
We're substituting! Woo-min, come out!

33
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,485
<i>You know I'm seeing someone.</i>

INCHEON AIRPORT TERMINAL 1

35
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,790
Do you like him?

36
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,709
Does your heart race?

37
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
I'm working on it.

38
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,214
Is that something you can work on?

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,758
I want to try, with him.

40
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,345
If my feelings are making
things hard for you,

41
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,598
I want to stop, too. But...

42
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,477
But I can't.

43
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,231
-Woo-min...
-You still make my heart race.

44
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,025
I still want to be by your side.

45
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,738
I know you're trying
to draw a line and ignore how I feel,

46
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,365
but I want to hold onto you

47
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,367
like a fool.

48
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,913
You've changed, Woo-min.

49
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,793
You express your feelings now.

50
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,296
I'm not trying, like you.

51
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,884
I'm just saying what I feel.

52
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,449
Where did it all go wrong?

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,677
{\an8}THE PHOTO WALL AND THE EXHIBITION

54
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,040
Ms. Ahn!

55
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,793
It's been a while, Seon-ho.
I'm surprised to see you here.

56
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,295
I'm blacklisted by the industry,
so I'm free lately.

57
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,467
Are you participating
in the Diana History Exhibition in Seoul?

58
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,720
The big exhibition from New York?

59
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,347
So it's coming to Korea too.

60
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,391
She's no longer with us,

61
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,809
but their creative director,

62
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,019
Cezanne's favorite Asian model
was you, Seon-ho.

63
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,985
I'll never forget
the exclusive campaigns you did for Diana.

64
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,320
There was a time like that for me, too.

65
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,489
Since it's such a symbolic event,

66
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,950
if a model like you participated
in the opening,

67
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,246
it would highlight the brand's history,
and become a meaningful exhibition.

68
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,666
As you know, models have to be chosen.

69
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,462
I'm more honored to be
remembered by you like this

70
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,799
than to be part
of another moment on a photo wall.

71
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,764
The fabulous exhibition

72
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,393
went through Paris and New York,
and finally has come to Seoul!

73
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,604
And it's being held

74
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,815
in the most elegant art museum in Korea.

75
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,152
Well, we're only in charge
of the opening ceremony and photo wall.

76
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,778
But what's the problem? Why not?

77
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,282
The first exhibition was held
at the Palazzo Museum in Milan.

78
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:28,369
I watched the opening ceremony
via livestreaming. I was so jealous.

79
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,164
Also, it made me want to be
in charge of such a huge event.

80
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,207
If we were in charge, we'd do great.

81
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,044
What's the point
of a History Exhibition like this?

82
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,796
They want to separate their luxury goods

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,466
and turn them into art
instead of products.

84
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,011
Who's known for their luxuriousness?
It's us, Audrey.

85
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,388
Did you get the celebrity list?

86
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,681
I'm receiving it today.

87
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,143
Your model friend,
Ye Seon-ho was on the list, I think.

88
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,646
Of course, she is.
She was in tons of Diana campaigns.

89
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,900
There must be some big names invited.

90
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,110
I heard a rumor

91
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,613
about the models Gigi Hadid
and Kendall Jenner coming.

92
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,949
Ms. Oh, I'm so excited!

93
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,831
These are distracting.
Can you walk again, Esther?

94
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,841
Esther looks great in these.

95
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,426
I know Esther's pretty,

96
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,844
but no Esther, no Joseph.

97
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,555
Don't encourage her.

98
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,308
No Joseph, no Esther either.

99
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,726
Bosh.

100
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,146
The two outfits are so different.
Any particular reason?

101
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,650
The first one was by Jang Se-pyeong,
the elementary school kid,

102
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,819
who was growing dreams through K-drama.

103
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,489
And this one is by the current Mr. Joseph.
I wanted to match the two as one.

104
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,409
The portfolio we want to create

105
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,203
is a story of the brand called Mr. Joseph.

106
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,913
Showrooms overseas pay attention to

107
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,499
whether the brand identity
is present in the designs.

108
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,710
We'll have to split the shooting
into the editorial and the lookbook,

109
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,462
into in-studio and on-site shooting.

110
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,922
I'll handle hair, makeup,

111
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,007
and art to discuss
styling with Ms. Esther.

112
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,594
You should... right, head to the streets

113
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,721
and take a look at Joseph's emotions.

114
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,806
Okay.

115
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,393
It's a total click! Bosh.

116
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,728
I'm so excited.

This was our secret hangout spot.

Hey, since you're both late, take a shot.

Let me see!

Wow, that's insane!

140
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,669
So you're a designer now?

141
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,173
To me, Jjoseph has always been
the coolest designer!

142
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,552
You're going to be
a world-renowned designer now.

Hey, I know.

144
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,849
I'm really nervous.
Will I do well in Paris?

145
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,309
There are no right answers.

146
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,478
Just go ride-or-die.

162
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,372
-One more beer.
-One more beer.

163
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,417
Just one more!

164
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,841
Our whole history remains here.

165
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,176
After renovation, it'll be all gone.

166
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,679
So I rented it for a few days.

167
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,557
Add this to our list of locations.

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,474
Okay.

169
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,734
SEON-HO, WOO-MIN, JI-EUN, SE-PYEONG

170
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,319
PYO JI-EUN, JI WOO-MIN

171
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,529
HOW IMMATURE. ARE YOU KIDS?

172
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,163
Hey.

173
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,373
Are you not gonna do anything?

174
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,837
I heard everything from Ji-eun.

175
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:42,975
Booked for a job?

176
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,061
You're on a diet.

177
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,521
No, I'm just being professional.

178
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,857
You seemed unmotivated lately.

179
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,276
You're refreshed
after seeing your parents?

180
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,364
What do you think I can do when I retire?

181
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,366
Well.

182
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,992
Anything.

183
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,453
You, Ye Seon-ho, can do
anything if you try.

184
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,039
Why? Do you want to retire?

185
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:05,956
It's just...

186
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,295
I want to do something
that recognizes you on the inside,

187
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,464
not the outside.

188
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,050
Without using a body as a model.

189
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,142
Hye-na?

190
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,395
Huh?

191
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,480
Seon-ho.

192
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,731
Do you work here?

193
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,152
Just part-time.

194
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,530
I'm not getting any work

195
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,949
but have to make a living.

196
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,284
What about modeling? Did you quit?

197
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,747
It felt like I was at my limit.

198
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,544
I wanted to stop relying
purely on my will when I have no talent.

199
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,797
And competing every time...

200
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,424
I hated it.

201
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,636
I don't even have a strong presence
on the runway like you do.

202
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,306
You probably had no idea.

203
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,061
You were my motivation.

204
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,525
Walking on the same runway
as you was a huge honor for us.

205
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,571
The Diana campaign photoshoots
and videos you took were like

206
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,781
the bible to younger models like me.

207
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,782
You wouldn't know.

208
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,703
Thank you for remembering me that way.

209
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,457
It was my dream to walk the runway
for a collection abroad

210
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,336
just like you while being friends
in the same dorm together.

211
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,634
My shift's coming up. See you later.

212
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,052
Hye-na.

213
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,773
Seon-ho's not here.

214
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,691
This doesn't make sense.

215
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,109
What? No way.

216
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,903
Check it again, Ji-eun.

217
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,489
I already double-checked with the HQ.

218
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,661
It's Diana's History Exhibition,

219
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,538
and they can't leave Seon-ho out.

220
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,582
She was Cezanne's favorite model.

221
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,460
She made the finale
of Cezanne's last collection,

222
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,046
and she was with Diana at its prime.

223
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,465
This is unfair!

224
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,092
They invited

225
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,637
the cream of the crop.

226
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,305
My hands are shaking.

227
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,432
How are we supposed to appease them?

228
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,518
We even might have to fall to our knees.

229
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,519
Ms. Oh!

230
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,315
Look.

231
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,067
I'm sorry about Ye Seon-ho,

232
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,236
but this is just what the situation is.

233
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,946
You saw it on your way to work.

234
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,448
They changed the bus stop commercial model

235
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,991
from Seon-ho to someone else.

236
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,747
It's just so upsetting
whenever this happens.

237
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,582
Fashion is all about what's new.

238
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,710
This is how we survive.

239
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,214
Call Ms. Ye.

240
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,842
She might be waiting for it.

241
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:23,988
We meet again.

242
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,573
I saw your tag on Instagram.

243
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,366
I don't have time to hang out.

244
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,452
I have class, work, and exercise to do.

245
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,788
Still, I bet you want
to spend time with me.

246
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,792
I don't think we have the same values
or interests to be friends.

247
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,253
Aren't looks enough?

248
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,464
I'm a lot more hard-working than I look.

249
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,091
What's your one-year plan?

250
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,554
To make an official debut as a model
at the runway of Seoul Fashion Week.

251
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,723
I don't want to make a vague start.

252
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,892
I want to start strong. What about you?

253
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,644
Perfect OPIc grades,
crypto investment, and licenses for

254
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,521
a web designer and a real estate agent.

255
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,274
Wow.

256
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,484
That's why you're so busy.

257
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,863
I have exactly one hour
and twenty minutes before my next class.

258
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,780
All right.

259
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,786
The academy told me my image, figure,
and personality will do.

260
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,748
A modeling academy gets you
an exclusive contract?

261
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,376
No, I have to graduate,
then pass the auditions for an agency.

262
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,045
That's very tough.

263
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,255
I'm putting everything into modeling.

264
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,383
Then is today

265
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,844
our first day as a couple?

266
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,642
I already saw you were handsome
after work that day,

267
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,937
and you're unexpectedly hardworking.

268
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,651
-I'm fine!
-This one will look great on you!

269
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,735
One, two, three!

270
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,155
One, two, three!

271
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,035
Did you send it to JD?

272
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,912
Yes, I got a text saying they got it.

273
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,456
I sent it early because she's so picky.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,293
Hello.

275
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,211
Oh my!

276
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,964
Oh gosh, look who's here!

277
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,298
Are you here to see Ji-eun?

278
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,384
Ji-eun told me she was working late.

279
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,554
You didn't have to get me such a thing.

280
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,101
She's downstairs for someone
who came by for her, but she'll be back.

281
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,811
Please have a seat.

282
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,980
-Share this with people.
-Okay.

283
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,356
-Thank you.
-No problem.

284
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,401
Are you doing
the Diana History Exhibition?

285
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,153
Just the photo wall on the opening day.

286
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,114
The HQ is doing all the fancy stuff.

287
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,742
Right. We received the celebrity list,

288
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,495
and gosh, is it a mess.

289
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,497
You always pull it off, though.

290
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,874
Nothing like Audrey
for celebrity fashion events.

291
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,543
Thank you for recognizing us.

292
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,508
I hope you're not too upset, Seon-ho.

293
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,969
You know how high fashion is.

294
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:56,140
They talk about how it's tiring to see
the same models as the last season.

295
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,308
It's a history exhibition,

296
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,562
but there is no history
in that photo wall celebrity list.

297
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,356
That's what they only care about.

298
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,899
I guess I wasn't on the list.

299
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,321
But we, the fashionistas, know

300
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,825
that the Korean supermodel Ye Seon-ho

301
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,494
was at the center of Diana's history.

302
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,543
This is too much.

303
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,630
I wanted to see you
but couldn't interrupt.

304
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,382
And this was the only excuse.

305
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,053
Thank you, we'll enjoy it.

306
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,305
You're too busy to date.

307
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,222
I can't reach you.

308
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,100
Is everything all right?

309
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,936
You're right, I was a little distant.

310
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,107
I was busy
with that airport incident and everything,

311
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,860
I'm sorry, I couldn't even care about you.

312
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,653
No need to apologize because of work.

313
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,115
I'm always rushing you

314
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,700
and being greedy.

315
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,077
-What do I do?
-Oh...

316
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,913
Your timing was off today.

317
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,456
Seon-ho!

318
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,333
Hello, Seon-ho.

319
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,045
I got here first and brought snacks.
They're eating now.

320
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,589
I feel bad for your boyfriend.

321
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,592
It's nice to hear I'm her boyfriend.

322
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,178
What brings you here?

323
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,555
To check my name isn't
on the celebrity list

324
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,182
for the Diana History Exhibition.

325
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,395
Why? Were you worried?
That it might hurt my pride?

326
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,733
Gosh.

327
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,778
You know who I am.

328
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:38,992
I'd like to take you and your friends
out to dinner. What do you think, Seon-ho?

329
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,786
As long as Ji-eun's okay.

330
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,373
But Woo-min and Jjoseph are busy lately.

331
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,583
But we should all meet at least once,

332
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,669
so that you can make it official, right?

333
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,092
Just let me know
when and where. I'll set it up.

334
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,718
Sounds good?

335
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,431
-Thank you, Seon-ho.
-No problem.

336
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,520
Don't be afraid of being
a bitch to someone.

337
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,401
I'm leaving.

338
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,532
Seon-ho! You know I love you, right?

339
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,746
I'll get going too. You should go inside.

340
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,687
Here.

341
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,190
Going for a night ride?

342
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,441
I need one more helmet.

343
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,442
Riding with someone?

344
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,112
You told me earlier.
Don't just sit by, but do something.

345
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,991
Slay! This is such bosh!

346
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,117
Wait right here.

347
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,455
Esther, where's the helmet? Huh?

348
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,343
Hey, wait up!

349
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,931
Bosh!

350
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,191
-Hop on!
-Hey, Woo-min, what's going on?

351
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,903
Get on. We're eating red bean porridge.

352
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,406
Why am I going with you
to get red bean porridge?

353
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,867
Like how you need me
when you eat <i>jajangmyeon</i>,

354
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,371
I need you
when I'm having red bean porridge.

355
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,040
-Here!
-What's with you?

356
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,335
Hey, I can't breathe.

357
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,633
There.

358
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,260
-What is this?
-Hold on.

359
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,470
Done.

360
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,764
All right, get on.

361
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,225
-But I'm tired.
-Hurry, get on.

362
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,142
Here we go.

363
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,436
-Let's roll!
-Oh gosh!

364
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,793
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

365
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:37,838
Eat.

366
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,132
I really don't like red bean porridge.

367
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,174
I know.

368
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,260
Then why would you bring me here?

369
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,221
I want to make sure, so I have no regrets.

370
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,894
It doesn't matter if you're
with someone. I'll still do my best.

371
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,231
And in the end, it's up to you to decide.

372
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,861
NAM-JIN

373
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,627
I'm just not sure.

374
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,718
You want to be my boyfriend again?

375
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:27,971
All right.

376
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,015
I like you too.

377
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,852
But I'm hesitant.

378
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,563
Regardless of who I'm seeing,

379
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,275
I can't make that decision.

380
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,780
If our relationship goes wrong again,

381
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,242
it'll mean that...

382
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,789
we aren't meant to be.

383
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,127
It'll affect us,

384
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,714
and it'll hurt our friends, too.

385
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,550
Do you think I said all that
without knowing that?

386
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,472
When you feel sure,

387
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,184
will you come to me?

388
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,987
I'll deal with my feelings however I want.

389
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,411
You really won't eat it?

390
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,789
I said I don't like it.

391
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,706
Just one bite.

392
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,542
One bite, please.

393
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,265
It's good.

394
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,144
From now on, you can say you like it.

395
00:23:59,146 --> 00:23:59,980
Let's eat up.

396
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:03,942
Yum!

397
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,247
Take care of the thread later.

398
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,832
-Okay.
-My gosh.

399
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,209
Seriously, your waist is so tiny.

400
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,920
Oh gosh, so pretty.

401
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,048
Your waistline is nice
and the length is perfect.

402
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,636
Gosh, JD will be
all over the photo wall for this event.

403
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,388
Did this really come in for me?

404
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:41,021
I worked really hard
to get the most elegant piece.

405
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,523
They were all asking
who was going to wear it.

406
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,441
Really?

407
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,318
Do JD and elegance go together?

408
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,070
Looks too seamless. I hate it.

409
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,534
Sometimes, at high-end events like this,

410
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,954
it's nice to show a different side of JD.

411
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,665
I look like a doll, not JD.

412
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,961
JD, you're an icon to both
the millennials and the Gen Z.

413
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,507
You define that generation.

414
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,722
You're not goofing around with me, right?

415
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,683
No.

416
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,310
Call the hair and make-up artist.

417
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,151
Okay, come on, move.

418
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,367
Hi, it's me, JD.
My outfit for the Diana photo wall.

419
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,328
Isn't it too weak?

420
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,792
LIM YEON-HEE

421
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,210
PARK SEO-JIN

422
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,712
Don't you ever get them confused.

423
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,383
The shoes, outfits,
and purses will all be different.

424
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,552
Label the lists from the HQ.

425
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,762
But there are a lot of outfits

426
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,889
that don't match the image of celebrities.

427
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,100
Who gets the nicest outfits?

428
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,685
The rising stars.

429
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,647
The photo wall isn't just a place
where pictures are taken.

430
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,067
It's where brands can clearly
show their direction and level.

431
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,736
The world needs
to know about their new faces.

432
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,780
What if reporters make a list

433
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,241
of all the worst-dressed celebrities?

434
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,826
What if it's in the headline?

435
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,160
Reporters?

436
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,498
I got nice gifts for them,
so don't you worry about that.

437
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,044
Hello, I'm here to see Ms. Oh.

438
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,963
Wasn't that Ms. Hong laughing just now?

439
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,339
Cover it!

440
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,383
Guys, come on, hurry!

441
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,810
I know you're busy,
but you should catch a breather.

442
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,355
To Seo-jin, the VIP,

443
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,609
I'd like to introduce
everyone here at Audrey.

444
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,901
Welcome.

445
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,903
Your timing is perfect.

446
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,740
It looks like
many celebrities are coming.

447
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,284
Those at higher tiers.

448
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,038
Thanks to K-Pop and K-Drama,

449
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,540
Korean singers and actors are global now.

450
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,042
And the Italian HQ asked us

451
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,294
to live stream the opening.

452
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,587
At the photo wall.

453
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,341
Seo-jin, how amazing!

454
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,258
This time,

455
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,512
you're going to be recognized
by the global fashion world.

456
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,098
Never mind that.

457
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,894
I also heard that actress,
Im Ji-wan was coming.

458
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,105
Can I see her outfit?

459
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,496
This is Ji-wan's outfit.

460
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,885
Ms. Hong, I'll get going.

461
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,804
Should I call your manager up?

462
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,472
I can find him right away.

463
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,099
-I'm off.
-Sure.

464
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,809
Ji-eun, you should see her off.

465
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,061
Right, let me walk you out.

466
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,606
See you.

467
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,526
What do we do?

468
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,700
Im Ji-wan's outfit,

469
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,369
it's the main signature outfit
for the season, right?

470
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,956
Yes, but...

471
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,291
But only one person is
the star of the show.

472
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,086
I'm not sure if it's a right choice.

473
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,509
We're just doing
what the HQ told us to do.

474
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,512
So it doesn't matter how the event goes?

475
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,272
Then what do we do?

476
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,858
Switching the outfits
without telling the HQ?

477
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:59,404
She's not doing this
because she wants to wear that outfit.

478
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,532
It's because she wants
more attention than Im Ji-wan.

479
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,453
They've been enemies
ever since their debut.

480
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,873
Recently, she lost a movie
and a commercial to her.

481
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,416
She's sensitive about it.

482
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,877
Well, that's her problem.

483
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,795
How could an agency break HQ guidelines?

484
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:20,216
Exactly! You should've taken one
of them off the list in the first place.

485
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,470
Those greedy brands are
giving us a hard time.

486
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,515
This event is really important to us.

487
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,267
We can't have any problems.

488
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,396
Seo-jin's temper is really something.

489
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,607
Come on, can't you persuade her?

490
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,027
Gosh, I'm asking for a favor!

491
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,995
A fashion photographer takes
family photos?

492
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,123
It's a VIP job.
The pay is the same as an ad.

493
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,626
Popular photographers live like this.

494
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,965
Let's lower it by two steps.

495
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,554
Ma'am, we're all set.

496
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,265
Can you ask everyone to come?

497
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,350
Sure.

498
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,145
-Right, Mr. Do.
-Yes?

499
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,774
Could you take pictures
of my son afterwards?

500
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,068
If I want to set him up on dates,

501
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,320
I need to have a nice photo of him.

502
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,988
Yes. Of course.

503
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,284
Oh!

504
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,328
Come here, darling.

505
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,038
You look great.

506
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,208
Oh my, you look great, Nam-jin.

507
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,709
Okay, come here.

508
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,711
Over here.

509
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,839
Give us a big smile.

510
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,173
We'll take test shots.

511
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,634
Okay, great.

512
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,553
All right, one more.

513
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:49,848
-Wow!
-I love it.

514
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,808
Great photos. Right, darling?

515
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,725
Yes.

516
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,520
Let's look at Nam-jin's.

517
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,898
That one came out well.

518
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,153
If you don't introduce me

519
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,156
to that Pyo Ji-eun girl you're seeing,

520
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,909
I'll hand these pictures
over to a marriage agency.

521
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,872
Mother, I'll head inside.
I have to go to work.

522
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,789
Okay.

523
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,251
Thank you for today.

524
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,090
That's my son. Isn't he handsome?

525
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,302
-He must take after you.
-Oh my.

526
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,309
Terminate your contract?

527
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,644
If you aren't modeling, who will?

528
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,937
You're Ye Seon-ho.

529
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,523
Why is everyone I meet lately
comforting me?

530
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,442
It's a waste of your talent.

531
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,988
Then how about a TV program?

532
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,616
You talk well, and you're cool.

533
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,867
People will love you.

534
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,285
Throwing your career away?

535
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,162
What a waste.

536
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,666
I'm thankful,
but I can't just take random jobs.

537
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,627
That's not what I do.

538
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,795
Please, Mr. Gang.

539
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,214
Send me the termination agreement.

540
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,050
Hey...

541
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,032
Excuse me, miss!

542
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,082
Thank you.

543
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,833
Oh my, Ji-eun.

544
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,169
Nice to see you here.

545
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,046
Madame Jang, hello.

546
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,548
I'm just here to pick up some products.

547
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,800
Are you out shopping?

548
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,595
Yes, I'm having lunch
and shopping with my friend.

549
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,765
This is my son Joseph's friend, Ji-eun.

550
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,602
She's a bright and smart woman
working in the fashion industry.

551
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,979
-Isn't she lovely?
-Yes.

552
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,563
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

553
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,523
Likewise.

554
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,110
You know
the high-end brand Rublani, right?

555
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,738
Her son is the CEO of the Korean branch.

556
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,035
So it is you, isn't it?

557
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,171
I've heard about you for the past year,

558
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,257
and it's so nice to finally meet you.

559
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,842
Thank you, Ji-eun.

560
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,219
No, it's my pleasure.

561
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:37,056
When I asked my son
what kind of lady you were,

562
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,226
he said you were the kind
he wanted to marry.

563
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,856
Ji-eun, what kind of man is
Nam-jin to you?

564
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,696
To be honest, Nam-jin
and I broke up once before.

565
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,658
And it hasn't been too long
since we got back together.

566
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,076
Oh.

567
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,288
That must mean you two are even stronger.

568
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,207
I like that kind of story.

569
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,256
My family has a lot of money.

570
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,091
A high reputation, too.

571
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,677
But neither I nor Nam-jin

572
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,181
want to bring a trophy wife
into the family to show off to people.

573
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,311
I like women
who have careers like you, Ji-eun.

574
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,605
Thank you.

575
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,275
Oh! You should go back to work.

576
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,612
Thank you for making the time
to have tea with me.

577
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,239
You can take my car.
I've already told the driver.

578
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,201
No, that's okay. I can take a taxi.

579
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,243
Please.

580
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,829
Get used to it before you join our family.

581
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,918
Oh dear, you're so beautiful, Ji-eun.

582
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,517
LOVE PASSIONATELY

583
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,726
I'LL MISS YOU THE MOST

584
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,605
NOT "SAME HERE" OR "ME TOO,"
SAY I LOVE YOU

585
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,652
Can I borrow the place
for a few days, too?

586
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,017
SEMI-BASEMENT
FOR LEASE

587
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,409
DIANA
HISTORY AND MOMENT

588
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,919
No, not at all.

589
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,463
You'll be here soon, right?

590
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,008
All right, I'll see you soon. Bye.

591
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,429
Oh my God! What do I do?

592
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,265
Go, hurry.

593
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,521
Mr. Kang, what happened?

594
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,898
What? What is it?

595
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,109
I think I might get fired, Ms. Oh.

596
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,485
An important guest is out.

597
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,446
Who? Who was it?

598
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,781
-The model, Ye Seon-ho.
-Ye Seon-ho?

599
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,285
What do you mean?
She was never on the list.

600
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,246
My team double-checked,
and she wasn't even on the outfit list.

601
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,874
Where did that name come from?
We only have one hour.

602
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,752
I know. The global HQ confirmed the list.

603
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,087
Cezanne's people found out today

604
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,299
that Seon-ho wasn't on the list
and made a huge scene.

605
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,260
They will take Cezanne's archive
out of the exhibition.

606
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,012
We only have an hour left.

607
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,640
We don't even know where Ye Seon-ho is.

608
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,437
Ms. Oh, we can wrap up
after the gift unboxing.

609
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,774
And JD's makeup is taking a while,
so they might be late...

610
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,651
JD isn't important now.

611
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,278
You need to bring Ye Seon-ho

612
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,863
to the photo wall.

613
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,367
Seon-ho? Right now?

614
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,872
-They lost their way. Go and fix it.
-Okay.

615
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,999
Check the list for reporters.

616
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,878
My gosh, I'm losing it. Did you reach her?

617
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,297
No, I can't get through.

618
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,799
I texted her,

619
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,135
saying my life depends
on her coming to the photo wall.

620
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,845
Let's leave it to God's will.

621
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,390
But, what about her outfit?

622
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,393
The store will send us an outfit
in Ye Seon-ho's size by express.

623
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,436
But considering how the HQ handles it,

624
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,272
they will never make it in time.

625
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,233
If she comes, I'll dress her in my outfit.

626
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,610
Even though I wore this to blend in.

627
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,280
This is still from Diana.
Is this Diana, too?

628
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,740
The basic etiquette among fashionistas.

629
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,203
-Oh gosh, you're here!
-Welcome!

630
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,790
MS. HONG

631
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,004
I want to stand at the photo wall
with my boyfriend!

632
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,255
Seo-jin, no, stop it.

633
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,173
I know you're a top star,

634
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,635
but people in the fashion world
will call you crazy and blacklist you.

635
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,762
If you reveal your boyfriend

636
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,807
in someone else's event,
how will this event look to the public?

637
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,475
I wore what you told me to.

638
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,645
I dressed him head to toe in Diana too.

639
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,730
So what's the problem?

640
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,689
How senseless!

641
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,693
Even your manager called me for help.

642
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,819
Ms. Hong.

643
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,281
No, Ji-seon. I'm not dumb.

644
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,492
Show business is all about making issues.

645
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,787
I'm not Im Ji-wan's sidekick today.

646
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm trying to make myself
the star of this event.

647
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,374
Fashion?

648
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,752
They've been living off us.

649
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,005
I want their eyes on me
instead of the event. So what?

650
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,382
Okay, fine. Seo-jin, just hear me out...

651
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,137
Today's event

652
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,806
it isn't for your greed, Seo-jin.

653
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,978
It's for witnesses of the history
of fashion made by people

654
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,272
who deeply cared
about change and sustainability.

655
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:23,486
In a way, celebrities like you are
getting a free ride

656
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,907
on their hard work.

657
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,950
What are you doing?

658
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,995
Since you're dressed up,

659
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,623
please go to the photo wall.

660
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:40,211
Don't tarnish the meaning
behind the outfit with a cheap smile.

661
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,464
Just show off your cold, chic pose.

662
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,888
That's how you pay back
everything you've enjoyed

663
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,140
thanks to fashion.

664
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,646
That's why we invited you.

665
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,731
So pay us back!

666
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,735
Gosh.

667
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,903
Damn it.

668
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,034
Manager, all good.

669
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,787
Okay, go!

670
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,497
Let's go!

671
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,791
Ji-eun, Park Seo-jin has just left.

672
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:23,963
Ms. Hong.

673
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,842
I'm done doing business
with celebrities, right?

674
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,469
You know I have a big mouth like media.

675
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,430
Seo-jin's career is over, not yours.

676
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,598
Oh gosh, I almost fainted.

677
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,601
Ms. Oh, I've never seen you
like that before!

678
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,687
My legs are still shaking.

679
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,314
Over here, please!

680
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,232
Look over here!

681
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,150
Over here, too!

682
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,568
Actress, Park Seo-jin.

683
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,239
Look over here, please!

684
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,240
Over here!

685
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,199
Over here, too!

686
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,548
Over here!

687
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,175
Singer, JD.

688
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,306
She isn't showing off the clothes,
Ms. Oh, what do we do?

689
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,978
Look over here.

690
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:21,937
Thank you.

691
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,608
Ms. Oh, it's Ye Seon-ho!

692
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,609
Where?

693
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,833
Look over here, please!

694
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,586
Over here!

695
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,969
-Seon-ho, you're so pretty.
-Seon-ho!

696
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,140
Model, Ye Seon-ho!

697
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,812
Isn't that outfit
from Cezanne's collection five years ago?

698
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,776
Oh my gosh!

699
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,903
You look great, my friend!

700
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,322
Gorgeous!

701
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,457
THE MODEL CEZANNE LOVED
PROVES DIANA'S HISTORY

702
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,461
She's very smart.

703
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,339
She graced the event
with her presence in an outfit

704
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,675
from Diana's creative director
five years ago.

705
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,553
Thanks to her, the opening event showed

706
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,055
the true meaning
of the Diana History Exhibition.

707
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,934
And in the background,
someone was betting their all

708
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,519
for the sake of fashion.

709
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,603
Ms. Hong...

710
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,566
Cheongdam Daily says
you went straight in for a slap.

711
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,735
Oh, no, gosh.

712
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,112
Not a slap.

713
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,656
-It was like a punch.
-Ms. Hong.

714
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,782
Am I wrong?

715
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,660
Please. Ms. Ahn will have the wrong idea.

716
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,663
Then she started shaking...

717
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,581
No, she wasn't.

718
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,154
Welcome.

719
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,326
Will you sit there?

720
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,078
It'd be nice to sit
across from each other.

721
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,835
Won't you sit?

722
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,056
I thought you would bring your friends.

723
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,099
My friends...

724
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,062
They aren't coming.

725
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,875
The guy called Lee Nam-jin,

726
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,547
he caught my eye
just like those shoes did.

727
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,051
I wanted to make things work between us.

728
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,720
Like a gift, you made my heart race,

729
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,597
and I was thankful.

730
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,183
That's how I felt.

731
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,563
-Ji-eun.
-But those shoes...

732
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,068
don't fit me.

733
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,865
It felt like I had to force
myself into them.

734
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,330
And sometimes, it felt like they were
so loose that I had to drag my feet.

735
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,165
It really did.

736
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,171
Even though I tried,

737
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,135
they weren't for me.

738
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,600
I think I was just too greedy, Nam-jin.

739
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,480
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,359
I think this is the end of us.

741
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,372
In thos uncomfortable shoes,

742
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,626
it must've been hard

743
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,255
to keep up with me.

744
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,552
I liked walking alongside you so much

745
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,388
that I didn't notice.

746
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,559
Since they're heels,

747
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,937
I can't even ask you to wear them out

748
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,607
or make them tighter.

749
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,862
Thank you for everything, Nam-jin.

750
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,201
Thank you.

751
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,554
JJOSEPH

752
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,399
Is she not home yet?

753
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,667
Ppyoji, did you ignore my call?

754
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,169
Jjoseph, Seon-ho.

755
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,171
What is it? Why are you so down?

756
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,382
It's nothing.

757
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,760
What's up? I'm kind of tired.

758
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,680
Today's the last day
of Woo-min's exhibition.

759
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,432
What exhibition?

760
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,226
You'll find out.

761
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,570
SEMI-BASEMENT
FOR LEASE

762
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,160
This is the bar
we used to visit in college.

763
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,997
The gallery's kinda lame,
but you'll like the exhibition.

764
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,668
What are you doing? Go.

765
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,588
Go inside.

766
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:15,517
BYE! SEE YOU AGAIN TOMORROW

767
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:25,027
SEMI-BASEMENT
THANK YOU FOR BEING BY MY SIDE

768
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,313
<i>You've never really missed me, have you?</i>

769
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,607
<i>I can see you any time.</i>

770
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,150
<i>Am I your regular diner?</i>

771
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,069
<i>That you can come sit down at any time?</i>

772
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,779
No, <i>I'm</i> your regular diner.

773
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,448
So, you can come by any time.

774
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,202
<i>You were never just a friend to me.</i>

775
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,996
<i>I've never stopped
thinking of you as my girl.</i>

776
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,628
<i>It doesn't matter
if you're with someone. I'll do my best.</i>

777
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,215
<i>When you feel sure,</i>

778
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,175
will you come to me?

779
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,857
If you must know,

780
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,778
the photographer probably
went to your place

781
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,154
to give you your ticket.

782
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,111
Hey...

783
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,282
Today's the last day of my exhibition.

784
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,743
Shall we go see it?

785
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,953
I already saw it.

786
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,874
It was great.

787
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,590
I'm sorry.

788
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,425
The assurance,

789
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,387
that's what I couldn't give you.

790
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,475
To me,

791
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,395
those pictures were all the moments...

792
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,898
When you loved me.

793
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,991
What I want is...

794
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,330
more of those moments with you.
