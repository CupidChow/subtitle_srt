1
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,199
Hey, Dad. You're calling early. What's up?

2
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,036
<i>Ji-eun, do you have time around lunch?</i>

3
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>Go take your grandmother to the hospital.</i>

4
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,373
Grandma? Why? Is she okay?

5
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>She thinks she has Alzheimer's.</i>

6
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,546
<i>She's better with numbers than me
and seems healthy.</i>

7
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,089
<i>Still, she wants a checkup.</i>

8
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,593
Gosh, Grandma worries too much.

9
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,845
Okay. I'll treat her to a nice lunch.

10
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm off to work!

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,276
{\an8}GRANDMOTHER'S SCARF
AND THE CHEONGDAM FASHION CIRCLE

12
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,785
-Here's your order.
-Thank you.

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,827
What would you like?

14
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,829
-One hot Americano, please.
-Sure.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>Get me one too.</i>

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,126
One more, please.

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,252
-Two of the same?
-Yes.

18
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,170
Okay.

19
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,506
Thank you.

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,674
Next customer, please.

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,593
PUT YOUR BUSINESS CARD

22
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,392
A LUXURY BAG GIVEAWAY THROUGH LOTTERY

23
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:47,982
Wait.

24
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,943
My business card holder.

25
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,574
So you're really doing nothing about it?

26
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,493
<i>It's over anyway.</i>

27
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,122
That asshole Young-soo was cheating
on you! Aren't you even mad?

28
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,875
After all, he was seeing someone else
while he was dating you.

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,712
Assholes like him need to be punished
immediately. For the good of society.

30
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,005
You deserve an apology.

31
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,134
<i>Stop being nosy and just go to work.</i>

32
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,760
Worry about yourself.

33
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,221
You have a pictorial
with JD and Hong Ji-seon.

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,432
<i>Do you think she'll cooperate
after you provoked her?</i>

35
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,060
<i>You know what she's like.</i>

36
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,687
What do I do?

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,814
Jeez!

38
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,066
What do you mean? Just grin and bear it.

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,110
Okay, I'll pray for you.

40
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,029
All right, bye.

41
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm heading out. How about you?

42
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,413
Ji-eun wants me to demand
an apology from Young-soo.

43
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,582
For his cheating.

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,250
What good would that do?

45
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,085
Right? Screw the apology.

46
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,795
I'll just take a nap.

47
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,634
Where are you going, all dressed up?

48
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,345
I'm riding a bike.

49
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,015
All dolled up like that?
You even did your hair.

50
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,935
What happened with Ji-eun?

51
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,146
You guys were just drunken hook up?

52
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,775
It's written on your face,
so don't try to fool me.

53
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,071
The more you see her,
do you regret letting her go?

54
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,989
Yes!

55
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,658
You're not getting her back.

56
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,079
Yes, you're right.

57
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,667
I feel like she's still mine.
Maybe because I keep seeing her.

58
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,255
At the same time,
it feels like she's out of my reach.

59
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,051
But I think I like the way things are now.

60
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,471
We can meet up casually
whenever we want to.

61
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,265
I can be open with her as a close friend.

62
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,644
And that's why I don't need to be
responsible for her.

63
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,937
No need to try hard

64
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,563
or make an effort.

65
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,316
Still,

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,777
when she's with another guy,

67
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,446
I can't stand it.

68
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,782
You freaking coward!

69
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,492
Stop being a such jerk!

70
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,618
I'll get going!

71
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,120
Hey!

72
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,998
Keep doing that,
or we're through as friends, got that?

73
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,504
You're not even a man.

74
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,256
What a hopeless asshole.

75
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,854
Do you see that from all the way
over here? That scary aura.

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,608
But it's only...

77
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,944
Why didn't she go to her own workplace?

78
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,445
She was the first one here.

79
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,739
It was as if she was waiting
to burst through the doors.

80
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,951
Ms. Oh got all pale and rushed in.

81
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,245
Her face is all sallow now.

82
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,665
We don't have the outfits ready.
What's she even going to do?

83
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,625
I think she's up to something.

84
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
Maybe something happened?

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,672
Who are you to cozy up
with someone else's man?

86
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,507
Get out here!

87
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,508
Shoot.

88
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,677
Wait.

89
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,186
Seriously...

90
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,064
Just as expected!

91
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,859
As usual,
you've got great taste, Ms. Hong.

92
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,696
Nobody's tried on
this season's signature piece.

93
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,449
I think JD will look gorgeous in this.

94
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,617
Ms. Oh, is this all you can offer?

95
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,330
I can't find any of the pieces
that seemed okay in this collection.

96
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,790
Who the hell picked
these hideous things anyway?

97
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, then...

98
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,295
How about this?

99
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:42,008
JD's neck and collarbone will definitely
stand out in this keyhole neckline...

100
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,968
This is going nowhere.

101
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,430
I should just call Ms. Ahn
and take a look at other brands.

102
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,015
This isn't going to work.

103
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,112
Good morning, Ms. Hong.

104
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,535
We usually send the lookbook in
before the meeting.

105
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,163
What brought you all the way here,
without an assistant?

106
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,832
The texture of the fabric,
the silhouettes, the tones,

107
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,668
and styling ideas
inspired by those features.

108
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,130
These are all things you can't get
by browsing through a lookbook.

109
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,965
Do you even understand?

110
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,641
Ms. Ahn told me to work with AUDREY
and specifically mentioned you.

111
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,727
I wonder why she did that.

112
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,564
She's just someone I admire a lot.

113
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,484
School, hometown, or family.

114
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,195
Any of these connections with her
would make sense.

115
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,950
The great editor-in-chief Ahn Nam-hee
mentioned you specifically.

116
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,493
Wouldn't you be confused?

117
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:57,166
She's never mentioned
a mere PR employee's name before.

118
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,751
It has never happened.

119
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,923
Let me see.

120
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,259
Show me what you've got.

121
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,928
Pardon?

122
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,807
Can I see the outfit you recommend?

123
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:18,980
But Ms. Hong.

124
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:24,694
I'm just a marketer for the brand,
not a stylist.

125
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,989
I could brief you on the concepts
for this season, but...

126
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,158
This is JD we're talking about.

127
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,034
You must've had at least some plan

128
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,370
for her styling, right?

129
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,706
Right,

130
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,833
maybe you're hammered all the time,

131
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,043
so you didn't have time to think about it?

132
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,503
-Ms. Hong...
-Well, Ms. Hong!

133
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,548
Excuse us for five minutes.

134
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,467
Enjoy some of our tea, please.

135
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,018
She's picking on us.

136
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,603
l'd like to know why.

137
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,021
She's just been putting me down

138
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,398
but biting your head off with a "roar"!

139
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,233
She might end up eating us alive.

140
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,569
She knows
about the afternoon concept meeting.

141
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,196
Why is she here so early?

142
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,615
Did something happen between you two?

143
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,701
Were you drunk? She saw you at a bar?

144
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,536
Bar? No way!

145
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,914
You know I can't drink.

146
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,542
So nothing happened?
Not even the slightest thing?

147
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,669
No way.

148
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,297
We're on totally different levels.

149
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,799
Right, that makes sense.

150
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,801
God, what a headache!

151
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,178
What do we do?

152
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,556
Remember the sample clutch
from last season?

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,350
Give it to her, and report it to HQ.

154
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,187
-Again?
-It's the only way to shut her up.

155
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,606
All right?

156
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,274
Gosh!

157
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,404
How about Better PR and Two Communication?

158
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,950
They're representing a lot of brands
with great marketing output.

159
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,412
This one's doing outdoor brands

160
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,665
and spa brands as well?

161
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,208
What a tasteless mishmash!

162
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,461
And this one's doing
Japanese rice cookers.

163
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,841
But it would allow them for wide coverage
and comprehensive PR.

164
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,804
How about we just try CRYSTAL or AUDREY?

165
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,015
Most of their clients are luxury brands.

166
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,226
And that's exactly
what MR. JOSEPH is all...

167
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,896
Joseph, we're just a local brand.

168
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,439
You really think

169
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,442
high-end brand PR agencies would say "yes"
if we ask them to represent us?

170
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,986
They're more famous than us.

171
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,614
Okay, then this one, that one,
and that one!

172
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,617
Have these three give a presentation.
Then I'll pick one.

173
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,328
Okay, get up.

174
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,081
-I've set up meetings with them.
-What?

175
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,876
This one, that one, and that one!
And that one too, my recommendation.

176
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,171
Wait, so we're going now?

177
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,798
Let's show them

178
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,301
how much potential MR. JOSEPH has,

179
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,012
and get some advice from them too.

180
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,848
Even our retailers were turned down,
so we should do something.

181
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,143
Is this how low I've fallen?

182
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,270
Bosh.

183
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,987
Are you going
to the Cheongdam Fashion Circle luncheon?

184
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,196
Shall we go together?

185
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,576
Well, I got the invite
but haven't made up my mind yet.

186
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,245
-I'm not in the mood either.
-Ms. Hong.

187
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,081
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:28,669
I'm the one who failed to manage
my employees. It's all my fault.

189
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,546
Please let it slide this once.

190
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,592
-Well...
-Yes?

191
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,101
Ms. Hong, please.

192
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,942
I'm too tired to drive
after a restless night.

193
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,195
Ji-eun!

194
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,451
You should drive us
as a token of your apology.

195
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,994
Where to?

196
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,122
You know, the Cheongdam Fashion Circle,
the famous fashion industry gathering.

197
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,083
We have a lunch meeting today.

198
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,460
Is it okay if we take your car, Ms. Hong?

199
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm sorry, but I've got other plans today.

200
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,555
Ji-eun, what are you doing?
Hurry up and get the car.

201
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,904
Dad, Grandma isn't answering.
Is she out already?

202
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,490
<i>She left her phone, saying it's a hassle.</i>

203
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,242
<i>Are you not with her?</i>

00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,004
Then I can just leave.

how could I say no to a friend?

222

But do you mind
if I bring one more person?

223
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,556
No problem. Who?

224
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,731
Oh, dear.

225
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,036
Ma'am.

226
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,707
Good afternoon, I'm Woo-min.

227
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,542
Who?

228
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,419
Oh, I'm Ji-eun's friend.

229
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,547
We met a few times in front of your house.

230
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,968
I guess you don't remember me.

231
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,428
Oh...

232
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,848
The young man who used to date my Ji-eun?

233
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,936
Oh, dear.

234
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,771
I remember you.

235
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:38,818
You're the one who had my granddaughter
all upset and worried, right?

236
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,493
<i>Prepare the list of outfits at the office.</i>

237

<i>And hand me the keys.</i>

Grandma must be waiting.

{\an8}PHONE CALL

241
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,849
Hello?

242
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,851
<i>Is this Pyo Ji-eun?</i>

243
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,353
This is she. Who's calling?

244
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,646
<i>I'm Shim Do-young.</i>

245
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,483
I don't know anyone with that name.
You have the wrong number.

246
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,610
I'm pretty sure I got the right number.

247
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,654
I found your business card holder.

248
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,572
I'm sorry?

249
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,907
Oh...

250
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,618
Looks like it's from Saint Laurent.
Don't you want it back?

251
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,871
Well, yeah...

252
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,664
You know Cheongdam Steakhouse, right?

253
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,249
How about we meet there?

254
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,126
Pick a time that works for you.

255
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,044
All right.

256
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,255
But I'm a bit busy today,

257
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,091
so does 11 a.m. tomorrow
sound good to you?

258
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,178
I can't wait to see you,
but I guess you don't feel the same.

259
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,806
<i>Anyway, I got it. See you tomorrow.</i>

260
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,226
What's with this guy?

261
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,228
What did he just say?

262
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,403
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

263
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,030
Chairman Kim!

264
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,574
-My, it's been a while.
-He's great as always.

265
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,661
It's Ms. Ahn.

266
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,496
-Wow!
-It's an honor.

267
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,497
Chairman Kim.

268
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,920
This is Mr. Lee Nam-jin,
an M&A specialist.

269
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,963
He helped us acquire shares in RUBLANI.

270
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,632
Nice to meet you, Ms. Ahn.

271
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,261
He'll also play a key role

272
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,096
in growing RUBLANI in Asian markets

273
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,098
as a major brand like Hermes.

274
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,810
I never skip a RUBLANI store
when I visit Paris.

275
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,606
So I was happy about their first branch
in South Korea, and I look forward to it.

276
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,024
I'm Ahn Nam-hee.

277
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,528
I heard your recommendation
played a big part in the acquisition.

278
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,489
You really have great taste, ma'am.

279
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,134
For starters, I'd like to thank everyone

280
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,638
who supported Trend Lab,
which began with a passion for K-Style,

281
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,431
to make this a regular gathering.

282
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,230
Why am I seated further down
than the Sungwoon marketing director?

283
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,232
Who did the seating arrangements?

284
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,025
The fashion now...

285
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,860
I heard Ms. Ahn's in charge of it.

286
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,488
She does the seating arrangement herself.

287
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,450
We also need to incorporate
other cultural genres to create...

288
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,953
Did she not take into consideration
this year's performance?

289
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,038
No wonder she isn't so generous with us.

290
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:42,167
Trend Lab will be introducing
the main theme of 2022,

291
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,544
the future of K-Style and...

292
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,297
Is the man from earlier Lee Nam-jin?

293
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,300
Once again, our fashion industry...

294
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,593
Looks like it.

295
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,512
We should put our heads together to...

296
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,055
He's handsome.

297
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,640
Over here.

298
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,517
Here's our first guest today.

299
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,645
She won the Jury Prize at
Seoul International Women's Film Festival.

300
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,105
Director Kim Lee Han-na.

301
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,773
She collaborated

302
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,276
with Korean designer brand Hela

303
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,070
and was in charge
of the 2022 SS Online Fashion Film,

304
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,281
which drew lots of attention on YouTube.

305
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,578
Her idea was to give everyone
a front-row experience.

306
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,997
-Move over!
-Wait...

307
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,044
Oh my gosh!

308
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,712
-What's wrong with you?
-Oh my!

309
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,964
-What have you done?
-My goodness.

310
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
I'm so sorry!

311
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,760
Oh no, this is a sponsored item
for Ye-jin.

312
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,554
Turning up uninvited again.

313
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,098
Is that a bad habit of yours?

314
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,185
I'm so sorry.

315
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,064
Whether we wipe it or wash it,
let's take care of it outside.

316
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,086
Ji-eun.

317
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,549
It's nice to see you here.

318
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,011
What was so nice to see?
Me or me in this situation?

319
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,680
You didn't answer my calls.

320
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,390
I didn't know. I blocked you.

321
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,894
You came after me
just to ask about that? Why?

322
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,107
Wipe it with this.

323
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,276
I'm fine.

324
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,616
I have something to tell you.
Answer your phone.

325
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,743
Get back safe.

326
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,751
Wait, he's...

327
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,517
Do you mind if I help?

328
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,438
-Like this...
-I see.

329
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,107
You're good.

330
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,525
Have a taste.

331
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,580
Did you not adore and pamper my Ji-eun?

332
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,583
Pardon?

333
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,378
She used to cry for days on end,
moaning and groaning.

334
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,256
And it broke my heart too,
just to see that.

335
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,716
I hate you.

336
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,971
Grandma's about to join the club.

337
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,892
See him? He's easy to hate, Grandma.

338
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,143
His haters... I mean,

339
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,854
there's a club of people who hate him.

340
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,647
You should join. I'm the president.

341
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,694
Grandma, how's the food?

342
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,030
It's lovely.

343
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,824
Let me show you something.

344
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,117
What did you learn?

345
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,161
There...

346
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,709
You put this here today.

347
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,670
Grandma, where did you learn this?

348
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,714
You're such a fashionista. It's pretty.

349
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,886
Your grandpa gave me this
when he proposed to me.

350
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,221
It's the prettiest one.

351
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,098
You must've been happy.

352
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,605
This might get loose.

353
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:34,858
Come closer.

354
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,279
It's still a little chilly outside.

355
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,364
We'll go to the hospital?

356
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,115
We're going now.

357
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,494
But Grandma, I'm pretty forgetful too.

358
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,372
-You're too, right?
-Yeah.

359
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,915
See?

360
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,464
Let's eat.

361
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,553
Between understanding
and misunderstanding,

362
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,764
the latter is easy to pick
over the former.

363
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,266
Seon-ho,

364
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,644
please calm down and try to understand.

365
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,730
At my boyfriend's house,
in the middle of the night,

366
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,900
there was some woman wearing
nothing but a nightgown.

367
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,820
Do calm people understand such a thing?

368
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,780
What's so funny?

369
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,533
In that context, it can be seen
as part of a soap opera.

370
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,869
What, are you filming a movie?
How can you possibly explain this?

371
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,580
First of all, you made a scene

372
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,750
and ruined the show
I put months of hard work into.

373
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,045
I managed to pull through,
but it wasn't enough.

374
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,465
You were upset
because I didn't take your side,

375
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,467
but I was just as upset as you were.

376
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,305
Ms. Hong came to comfort me that night.

377
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,850
She spilled her wine,
and I brought her a change of clothes.

378
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>Just then, some drunk woman
busted my window,</i>

379
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,653
and I saw you behind her.

380
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,742
<i>As a designer,</i>

381
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,952
<i>it's my job to dress and undress models,</i>

382
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,704
so Ms. Hong's state of dress meant nothing

383
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,914
especially when my girlfriend's a model.

384
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,666
So you just stood there?

385
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,928
You always put your feelings first.

386
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,807
In this situation, I should've done this.
In that situation, I should've done that.

387
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,559
Don't force me to act however you want.

388
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,811
So, you're telling me I misunderstood.

389
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,856
Then you should've come after me
right then and tried to explain!

390
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,940
Why should I?

391
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,777
I was feeling like shit too,

392
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,862
so why should I cater to your whims?

393
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,573
I have no intention of doing that

394
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,116
and I never will.

395
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,910
If you want...

396
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,540
Don't misunderstand.
This wasn't impulsive.

397
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,251
I've been waiting for the perfect timing.

398
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,754
I was being calm and meticulous.

399
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,562
Well, that wasn't easy.

400
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,315
Hey, how low do I have to go?

401
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,819
Why do I have to be insulted,
as if I'm a petty peddler?

402
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,739
Joseph, you'd better throw tantrums
only with me, not anybody else.

403
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,574
Being sulky and emotional,

404
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,536
just like you were back there,
isn't professional.

405
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,495
You heard them!

406
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,123
"There are tons of designer brands
in Korea."

407
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,583
"How many of those would succeed?
You know nothing."

408
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,293
How rude to a potential client!

409
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,753
It's because we don't sell.

410
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,548
-Hey!
-If it's unfair, then become famous.

411
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,470
You really make me...

412
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,183
Are you hungry?

413
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,813
Yeah.

414
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,275
Shall we eat?

415
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,487
I want stir-fried <i>sundae</i>
with lots of noodles.

416
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,614
Let's go.

417
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,162
I'm sorry, my knees are too precious
to get down and grovel.

418
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,998
It's all right. I got you covered.

419
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,502
So, are we going to Sindang-dong?

420
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,463
Sillim-dong is known for <i>sundae</i>.

421
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,215
Right, Joseph.

422
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,509
Shall we link arms?

423
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,344
Bosh, what's the fuss?

424
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,730
Gosh.

425
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,066
You've no idea how upset I was.
I'll eat all the <i>sundae</i> in Sillim-dong.

426
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,610
You'll get tubby, Joseph!

427
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,948
Sir, there's a big motorcycle shop
in Hannam-dong.

428
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,408
Please drop her off there.

429
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,453
-I'll tell Dad to come out for you.
-Oh, dear.

430
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,955
I know where my own house is.

431
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,458
He's a busy man, so don't bother him.

432
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,129
Why? Did the doctor say it's that bad?

433
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,925
No way, you heard him.
You're doing great for your age.

434
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,595
Ji-eun, don't work too hard.

435
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,306
Be a baby sometimes,
going "Ah, my tummy hurts."

436
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,267
That's a great tip, Grandma.

437
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,102
All right, I'll see you.

438
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,104
Drive her home safe, please.

439
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,440
Bye.

440
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,407
GANGNAM JIIN HOSPITAL

441
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,868
Excuse me, is this your grandmother's?

442
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,954
-Oh...
-She left it.

443
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,996
Thank you.

444
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,132
BOUTIQUE MONACO ART MUSEUM

445
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,765
Why are you here?

446
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,601
After coming and going as you please,

447
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,521
you finally realized
the place doesn't belong to you?

448
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,649
Yeah, I did.

449
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,777
Something happened?

450
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,988
I don't know. I don't wanna talk about it.

451
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,367
Does that mean you need some alcohol
before you start talking?

452
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,747
-Ji Woo-min.
-Do you want fried chicken too?

453
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,541
Want to hook up with me?

454
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,466
Are you crazy?

455
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,846
Otherwise,

456
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,099
take me out for a drive.

457
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,908
Where do you want to go?

458
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,412
Gangneung.

459
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,332
At this hour?

460
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,544
Let's have
some fresh sliced raw fish and soju.

461
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,172
You saw Jin Young-soo?

462
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,215
I told you not to.

463
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,343
Who are you talking about?

464
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,513
Let's go to Busan.
I want to see the Gwangan Bridge!

465
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,265
Anywhere else?

466
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,808
Namhae! That sounds nice!

467
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,311
Why are you so serious?

468
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,024
Weren't you just casually dating?

469
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,195
How can dating
and a person's feelings be "casual"?

470
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,449
It's a word you use when you don't know
how to express your feelings.

471
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,117
Is that right?

472
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,204
That's what you're doing to Ji-eun
and it's wrong.

473
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,374
Being friends
after dating for three years?

474
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,502
Don't be ridiculous.
I've known you forever.

475
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,567
Well...

476
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,299
Oh my God!

477
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,637
Oh, come on!

478
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,514
What's wrong with you guys?

479
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,432
Oh my God!

480
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,727
-Come on.
-What?

481
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,019
Come on.

482
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,731
Our precious Ji-eun's working
overtime alone.

483
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,941
And who freaked you out?

484
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,901
-It's okay.
-Gosh.

485
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,528
Let's have a drink first.

486
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,446
There.

487
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,410
Is Hong Ji-seon making you select outfits?

488
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,955
Yeah, she wanted to see
my suggested outfit.

489
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,916
Like I'm her personal assistant.
I'm screwed.

490
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,127
You said you'll suck up to her.

491
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,547
That's the price for that night.

492
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,799
Seon-ho got her revenge too.

493
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,760
Jin Young-soo.

494
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,472
-Splash!
-What?

495
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,974
In his face?

496
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,438
That's so cool!

497
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,397
-Drink up!
-Okay!

498
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,524
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

499
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,572
Let's drink!

500
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,573
Drink!

501
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,074
Don't splash it on my face.

502
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,744
You should've done that
to Hong Ji-seon too!

503
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,604
Excuse me, are you Shim Do-young?

504
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,273
You came earlier than I expected, Ji-eun.

505
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,150
Have a seat.

506
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,239
I have to ask...

507
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,074
Do you know me?

508
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,619
You're Pyo Ji-eun.
You work at AUDREY, a luxury brand agency.

509
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,120
You're the head of PR.

510
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,998
Plus,

511
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,877
you got dumped by your boyfriend recently.

512
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,879
That's all I know.

513
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,340
Did I hit a nerve?

514
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,681
I searched it out of curiosity
but didn't take or put anything in.

515
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,558
Ji-eun, won't you eat?

516
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,562
Listen, we just met.
Why do you keep calling my name?

517
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:59,440
Women usually like it
when a younger guy like me does that.

518
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,900
You're different, Ji-eun.

519
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,364
I don't have time to joke around with you.

520
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,616
How do I pay you back?
How much do you want?

521
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,493
I don't want anything.

522
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,328
I just wanted to return it to you.

523
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,622
Ji-eun.

524
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,292
But at least I deserve a steak, right?

525
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,836
I saw a driver's license
in your wallet too.

526
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,755
Thanks for the lunch.

527
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,719
Thank you.

528
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,722
Okay...

529
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,848
Oh my gosh.

530
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,558
-Hold on a sec.
-What are you doing?

531
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,852
I thought
you should know my number, Ji-eun.

532
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,230
It'd be a shame if you wanted to call me
but didn't have a way to do it.

533
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,693
Bye, Ji-eun.

534
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,295
Out!

535
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,673
Match them.

536
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,051
Show me.

537
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,887
Come on...

538
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:13,890
Jeez...

539
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,435
This belt won't do.

540
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,605
Replace it with the velvet one
and the white bag.

541
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,113
Excuse me, Ms. Hong.

542
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,784
This belt is part of a two-piece set,
so it's hard to take it out.

543
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,369
Can't we keep them together?

544
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,834
Ms. Pyo, do you really think they match?

545
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,963
You can hardly see the waistline!

546
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:49,926
Even though I don't even like the buckle,
I tried to be nice. Are you serious?

547
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,432
Just do as I say.

548
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,310
Understood.

549
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,269
Out!

550
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,484
Ms. Hong,
these have to be in the pictorial.

551
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,568
Please.

552
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,947
Ms. Oh has told me
a million times already.

553
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,742
And I've spoken with JD's company.
So no worries.

554
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,415
She obeys me.

555
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,128
I will dress her and you just watch.

556
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,716
I'm here!

557
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,218
-Good afternoon.
-Wow!

558
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,219
Look at you!

559
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,638
-Pretty!
-Hello.

560
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,515
What's with your hair color?

561
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,727
-Should we start the shoot?
-Pink angel.

562
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,729
I'm coming for you.

563
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,440
All right.

564
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,491
How's the concept? Do you like it?

565
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,662
All these pretty things,
including the bags,

566
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,373
have been flown in, especially for you.

567
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,252
They're all just waiting in line
to be worn by you,

568
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,588
before anyone else.

569
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,882
-My gum.
-Here.

570
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,969
-Water.
-Sure.

571
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,679
Here you are...

572
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,604
The cover shoot, right?

573
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:30,318
Of course.
Along with the 14 pages inside, too.

574
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,696
Ms. Hong, I can't decide like this.
I want to see for myself.

575
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,116
Sure.

576
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,952
You should check them out
before putting them on.

577
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,164
What are you waiting for?
You're not on vacation.

578
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,791
Go get the outfits ready.

579
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,542
I'll go.

580
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,005
Will you?

581
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,009
Okay, this one,

582
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,013
and to spice things up,

583
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,225
this one too. What do you think?

584
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:06,229
Nothing less than a fashionista.

585
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,357
I can't stand hearing
my stylist is my hater.

586
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,944
Hey, JD.

587
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,029
Ta-da!

588
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,155
How about this?

589
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,991
That looks boring. Take them out.

590
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,789
But, JD,

591
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,834
I think you should keep the outfits as is.

592
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,628
If you don't like matching these,

593
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,046
right, this one.

594
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,005
Like this.

595
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,134
Who's the editor?

596
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,305
As long as it's in line with the concept,
I pick what I want to wear, right?

597
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,474
"JD participated in the styling."

598
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,268
Sounds like a good title, right?

599
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,477
Well...

600
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,816
Is there a problem?
If so, we can postpone the shoot.

601
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,192
No, not at all.

602
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,735
We can do that.

603
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,529
Please proceed.

604
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,491
Ms. Hong, take a break.
Just help me change the outfits later.

605
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,577
Okay.

606
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,668
No, be quiet!

607
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,469
Hello, JD.

608
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,305
God, she's insane.

609
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,098
Who is she?

610
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,603
My name is Pyo Ji-eun from the agency
sponsoring the pictorial today.

611
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,271
I don't talk to agency staff.

612
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,190
-You can talk to me.
-Wait, please.

613
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,276
This pictorial is
really important to us too.

614
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,945
As agreed, you have to wear those outfits.

615
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,991
Ms. Pyo, don't do this.
Talk to me instead.

616
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,451
Ms. Hong, do you know her?

617
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,621
Well, yes...

618
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,748
She's from our sponsor agency.

619
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,210
I can't go back to the office

620
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,754
unless I see you take the photos
in these outfits.

621
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,172
Ms. Hong, you know it too.

622
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,841
What are you talking about? Enough!

623
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,718
We can discuss this outside.

624
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,178
No, wait, please!

625
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,804
This is what was agreed upon!

626
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,265
You can't just pick
whatever you feel like!

627
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,517
Oh God, what's wrong with you? Get out!

628
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,394
I'm not doing this!

629
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,611
<i>You're not allowed on site
until the shoot is over.</i>

630
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,446
<i>She wants you out of her sight,</i>

631
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,366
<i>or she won't do the shoot.
So wait outside.</i>

632
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,667
{\an8}JI WOO-MIN
CALLING

633
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,219
Hey, I'm...

634
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,263
<i>Ji-eun, is your grandmother with you?</i>

635
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,598
Why do you ask that?

636
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,891
<i>She's disappeared.</i>

00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,687

so your dad called me.</i>

DRY CLEANER'S

639
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,753
Dad, where's Grandma?

640
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,464
She must've left the neighborhood.
We can't find her.

641
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,342
What about Auntie's?

642
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,593
She wasn't there, either.

643
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,013
Where on earth could she have gone?

644
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,101
What do we do?

645
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,437
Is there anywhere else she would go?

646
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,354
I'm not sure.

647
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,444
{\an8}MS. OH
CALLING

648
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,783
Answer it.

649
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,287
<i>Pyo Ji-eun.</i>

650
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,830
Are you insane?

651
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,832
Is this how you do your job?

652
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,086
You got kicked out of the studio,
and then went for a drive or something?

653
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,796
I'm sorry but now...

654
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,507
<i>Do you know how many top celebrities
Hong Ji-seon handles?</i>

655
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,886
Do you know how much
these items you're responsible for cost?

656
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,599
Do you not know
how much this python clutch costs?

657
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,810
If anything goes missing,
will you pay for it?

658
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,687
<i>Can you even afford it?</i>

659
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,900
<i>These are supposed to be flown
to Singapore tomorrow morning!</i>

660
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,568
Go give them back now!

661
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,410
Ji-eun, I know you're worried,
but just go back to work.

662
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,372
I'll make sure to find her with your dad.

663
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,541
We've made a police report,
so it should be fine.

664
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,043
He's right, Ji-eun.

665
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,587
Woo-min's been searching around with me.

666
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,339
I bet she didn't go too far.

667
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,550
I was so surprised and made you two worry.

668
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,760
But...

669
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,851
Sir, I think I know where she went.

670
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,813
She could return home,
so you'd better wait there for her.

671
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,399
-Where?
-Hold on.

672
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,110
You think you know where she is?

673
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,569
Yes, I'll call you.

674
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,238
See you later.

675
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,438
You must've been frightened.

676
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,442
You were afraid
you lost something important to you

677
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,404
and ran all the way here.

678
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,657
This precious thing was right here.

679
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:36,911
Ma'am.

680
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,788
Ji-eun was worried.

681
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,707
And her father, too.

682
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,461
Let's go home now,

683
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,588
shall we?

684
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,786
How can we do business with AUDREY?

685
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,082
Limited pieces like these
are about punctuality.

686
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,417
How can we trust an agency like this?

687
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,128
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,131
This will be reported directly
to the superiors.

689
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,760
Everything looks good.

690
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,763
Please give us another chance.

691
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,932
Nothing like this will happen again.

692
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,642
I'm really sorry.

693
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,318
<i>Your dad was in a panic,</i>

694
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,903
<i>but your grandmother's fine.</i>

695
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,863
What a relief.

696
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,408
Everything went well?

697
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,742
<i>Yes, just barely.</i>

698
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,454
What would I have done today without you?

699
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,298
Woo-min.

700
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,468
Thank you.

701
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,224
-Ji-eun!
-Ji-eun!

702
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,395
Sorry, I'll call you back.

703
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,539
Where are you headed? I'll drive you.

704
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,542
Is it because you stayed awhile in the US?

705
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,377
I'll get you home.

706
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,921
We broke up. Why are you doing this?

707
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,887
Nam-jin, you were right.
We're not compatible.

708
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,890
I didn't know
you were still thinking about that.

709
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,266
Then...

710
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,478
I'll take that
as your lingering feelings for me?

711
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,813
No, I just can't stand running into you

712
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,524
under the worst circumstances. I hate it.

713
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,027
Go and date a woman who gets you.

714
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,781
I'll date a nice man who understands me.

715
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,343
{\an8}JI-EUN

716
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,942
Grandma was already asleep
when I got there.

717
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,361
I just left
after being told off by my dad.

718
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,322
You deserved it.

719
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,617
You didn't return
your grandmother's precious scarf

720
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,869
<i>and went around wearing it.</i>

721
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:08,747
Right.

722
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,000
Your grandmother was adorable.

723
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,503
She still loves your grandfather.

724
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,213
Seems like it.

725
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,967
I'm at an izakaya. You want to come?

726
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,430
No, I think I'll drink alone today.

727
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,306
I've been embarrassed all day.

728
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,058
Is that so?

729
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,727
All right, then.

730
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,480
Woo-min.

731
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,399
Yeah?

732
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,446
You really don't remember that scarf?

733
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,906
What do you mean?

734
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,993
Don't you still have the tie

735
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,454
with the same pattern as that scarf?

736
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,291
<i>From when we were together.</i>

737
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,834
It was our first anniversary,

738
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,462
and we took a picture,

739
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,589
wearing the matching tie and scarf.

740
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,469
<i>You were so cheesy about
taking pictures on every anniversary.</i>

741
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,180
That scarf...

742
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,142
Wasn't it a proposal gift
from your grandfather to your grandmother?

743
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,811
The original scarf was worn and ripped,

744
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,354
so I gave her mine

745
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,231
after we broke up.

746
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,568
<i>I thought you'd notice.</i>

747
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,616
You're no fun.

748
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,119
Whatever, you were always bad
at noticing details.

749
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,040
I just wanted to let you know.

750
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,375
I wasn't picking on you.

751
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,545
All right.

752
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,465
Gosh...

753
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,010
Me too, all right.

754
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:09,451
{\an8}PYO JI-EUN, JI WOO-MIN
FIRST ANNIVERSARY

755
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,969
What are you smiling for?

756
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,472
I heard you found Ji-eun's grandmother.

757
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,516
How did you know?

758
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,018
Joseph and Ji-eun text everything.

759
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,857
I called her, but she didn't pick up.
Have you talked to her?

760
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,650
She's drinking alone.

761
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,152
But you know where she's drinking.

762
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,320
Shall we go join her?

763
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,906
No.

764
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,535
She had a rough day today.
I'm not sure if she's okay.

765
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,249
You seem to care a lot about her.

766
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,961
Me? No way.

767
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,922
You blew the chance I gave you.

768
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,135
Ma'am?

769
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,553
Ma'am.

770
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,222
Ma'am.

771
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,936
Ma'am, are you okay?

772
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,986
Looks like she passed out.

773
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,826
<i>The number you've called is unavailable.</i>

774
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,246
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

775
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,881
Let's not drink too much today.

776
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,924
Ma'am...

777
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:29,883
I'm so hungry.

778
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,969
-Going into work tomorrow?
-No.

779
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,096
Ma'am, please wake up.

780
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,058
Ji-eun! Pyo Ji-eun!

781
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,020
-Is she alone?
-Yes, sir. Do you know her?

782
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,689
She's had too much to drink.

783
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,816
Ji-eun, are you okay?

784
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,030
-Could you help me?
-Sure.

785
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,665
Take your hands off my Ji-eun.
