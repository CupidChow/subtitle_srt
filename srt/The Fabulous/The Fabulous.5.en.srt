1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,437
The boundaries of fashion
already collapsed.

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,148
The power lies in the interaction,

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,192
because you can communicate
with anyone whenever, wherever now.

4
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,777
It all depends on the content.

5
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,572
The content will determine

6
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,033
how active the interaction
and conversation will be.

7
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,243
And that's why I think

8
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,496
we need to prepare
a variety of ways to communicate.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,374
Aren't my followers alone enough?

10
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,502
People recognize my value.
They love and enjoy it,

11
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,755
and help spread my influence.

12
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,764
An outfit created
at a small atelier in Nice, France

13
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,223
is flying off the shelf

14
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,684
through an online mall
to the young people of Tokyo.

15
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,686
And a new designer debuts

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,897
at the Paris Collection one day,

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,359
and influences people all across China
through Instagram the day after.

18
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,196
These clearly show
that the world has changed.

19
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:15,158
It depends on who you're following.

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,701
Go and follow Thierry.

21
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,953
Ooh la la. You got me.

22
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,750
You can interpret this kind of interaction

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,879
{\an8}as a collapse of all boundaries
of fashion, binding us into one universe.

24
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,343
{\an8}<i>I heard you tried
an amazing dish in Seoul.</i>

25
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,763
{\an8}Tteokbokki! <i>It was so shocking.</i>

26
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,806
{\an8}FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWINGS

27
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,890
{\an8}<i>Then, today...</i>

28
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,105
You understand
how exceptional it is for the HQ

29
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,233
to send people over to an agency
for a meeting, don't you?

30
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,986
This is the first time
in the history of Korean fashion.

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,238
Well, with Audrey,

32
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:57,200
we haven't worked together properly
except when they were our subcontractor,

33
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,745
so we wanted to check
if you're on the same level as us,

34
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,374
and to make a few things clear
with your agency as a client.

35
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,461
Our planning and strategies
are on a different level

36
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,130
from other agencies.

37
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,050
Audrey specializes in luxury brands.

38
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,594
I'm sure you've
already checked out our products.

39
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,181
Let's hear about your strategies.

40
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,142
I really like the scarf.

41
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,769
It feels soft, wraps around the neck well,

42
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,147
and goes well with any outfit.

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,983
We thought these should be
selling points for the product.

44
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,819
Ms. Oh, you're gonna have to
try harder than that.

45
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,487
That's far too simple.

46
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,534
Our final goal is for everyone of all ages

47
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,412
to wear our scarves this winter.

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,122
To be this year's must-have item.

49
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,331
What's your budget?

50
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,750
Minimum budget, for maximum results.

51
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,713
It's just one scarf, after all,
and we can't invest too much.

52
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,799
Performance and results
should be the focus

53
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,260
instead of the budget. Got it, Ji-eun?

54
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,055
Minimum budget. If that's the case,
influencers are the answer.

55
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,349
We'll shoot
with ten million followers and up

56
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,602
And seeding with the ones with 50K.

57
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:10,565
Influencer marketing is great for showing
an item matching with various outfits.

58
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,525
Influencers... that's just...

59
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,194
They have no basis.

60
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,446
They just take selfies
and put them online.

61
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,990
I hate how they're
different from our brand's identity.

62
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,369
Ms. Park, you're clearly not catching up
with current trends in the industry.

63
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,954
Without influencers,

64
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,749
how would you lead fashion trends
and make sales these days?

65
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,500
They have great influence.

66
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,587
They're perfect
for minimum budget and maximum effect.

67
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,297
If you're not so sure,

68
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,967
we can add a couple of celebrities
to the list to make it go viral.

69
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,970
But of course,
that's only possible with a bigger budget.

70
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,930
The celebrities...

71
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,806
How about JD?

72
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,101
Ms. Oh,

73
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,854
you're best friends
with JD's manager, Ms. Hong, right?

74
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,523
Oh, JD?

75
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,818
JD doesn't get sponsored
from most luxury brands.

76
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,614
But we need a top star like her
to save face with the global HQ.

77
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,992
Why else would we choose you
out of all the many agencies?

78
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,996
If you get JD, we'll raise the budget.

79
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:08,998
That's a promise.

80
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh gosh!

81
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,962
Did you hear
that assistant manager from the HQ?

82
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,007
"Out of all the many agencies"?
We're not a run-of-the-mill tailor shop!

83
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,010
People from HQ are
always like this, you know that.

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,722
I've been in the industry for ten years,
but I still can't get used to them.

85
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,391
Let's just call it off.

86
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,352
The product isn't great,
and the budget is tiny.

87
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,521
They messed up their season campaign.

88
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,481
Why do we have to clean up after that?

89
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,775
They're just taking orders
from the global HQ.

90
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,528
I'm just worried.

91
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,697
We have a small circle of influencers.

92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,282
That's not our forte.

93
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,950
What will you do with influencers?

94
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,493
Many of them are so weird.

95
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,705
Although we've focused
on celebrities in the past,

96
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,873
you know that
influencers are the trend now.

97
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,834
I've kept an updated list of influencers

98
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,336
with marketing potential
while staying in touch.

99
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,380
Let's show them

100
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,216
how well we can do it with a tiny budget.

101
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,844
Let's show them what we've got.

102
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,935
INTERMEDIATE COURT

103
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,449
Waikiki Beach has
the best waves for surfing.

104
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,243
When I ride those waves,

105
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,120
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

106
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,289
Like I could just die and have no regrets.

107
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,583
That's why I'm going there right now.

108
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,501
Not running away from Ji-eun?

109
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,919
Put on some upbeat music.

110
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,089
A song about the ocean,
like Hawaiian music, maybe?

111
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,051
Ever since you got dumped by Ji-eun,
you've been acting weird.

112
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,220
<i>Let's hurry and go</i>

113
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,141
<i>Yayayaya, to the sea</i>

114
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:57,565
<i>To throw all my woes into the sea</i>

115
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,781
That schmuck.

116
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,076
You always pretend
you're okay when you're not.

117
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,786
Can't fool me.

118
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,360
My schmuck's all grown up now.

119
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,446
You're not talking nonsense
about Hawaii this time.

120
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,324
You're not running away
but keeping yourself busy like this.

121
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,284
Why would I run away?

122
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,703
I came here
thinking you'd be crying again.

123
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,206
Are you disappointed
because I'm staying too strong?

124
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,375
No, I'm proud of you.

125
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,632
I didn't know Ji-eun's heart
already turned to that guy.

126
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,593
Seon-ho, you see,

127
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,556
it's like bouncing a ball
against the wall.

128
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,601
If I hit the ball hard,

129
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,521
it comes back at you.

130
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,691
If I don't hit it hard,

131
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,278
it retreats and doesn't come back.

132
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,281
It's heartbreaking. But at the same time,

133
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,827
I love it.

134
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,496
Are you a pervert?

135
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,626
I've never done
something with all my might.

136
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,879
Hitting a ball like that

137
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,380
gives you any chance to win?

138
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,550
It's a losing battle for now,

139
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,428
but I'll try until I win.

140
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,432
Now, let's go to Hapjeong for udon.

141
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,142
I'm so hungry.

142
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,195
Hey.

143
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,113
Nam-jin, why are you outside?

144
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,364
Couldn't wait to see you.

145
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:12,992
Let's go inside.

146
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,541
Trends in male fashion change each season,

147
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,920
but most men prefer clothes
with just one color and tone,

148
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,963
and simpler designs.

149
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,549
So men's clothing is all about details.

150
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,801
I'll love
whatever you choose for me, Ji-eun.

151
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,805
You know, it's hard to pick clothes
for people like you.

152
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,517
Is it?

153
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,268
Want something else?

154
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,062
Something else? Like what?

155
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,108
Here are the shoes that Mr. Lee ordered.

156
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,953
I'm not sure about my choice.

157
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,121
They're from Manolo Blahnik.

158
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,499
I saw you were in awe of them before.

159
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,669
It was a special order from Mr. Lee,

160
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,338
so our buying team
went to New York for these.

161
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,550
They're a limited edition
that aren't sold in Korea.

162
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,176
Try them on.

163
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,187
They look perfect on you, Ji-eun.

164
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,190
You're not supposed to give
your girlfriend shoes as a present.

165
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,526
I might put these shoes on and run away.

166
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,070
I want you to put them on and run to me.

167
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,417
JI-EUN

168
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,838
JI WOO-MIN

169
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,959
<i>You got more Instagram followers.
You're almost an influencer.</i>

170
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,380
Honey, don't provoke me.
You'll ruin my makeup.

171
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,800
I think starting over
with that guy Nam-jin made you popular.

172
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,011
<i>Joseph, just tell me what you want.
I have to go to work.</i>

173
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,224
-When will you post the pics on Instagram?
-What pictures?

174
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,227
<i>Didn't the multishop buying team
go to New York for your shoes?</i>

175
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,479
Esther read the headlines
in Cheongdam Daily.

176
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,483
Am I the Cinderella in today's gossip?

177
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,652
<i>You know I'm a curious cat, don't you?</i>

178
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,406
Ppyoji, wear those
for my mom's birthday party today. Okay?

179
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,283
I can't find anything
to match them with, so not today.

180
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,619
And these aren't
for a common-wage slave like me.

181
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,915
Flagship stores and department stores are
everywhere in Cheongdam-dong and Gangnam.

182
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,250
Swipe that card.

183
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,731
LET'S MEET SOME TIME

184
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,363
This person wants to see me.

185
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,408
Looks like a mega influencer,

186
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,826
with two million followers.

187
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,496
-Should I see her?
-Of course.

188
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,208
Look at this, too.

189
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,546
SELLING A T-SHIRT SIGNED BY THE FAMOUS
DESIGNER JOSEPH HIMSELF!

190
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,548
What? Five thousand won?

191
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,347
When will I get to feature
a shoot like this?

192
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,475
What are you doing here?

193
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,976
You're not supposed to be here.

194
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,979
Come on, as if we've never met.
I came to see you.

195
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,315
I got paid.

196
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,108
I'm here to pay you the money

197
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,401
for the profile shoot.

198
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,111
That was long ago.

199
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,322
I'm fine with it.

200
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,366
Let's just say
I helped out an aspiring model.

201
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,286
Really? Then how about
I buy you <i>tteokbokki,</i>

202
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,579
with this extra money?

203
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,831
I'm hungry.

204
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,125
Let's go for some <i>tteokbokki,</i> please?

205
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,544
-Seriously.
-Come on, let's go!

206
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,928
When I went to the DDP
to see the Seoul Collection,

207
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:28,140
people took pictures of me,
saying I'm a total fashionista.

208
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,726
They'd post the pictures
on their Instagram, too.

209
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,561
That's when I realized it.

210
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,772
I'm a hip guy with strong potential!

211
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,110
But you failed all your auditions?

212
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,614
Image, body, personality,
and the face, I've got it all.

213
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,659
But I don't know how I ended up here.

214
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,371
Can you sponsor me?

215
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,413
Sponsor?

216
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,915
Excuse me.

217
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,875
-One Coolpis, please!
-Okay!

218
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,710
I'm taking a break from school.

219
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,964
Can I stay at your place?
Just for a month.

220
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm thinking about attending
a proper model academy.

221
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,552
To sponsor you, no.

222
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,557
To let you stay over,
we don't know each other well enough.

223
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,642
Come on, all the top stars start out

224
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,519
with their managers like this.

225
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,605
-Here's your Coolpis.
-Right.

226
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,232
Thank you.

227
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,076
Coolpis is perfect for <i>tteokbokki</i>, right?

228
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,918
You know this place has
a branch in Hannam-dong?

229
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,254
That's all thanks to me.

230
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,172
Two postings on my Instagram

231
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,257
made them trendy.

232
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,219
The Hannam-dong branch asked me to visit,
but I'm just too busy now.

233
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,721
I know.

234
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,807
You have such a great eye

235
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
and review-writing skills.

236
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,769
You really have an insight as an agent.

237
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,939
The point of influencer marketing

238
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,442
is sharing experiences, not information.

239
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,945
No wonder you have
such a strong fan base, Xena.

240
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,324
My followers are loyal
compared to other influencers.

241
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,077
They always visit
the trendy spots and restaurants.

242
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,415
I can't wear just anything,
from clothes to makeup.

243
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,002
Because they always do everything I say.

244
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,170
Of course.

245
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,507
Eight hundred thousand followers
see every picture and review from you,

246
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,217
and open up their hearts, right?

247
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,428
You communicate so well with them, too.

248
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,431
I've been so busy lately
that I lost some weight,

249
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,808
and then there were
nasty comments about me

250
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,269
not being a plus size anymore.
Have you seen those?

251
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,982
But your body positivity movement has had
a huge impact, not only on young women

252
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,319
but also on women in their 40s and 50s.

253
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,197
I love your message
about loving yourself the way you are.

254
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,617
I'm a loyal subscriber
to your YouTube channel <i>SeventyLookBook</i>.

255
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,869
I appreciate the likes
and the subscribers.

256
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,165
Well...

257
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,001
You received
the other products as well, right?

258
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,421
I thought it'd be better
to mix and match items

259
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,215
from the same brand,

260
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,258
so I sent you different kinds of items.

261
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,594
You're good.

262
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,139
Wanna show the HQ
how you kill two birds with one stone?

263
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,019
We know you're so great at styling,

264
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,021
so we'll leave it up to you.

265
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,984
You're aware it's for two posts, right?
One for styling, and one for review.

266
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,028
If there's anything else you need,
please DM me anytime.

267
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,989
Well, I do have one favor.

268
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,240
Sure, what is it?

269
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,744
Those shoes are not fake, are they?

270
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,208
Sorry?

271
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,270
{\an8}#XENA'S_EVERYDAY_LIFE

272
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,981
<i>-See you soon!</i>
-Gosh.

273
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,524
<i>What does she do?</i>

274
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,985
I told you. She's an influencer.

275
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,445
That's her job?

276
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,531
They say it's the birth of a new race.

277
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,117
She's got two more Lamborghinis
in different colors.

278
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,912
Lending her the shoes
you got from your boyfriend

279
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,122
is such a tough duty.

280
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,249
Don't even try to imagine me

281
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,918
taking this video for her Instagram story.

282
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,426
See you soon!

283
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,261
Okay.

284
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,850
Hey, Ye Seon-ho,
were you imagining it just now?

285
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,936
-No, I wasn't
-You were, weren't you? Get back here!

286
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,188
This is so embarrassing!

287
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,315
-Ms. Oh.
-Yeah?

288
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,069
You want to put those scarves on JD,

289
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,613
and you're only buying me champagne?

290
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,909
Vintage champagne.

291
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,872
And what about this caviar?
This is tip-top stuff.

292
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,336
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

293
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:17,930
You know Thierry Henry
completely fell Audrey, right?

294
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,184
It's all thanks to my big mouth.

295
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,063
The campaign and escort were so excellent

296
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,273
that he even sent us

297
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,319
a thank-you email about it.

298
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,487
Anyway!

299
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,116
Tell him to launch Earlaine in Korea,

300
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,159
and become their agency.

301
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,538
What's the point of a thank-you email?

302
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,790
He asked for something in the email.

303
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,504
He was looking for someone to be
their international ambassador for Asia.

304
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,758
What? "International ambassador"?

305
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,220
Oh my gosh.

306
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,556
Oh my, I must be drunk, Ms. Hong.

307
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,521
Look, she just has to post
an Instagram picture like this, right?

308
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,022
No need to pay us.

309
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,443
Just make JD the international ambassador.

310
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,366
How can we not pay you?
That's how you earn a living.

311
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,827
One airport outfit will do.

312
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,539
Then I'll hassle the HQ

313
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,500
so that they can pay you big.

314
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,171
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

315
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,173
-You're...
-Yeah?

316
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,175
...such a capable woman!

317
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,720
You were born to run an agency!

318
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,848
Should we order another caviar?

319
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,766
-Okay. Deal!
-Deal!

320
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,436
Excuse me!
Another round of caviar, please!

321
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,028
Do you think I'm a joke?

322
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,199
Did you think I'd be happy
if you asked me to start over?

323
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,784
<i>Let's just stop being friends.</i>

324
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,793
Thank you.

325
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,086
Madame Jang.

326
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,340
Wow, what did you get me?

327
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,092
Are these bath bombs?

328
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,095
I heard you do bubble baths every day.

329
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,473
-Oh my.
-Mom and Dad are like newlyweds.

330
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,433
A different scent every day, Madame Jang.

331
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,393
Happy birthday.

332
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,572
What took you so long?

333
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,157
Happy birthday, Madame Jang.

334
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,034
Thank you, Woo-min.

335
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,494
Come, sit.

336
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,495
-Sure.
-Over there.

337
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,538
Everyone must be hungry.

338
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,749
Oh gosh. So hungry.

339
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,918
Time to bring out the food.

340
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,212
Could you please prepare my orders?

341
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,630
Yes, ma'am.

342
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,509
I prepared a feast for everyone,
like a mother feeding her children.

343
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,551
It'll surprise you.

344
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,935
The vibe has changed a bit, hasn't it?

345
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,898
Something happened
between you two, Ji-eun and Woo-min?

346
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,610
Some sort of love affair, maybe?

347
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,279
Mom, please.

348
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,197
Those two are acting kind of weird.

349
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,952
I told her we should stop
being friends and go out.

350
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,370
And she turned me down.

351
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,123
She's already with someone else.

352
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,541
They haven't met since then.

353
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,625
Oh my, bosh!

354
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,420
Woo-min.

355
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,006
A word?

356
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,474
What a drama!

357
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,401
Why did you have to let Madame Jang know?

358
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,069
You could've just smiled.

359
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,071
How could I smile?

360
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,326
The girl who rejected me
and ended our friendship

361
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,328
is across from me.

362
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,331
I was caught off guard that day...

363
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,250
It was just too sudden.

364
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,087
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,715
I take back what I said about us

366
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,967
stop being friends.

367
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,476
Your rejection...

368
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,314
it hurt a lot.

369
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,860
Were we not supposed to date at all?

370
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,112
Or even stay as friends?

371
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,200
I couldn't organize
my thoughts or feelings.

372
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,453
I couldn't stay cool.

373
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,622
You'll sort it out,

374
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,582
like you always have.

375
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,169
You won't regret it?

376
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,269
Then...

377
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:18,980
Let's shake hands.

378
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,925
I'm leaving.

379
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,490
Woo-min!

380
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,577
-Are you heading out?
-Yeah.

381
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,373
I'm really not comfortable
living with another guy.

382
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,125
Come on, I'm loving it.

383
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,669
I'm going to search
modeling academies today.

384
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,296
All right, get a good one.

385
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,465
I'm off.

386
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,551
I'll clean up before I head out!

387
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:31,928
Good luck!

388
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,515
Do you know this purse?

389
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,684
Isn't this the one
the HQ lady was carrying?

390
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,061
That's right. Isn't it scary?

391
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,397
Acting like if she owns this sample.

392
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,901
When I saw it, I was in shock.
I wondered how she could afford this.

393
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,570
We already sent the purse
JD's wearing to the airport.

394
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,155
Why did you get another sample?

395
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,324
This was the only remaining spare.

396
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,911
You know she's unpredictable.

397
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,329
I kept one just in case.

398
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,372
If she ever wants to see
the purse anytime,

399
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:04,127
we have to break into department stores
or storage to get it.

400
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,712
We need to be fully prepared.

401
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,464
I'll keep it.

402
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,549
If something happens,

403
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,552
I should be the first one on the scene.

404
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,763
Maybe influencers are
better than celebrities.

405
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,932
They give just as much as they take.

406
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,433
Hold on.

407
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,937
Look at this.

408
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,524
It would've been so much better
if she took a picture of her smiling.

409
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,525
IT GOES WELL WITH ANYTHING

410
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,110
I'm just thankful for the post.
She's JD, after all.

411
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,488
She's not posting them for free.

412
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,241
Now that JD uploaded
her pictures, let's keep going.

413
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,452
I'm impressed
with Xena's recent post, though.

414
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,704
It really had an impact.

415
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,414
When it goes viral,

416
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,376
the HQ wants to do
a media mix with the review.

417
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,671
Tell them
they need to pay extra for reviews.

418
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,136
SHIM DO-YOUNG

419
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,766
The number you called is unavailable.

420
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,812
What's this?

421
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,357
Am I in a love triangle?

422
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,652
Or is she a two-timer?

423
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,869
Can you see I'm a mega influencer?

424
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,122
1,73 million, on Instagram,

425
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,333
YouTube subscribers, 490k,
That's 2,2 million in total.

426
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,210
Doesn't it overlap?

427
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,298
So you want to introduce
our products to all those followers

428
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,301
and arrange a group purchase.
Did I get that right?

429
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,761
You know, your pop-up shop went so well.

430
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,722
Don't you think

431
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,224
it's time for you
to use that popularity for sales?

432
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,811
The pop-up shop was designed
to promote Mr. Joseph's identity,

433
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,229
not to boost sales.

434
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,523
I think you misunderstood our brand...

435
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,566
Hey.

436
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,612
Haven't you seen Thierry Henry
and Ms. Ahn Nam-hee's Instagram live?

437
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,781
Interaction!
Communication through content!

438
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,158
That's power!

439
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,954
Right, that live stream has been
a hot topic in the industry lately.

440
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,498
I used to work as a merchandiser.

441
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,711
I quit because I couldn't force myself
to sell things I didn't like.

442
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:15,175
I only choose and sell
hip, unique, and trendy stuff.

443
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,219
You know that reputation
is everything to an influencer, right?

444
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,972
And the reputation alone
made me a mega influencer.

445
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,976
You are so lucky
that you were chosen by me.

446
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:31,191
But we've never done
influencer marketing before.

447
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,651
Well, what do you want?

448
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,612
I could even sell chewed-up gum.

449
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,073
Chewed-up gum? That's gross...

450
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,034
I need a code
for a group purchase live broadcast.

451
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,577
The margin will be 30%.

452
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,955
I've even done three rounds
for a single product on a live stream.

453
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,210
Many brand owners call to meet me.

454
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,962
But I only work with brands I like,

455
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,131
I'm a megastar.

456
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,807
What's up with all these randos?

457
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,266
I almost said okay to that.

458
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,769
She was so persuasive,
like a voice phishing scammer.

459
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,146
She's even done three rounds
on a group purchase.

460
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,523
I tried to stay firm too.

461
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,858
We both tried hard, huh?

462
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,818
We really did.

463
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,737
Throw it on me too.

464
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,155
This is luxury bay salt.

465
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,366
Is it expensive? Lay it on me.

466
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,702
More.

467
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,459
What time is it?

468
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,884
Hello, Ms. Park, Ms. Lee.

469
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,722
Wait, Ji-eun,

470
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,599
are you picking us up in this car?

471
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,685
Ms. Lee, get in.
Ms. Park, the car behind me!

472
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,853
Behind... Oh God!

473
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,358
-Let's go.
-Please, go ahead.

474
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,276
Oh my.

475
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,153
Oh gosh, the door...

476
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,784
Ji-eun,

477
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,871
is this how you normally do
business at Audrey?

478
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,667
Who would prepare
a car like this for a pick-up?

479
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,254
For maximum results with a minimal budget,
we don't have a choice, Ms. Lee.

480
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,632
The agency must follow
instructions from the HQ.

481
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,136
Ms. Park didn't like
what the influencers prepared for today.

482
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,847
The scarves and the mix-and-match
look totally unbalanced.

483
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,099
Shooting in the streets
makes us look cheap...

484
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,058
A U-turn.

485
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,195
You see,

486
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:45,116
I had no idea
someone like you worked at Audrey.

487
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,952
I don't work at Audrey.

488
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,829
I'm the photographer today.

489
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,872
Photographer?

490
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,665
Audrey, that's unacceptable.

491
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,335
How rude to ask
a chief photographer to do this.

492
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,129
No, I'm a friend of Ji-eun's.
She asked me as a favor.

493
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,633
And I'm not
a chief photographer, so it's fine.

494
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,345
Photography is about a good sense,
not about experience.

495
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,346
Please do your best.

496
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,263
Sure.

497
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,058
I should have gotten you
a coffee or something.

498
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,393
You've gone
to all this trouble to drive me.

499
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,187
How inconsiderate I am.

500
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,731
Has Ji-eun ever mentioned me?
She and I are very close.

501
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,112
Ji-eun, I love the concept today.

502
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,907
The scarf and mixed-and-match
are well-balanced.

503
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,117
And it's so nice we're doing the shoot

504
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,911
at such a pretty avenue like this.

505
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:34,165
Mr. Photographer, this is the kind
of vibe that's trendy these days, right?

506
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,960
I'll do my best, Ms. Park.

507
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,378
Thank you, Ji-eun.

508
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,129
Should we get started?

509
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,757
-Ms. Lee.
-Yes?

510
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,133
-Go get some coffee.
-Okay.

511
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,553
I'm in a great mood today.

512
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,762
Thank you.

513
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,680
Hey, Ji-eun,

514
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,307
go get some coffee for everybody.

515
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,934
-Yes, Ms. Park.
-Ms. Lee.

516
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,436
I asked you to do it, didn't I?

517
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,564
Can't you see Ms. Pyo is busy?

518
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,817
Right. I'll go.

519
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,486
What was she thinking? I'm sorry.

520
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,572
Ji-eun.

521
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,407
So lovely here. The sunlight's great.

522
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,741
It really is.

523
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,037
You and that photographer
are friends, right?

524
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,831
And nothing more?

525
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,626
Yes, just friends from college.

526
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,878
Just friends.

527
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,629
It's such a nice day today.

528
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,092
Ji-eun, can you touch up
the model's scarf?

529
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,177
Right, the scarf.

530
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,560
The shoot could've been tough
with the HQ people around,

531
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,520
but you're making things easier.

532
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,438
Thank you.

533
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,565
I never thought you'd say that.

534
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,318
Don't take it.

535
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,077
-Welcome.
-Hello.

536
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,537
Huh?

537
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,748
Hello, Ms. Hong. What can I do for you?

538
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,166
Oh...

539
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,169
Can I help you?

540
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,754
Is it sold out?

541
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,590
Sorry? What are you talking about?

542
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,677
The purse from the pictures on Instagram.
But I don't see it here.

543
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,889
You mean the purse from the pop-up shop?

544
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,474
Well, it's not for sale...

545
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,850
I'm not here to buy it.

546
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,770
I'm Hong Ji-seon.

547
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,149
Ms. Hong, it's not a product for sale,
but a work of art.

548
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,027
The sponsorship won't be available.
I hope you understand.

549
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,748
<i>They said it isn't available
even for sponsorship.</i>

550
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:42,043
I know it's out there,
so why can't I have it?

551
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,004
Things like this happen sometimes.

552
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,966
Joseph isn't a famous designer,

553
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,968
so I shouldn't have to go and beg him.

554
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:56,140
My world-class star, JD, has
no reason to carry a purse like that.

555
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,810
They're way below your level.

556
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,812
It means I'm on the same level as you?

557
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,271
Whatever.

558
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,316
Cancel everything you scheduled.
I'm not in the mood.

559
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,528
JD, then we'll have to pay
the penalty fee.

560
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,154
Penalty fee? Pay it.

561
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:11,739
I'll do it myself.

562
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,535
After paying double or triple the penalty,
I'll no longer use that brand.

563
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,203
That'll do.

564
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,663
I've made myself very clear.

565
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,790
JD, instead of that purse...

566
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,417
I said I've made myself clear.

567
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:25,878
What do we do?

568
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,381
Since she already did the Instagram post,

569
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,093
I'll tell them to drop the airport OOTD.

570
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,054
No photoshoot for JD.

571
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,724
JD wants to cancel everything.

572
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,810
What you brought me today
is not on my level.

573
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,453
Why are you smiling like that?

574
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,248
Nothing. Just something
that happened at work.

575
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,460
Looking at your pretty smile,
it must've been something nice.

576
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,128
It's not that.

577
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,857
Hello, Mr. Lee. I came early.

578
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,901
Hello, Ms. Ahn.

579
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,238
I don't know if you remember me,
but I'm Pyo Ji-eun from Audrey.

580
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,323
I remember.

581
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,576
We've met several times, haven't we?

582
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,661
It's really an honor, Ms. Ahn.

583
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,499
I never would've thought
we'd be having dinner together like this.

584
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,292
You should've told me earlier.

585
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,630
She mentioned you're her role model.

586
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,632
So I asked you for dinner.

587
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,800
Thanks for your time.

588
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,054
You've invited me to such a lovely place.
The pleasure's all mine.

589
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,312
I went to a Paris fashion school
to become a designer.

590
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,899
But looking at my friends' work,
I got discouraged.

591
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,235
They were all people like Thierry Henry.

592
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,029
I have the eye for it,

593
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,406
but I was never satisfied with my work.

594
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,535
I know exactly what you mean, Ms. Ahn.

595
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,704
Every time I did a project in college,

596
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,707
I could see how far behind my peers I was.

597
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,293
My parents ran a tailor shop.

598
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:33,381
Even people from the countryside
would have Dad tailor their clothes.

599
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,634
Whenever I'd see
my peers' work and get home,

600
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,470
I'd just sit my dad down and cry, saying,

601
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,807
"Why wasn't I born
with the same talent as you, Dad?"

602
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,934
"Am I really your daughter?"

603
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,353
I just kept whining.

604
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,900
But I really love my job.

605
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,862
I'm proud of myself
for working in the fashion industry.

606
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,699
Life's most important necessities are
clothing, food, and shelter.

607
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,784
And clothing comes in first.

608
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,205
It means
it's that much more important to people.

609
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,415
So you're saying,

610
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,127
we get people
the most important thing in their lives?

611
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,045
Yes.

612
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,965
You two get along so well.

613
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,968
-Shall we toast?
-Sure.

614
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,445
I should give you a nice scarf,

615
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,864
but I couldn't
because I didn't expect to see you.

616
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,741
This is all I have.

617
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,744
You seemed a bit chilly.

618
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,204
No, the car will be here...

619
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,664
You can just have it.

620
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,375
This is a product
that Audrey is promoting right now.

621
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,501
I was wearing it,

622
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,004
thinking I could sell it better
from experience.

623
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,673
It's warm.

624
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,719
The car isn't here yet?

625
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,056
I had so much fun at tonight's dinner.

626
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,475
Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

627
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,936
It's here, I'll be going now.

628
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,104
It's truly been an honor, Ms. Ahn.
Thank you.

629
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,111
Have a good night.

630
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,143
REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE
THAT'S OUR PHILOSOPHY

631
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,271
Hey, Ji-eun.

632
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,440
Hey, Woo-min! I got one, too!

633
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,359
You did?

634
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,571
What? Did you think
you would suddenly become a rising star?

635
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,283
I expected it a little.

636
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,200
Gosh.

637
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,743
Wanna grab a beer?

638
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,789
You look drunk already.

639
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,835
I was so tired
and could've gone straight home,

640
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,629
but I came all the way here
for your magazine.

641
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,381
I'm such a loyal friend, right?

642
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,300
Get in!

643
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,385
I'll be loyal and get you home.

644
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,761
Hey, let's go for a beer.

645
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,139
-Get in!
-Beer.

646
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,056
Fine.

647
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,026
After all that talk about beer,
how disloyal.

648
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,911
No.

649
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:18,999
Not this one.

650
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,751
To the left!

651
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,794
-Left?
-Right.

652
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,462
-Hurry up.
-I found it!

653
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,799
-I got it!
-You did?

654
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,176
-Let me see!
-Found it!

655
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,888
-Let me down.
-No.

656
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,516
Come on, don't do that!

657
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,726
-Let me down, Woo-min!
-I don't wanna.

658
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,521
Okay, there.

659
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,797
Wait, Ms. Hong.

660
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,759
She's not wearing the purse
on the day of airport shooting?

661
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,803
How's that going to
make us look to the HQ?

662
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,764
You know how fickle celebrities are.

663
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,935
We can cancel things once in a while.
It's not just anybody, but JD.

664
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,937
Then what about a pictorial photoshoot?

665
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,481
Where's that money coming from?

666
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:27,026
Anyway, JD wants to do the photoshoot.

667
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,196
You shouldn't have arranged
the shoot in Bali.

668
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,491
If you insist,

669
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,243
I'll call the HQ
and tell them we're canceling.

670
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,244
Is that enough?

671
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,956
How could they possibly blame a celebrity
like her? They'll just kill us!

672
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,001
No loyalty, no trust.

673
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,506
Isn't this too much?
I'm so disappointed in you.

674
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,218
That's why I brought it here myself
instead of using a courier service!

675
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,303
Because of that champagne we shared!

676
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,596
What's going on?

677
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,264
It's JD again.

678
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,226
She'll shoot in Bali
but not the one at the airport.

679
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,102
What? Has she lost her mind?

680
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,648
We hyped up the mood,
making all the influencers post about it.

681
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,858
JD was supposed to do the airport shooting

682
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,861
so that we could complete
our brand strategy. But it's messed up?

683
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,405
What can we do? It's JD.

684
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,991
I can't believe this.

685
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,118
At least she'll do the pictorial.

686
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,540
I feel so lost.

687
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,252
This isn't easy for me, Ms. Oh.

688
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,712
Hi, Woo-min.

689
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,756
You left something in my car yesterday.

690
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,300
Don't you need it? It looks like a purse.

691
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,511
Yes, I did.

692
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,097
But not anymore.

693
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,933
I can drop by your office,
just in case you still do.

694
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,726
I'll be out of town for a commercial.

695
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,980
No, you must be busy.
You can give it to me tomorrow.

696
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,107
I really don't need it.

697
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,317
Are you sure?
All right, good luck with work.

698
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,283
Let's go, Woo-min.

699
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,996
-Wake me up when we get there.
-Okay!

700
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,722
Wait, here!

701
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,100
I bought you some coffee.

702
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,019
Thank you.

703
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,563
What's your name?

704
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,190
That's such a rude way of asking.

705
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,360
Good work today.

706
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,830
My name's Chae-young. Park Chae-young.

707
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,916
I'm Do-young! Shim Do-young!

708
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:57,760
Chae-young.

709
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,143
-Good luck!
-See you!

710
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,487
Excuse me...

711
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,573
What? Just tell me what you want.

712
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,450
What I want?

713
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:22,910
Do you like me?

714
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,537
I'm not interested in dating.

715
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,122
Bye.

716
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,249
I'm not done!

717
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,502
I'm busy.

718
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,419
Can I...

719
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,005
Can I follow you?

720
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:47,935
I'll DM you.

721
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,687
I'll answer if I want.

722
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,608
Nice! Got her Instagram.

723
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,277
Bye!

724
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,991
Sir, if you're not going to buy a copy,
you can only check the sample.

725
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,452
-Okay.
-No, I'm going to buy it.

726
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,580
It's just that
some pages of the sample ripped out.

727
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,875
But that doesn't mean
you can unwrap the others.

728
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,546
My daughter is a famous model
who's in lots of photoshoots,

729
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,549
so I buy five or six magazines a month.

730
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,802
But this month,
I can't find pictures of her anywhere.

731
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,804
Maybe she didn't do any.

732
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,557
Hey! My daughter's a successful model!

733
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,058
Mom, Dad.

734
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,685
Hey, Seon-ho.

735
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:30,602
Seon-ho.

736
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,688
Here,

737
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,150
this is my daughter.
Ye Seon-ho the supermodel.

738
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,037
Dad, after all your strong opposition
of me being a model,

739
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,330
you're buying magazines?

740
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:55,502
He's probably spent almost a million won
for the magazines with you in them.

741
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:00,090
He got kicked out of a bookstore
for looking at the magazines too long

742
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,302
because they thought
he was an old pervert.

743
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,596
Stop that.

744
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,226
I looked around a bigger store,

745
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,897
but it doesn't seem like
they have any with you in it.

746
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,151
Dad, I haven't been
doing photoshoots this month

747
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,862
except for that one magazine.

748
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,992
Modeling requires a perfect body,
and I've seen my best days.

749
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:30,996
Nonsense.

750
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,956
You're my daughter.

751
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,003
Do as many shoots as you want,
until you're 100 years old.

752
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,591
Dad will always be your fan,
Ye Seon-ho the supermodel.

753
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,178
Seon-ho, I'm your fan too.

754
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,888
You're the best, my daughter.

755
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:07,115
Joseph, Ms. Hong came
for the purse yesterday,

756
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,909
but I said no

757
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,286
since it wasn't for sale.

758
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,204
Good job.

759
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,792
But she's at the boutique now.

760
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,920
-I think you should see her.
-What?

761
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,219
Ms. Hong.

762
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,556
Joseph!

763
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,320
I can't control myself
when I'm emotional like this.

764
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,614
I think I've lost my mind,

765
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,449
day-drinking at your boutique.

766
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,619
No, it's fine.

767
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,205
Come here. Don't cry.

768
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,665
This way.

769
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,670
Oh, dear.

770
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,380
What happened, Ms. Hong?

771
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,882
No, I just...

772
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,759
I just thought of you.

773
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:12,347
Looking back at my life,

774
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,143
you were the only person
that ever took care of me with respect.

775
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,896
I'm stylist Hong Ji-seon.

776
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,106
You're not VIP.

777
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,941
Just wait here.

778
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,402
She's a guest, so please let her in.

779
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,072
So I'm here

780
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,867
to say thank you.

781
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,286
People...

782
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,373
they look up to me

783
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,295
as JD's, a superstar's famous stylist,

784
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,508
but, truthfully, my job requires
the greatest emotional labor ever.

785
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,930
I have all the fashionistas
that are close to me.

786
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,349
But me?

787
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,894
Busy buttering up to
those fickle-minded people.

788
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:05,108
When they're drunk and throw up at home,

789
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,986
I go run and get the mop.

790
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,613
Slay.

791
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,325
JD is going to Bali for a photoshoot

792
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,496
and she left me out.

793
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,830
Bosh!

794
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,415
But you're her stylist.

795
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,750
She's just being fickle.

796
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,668
I...

797
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,589
I've been working in fashion
since I was twenty-five.

798
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,925
And I'm still in this industry.

799
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,888
Not everyone can do that.

800
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,769
It's because I've stayed strong so far.

801
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,398
Joseph.

802
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,696
I really want to go to Bali.

803
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,450
Take the purse!

804
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,412
Thank you!

805
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,372
Let it out.

806
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,000
Thank you so much!

807
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,840
Hi, Ji-eun!

808
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,136
Huh? I told you
if you show up like this again,

809
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,887
I'd report you for stalking me.

810
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,514
Come on, you're scaring me.

811
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,598
No, you're scaring me.

812
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,059
Stop following me. I'm busy.

813
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,478
Oh, and I've got a boyfriend.

814
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,897
So everything between us is over.

815
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,984
I was going to say that first.

816
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,903
Ji-eun! Do you know Ji Woo-min?

817
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,495
Your boyfriend. It's not Woo-min, is it?

818
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,289
How do you know Woo-min?

819
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,875
I think he likes you,

820
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,629
so I'll stop sticking around you,
and become your cupid.

821
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,258
Wanna take a look?

822
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,894
PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK

823
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,883
I told you not to take
pictures of me. I have to focus.

824
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,052
That color is as red as blood.

825
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,804
I'm warning you.

826
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,685
Come on, Woo-min!

827
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,522
Get over here, seriously!

828
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,607
-Hey!
-Get back here!

829
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:25,684
Nam-jin bragged so much
about how pretty his girlfriend is.

830
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,352
It's nice to finally meet you.

831
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,270
Likewise.

832
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,480
Nam-jin is sweet and gentle, isn't he?

833
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,900
But that's why
he's the least popular among us.

834
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,736
Don't talk smack
about him in front of her.

835
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,363
Wrong. We're just jealous.

836
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,949
Nam-jin likes women who are career-driven.

837
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,534
You two make a great couple.

838
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,619
Thank you.

839
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,205
But do you think
you're gonna be okay, Ji-eun?

840
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,290
Marrying a chaebol?

841
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:49,833
What are you doing?

842
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,251
-Hey.
-Stop it.

843
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,171
He's a businessman, not from chaebol.

844
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,007
You can say he is.

845
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,508
He has the whole package.

846
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,845
Then she would be the only daughter-in-law
of a chaebol that's working.

847
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:07,267
You know, US President Biden's wife
still works as a school teacher.

848
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,310
Seriously?

849
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,103
MS. OH

850
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,855
Sorry, I have to take this.

851
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:12,898
Sure.

852
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,358
Yes, Ms. Oh?

853
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,818
<i>JD will do the airport shoot!</i>

854
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,738
Now?

855
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,823
The HQ is so happy to hear about this.

856
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,618
But I already told the press
to cancel. it's too late.

857
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,245
There's an idol who's flying
around the same time.

858
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,372
So reporters are already there.

859
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,001
Ms. Oh, do you have the purse

860
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,170
that Ms. Hong gave back in the morning?

861
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,924
We sent it over to Son Ye-jin,
the actress, like the HQ told us to.

862
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,259
<i>Don't you have one?</i>

863
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,302
What do we do?

864
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,304
There are no samples at the HQ.

865
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,932
No, I was just asking.

866
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,059
I'm heading to the airport right now.

867
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,561
Ji-eun, what are you doing?

868
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,523
I'm sorry.
Something's up at work. I have to go.

869
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,442
What happened? Let me give you a ride.

870
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,027
I can just go by myself.

871
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,571
Please explain it to your friends.
I'll call you later.

872
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,243
JI WOO-MIN

873
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,250
<i>The number you called is unavailable.
Please leave a message...</i>

874
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,879
Woo-min, where are you?
I need the purse now.

875
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,757
Can you come
and bring it to Incheon Airport?

876
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,467
Call me as soon as you get this.

877
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,114
-Yes, are you done?
-Good job today.

878
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,198
Thank you for today.

879
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,284
Wait, let me just take care of this.

880
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,506
Yeah, Ji-eun. I'm leaving now.

881
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,466
I'll drive as fast as I can.

882
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,185
Agency? Or HQ?

883
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,895
-Agency.
-Oh.

884
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,148
JD hasn't done one in a while.

885
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,734
You know how fickle she is.
Is she really coming?

886
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,446
Yes, she'll be here in 30 minutes.
Please take a lot of pictures, sir.

887
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,532
Even if the purse is upside down,
it'll sell out, so it's worth it.

888
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,659
-Good luck.
-Sure.

889
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,496
Yes, Ms. Hong.

890
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,540
Yes, where is she now?

891
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,168
I'm in Area 5.

892
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,463
The purse is on the way.
It'll be here around the same time.

893
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:42,881
Okay.

894
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,396
Come on!

895
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,028
-It's JD's car!
-She's here!

896
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,741
-It's JD!
-Over here!

897
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,451
Look here, JD!

898
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,287
-JD!
-Look here, please!

899
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,539
Over here, please!

900
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,334
-Look here!
-Over here!

901
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:32,055
Honey, this is all your fault.

902
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,556
I did my part.

903
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,229
Right, it's our fault.

904
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,442
I've heard of celebrities
refusing to wear a product,

905
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,779
but I've never heard of an agency
that didn't bring the product in time.

906
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:51,032
This has to be a first
in airport outfit history in Korea.

907
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,203
Good luck. I'll see you later.

908
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,506
<i>What's going on with you?</i>

909
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,841
I'm sorry.

910
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,301
<i>The HQ is going crazy!</i>

911
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,720
They're crazy over the moon!

912
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:17,809
Ms. Ahn uploaded pictures of her
wearing the scarf on her feed.

913
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,396
She even introduced the artist
that she collaborated with.

914
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,522
And it's everywhere!

915
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:27,485
<i>London HQ just called
to thank us for top-notch marketing.</i>

916
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,655
<i>I'm learning a lot from you, Ji-eun.</i>

917
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,491
<i>Love you, Ji-eun!</i>

918
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,542
Ji-eun.

919
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,754
I tried to step on it.

920
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:49,841
Sorry, I'm late.

921
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,558
We've always been like this.

922
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,396
You're always late.
The timing's always all wrong.

923
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,857
Nothing ever works out.

924
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,447
I'm tired of looking stupid all the time.

925
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:17,452
I'm tired of saying things I don't mean,
or pretending I'm okay or cool.

926
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,078
Seriously.

927
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,664
I want to stop all this.

928
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,374
Hey, that's too much.

929
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,627
I said I was sorry.

930
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,379
What are you even sorry for?

931
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,343
You do everything I ask,
you handle everything so well.

932
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,846
And you're trying so hard
to deal with all my stupidity.

933
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,435
You said we were just friends.

934
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,437
We're just friends!

935
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,396
Exactly!

936
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,192
That's why I want to be
your boyfriend again!

937
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,363
The timing's all wrong? I'm too late?

938
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,909
Watch me how I catch up.

939
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,580
I'm going to start
running at full speed now,

940
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,707
to you.
