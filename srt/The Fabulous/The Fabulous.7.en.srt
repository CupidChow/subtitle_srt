1
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,866
Look at them having fun.

2
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,909
As if they just started dating.

3
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,370
Being tired of acting like friends
and being cool,

4
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,914
they're doing whatever they wanted to do.

5
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,624
Bosh. How romantic.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,085
Technically, that's a second-hand love.

7
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,670
Hey, don't...

8
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,631
It's called upcycling.
It's a trend nowadays.

9
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,676
Guys, we should go on a trip.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,471
Just the four of us.
Sounds fun and exciting, right?

11
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,097
You already seem excited.

12
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,266
A trip? All of a sudden?

13
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,394
Let's have a barbecue, a campfire,
and look at the stars.

14
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,562
-Sounds good?
-Yeah.

15
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,814
We can set up a tent and lie down...

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,150
Camping? No, thank you.

17
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,779
I hate bugs, and I hate
not being able to take a shower.

18
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,322
Sleeping in the cold? Slay me.

19
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,407
Jjoseph, please!

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,617
Only if it's glamping.

21
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,787
Then, I'm in too.

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,206
Me too!

23
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,750
Gang-woo, do you even know
what this is about?

24
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,544
If Seon-ho says yes,
it's a yes from me, too.

25
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,007
I brought my bike.

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,635
A tandem bike?
Woo-min, let's go for a ride.

27
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,594
Hey, that's for us!

28
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,263
Nonsense.
It belongs to whoever gets on it first.

29
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,849
Hey, don't trip and fall!
Remember, safety first!

30
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,267
Hey, we call dibs!

31
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,187
Dating must be nice. So full of energy.

32
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,358
Bosh! What the hell? Who did that?

33
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,989
Wow!

34
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,997
I'm so sorry about that.

35
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,541
I was playing with my nephew.

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,505
Where did you get this?

37
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,508
Let me know, and I'll order you a new one.

38
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,137
Uncle!

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,721
I'll be right there!

40
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,934
How should I make it up to you?

41
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:27,105
No, it's okay. We're done eating.

42
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,773
Are you sure?

43
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,025
Yeah, it's totally fine.

44
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,735
Oh.

45
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
Thank you.

46
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,594
Let's ride!

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,346
Let's go!

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,316
Thank you.

49
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,068
No. Thank <i>you</i>.

50
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,989
-But what are you thanking me for?
-For waiting.

51
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,993
You know you were cutting it close, right?

52
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,995
You were being way too slow.

53
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,667
And what are you thanking me for?

54
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,504
For showing me all of your heart.

55
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,049
And for reassuring me.

56
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,608
{\an8}VINTAGE AND SUSTAINABILITY

57
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,112
Why are you buying used clothes?

58
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,489
It's vintage.

59
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,991
This came out in 2014.

60
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,079
It's Patrick Shyong's last collaboration.
The designer died young in a car accident.

61
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,248
They say it's a flex.

62
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,295
This is more expensive
than this brand's new line.

63
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,047
It means it's worth the price.

64
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,467
It's hard to even find
vintage clothes like this.

65
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,386
Why are you leaving it? Why not buy it?

66
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,804
It's expensive.

67
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,348
Let's go.

68
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,016
It's time for you to go to class.

69
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,394
Hey! Don't sell this yet, okay?

70
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,979
-I'll come back!
-Okay.

71
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,486
Many brands are participating
because Ms. Ahn is leading

72
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,530
the brand campaign herself.

73
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,116
Is it because of her global influence?

74
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,536
Sustainability has already been
a concern among a lot of people.

75
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:51,165
Carbon emissions and climate issues
are all part of a global campaign.

76
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,918
Thanks to that,
we're promoting four of the brands.

77
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,046
There are many regenerated
fiber products from plastic bottles.

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,302
The work of a famous
British junk artist is coming too.

79
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,886
Trash was used as the material?

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,638
How moving.

81
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,181
They're on the plane right now.

82
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:12,520
Look at how garbage is gorgeously
reborn in the hands of an artist.

83
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,861
Ms. Oh, I didn't know
we had a meeting. I didn't get a call.

84
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,823
See, didn't I tell you?
Ji-eun would stay strong.

85
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,953
Come with me, Ji-eun.

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,249
Did something happen?

87
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,502
Ji-eun, are you sure you're okay?

88
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,891
Ms. Oh, if there's something I did wrong...

89
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:50,975
Ji-eun.

90
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,770
Take some time off.

91
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,189
Sorry? Time off?

92
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,359
When you have a lot on your mind
and your heart aches,

93
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,903
you might think you want to stay busy.

94
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,989
But if you do that,
you might burn out and explode.

95
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,617
And you'll end up a total mess.

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,205
A mess? Me? Why all of a sudden?

97
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,416
Hey, there are no secrets in this world.

98
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,253
Cheongdam Daily will even tell you
how many panties a designer owns.

99
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,880
Don't try to keep it from me.

100
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:25,051
No matter what anyone says,
I understand you.

101
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,553
Any man. That's not true.

102
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,640
Honestly, Lee Nam-jin isn't just any man.

103
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,895
Anyway, just tell yourself
it wasn't meant to be.

104
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,523
But after getting dumped by Lee Nam-jin,

105
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,733
I heard you're so desperate
that you started

106
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,986
dating a photographer's assistant
who has no aspirations.

107
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,904
Is that true?

108
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,824
"Desperate"? No, that's not true, I'm...

109
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,076
I know. I've been there.

110
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,161
But after all,

111
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
it'll hurt the guy you're dating now.

112
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,835
Just let everything go, and get some rest.

113
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,130
-Your vacation bonus.
-Ms. Oh.

114
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,089
It's nothing.

115
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,842
I should at least
take care of you like this. Take it.

116
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,097
You don't have to say anything.

117
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,350
"I'll enjoy my vacation."
That's all you need to say.

118
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,478
Okay, thank you.

119
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
Ms. Oh.

120
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,403
That photographer, you know.

121
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,823
He's actually someone I really love.

122
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,285
All right, I see.

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,787
Keep telling yourself that.

124
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,748
You got this.

125
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,673
I contacted your agency, and it seems
you're no longer under contract with them.

126
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,258
So I contacted you directly.

127
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,509
Thanks to that,

128
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,095
I get to have tea with you alone.
This is nice.

129
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,224
I hope you would say the same thing
about my offer as well. What do you think?

130
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,061
You don't need me for that pictorial.

131
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,856
It's a photoshoot
with body paint, not clothes.

132
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,737
It's fashion
that will be drawn on a perfect body.

133
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,408
I would think
you'd be interested in that as a model.

134
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,454
Not worn, but drawn.
Perfect for an environmental project.

135
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,874
Designer Jin Young-soo's work

136
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,335
will be drawn on you.

137
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
You know he's my ex-boyfriend.

138
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,383
That's all in the past.

139
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,844
Now, we're just a designer and a model.

140
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,894
It's been a while.

141
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,314
I asked her for this.

142
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,858
Please consider it.

143
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,403
The model is an extremely important part
in this project.

144
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,406
I'll be excusing myself, then.

145
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,455
What are you playing at?

146
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,127
All models should be chosen.

147
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,547
Models also have the right
to refuse to be chosen.

148
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,173
It's a rare opportunity.

149
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,177
If you turn this project down,
that will mean you're retiring for good.

150
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,930
Should I answer?

151
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,015
Then it looks like I'll lose my muse.

152
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,811
I wanted to renew our contract
after this project.

153
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,771
Trends change every season.

154
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,733
You should change too, Mr. Jin.
That's how you survive.

155
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,485
I can't keep changing my identity

156
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,238
just to keep up with the trends.

157
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,366
I don't want to be remembered
as a predictable model.

158
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,452
Ye Seon-ho in Jin Young-soo's collection?
That's too old-fashioned.

159
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,833
That's the power of vintage.

160
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,753
Even when it's faded and old,
its presence still shines.

161
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,716
That is a little touching.

162
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,015
The editorial is beautiful.

163
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,685
I thought he was just a big-eyed kid.

164
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,895
I guess he's talented in photography, too.

165
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,441
Thanks to Joseph's unique identity,
his work stands out more.

166
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,486
Esther, you always know
how to talk nicely.

167
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,074
Send this over to all the showrooms,
and ask them to sign contracts.

168
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,619
The more they know,
the more his pieces will sell.

169
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,747
We can't ignore the 12% commission
and organizing fee.

170
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,417
They'll be picking what they want,
but we should pick too.

171
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,504
Some showrooms even have
a set 40% revenue share.

172
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,508
They tell us to do this and that

173
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,093
with the clothes.

174
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,262
Joseph will lose it if he finds out.

175
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:45,102
I'm so glad that Joseph has you, Esther.

176
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,815
Still, our portfolio came out well.
I should send this

177
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,901
to the top three showrooms right away.

178
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,365
Joseph!

179
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,284
-What's wrong, Esther?
-E-mail!

180
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,786
Check your e-mail!

181
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,037
Thierry Henry...

182
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,422
What? Creative director?

183
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:18,386
Jjoseph! Congratulations!
I'm so proud of you!

184
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,471
Look at these tears in my eyes.

185
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,139
-Where?
-Stop that!

186
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,600
Hey, we should celebrate.

187
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,435
-Raise your glasses! Cheers!
-Okay!

188
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,606
-Jjoseph!
-Jjoseph!

189
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,699
What's wrong?

190
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,412
Why is Thierry putting me
through this hardship?

191
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,627
I'm Joseph,

192
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,130
but he wants me to be Thierry.

193
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:59,427
Mr. Joseph is my identity,
but he wants to turn it into Earlaine.

194
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,011
Do you feel pressured?

195
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,849
A global luxury brand offered you
a job to be their creative director.

196
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,767
-And?
-Gosh.

197
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,520
But this is huge a deal.

198
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,274
Has there ever been a Korean designer
in such a great position?

199
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,275
I don't think so.

200
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:18,529
Right, this is something you should be
happy about and congratulated for.

201
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,703
Do you guys not want me around?

202
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,999
If I do this, I'll have to live in Paris.

203
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,335
And I'll have to give up Mr, Joseph too.

204
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:41,719
I don't wanna be away from you guys,
and I don't want to lose myself.

205
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,101
There, there.

206
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,645
Hey.

207
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,498
Jjoseph, did you have mascara on?

208
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,125
It was a "no-makeup" look. Is it obvious?

209
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,503
You were crying your eyes out,
and yes, it smudged.

210
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,879
It's super obvious.

211
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,883
Oh my, but you're still pretty, Jjoseph.

212
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,967
I got you a taxi.

213
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,221
You guys should go home
and pack for the trip.

214
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,639
Aren't you leaving?

215
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
What?

216
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,309
Well...

217
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,521
I was going to help clean up.

218
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,817
Sly, Woo-min,

219
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,110
You're staying over?

220
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,989
Are you guys...

221
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,492
So what? They did it
when they were just friends.

222
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,452
What are you guys talking about?

223
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,705
We used to sleep over
at each other's places.

224
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,082
I want to stay too.

225
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,836
There's only one bed.

226
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,088
So what? It's not like
she sees me as a man.

227
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,965
I'll sleep with Ji-eun. Right, Ppyoji?

228
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,174
Come on!

229
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,927
Ji-eun's mine now.

230
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,513
Well, then I'm staying too.

231
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,891
How exciting! We're having a pajama party.

232
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,435
Wait, I didn't bring my pajamas.

233
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,563
Hey! You should've brought one.

234
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,564
Jeez!

235
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,773
Turn on the flashlight.

236
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,275
-What?
-Where's your phone?

237
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,484
-My gosh.
-Ouch!

238
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,402
Hey.

239
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,511
Careful, be careful!

240
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,305
Sign here, please.

241
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,682
Yes, of course.

242
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,852
RECIPIENT AUDREY

243
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,104
Aren't you going to read it?

244
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,274
Ms. Bae, it's not my first day at work.

245
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,987
We'll return it on the dot
once the shoot is done.

246
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,157
And could you please tell Mr. Lee

247
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,076
that JD will be wearing Rublani.

248
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,828
The purse is the star this time.

249
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,332
Mr. Lee only did it
at the request of Ms. Ahn.

250
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
Oh.

251
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,377
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

252
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,338
-Careful.
-Okay.

253
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,675
-Take care.
-Thank you.

254
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,593
See you later.

255
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,136
-Hello. Have you eaten?
-Yes.

256
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,472
That's Lee Nam-jin!

257
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,556
Mr. Lee!

258
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,687
Hello, I'm the CEO of Audrey.
It's been a while. It's been a while.

259
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,606
Right. Hello.

260
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,155
Did you think we were too clingy?

261
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,659
It's a good thing
we sent Ji-eun on a vacation.

262
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,048
Hello.

263
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,428
You brought a tent?

264
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,722
And you brought chairs?

265
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,432
Jjoseph said he can't make it.

266
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,309
Seon-ho said the same thing.

267
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,274
Those guys are such loyal friends.

268
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,442
Right.

269
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,154
So, are we going camping
and looking at the stars?

270
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,408
-I'll get you as many stars as you want.
-Woo-min!

271
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,167
Do you have to wear gloves?

272
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,421
Does the packaging have to be that fancy?

273
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,549
It's for JD,
so the packaging has to be gorgeous.

274
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,468
This piece is by an artist
whose work perfectly covers

275
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,262
the environmental campaign.

276
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,514
All the way from London.

277
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,599
Did you hear that, JD?

278
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,310
Still, it's just something made
by a junk artist.

279
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,898
The campaign puts more emphasis
on the "artist" part than the "junk" part.

280
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,817
I think it'd be perfect for you

281
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,987
since you're leading
the millennial and Gen-Z fashion trend.

282
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,157
Even though JD does streetwear,

283
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,035
you know everything she wears is
from luxury brands.

284
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,494
Of course.

285
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,205
Okay! Let's have a look, then!

286
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,834
Oh, how fancy.

287
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,052
Oh my goodness.

288
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,016
-I didn't know.
-What is this?

289
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,686
Is it too abstract?

290
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,857
You don't like it, right?

291
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,859
It's so artistic.

292
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,862
What a vibe, right?

293
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,323
This is so cool!

294
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,744
It's pretty!

295
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,248
Let's get ready for the shoot then.

296
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,000
It'll be perfect for today's outfit!

297
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,044
JD, this looks great on you.

298
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,712
You're the icon of the generation!

299
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,672
That was close.

300
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,800
Is it made from recycled trash?

301
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,760
Someone might hear you. It's an art work.

302
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,345
Sustainability!

303
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,641
Anyway, I heard from the HQ in Paris,

304
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:26,146
Thierry's picked a creative director
for the new sub-brand of Earlaine..

305
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,359
A rising designer in Korea was selected.

306
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,655
-You know anything about that?
-That's news to me.

307
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,532
Come on, think hard.

308
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,952
Don't you remember anything
from when you escorted Thierry?

309
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,246
No, there wasn't much.

310
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,250
Right! Joseph's pop-up.

311
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,963
Right, that weird little bag
that was on display.

312
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,383
Thierry kept saying how brilliant it was
and made a fuss about it.

313
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,801
It was all over Instagram...

314
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,432
Joseph.

315
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,061
First, I'd like to thank
Thierry for this offer.

316
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,607
But I would like to stay here
at Mr. Joseph, because it's my everything.

317
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,903
Moreover, I don't want to leave Seoul,
my hometown and my identity.

318
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,657
Working with Earlaine
would be a great honor for me.

319
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,368
But I'd like to keep myself and my store.

320
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,038
What did he say?

321
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,167
He said he didn't want any offers.

322
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,919
I think he'll be really disappointed.

323
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,130
It is a very exceptional proposal for us.

324
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,217
We're sad about your decision.

325
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,723
Thank you for coming.

326
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,266
Thank you.

327
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,201
Oh my, Madame Jang, hello.

328
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,623
-Who...
-I'm Hong Ji-seon.

329
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,168
At your retirement press conference,

330
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,754
I was the youngest stylist there.

331
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,925
When I heard that Joseph was your son,

332
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,969
I thought artistry surely runs
in the family.

333
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,890
It's so nice to see you again.

334
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,974
Oh.

335
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:32,231
You're the one that insists on calling
my dear Joseph "Se-pyeong," aren't you?

336
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,983
CONGRATULATIONS

337
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,778
Congratulations, Madame Jang.

338
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,240
Such great news
for the Korean fashion industry.

339
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,742
You must be so happy.

340
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,743
About what?

341
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,539
I heard about everything.

342
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,669
The Korean designer
that Thierry Henry picked is...

343
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,170
Wait.

344
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,172
Can you speak French?

345
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,716
Yes, a little.

346
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,058
Then, can you do me a favor?

347
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,559
Of course.

348
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,605
Oh, me?

349
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,648
Well.

350
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,485
Say hello.

351
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,529
Hello?

352
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,955
-Well done, everyone!
-Oh my!

353
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,291
-Great work, JD!
-Where's Ms. Hong?

354
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,669
I'm not sure. Maybe she's with Ms. Oh

355
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,629
to discuss something important...

356
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,257
She's so mean.

357
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,093
Great work, everyone.

358
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,554
-Let's clean up quick and go eat.
-Okay.

359
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,030
What's this?

360
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,409
It's the bait I used whenever
you retreated into your cave in Paris.

361
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,912
-Pear juice?
-I warmed it up for you.

362
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,421
Thank you.

363
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,552
Joseph.

364
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,723
Guess what day it is today.

365
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,518
This day, seven years ago,
I arrived in Paris

366
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,104
and found out I was scammed
to my study abroad.

367
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,733
It's the most important anniversary
in my life.

368
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,194
Because it's the day we first met.

369
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,238
You were crying in the rain.

370
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,449
I remember.

371
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,578
I had nowhere to stay and had no money,

372
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,582
but you clothed me, fed me,
and even looked for a school for me.

373
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,669
You've looked after me so far.

374
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,673
We had so much fun then, didn't we?

375
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,219
Remember when we'd come home drunk
after partying?

376
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,138
We'd climb up six floors
and would fall asleep halfway,

377
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,099
because there weren't any elevators?

378
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,600
It was more than that.

379
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,937
We almost got kicked out
because we threw up all over the stairs.

380
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,190
Remember the kids
from the fashion kindergarten next door?

381
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,692
Looking at their projects, I used to cry,

382
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,569
because they were better than me.

383
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,447
But it motivated you to win
first place for your graduation project.

384
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,616
Thanks to my model, Esther.

385
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,747
You did well today, Joseph.

386
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,752
I didn't just blow a big opportunity?

387
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,589
I feel the same way as you.
I don't want to lose Joseph.

388
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,861
I love this song!

389
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,198
Hey! Are you an audience or something?

390
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,825
Get up and dance with me.

391
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,497
Come on, dance with me.

392
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,840
Woo-min's my best friend.

393
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,592
And Ji-eun's my best friend.

394
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,428
I can't live without Ji-eun and Joseph.

395
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,972
I can't live without Seon-ho
and Woo-min either.

396
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,391
Why can't you live without Woo-min?

397
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,685
He's handsome.

398
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,356
It's been almost a year now.

399
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,901
-You two still have feelings?
-No.

400
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,153
Great.

401
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,490
Then just stay friends.
Don't make it awkward for us too.

402
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,618
Just go back to
when it was the four of us.

403
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,662
Seon-ho and I have had it.

404
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,749
I really don't feel anything anymore
when I see him.

405
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,585
How do I say it?
It's like looking at dust?

406
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,213
I don't even remember us dating.

407
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:53,510
Honestly, Woo-min is the type who makes
a better friend than a boyfriend.

408
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,391
Long time no see, Woo-min.

409
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,937
How about you?
Are you okay being friends with me?

410
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,232
Yeah.

411
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,444
We should've made them
meet up sooner, right?

412
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,531
So we're back to how it used to be. Okay?

413
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,366
Thank God.

414
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,784
Shake hands.

415
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,593
<i>The moment our hands touched,</i>

416
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,930
<i>all the feelings I tried to bury
kept rising to the surface.</i>

417
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,144
I tried to be cool, but I wasn't sure
if we could stay just friends.

418
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,607
But deep inside, I guess I wanted
to keep seeing you, even as just friends.

419
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,153
You have no idea how relieved I was
that we could at least remain as friends.

420
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,656
How did you feel then?

421
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,369
How was it?

422
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,750
Hey, don't just laugh!

423
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,211
I mean, after we broke up,

424
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,798
you went traveling and kept working out.

425
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,175
You were fine without me.

426
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,971
I hated it, back then.

427
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:26,561
When I saw you again back then,
my heart was pounding like crazy.

428
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,066
It was driving me nuts.

429
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,571
I was worried that you, Seon-ho,
and Joseph would hear my heart beating.

430
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,284
If so, it meant
we couldn't even be friends.

431
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,624
I clenched my teeth, trying to hold it in.

432
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,000
Really?

433
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,089
Is that why you didn't say anything
and kept your mouth shut?

434
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,174
That's so funny.

435
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,094
I had no idea.

436
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,472
Ji-eun, look at the stars.

437
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,711
MS. OH

438
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,047
My head.

439
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,759
We opened the box,
and the purse wasn't there.

440
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,014
She didn't check inside the box
and just took it after the shoot.

441
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,643
Whenever JD has a shoot,
she brings lots of staff members with her.

442
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,229
Hyun-ji must've missed it
because she was so busy.

443
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,315
That's nonsense!
How do you lose an artwork?

444
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,321
Damages compensation clause.

445
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,531
"If lost,

446
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,327
all tangible and intangible costs
will be calculated as damages."

447
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,539
We didn't just damage it. We lost it!

448
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,917
We'll find it.

449
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,670
Yeah, we'd better find it. We have to.

450
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,758
What are you looking for?

451
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,342
A purse.

452
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,554
A very special purse.

453
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,558
A very expensive purse.

454
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,894
I mean, who would steal that?

455
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,898
It's not like they have done
a fashion photoshoot for the first time.

456
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,942
I know.

457
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,198
-Thank you.
-Oh, sure.

458
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,872
By the way, Ms. Oh,
where did you get the purse?

459
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,874
You said it wasn't a brand.

460
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,711
From Mr. Lee Nam-jin.

461
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,340
Seriously.

462
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,512
I'll discuss this with Ms. Ahn.

463
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,138
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

464
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,724
Could you give me five garbage bags?

465
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,059
You used them up already?

466
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,896
There was so much trash
from the studio yesterday!

467
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,564
Don't use them up so quickly!

468
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,692
Gosh, why don't you keep
the recycling area clean?

469
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,528
All you do is sit around and watch TV!

470
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,279
Hey, when did I...

471
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,407
Ma'am! Have you seen this?

472
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,992
What am I looking at?

473
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,622
Is that a plastic bag?

474
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,998
Did you throw it out?

475
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:34,958
Oh gosh.

476
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,211
You're supposed to throw trash out
when you see it, not keep it!

477
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,712
Where is this now?

478
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,007
Gosh, the garbage truck took it.

479
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,093
-It's...
-What is it?

480
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,219
It's...

481
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,887
-What's going on?
-What's wrong?

482
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,639
-Hey.
-Garbage...

483
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,349
Are you all right? What's wrong?

484
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,647
What happened, Ms. Oh?

485
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,901
-Bring me some water.
-Yes, ma'am.

486
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,446
Ji-eun.

487
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,824
We went through the garbage truck,

488
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,993
but it wasn't there.

489
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,621
Ji-eun, I'm sorry you had to come back
when you're on vacation.

490
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,416
I'm so sorry, Ms. Oh.

491
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,350
<i>I'm going to New York.</i>

492
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,978
Wow.

493
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,897
I love New York!

494
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,482
I'm going abroad to work
as Model Ye Seon-ho again.

495
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,152
There's not much work in Korea anyway.

496
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,737
Living abroad was my dream!

497
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,239
Wow, dreams really do come true.

498
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,492
No position's open for you
in my plans for New York.

499
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,577
Your boyfriend!

500
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,747
Would I need you?

501
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,831
How about a manager?

502
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,834
My English is pretty good,
and I'm friendly.

503
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,252
I'm good at driving, too.

504
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,254
I already signed up with an agency.

505
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,175
I won't make enough money
to have a manager.

506
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,511
Then I'll use my savings
to make my debut as a director.

507
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,180
I'll follow you around

508
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:16,267
and make a documentary of Ye Seon-ho,
the supermodel's life story.

509
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,522
I'm not even sure
if it'll be a success or a failure.

510
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,942
Whether it's Model Ye Seon-ho
or the documentary,

511
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,693
at least one of them will be successful.

512
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,697
Drama is what makes
documentaries successful.

513
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,199
You can do it!

514
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,081
I've been waiting.

515
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,210
I thought I should thank you
for accepting my offer without hesitation.

516
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,170
It wasn't without hesitation.

517
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,255
You haven't changed, Seon-ho.

518
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,051
Say hi. This is my adorable boyfriend.

519
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,929
This is designer Jin Young-soo.

520
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,431
My ex.

521
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:07,986
Who is it?

522
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,532
Ta-da!

523
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,284
I got worried, so I came over.

524
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,286
Ms. Hong, please sit.

525
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,373
Are you all right?

526
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,460
I thought you might need a drinking buddy.

527
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,296
No room for soju.

528
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,424
Thank you, though, Ms. Hong.

529
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:35,054
Ms. Ahn and Mr. Lee are having
a meeting about it now.

530
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,851
I feel bad about it too
since it happened after JD's photoshoot.

531
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,895
Gosh, all this fuss
just because of some recycled trash.

532
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,897
It's not recycled trash.

533
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,441
Anyway,

534
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,903
it was made from recycled juice boxes.

535
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,115
Well, thanks to
the amazing magic of the artist,

536
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,409
it was reborn as a work of art.

537
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,702
Ms. Hong.

538
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,580
-Did you drive here?
-Yeah.

539
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,833
We need to go somewhere. Hurry!

540
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,629
Oh gosh.

541
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,092
Do we really have to go this far, Ms. Oh?

542
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,183
Do you need my help?

543
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,647
Huh?

544
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,821
This is it.

545
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,364
You found it!

546
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,533
You found it, Ms. Oh!

547
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,038
Oh dear, Ms. Oh!

548
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,227
Thank you for the ride.

549
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,354
I'll wait here. Go.

550
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,689
I'm sorry.

551
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,274
Thank you for telling me.

552
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,653
Since Ms. Oh's in the hospital,

553
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,155
I should at least drop by
to say thanks to him.

554
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,658
Is Ms. Oh's condition serious?

555
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,995
I think the stress
from what happened gave her a shock.

556
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,123
She'll be out in a few days
after some rest.

557
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,669
I'll be right back.

558
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:49,355
I'm sorry, but Mr. Lee's conference call
is running late today.

559
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,566
It'll be difficult to meet him today.

560
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,942
Is that so?

561
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,777
You can leave him a message,

562
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,029
and I'll relay it to him
once the call is over.

563
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,614
Oh...

564
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,076
Could you relay my thanks
for taking care of the situation

565
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,536
with the junk artist's purse?

566
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,497
Tell him that I came by
to thank him personally.

567
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,963
<i>Section Chief Pyo Ji-eun
from the fashion agency Audrey</i>

568
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,007
<i>dropped by to personally thank you</i>

569
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,635
<i>for resolving the issue
regarding the junk artist's bag.</i>

570
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:24,140
<i>You asked not to be bothered,
so I handled it accordingly.</i>

571
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,912
I passed the agency audition!

572
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,831
I can finally audition
for Seoul Fashion Week!

573
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,589
A gift for your next audition.

574
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,469
This is...

575
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,096
Wow.

576
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,729
Chae-young, I'm seriously moved.

577
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,773
You like me a lot, too!

578
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,776
You know I invest
in crypto and stocks, right?

579
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,696
This is an investment in my boyfriend.
Nothing more, nothing less.

580
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,242
There's no way someone as smart
as you would invest in just anybody.

581
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,536
It means I'm worth it, right?

582
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,082
Excuse me, one <i>Coolpis</i> here, please!

583
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,628
But how did you end up
doing body painting?

584
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,213
It was designed by Jin Young-soo.

585
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,465
There's nothing
the great Seon-ho can't do.

586
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,550
They're just a designer and a model now.

587
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,094
Still, they're exes.

588
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,722
Whatever. I've been
on a strict diet to get in shape.

589
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,767
Man, I could eat a horse.

590
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,144
Don't try to stop me tonight.

591
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,480
When you eat spicy food
on an empty stomach...

592
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,440
-Come on.
-Gross!

593
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,942
We're about to eat!

594
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,070
Hey! I told you Ji-eun's mine.

595
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,655
That's unfair!

596
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,449
I'll find my own partner too.

597
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,619
Really, Jjoseph?

598
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,662
Is there someone?

599
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,997
Do you have a guy in mind?

600
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,334
I'm not telling you!

601
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,877
Gosh, there must be someone.

602
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,045
Jjoseph, who is it?

603
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,338
You have to tell me!

604
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,548
I don't know!

605
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,925
-Jjoseph!
-No, stop it!

606
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,593
-Come on, tell me!
-No way.

607
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,012
-Please tell me.
-Whatever.

608
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,389
-Come on, please?
-I said no! Wait.

609
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,142
Three orders of <i>tteokbokki</i>
with glass and ramen noodles.

610
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,228
And two orders of <i>sundae</i> and fried
seaweed rolls, and four fried squids too.

611
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,148
No, five fried squids.
I want an extra one.

612
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,443
These guys are so childish
that I can't hang out with them.

613
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,777
I think it's cute.

614
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,071
Let's stay here. It's chaotic over there.

615
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,699
Come on, just say it once.
It'll be our secret.

616
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,700
-Fine.
-Just tell me.

617
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,243
No.

618
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,705
-You're so mean.
-Where did you meet him?

619
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,755
This is delicious.

620
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,384
-Joseph!
-Esther!

621
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,761
-Hi.
-It's been a while.

622
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,139
-Are you here for some <i>tteokbokki</i>?
-No, you left your phone.

623
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,891
Did I?

624
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,684
You came all the way for that?

625
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,269
-Sit down and...
-No!

626
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,485
Thierry Henry is making you another offer

627
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,446
for the creative director position
for Earlaine.

628
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,157
He'll respect
Mr. Joseph's identity, separate it

629
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,286
from Earlaine, and allow you to work here,
in Seoul, instead of in Paris.
