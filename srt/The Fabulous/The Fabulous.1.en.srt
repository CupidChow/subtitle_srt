1
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:29,172
DOM PÉRIGNON AND A SHOT OF SOJU

2
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,118
Right at the end here...

3
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,328
Pay attention here.

4
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,412
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

5
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,626
Number 12. Tell Esther that she's out.

6
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,836
But, Joseph.

7
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,755
It's number 12's debut today.

8
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,924
Bosh. Number 12's out.

9
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,927
Yes, understood.

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,638
Esther, where are you now?

11
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,431
Don't wrinkle the clothes.

12
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,183
Can we talk for a second?

13
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,351
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,727
Keep your arms straight.

15
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,648
-Seon-ho.
-Joseph!

16
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,112
I'm only doing this kelp-like style
because you want me to.

17
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,616
I could even squeeze water out of my hair.
So hilarious.

18
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,452
Seon-ho, it's perfect.

19
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,787
God...

20
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,250
All right.

21
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,712
Let's get everyone falling in love
with the show. Got it?

22
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,839
Drench them all!

23
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,018
-Please look over here.
-Over here!

24
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,817
It's JD!

25
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,766
Make it tighter. More.

26
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,393
Joseph.

27
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,604
Excuse me. Joseph.

28
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,772
What's going on?

29
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,149
Esther wants you to come over now.

30
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,901
Slay. She knows I'm busy.

31
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,902
Make her come here.

32
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,487
Guess who just arrived.

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,823
Ahn Nam-hee. The editor-in-chief.

34
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,328
Slay! Move! Get out of the way!

35
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,333
-Joseph.
-Oh my.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,835
-Congratulations.
-You came.

37
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,587
-You never disappoint.
-Of course.

38
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,387
-Thanks. Exactly.
-Absolutely elegant.

39
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,101
What is it?

40
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,687
Ms. Ahn!

41
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,983
With a tight schedule in New York,
I didn't expect you here.

42
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,694
I got all choked up
when I saw you come in.

43
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
Thank you so much, Ms. Ahn.

44
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,991
You too, Ms. Hong.

45
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,328
I'm really looking forward to it.
The venue is unique too.

46
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,705
You're right.

47
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,000
Venues like this
can easily distract people

48
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,794
when the show gets boring
even for a second.

49
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,922
It's a bold move.
Was this your idea, Se-pyeong?

50
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,306
You see, Joseph's real name is Se-pyeong.

51
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,558
Jang Se-pyeong!

52
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,143
Am I right?

53
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,108
I'm so flattered
by your attentiveness to my profile,

54
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,068
down to the smallest detail.

55
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,945
Oh, come on.

56
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,614
-Joseph, here...
-Oh!

57
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,533
I present to you

58
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,829
our Mr. Joseph Collection, titled "Holic."

59
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,415
I was inspired
by the alluring <i>Song of the Sirens</i>.

60
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,209
The main colors are emerald green
and sapphire blue,

61
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,296
and I focused on fabrics
that create a seductive silhouette.

62
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,758
You mean sirens, the sea monster?

63
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,846
Haven't you done enough already?

64
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,475
I used both silk and organza fabric
for a bit more...

65
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,727
Well, that won't do for JD, then.

66
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,521
She can pull off almost everything.

67
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,691
But wrapping the body with silk
is old-fashioned

68
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,361
and organza lacks practicality.

69
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:08,534
It's interesting how you started
with a myth and added picturesque touches.

70
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,955
Of course you would notice the patterns.

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,375
I took extra care to match the colors.

72
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,710
I bet you skipped meals for the show.

73
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,420
Have this.

74
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,215
You didn't have to. Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

75
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,177
Wow, bread.

76
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,846
You should be honored.

77
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,182
It's Ms. Ahn's favorite bread.

78
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,267
It's fig. Organic.

79
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,063
Joseph!

80
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,399
-Hey, you're here.
-Joseph!

81
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,778
Congrats!

82
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,822
-Seriously!
-How uncouth...

83
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,494
She always calls me Se-pyeong.
God, I hate it...

84
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,622
Who said that? Where is that person?

85
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,666
Hong Ji-seon, standing next to Ms. Ahn.

86
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,919
Wait, the Ahn Nam-hee?

87
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,754
Yes, your idol, that Ahn Nam-hee.

88
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,340
You only memorized
her editor's letters, not her face.

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
No way.

90
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,845
You should've told me
so that I could say hi at least.

91
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,806
-Hey.
-What's this?

92
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,224
Bread?

93
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,560
They say it's "organic."

94
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,562
See you later.

95
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,983
Joseph!

96
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,694
Good luck!

97
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:59,312
Is your camera a weapon? You almost
blinded me. I could have been hurt.

98
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,064
-Watch who you...
-You're hurt? Let me see.

99
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,401
Let me check
if you've been well and missed me.

100
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,322
Look, you disappeared on me
after the last season.

101
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,741
Do I look like
I worried as an ex-turned-friend?

102
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,910
So you've been wondering about me.

103
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,790
I thought you were just surfing in Hawaii.

104
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,250
What on earth happened there?

105
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,961
From your face to the way you talk,
you're all so slick.

106
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,922
You <i>did</i> miss me.

107
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,633
Were you looking at my Instagram?

108
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,843
You could've dropped some likes.

109
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,763
Likes? Whatever.

110
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,518
From that old-fashioned necklace
to your embarrassed face,

111
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
-you haven't changed.
-Wait.

112
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,314
What? "Old-fashioned"?

113
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,068
Clearly, you have no taste at all.

114
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,363
Coco Chanel, Jacqueline Kennedy,
Audrey Hepburn, and Princess Diana.

115
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,990
You just insulted women
who elevated their dignity

116
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,700
and elegance with this jewelry.

117
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,245
You said I have no taste but you're my...

118
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,331
Forget it, how can you discuss
the classics with me?

119
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,751
You don't even remember this necklace.

120
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,837
Ji-eun.

121
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,465
Nam-jin, you're here.

122
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,388
I'm Ji Woo-min, also Ji-eun's ex.

123
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,726
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Nam-jin.

124
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,978
We're friends now.

125
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,939
I see.

126
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,065
We should go.

127
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,294
Look here.

128
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,380
Perfect. Amazing.

129
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,016
Yes, like that. No one else but JD.

130
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,696
I think he's better than the guy
you were with last season.

131
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,323
Mind your business.

132
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,743
You look so pretty
sitting next to another guy.

133
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,663
Shut up and watch the show.

134
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,112
Open the door, please!

135
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,863
Check the outfit.

136
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,782
The second outfit!

137
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,789
I need it.

138
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,668
-Wait a minute.
-Shoes!

139
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,986
I'm so excited!

140
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,756
Joseph, you should go out.

141
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,800
Please stand by.

142
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,239
What's going on?

143
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,240
-What?
-What's this?

144
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,575
-What happened?
-What?

145
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,535
-What's this?
-What?

146
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,579
Too dark to see.

147
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,622
What's going on?

148
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,124
-What's this?
-A blackout?

149
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,042
How come?

150
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,418
So scary.

151
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,372
Wow, everything was amazing,
to the finale outfit.

152
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,791
Seon-ho was beautiful like crazy.

153
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,961
It's a shame Jjoseph didn't make it
to the curtain call.

154
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,546
But it was the collection itself

155
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,548
you really wanted to show, right?

156
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,675
So it went perfectly.

157
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,176
I watched the whole process.

158
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,137
It was gorgeous, elegance, and brilliant.

159
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,514
You made it all.

160
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,391
Seon-ho did the perfect pose.

161
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,191
Say something.

162
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,278
Right. The black-out seemed
part of the show.

163
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,031
It was ear-splitting
when people were screaming.

164
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,701
Tell him with some sincerity, Ji Woo-min.

165
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,327
Right, it wasn't that bad.

166
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,955
Joseph, don't get too emotional.

167
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,665
Those people outside?

168
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,377
They're still here
so they don't miss a dramatic scene.

169
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,462
They all want to see you find that girl

170
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,089
and rip her hair out.

171
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,967
A rookie model whose desires were killed

172
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,511
and a furious gay designer fight at dawn.

173
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,389
Be classy.
Cheap revenge drama isn't for me.

174
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,141
What's with the "gay"?

175
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,434
It's more provocative.

176
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,146
Okay. There you go.

177
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,358
Joseph,

178
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,695
let's move on.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

179
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,032
Right, let's just do a proper
curtain call here.

180
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,659
Let's drink, go out, and show
those people out there

181
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,661
that we're having a good time, okay?

182
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,748
-Be cool.
-You're right.

183
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,499
I even sent my boyfriend home

184
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,127
to have a fantastic time with Joseph.

185
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,719
So...

186
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,638
tonight...

187
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,057
we'll ride or die?

188
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,143
Of course, we'll ride or die!

189
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,771
-Ride or die!
-Ride or die!

190
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,650
-Joseph!
-Joseph!

191
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,884
Hey, Woo-min! What are you doing?

192
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,177
-Hey!
-Let's go.

193
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,901
Is it okay for us to do this?

194
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,331
Nice weather, right?

195
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,461
Right, it was so hectic last night
that I didn't notice you leaving.

196
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,796
Champagne knocks me out.

197
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,757
Get some hangover food.

198
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,135
Maybe this is the wrong kind.

199
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,012
Do you want hangover soup?

200
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,472
No, this is better. It looks tasty, too.

201
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,268
I'll have what he's having.

202
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,186
Coming right up.

203
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,489
Are you upset about last night?

204
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,532
What about it?

205
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,245
Well, I invited you
despite your busy schedule

206
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,914
but didn't look after you.

207
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,999
I know you're busy too, Ji-eun.

208
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:15,047
To be honest,
I think I lost control last night.

209
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,217
You know how important Jjoseph
and Seon-ho are to me.

210
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,219
Since the show ended like that,

211
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,971
the model and designer
were having a meltdown.

212
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,224
As their friend, I had to stay

213
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,768
to lighten up the mood at the after-party...

214
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,019
With Woo-min too?

215
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,522
Well,

216
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,858
Woo-min was...

217
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,376
Should we stop now?

218
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,795
I mean, let's break up.

219
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,802
Okay, if that's what you want.

220
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,272
Yeah, we're just friends.

221
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,903
Have a taste.

222
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,655
Yes, sure.

223
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,785
It's good.

224
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,079
Well...

225
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,499
I like the texture. It's fried well.

226
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,794
Nam-jin.

227
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:39,923
By any chance...

228
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,676
Did you come to pick me up in the morning?

229
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,142
Actually,

230
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,312
important people were at the party,

231
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,188
and they're all potential clients.

232
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,608
They're at the top,
and I'm at the bottom of the totem pole.

233
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,943
That's the life of a PR.

234
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,820
I can't refuse their glass.

235
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,656
So I kept drinking and got too drunk.

236
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,907
When I woke up,

237
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,910
I found myself at Seon-ho's.

238
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,746
I see.

239
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,581
So you slept at Seon-ho's.

240
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:13,999
Right.

241
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,668
That happens.

242
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,633
Thank you.

243
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,761
Enjoy your meal.

244
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,895
I wanted to dress up nicely today,

245
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,731
but Seon-ho's clothes didn't fit me.

246
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,066
I couldn't borrow them,

247
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,651
and I didn't want to be late,
so I came straight here.

248
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,363
This is from Chloé's latest collection.

249
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,407
And Stuart Weitzman shoes
with a Chanel bag.

250
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,701
It's not different from last night,

251
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,704
but don't you think I matched
the items well enough

252
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,039
as your girlfriend?

253
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,375
-Ji-eun.
-Yes?

254
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,252
Do you know what Northern Limit Line,

255
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,046
or NLL, means?

256
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,800
NLL?

257
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,052
Who's our current prime minister?

258
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,763
Nam-jin...

259
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,598
I always wanted to tell you this.

260
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,394
I don't expect you to read the newspaper,

261
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,271
but you should watch the news as an adult.

262
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,566
No offense,

263
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,487
but all you talk about is
the fashion brands or designers.

264
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,322
I don't follow you.

265
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,409
Because it's us.

266
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,036
We're different.

267
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,958
Nam-jin, what are you trying to say?

268
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,292
I'm tired of it.

269
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,795
Ignoring the fact we don't fit together.

270
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,173
A girl who I can talk to

271
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,801
about current world affairs,

272
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,972
political and economic issues,

273
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,765
rather than fashion trends,

274
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,643
would be better for me.

275
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,772
What's wrong with working
in the fashion industry?

276
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,150
Let's break up.

277
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,365
Eat up. I'll pay the bill on the way out.

278
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,039
<i>Males have a sharp sense of smell.</i>

279
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,083
Maybe he smelled Woo-min's toner on you.

280
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,002
You deserved to get dumped.

281
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,838
It was so humiliating and insulting.

282
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,590
What did he take me for?

283
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,093
He left that news magazine?
What's that supposed to mean?

284
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,931
Alcohol ruins your health,
and sex ruins your relationships.

285
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,015
Jeez...

286
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,684
I must've lost my mind.

287
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,188
If you're sane, you wouldn't have ruined
your mom's pearl necklace.

288
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,108
I always wear it
for an important event to attend.

289
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,944
It felt like mom was watching over me.

290
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,862
So you did it while wearing it?

291
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,030
Hey, Ye Seon-ho.

292
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,450
Are you thinking about
starting a new season with Woo-min?

293
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,204
Well, vintage is surely a charm.

294
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,413
That's ridiculous.

295
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,207
The word "vintage" isn't for him.

296
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,335
Deep down, he's got no passion.

297
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,921
Clearly, he's not capable
of being in love.

298
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,673
So why would I? Again?

299
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,757
Never.

300
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,967
Ever!

301
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,511
It's about your physical urges?

302
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,221
My physical urges?

303
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,390
I mean, you pass out drunk

304
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,225
and wake up next to Woo-min,

305
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,768
your ex from three years ago.

306
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,688
Unless you have any feelings left for him,

307
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,690
your body misses him.

308
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,608
So how many times? Was he any good?

309
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,443
What do you mean?

310
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,320
Hey.

311
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,913
I guess I drank too much last night.

312
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,332
Man, my head feels like
it's going to explode.

313
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,295
How about getting some <i>kal-guksu</i>?

314
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,381
I don't feel like eating carbs.
I'm leaving.

315
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,674
What? No way.

316
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,095
We can go for something else.

317
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,142
How can you be so calm to see me
after what happened?

318
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,271
You have no shame, Ji Woo-min, do you?

319
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,189
I'm not hungry.

320
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,734
You were busy getting dumped
and didn't get to eat.

321
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,860
You broke up?

322
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,862
You don't want a punch in the face.

323
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,864
What's up with you two?

324
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,907
There's high tension here.

325
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,410
What tension? We're just friends.

326
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,494
Right. Friends.

327
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,164
You two are funny.

328
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,126
So, is Joseph coming?

329
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,462
He wants to be left alone.

330
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,382
After his official warning,

331
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,801
Madam Jang Ok-jin went to see him.

332
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,682
"Mr. Joseph's collection was nothing
short of chaotic.

333
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,770
His taste in color and texture
isn't as it once was.

334
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,480
The gaudy organza fabric seemed

335
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,774
desperately needed to be ironed."

336
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,860
I'll stop here, Joseph.

337
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,612
Why? I'm cool with it.

338
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,280
I won't be swayed

339
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,450
by some nobody's comments
on Instagram or some blogs.

340
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,037
You won't be able to sleep at night.

341
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,625
"It looked like the orange printed dress
got kimchi juice on it..."

342
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,584
"Kimchi juice"?

343
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,296
Oh no, I'm screwed! Bosh!

344
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,422
That's enough.

345
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,383
Mom, they called it kimchi juice!

346
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,593
Like you said, why make a fuss over

347
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,970
some random comments
from a bunch of nobodies?

348
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,473
Who cares about blogs or Instagram?

349
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,809
Think of Leandra Medine or Susie Bubble.

350
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,978
Fashion bloggers
and influencers rule here.

351
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,397
Whatever.

352
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,816
Esther, hand me the remote, please.

353
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,361
Wait, last night's show
hasn't been edited yet.

354
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,989
This is the best pick-me-up
when you're depressed.

355
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,449
But Mom!

356
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,997
My son's brightest moment.

357
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,582
I'm going crazy.

358
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,294
That's your boss, Joseph Jean.

359
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,135
-Stop that.
-My boy.

360
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,721
-I'm not in the mood.
-Come on.

361
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,680
Gosh!

362
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,766
-Which part?
-That one.

363
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,727
Right there.

364
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,271
I love it!

365
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,777
<i>I seem to have dreamed
In the mirror so far</i>

366
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:02,782
<i>Why did you have to choose me
Among everyone else...</i>

367
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,075
Great expression.

368
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,204
<i>This relationship could've
Passed by casually</i>

369
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:13,585
<i>And I've never wanted something like this</i>

370
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,505
<i>Remember my sad face</i>

371
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,925
<i>And sleepless nights, until dawn</i>

372
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:26,014
<i>I look so pathetic, full of regret...</i>

373
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,057
Since he was little,
he was special, unique,

374
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,102
and had many talents.
The biggest blessing in my life.

375
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,604
When I first saw that video,

376
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,357
I knew my son was perfectly gay.

377
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,735
He's surely the coolest guy

378
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,195
I've ever known!

379
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,154
You think so?

380
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,155
Yeah!

381
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,114
Me too!

382
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,979
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,689
Jennie's available.

384
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,859
I've arranged a call
with Suzy's stylist, Ms. Yoon.

385
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,780
Yes, I'll arrange everything
and let you know. Bye.

386
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,407
My, you seem busy.

387
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,536
Are you making the coffee
because the rookie's on leave?

388
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,204
Oh dear.

389
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,413
For Ms. Hong?

390
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,456
Yeah.

391
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,292
You know
she likes her coffee sweet, right?

392
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,794
Does she?

393
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,802
Ms. Hong, please.

394
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,012
These need
a lot of your love and attention.

395
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:52,100
We really need our pieces to be included
in JD's paid pictorial.

396
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,562
If we fail this time,
we'll be definitely out.

397
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,647
It's always about JD's pictorial.

398
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,316
People talk about it all the time.

399
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,611
I'm just not loving these.

400
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,238
-Come on.
-Hey!

401
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,197
Oh my gosh!

402
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,950
Hey, what are you doing?

403
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,081
These "babies" are from Milan.

404
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,630
How lovely!

405
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,841
What are all these?

406
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,473
Honey, is something up
between you and Ms. Ahn Nam-hee?

407
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:37,145
No, I wish I could say there was.
What about her, though?

408
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,732
She specifically mentioned
she doesn't want to work with this brand.

409
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,943
I thought you two are not on good terms,
or maybe you messed up.

410
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,112
Nothing like that happened to me.

411
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,197
Maybe she has a problem with the HQ?

412
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,116
How would I know?

413
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,077
JD's concept meeting's the day
after tomorrow.

414
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,329
We're pressed for time.

415
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,290
But I can't bow down to Ahn Nam-hee,

416
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,334
just for the sake of your brand.

417
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,627
What would that make me?

418
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,794
It's just

419
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,380
not on my level.

420
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,051
Of course. I'll handle it.
I'll go see her.

421
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,010
You? Why?

422
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,888
Send your employees.

423
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,725
Imagine a CEO like you
following some editor-in-chief around.

424
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,226
It's ugly.

425
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,605
Honestly, who reads
fashion magazines these days?

426
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,398
If a star like JD

427
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,401
makes just one post
on Instagram, it's all over.

428
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,361
You know how it is.

429
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,071
Still,

430
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,824
I can't send some employees over
to meet with Ms. Ahn.

431
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,036
For people in high fashion like us,
that's not on our level.

432
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,624
Then I'll go to La Belle,
who's on the same level as me.

433
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,667
No, wait...

434
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,838
I'm doing my very best
to keep up with your level,

435
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,007
even though it's a struggle.

436
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,096
Hello, Ms. Hong.

437
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,600
You keep making the headlines
of Cheongdam Daily.

438
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:02,605
That guy was a rising star among those
who go back and forth from Hong Kong.

439
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,692
I heard he's an M&A specialist.
Is that true?

440
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,197
Oh dear,
it was close but you lost a big fish.

441
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,160
I don't like fish, Ms. Hong.

442
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,204
I can't even eat fish soup.

443
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,164
The story on Cheongdam Daily is fake.

444
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,042
Thanks for the coffee.

445
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,092
What's wrong?

446
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,927
Did you add sugar?

447
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,471
I heard you take it sweet.

448
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,474
Do you have any idea
how white sugar is made?

449
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,936
White sugar is basically
chemical flavoring.

450
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,022
How am I supposed to take that?

451
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,400
I think we have honey somewhere...

452
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,484
Make a new one.

453
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,236
I'm sorry. I'll bring a new one.

454
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,030
No, forget it.

455
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,490
Just get me some water
to rinse out my mouth.

456
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,159
The sparkling water.

457
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,994
Yes, right away.

458
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,620
Oh gosh.

459
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,456
-Oh my.
-It went down already!

460
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,624
-Oh dear.
-It went down!

461
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,094
Ji-eun, I need you to go
and see Ms. Ahn Nam-hee.

462
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,138
Me?

463
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,224
She's not someone you can meet
whenever you want to.

464
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,437
If JD doesn't want our clothes this time,
we can't renew our contract.

465
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,524
Ms. Ahn is handling the pictorial herself.

466
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,362
If she just takes her words back
to take our clothes out,

467
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,990
we'll have no problems with the shoot.

468
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,202
Until then, we should convince her
to change her mind, whatsoever.

469
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,703
How?

470
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,705
Do you remember the china plates

471
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,583
we got from Paris for the collaboration?

472
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,627
We paid over 300 euros a piece

473
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,546
for those "babies"
that were so hard to get.

474
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,299
I heard Ms. Ahn collects fine china.

475
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,759
So give those to her...

476
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,803
Do you really think she'll take them?

477
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,137
You don't think so?

478
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,389
What do we do?

479
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,938
I'll try to come up with something.

480
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,056
-Have some coffee.
-Thank you.

481
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,266
Two lines here.

482
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,477
Hey. You should look at your girlfriend
when you say hi.

483
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,104
Do you want a warning?

484
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,983
-Sorry.
-I'll let this slide because you're cute.

485
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,110
Please turn up the music.

486
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,069
Okay.

487
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,904
I'm going to get ready too.

488
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,416
God, this is awesome.

489
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,586
-So embarrassing.
-I know.

490
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,712
It's true.

491
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,130
So annoying.

492
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,506
-Right?
-What?

493
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,523
She can't read the room.

494
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,361
Wow.

495
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,535
We need an agency.
One that can attract top celebrities.

496
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,455
If they do paid pictorials
and make Instagram posts...

497
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,372
Wait...

498
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,125
Are you saying I should beg them

499
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,168
to wear my clothes?

500
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,839
Joseph, things are different
from last season.

501
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,343
Back then, they came on their own,
but that'll be impossible for now.

502
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,845
We can ask influencers for our exposure.

503
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,474
You didn't invite them, saying
it's a fashion show, not a flea market.

504
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,810
Fashion isn't about business.
Why would I do that?

505
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,817
All we have are celebrities and stylists.

506
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,194
If JD wears your clothes

507
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,905
in a pictorial or an Instagram post,

508
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,574
you'll take over
this year's fashion scene.

509
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,869
JD? Hong Ji-seon works for him.

510
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,163
I don't like that woman.

511
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,123
You'll have to from now on.

512
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm getting a call.

513
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,338
PPYOJI

514
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,256
What?

515
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,549
Ji-eun, what's up?

516
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,386
Jjoseph, my only hope.

517
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,554
Please be my savior today.

518
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,472
What?

519
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,730
<i>It's a 30-year-old baker
on Seongbuk-dong hill.</i>

520
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,816
<i>Ms. Ahn lived there for a long time.</i>

521
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,943
<i>And what she misses the most</i>

522
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,153
<i>after moving to Seocho-dong
is that bakery.</i>

523
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,364
<i>Someone as busy as her</i>

524
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,408
<i>can't go back and forth
just for that bread.</i>

525
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,328
<i>She even joked she's getting
depressed from not eating it.</i>

526
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,583
My legs.

527
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,214
Man.

528
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,178
You're just telling me to go straight,
which means I have to keep going uphill.

529
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,047
Sold out?

530
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,134
Yes. Once we run out of ingredients,
we close for the day.

531
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,346
The fig bread is out, but we have
cinnamon rolls left.

532
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,805
These are good too.

533
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,767
Nothing else is of any use to me, sir.

534
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,561
Only the fig bread can save me.

535
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,981
Before sunset,
I need to bring the fig bread!

536
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,318
I told you. We don't have the ingredients,
so I can't make anymore.

537
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,361
God...

538
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,738
No.

539
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,240
Please sir, you can save me.

540
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,161
You make it with these hands.
And the figs...

541
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,538
Where's the supermarket?

542
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,874
I'll go get the figs, okay? Please!

543
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,251
We don't use just random ingredients...

544
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,463
We have a vendor we buy
from in Garak Market.

545
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,257
And I've turned off our oven already.

546
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,927
I'll go. To Garak Market!

547
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,223
So please put the fire back on in the oven

548
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,974
and help me out, I'm begging you.

549
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,435
Here, I'll leave this.

550
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,813
It's as dear to me as my own life.

551
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,190
Your... lifeline?

552
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,608
But it's cut off.

553
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,486
There was an accident...

554
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,658
It's a keepsake from my mother.

555
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:15,037
I'll put it back together somehow,
and that's how important it is to me.

556
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,207
But bringing the fig bread is also
super important to me, sir.

557
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,627
Miss.

558
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,922
If you need it before sunset,

559
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,966
you'd better head out right away.

560
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,678
Thank you so much, sir.

561
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,471
-I'll call for a ride.
-Okay.

562
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,762
Baby.

563
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,390
What happened to your neck? Are you hurt?

564
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,686
It's just a scratch.

565
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,146
It doesn't look like it.

566
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,481
It's red.

567
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,150
Let me see.

568
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,696
The show's about to start.

569
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,532
You're a model on stage,
and I'm the designer.

570
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,493
I know that. Baby, I just...

571
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,161
I'm not your "baby" here!

572
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,752
I'm giving model Ye Seon-ho
a warning as designer Jin Young-soo.

573
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,004
Keep your work and private life separate.

574
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,007
Check this for me.

575
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,925
Okay.

576
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,941
If she slept her way up top,
does she not think she'll be replaced?

577
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,987
Her coffee.

578
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,197
She spilled it!

579
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,615
Her face, that was something.

580
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,450
She made a fool of herself.

581
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,585
Is it fun talking behind my back?

582
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,338
Let me hear it, too.

583
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,884
Yu-jin, why don't you tell me?

584
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,928
What are they saying?

585
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,020
Jung Hye-na, I think
you'd better be the one to tell me.

586
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,189
Seems like you've got a lot to say.

587
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,440
Why should I?

588
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,319
I don't think I need to report to you

589
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,113
about every little thing we say.

590
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,909
Are you trying to be a boss here?
So pathetic.

591
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,494
You're no different from us.

592
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,997
How can we be the same?

593
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,333
You think all models are the same?

594
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,210
Seriously?

595
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,381
Well, technically,
I've walked more runways than you.

596
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:17,136
I auditioned for every show I did,
fair and square.

597
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,387
But as for you...

598
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,519
You sold your body to walk the stage,

599
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,479
That's the difference.

600
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,486
That's how low you want to go, huh?

601
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,113
Wanna see what low looks like?

602
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,740
-Hey!
-You!

603
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,702
-Hey, let me go!
-Stop it!

604
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,580
Let go!

605
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,956
You crazy brat!

606
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,125
Let go!

607
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,254
Let go of me!

608
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,561
Hye-na.

609
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,022
Go get your hair and makeup fixed.

610
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,532
What are you doing?

611
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,535
Are you putting her on stage
after what she did to me?

612
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,703
You can't fight.

613
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,539
Why would you start a fight with her?

614
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,749
Am I being fired?

615
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,085
So that's it?

616
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,211
Your face is a mess.

617
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,089
I can't allow a messed-up model.

618
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:36,965
I'm not an object.

619
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,884
Do you want to keep making a scene?

620
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,971
Go home. See you after the show.

621
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,765
Jin Young-soo.

622
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,601
You think you're so rational and smart.

623
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,519
Seon-ho.

624
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,480
You should've called my name earlier.

625
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,525
And then you should've checked
if I was all right.

626
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,151
But you called me a mess.

627
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,987
You should've consoled me
and comforted me.

628
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,073
At least, when we're alone,

629
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,866
instead of judging me like this,

630
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,951
You idiot!

631
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,745
You should've pretended to take my side!

632
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,755
Thank you.

633
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,980
Sir, I brought the figs!

634
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,358
Wow!

635
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,044
Next, just a little brighter, please.

636
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,594
Okay, that was good.

637
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,366
EDITOR IN CHIEF AHN NAM-HEE

638
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,814
Ms. Editor, where are you going?

639
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,731
You're here.

640
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,236
Looks like she doesn't like the jewelry
and decorative items we prepared,

641
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,279
so she's more on edge than usual.

642
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,574
So I'm going to get some flowers instead.

643
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,492
Oh...

644
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,995
-Let me take care of it.
-Sorry?

645
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,373
She might get upset if you're not around.

646
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,290
Oh...

647
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,001
Then, I'll leave you to it.

648
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,221
Let's take a ten-minute break!

649
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,228
It says Editor-in-chief Ahn Nam-hee.

650
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,732
Must be fresh out of the oven.
It smells amazing.

651
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,913
The flowers are here!

652
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,458
Thank you, Ji-eun.

653
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,882
-Who...
-Oh.

654
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,050
Hello, Ms. Ahn.

655
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,178
I'm Pyo Ji-eun from the PR agency Audrey.

656
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,351
Did you not know
only staff are allowed in here?

657
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,064
Well, it's...

658
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,609
-I'll show you out.
-Oh...

659
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,341
JI WOO-MIN

660
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,259
<i>Call me right after the shoot.</i>

661
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,054
<i>I have to see Ms. Ahn, no matter what.</i>

662
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,801
What?

663
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,718
Why?

664
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,639
No.

665
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,073
Ji Woo-min, what's going on?
The shoot's over?

666
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,908
You're still here?

667
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,870
I told you to call me when it's done.
I have to talk to Ms. Ahn today.

668
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,748
-You texted me?
-Gosh.

669
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,501
You've never been helpful to me, ever!

670
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,089
Let go. Stop fooling around.

671
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,015
Ji-eun.

672
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,684
Here.

673
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,061
Why are you giving me this?

674
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,690
Thank you, Ji-eun. You saved us all today.

675
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,067
We got good photos.

676
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,820
And you saved my life, seriously.

677
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,199
These flowers were really helpful
for the shoot,

678
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,201
and I can finally breathe.

679
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,830
I feel so relieved.

680
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,839
Take a look.

681
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:51,900
AUDREY PYO JI-EUN

682
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,658
Yes, Ms. Oh.

683
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,161
<i>She chose our clothes for JD's pictorial!</i>

684
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,371
<i>Your name came up,</i>

685
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,748
<i>and she said she owed you.
What did you do?</i>

686
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,667
Really?

687
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,460
Oh my gosh.

688
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,254
Pyo Ji-eun... I mean,

689
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,965
Editor-in-Chief Ahn Nam-hee
mentioned my name?

690
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,758
She really said my name?

691
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,344
<i>Don't get too excited!</i>

692
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,471
<i>Hong Ji-seon is still a problem.</i>

693
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,098
Don't worry about Ms. Hong.

694
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,809
I'll make this pictorial successful,
no matter what.

695
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,069
What is this?

696
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,114
Jin Young-soo's
collection theme is violence?

697
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,699
What's with the black eye makeup?

698
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,868
It's not makeup, it's real.

699
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,162
Real?

700
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,498
Fell off the stage?

701
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,876
Not the runway, backstage.

702
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,586
Bosh. For real?

703
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,298
So you walked the runway
looking like that?

704
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,384
Does Jin Young-soo love you that much?

705
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,969
Oh my, how romantic.

706
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,471
I got fired.

707
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,473
Fired?

708
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,269
The great model Ye Seon-ho's kicked out
from the runway?

709
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,938
Jjoseph!

710
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,024
Jjoseph!

711
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,319
Hey, Ms. Ahn Nam-hee mentioned my name!

712
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:20,822
Jjoseph! I have so much to tell you!

713
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,949
Seon-ho, get this...

714
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,587
Cheers!

715
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,009
OB DRAFT BEER

716
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:44,012
I'm sorry that
I'm the only one who's happy today.

717
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,722
At least one of us should be.

718
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,767
How did you turn it around like that?

719
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,519
Was it really because of the bread?

720
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,064
In that case, Ms. Ahn let me down.

721
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,150
It was the bread.

722
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,985
But I also think

723
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,697
my mom was looking down on me
from heaven and helped out.

724
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,534
So what will you be working on
with your role model, Ms. Ahn Nam-hee?

725
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,454
You won't believe this.

726
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,706
What I'll do is...

727
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,875
a pictorial with JD.

728
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,087
-For real?
-Bosh! That JD?

729
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,129
Yes!

730
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,006
But she's with Hong Ji-seon.

731
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,424
You said she's an asshole.

732
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:25,512
Asshole, a-hole, asshat, who cares?
It's JD anyway.

733
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,515
I've got to suck up to
Ms. Hong from now on.

734
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,725
Ms. Hong!

735
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,145
This honor's all thanks to you guys!

736
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,692
You really...

737
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,236
{\an8}CHAMISUL

738
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,219
Hey, Ye Seon-ho!

739
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,015
You're completely wrong this time.

740
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,767
Hey! Tell it to my busted eye.

741
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,271
I wouldn't have let you
on my runway either.

742
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,857
A collection means everything
to the designer.

743
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,735
You guys are too harsh.

744
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,571
Listen to me, you brat.

745
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:28,158
You should be told off
when you do something wrong.

746
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,578
And you have to apologize
for what you did.

747
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,998
You hurry up and go apologize to Mr. Jin.

748
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:39,210
You can't just break up out of anger.
He's probably waiting for you.

749
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,254
Honey, do you love Jin Young-soo?

750
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,089
If you do,

751
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,718
apologize!

752
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,721
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

753
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,515
Why are you two making a fuss
when I'm being calm about it?

754
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,061
Hey.

755
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:59,147
Why aren't you apologizing?

756
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:03,568
You never said sorry to me, not even once.

757
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,778
Am I right?

758
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,405
How could you do that to me?

759
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,828
How could you?

760
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,207
How could you do that to me?

761
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,211
You acted as if you were waiting
to break up with me.

762
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,588
How could you just say "okay,"
without hesitation?

763
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,216
You're drunk.

764
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,260
You were always passive
and indifferent about everything.

765
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,721
When I said "I love you,"
all your response was,

766
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,640
"me too." That was it.

767
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,644
I asked you out first, I kissed you first,

768
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,312
I hugged you first,

769
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,900
and I said we should break up first.

770
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,157
You're a real piece of shit.

771
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,495
I was wrong.

772
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,707
What am I supposed to do?

773
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,501
You want me to wait?

774
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,045
Wait until you feel sure about me?

775
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,131
What do you want from me?

776
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,511
Do you ever think about what I want?

777
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,767
What are you up to this time?

778
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,200
Where did you...

779
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,535
It was under my bed.

780
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,184
It means a lot to you.

781
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,854
It was your mom's.

782
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,154
I'm sorry for insulting a classic,

783
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,200
your mother,

784
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,497
and our memories together.

785
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,249
I'm sorry.

786
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,636
Why was it under Woo-min's bed?

787
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:42,977
Bosh.

788
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:43,937
You two...

789
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,773
slept together?

790
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,906
Is it true?
What's going on between you two?

791
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:58,243
What is this? Friends with benefits?

792
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,328
Sober up, Joseph!

793
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,247
This isn't the time for this, hurry!

794
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,958
We have to go apologize
to Jin Young-soo. Come on!

795
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,919
Quick! What are you doing?
Get the car, already.

796
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,470
Those guys really ride or die.

797
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:26,271
<i>Why did you have to choose me
Among everyone else?</i>

798
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,357
<i>This relationship could've
Passed by casually</i>

799
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,279
<i>And I've never wanted something like this</i>

800
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,646
Oh my gosh, the lights are on.

801
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,482
Okay, be cool and go apologize,

802
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,984
and tomorrow morning,

803
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,862
walk out of there
like you're on the runway.

804
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,530
-Ready?
-It's okay, go.

805
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,615
Right, you look great.

806
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,082
Seon-ho!

807
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,293
-You got this!
-You got this!

808
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,392
Oh my.

809
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,623
Seon-ho, what is it?

810
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,584
You can't do it?
Your pride is getting in the way?

811
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,879
There's some other girl in there.

812
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:16,923
No way.

813
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,018
Let's go.

814
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,063
Screw them!

815
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,277
Hey! Jin Young-soo!

816
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,656
Your collections have been
the same for years,

817
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,117
yet your heart move on this quick?

818
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,412
That's why you can't
make it abroad, you hear me?

819
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,457
Slay. She's going totally
ride-or-die tonight.

820
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,878
And you!

821
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,423
Who are you to get laid
with someone else's man?

822
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,216
Get out here!

823
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,140
Hey.

824
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:08,975
My God.

825
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:30,913
Wait.
