1
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,024
Let's go for round two!

2
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,735
Let's take a picture!

3
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,652
Here we go!

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,404
One, two, three!

5
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,947
-Make a funny face.
-One more!

6
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,825
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

7
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,662
-Huh?
-What?

8
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,917
No...

9
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,595
Run!

10
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,181
Hey, what are you doing?

11
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,724
Get them!

12
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,225
Hey, stop right there!

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,194
Jeez.

14
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,153
Hey, stop!

15
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,242
Hey, to the left!

16
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,544
Stop right there!

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,191
Go down! Quick!

18
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,152
Hey, this thing's on.

19
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,570
-Where are they?
-Find them!

20
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,490
Hey, hurry up!

21
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,368
Are they gone?

22
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,716
-Woo-min.
-What?

23
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,055
Never mind.

24
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,892
Jeez.

25
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,736
Woo-min.

26
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,822
Date me.

27
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,794
-Guys! Woo-min!
-Woo-min, Ji-eun!

28
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,589
-Ppyoji! Where are you?
-Where did she go?

29
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,550
Hey, never mind, I was just kidding.

30
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,720
Where are you guys?

31
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,226
Okay.

32
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,395
Let's date.

33
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,164
Woo-min.

34
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,333
-Ppyoji!
-Woo-min!

35
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,836
Look at them! This is crazy!

36
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,379
-What is it?
-Look at them!

37
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,672
Oh, my God!

38
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,657
<i>I said I only love you</i>

39
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,662
<i>Instead of all the words I had prepared</i>

40
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,539
<i>I'll always be by your side</i>

41
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:13,503
<i>I promise you as I look into the sky</i>

42
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,380
-Woo-min!
-Woo-min!

43
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,269
THE POP-UP SHOP AND THE TAILOR SHOP

44
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,605
How about one more bead?

45
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,692
Excuse me, Mr. Jo.

46
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,986
To work on this sample,

47
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,406
our entire staff
had to work overtime for days.

48
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,200
All the designs you gave us
had to be handmade.

49
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,077
Oh, thank you for your hard work.

50
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,495
Mr. Jo.

51
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,874
I've been running this bag factory
in Seongsu-dong for over 20 years.

52
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,751
Let me give you some advice.

53
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,338
Mr. Jo, your designs are, how do I put it?

54
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,631
Delusional.

55
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,009
You need to make things you can sell.

56
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,345
It's way too different
from the conventional designs.

57
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,639
There's a limit
to straying away from tradition.

58
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,100
I bet this won't sell.

59
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,561
The production cost is similar
to Chanel or Vuitton.

60
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,645
Am I wrong, Mr. Jo?

61
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,563
It's not Mr. Jo.

62
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,898
It's designer Joseph Jean, sir.

63
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,066
What's the difference?

64
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,652
We all put our name on the line
for our business.

65
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,987
Don't you agree, Mr. Jo?

66
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,905
He's Mr. Jo, so I call him that.

67
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,199
See! He's not complaining!

68
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,618
Anyway, Mr. Jo,
if it takes this much work,

69
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,287
we won't make a lot in a month.

70
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,581
Mr. Jo, if you're too stubborn
about your design,

71
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,583
you'll end up going under. So, Mr. Jo-

72
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,131
"Mr. Jo"!

73
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,966
How many times did I hear that?

74
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,718
How dare he decide if it'll sell?

75
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,887
He only made one sample. Such a show-off.

76
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,097
What? It strays away from tradition?

77
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,849
Screw that!

78
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,851
Fashion is about change and evolution.

79
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,020
Esther, what else did he say?

80
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,147
-High-end, sir.
-Highland?

81
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,774
He wouldn't know what high means.

82
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,650
Has he been to Eilean Donan Castle?

83
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,819
What does he know about the Highlands?

84
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,737
Joseph.

85
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,948
Not highland, high-end brand.

86
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,701
That's enough.

87
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,163
He said my design is delusional!

88
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,715
<i>Bosh!</i>

89
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:28,221
I've never seen a purse like this
in my entire life.

90
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,806
Combining various materials,

91
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,101
with the structure, with the volume.

92
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,561
Not just anyone can do this.

93
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,730
You like Alexander McQueen, right?

94
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,148
This would put him to shame.

95
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,110
Yours is something more than high-end!

96
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,697
Don't give up
on your creativity for money.

97
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,199
Just do what you want to do.

98
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,659
Whatever that may be.

99
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,037
Then the world will recognize
how you shine.

100
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,624
Ma'am, if we look at the price point,

101
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,877
the purse's cost-performance ratio
is too low for MR. JOSEPH's clients.

102
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,088
Then make it a special edition.

103
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,382
But what happens if it doesn't get sold?

104
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,925
It'll be a total humiliation.

105
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:11,264
I hope people will get to see
this piece in some way.

106
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,932
Like a pop-up shop?

107
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,267
"A pop-up shop"?

108
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,018
You mean a flash retailer?

109
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,522
It will depend on how we do it,

110
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,190
but it's a good idea.

111
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,703
Excuse me.

112
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,206
Hello, Producer!

113
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,210
Congratulations, Mr. Lee.

114
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,670
Congratulations.

115
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,839
Thank you for coming.

116
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,176
It's a great flagship store
that suits the brand image.

117
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,677
I look forward to your support.

118
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,971
Oh my, hello. It's an honor.

119
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,683
I can't believe
I'm meeting you in person, Ms. Ahn.

120
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:57,894
Will you escort...

121
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,107
You're here, too, Ms. Hong.

122
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,069
How sentimental those colors are.

123
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,407
You just noticed that now?

124
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,163
Woo-min.

125
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,169
This is the photographer
for today's event, Ji Woo-min.

126
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,796
He'll be taking your pictures, too.

127
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,715
We meet again. Nice to see you here.

128
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,595
Yes. Hello.

129
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,306
Do you already know each other?

130
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,976
Let's get started.

131
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,238
Oh gosh, these look so good.

132
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,323
Mr. Lee looks so amazing!

133
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,369
I heard you have great retouching skills.

134
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,246
Please take extra care of the photos.

135
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,205
Sure.

136
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,666
Mr. Lee, the photos look great.

137
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,210
Well, you're perfect in every way, so...

138
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,087
-Great work.
-Thank you.

139
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,383
Thank you.

140
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,094
Don't mention it. I'm just doing my job.

141
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,267
Excuse me, but I have to ask.

142
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,810
Sure, go ahead.

143
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,604
I heard you and Ji-eun broke up.

144
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,983
I wonder why we keep running
into each other lately.

145
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,443
Yes, we did initially.

146
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,028
How do I say this...

147
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,156
It was like a test, so to speak.

148
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,284
When I was with her,

149
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,287
I felt she was different
from other women I'd dated.

150
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,789
But I just needed to be sure.

151
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,377
I thought about it,
and only after we broke up,

152
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,879
I realized that I was right.

153
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,091
So, I'd like to start over.

154
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,051
Shouldn't you apologize first?

155
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,304
You're indeed a good friend.

156
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,349
Thanks for the advice.
I was about to do that.

157
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,603
You and Ji-eun are close friends, right?

158
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,313
May I ask for your support?

159
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,608
I want to do things right this time.

160
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,153
I don't think I can do that.

161
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,449
I'll do my best retouching these.

162
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,794
Is it true
Thierry Henry is coming to Korea?

163
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,592
New World International invited him,

164
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:38,012
begging him to come.
And he wouldn't even listen.

165
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:42,433
Even when they held Asia's first store
launching event in Shanghai,

166
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,810
he never left his atelier in Paris.

167
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,437
So why now?

168
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,565
And secretly, by himself?

169
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:58,449
I know you two have been best friends
since your days at ESMOD.

170
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,580
That's news to me.

171
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,169
I heard that because of his visit,

172
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:14,006
every luxury hotel in Seoul is getting
cancellation or reservation calls.

173
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,801
And you'll find out
in Cheongdam Daily soon.

174
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,303
These hotels have no manners.

175
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,891
Ms. Ahn, you're the one arranging
Thierry Henry's visit, right?

176
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,270
Why are you handling that alone,
when you're so busy?

177
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,191
If you report this to Cheongdam Daily,
the agencies will start lining up,

178
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,777
so that they can host him.

179
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
I mean, it's Thierry Henry.

180
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:41,200
The chief designer of EARLAINE,
the brand that women all over the world

181
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,202
covet the most.

182
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:48,874
A Korean adoptee
and a European fashion icon.

183
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:55,047
That's right. Thierry is coming to Korea.

184
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:55,965
Oh my!

185
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:57,883
What an honor.

186
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,264
As one of the leading
fashionistas in Korea,

187
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,517
I can't express how honored I am.

188
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,980
Do you know anyone
who can manage his accommodation?

189
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,899
Who would say no to accommodating Thierry?

190
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,529
Everyone's trying to make connections
and launch EARLAINE in Korea.

191
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,239
It's a different matter.

192
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,201
We need someone to work with discretion.

193
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:28,122
Someone who can keep it quiet.

194
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,626
-Thierry Henry?
-Hush!

195
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,922
That's right, one of the most famous
Koreans in the world

196
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,300
alongside BTS and Son Heung-min.

197
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,718
Thierry Henry.

198
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,262
He's Korean-French, to be exact.

199
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,056
His designs are always sold out,

200
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,852
and wherever he goes, he becomes
the gossip that are just as shocking.

201
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,522
With no manners, no mercy, no sense,
he's mean, picky, and finicky...

202
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,607
All right, I get it.

203
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,361
He even came second in Tabloid's list
of the rudest celebrities of the year.

204
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,864
That amazing Thierry Henry?

205
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,824
Was he second place, not first?

206
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,201
Come on, Ms. Oh.

207
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,536
So are you in or not?
Just say "goodbye" to him?

208
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,829
-Can I do that?
-You...

209
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,957
You'll have to say bye to me first.

210
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,423
<i>Thierry's visit to Korea is personal
and has nothing to do with EARLAINE.</i>

211
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,593
He doesn't want this to be news in Korea.

212
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,346
He doesn't want any public attention.

213
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,349
He'd like no one to know about this.

214
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,811
Can I ask him for an autograph
or a picture for my Instagram?

215
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:33,979
No.

216
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,024
Of course, absolutely not.

217
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,611
His likes and dislikes are clear,
but they differ from time to time.

218
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,446
He has mood swings too.

219
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,365
When he gets too passionate,

220
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,034
he does unpredictable things.

221
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,330
But that wouldn't happen this time.

222
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,249
His visit will be extremely private.

223
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,042
Take good care of him.

224
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,295
Thank you for your trust, Ms. Ahn.

225
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,340
Excuse me, Ms. Ahn,

226
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,428
does Thierry have a particular reason
for coming to Korea?

227
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,934
He wants to buy a suit.

228
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,189
A custom-made suit.

229
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,068
Do you think this makes any sense?

230
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,320
I guess there's
a world-class tailor in Korea,

231
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,905
who's good enough to attract him.

232
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,616
Ppyoji, this will be
your most glorious moment

233
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,410
in your life as a fashionista.

234
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,704
Of course I respect him,

235
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,583
but I only want to see him
in magazines or the media. He's scary.

236
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,753
He's one of the most creative people
I know in fashion.

237
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,255
He's only known through gossip,

238
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,799
but he actually does
many anonymous charity work.

239
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,636
He takes 40% of his income
and gives it back to society.

240
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,599
Everything from refugee issues
to starvation, and the environment.

241
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,226
To some, he may be a respectable person.

242
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,562
But he's also a complete menace to others.

243
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,733
But that might be just gossip, made up
by those who can't do their jobs right.

244
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,114
Hey, what's so funny?

245
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,409
He's been chuckling all along.
What is it, Woo-min?

246
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,122
Guess who just followed me on Instagram?

247
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,676
There's a campaign
with Dynamic Metropolitan as the theme.

248
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,929
It's a global event held by THE Q.

249
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,014
They want photos by street photographers.

250
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,392
That's why I'm looking
for suitable candidates on Instagram.

251
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,227
WOOMIN_J
FOLLOW

252
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,854
It's an honor.

253
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,648
Want to give it a shot?

254
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,399
You mean, THE Q?

255
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,904
Yes, of course. Thank you!

256
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,238
I'll DM you.

257
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,460
Let's sit down. I ordered for you.

258
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,338
Did you ask me for lunch to nag?

259
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,091
Nagging is for people
who actually listen, Seon-ho.

260
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,676
I'm a troublemaker now?

261
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,969
You ruined a trunk show,

262
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,888
and it made headlines.
So the answer is yes, of course.

263
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,141
The last two scheduled shoots
got canceled.

264
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,603
I'll admit my attitude
wasn't professional as a model.

265
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,271
I deserve punishment.

266
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,607
It seems you messed
with a pretty powerful woman.

267
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,612
Did I? So does that mean
I'm out of work for a while?

268
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,822
Will you apologize?

269
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,033
I have nothing to apologize for.

270
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,827
Good for you, then, Seon-ho.

271
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,246
A powerful woman, huh?

272
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,165
I'm craving champagne.

273
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,961
You brought your company card, right?
Let me order some.

274
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,263
You don't want
Thierry Henry's visit to hit the news.

275
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,806
What?

276
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,099
No way.

277
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,018
You know nothing.

278
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
On YouTube, they say,

279
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,605
you have to dress up to accommodate him.

280
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,247
Welcome, Thierry! Hello!

281
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,714
I'm from AUDREY...

282
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,723
Wait, excuse...

283
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,682
Oh gosh!

284
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,936
-Go!
-Okay, you should go.

285
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,818
MS. AHN

286
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,905
Jeez.

287
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,784
And then there he was,
looking so charismatic.

288
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,411
He had such a unique aura.

289
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,913
Pardon?

290
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,791
You want to speak with him?

291
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,460
The staff member you saw the other day.

292
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,421
She's taking good care of him right now.

293
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,008
Did something happen?

294
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,344
Well, Ms. Ahn,

295
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,680
by any chance, is Thierry allergic to...

296
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,182
No, I mean...

297
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,768
Does he have a trauma with flowers?

298
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,354
Were the flowers pink?

299
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,980
Gosh, how did you know?

300
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,737
Sometimes he panics
at the sight of the color pink.

301
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,908
I guess that's
how much he hates the color.

302
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,758
Thank you.

303
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,803
You saved me from all that pink.

304
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,059
Hello, let me introduce myself again.
I'm Pyo Ji-eun, from AUDREY.

305
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,728
Your Korean's very good.

306
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,442
Anything making you uncomfortable?

307
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,159
I was desperate for this
during the flight.

308
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,871
FINE DUST
VERY BAD

309
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,038
How nice.

310
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,332
So nice!

311
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,003
That hurt.

312
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,143
Passing through!

313
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,621
Are you having fun?

314
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,792
TOFU

315
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,491
-Do you mind taking our...
-One, two...

316
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,493
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

317
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,154
Who is it?

318
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,496
Come on, it's too early.

319
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,126
You have to help me.
Be my driver for a few days.

320
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,378
-Driver?
-Yeah.

321
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,132
Am I your husband? Or your boyfriend?

322
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,759
Neither, but you're my best male friend!

323
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,932
I'm not unemployed anymore.
I've got a job now.

324
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,518
I already asked Mr. Do to excuse you.

325
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,520
I checked you have no plans this week.

326
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,272
He told me you're all mine.

327
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,610
Where are we even going?
I haven't even washed my face yet.

328
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,404
No time. Do it in the car.

329
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,328
What is this? Did you get a new car?

330
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,706
I rented it. I'm doing a one-man
escort service because of Ms. Oh.

331
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,957
"One-man escort"?

332
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,293
I'm escorting Thierry Henry all by myself.

333
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,297
Hey, your hair's a mess. Do something.

334
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,849
Do I really have to wear a suit
while I'm driving?

335
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,935
Dressing up is a must
when escorting Thierry Henry.

336
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,231
Well, you sure have a nice figure.

337
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,444
By the way, you seem like
you've changed a bit lately.

338
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,072
Something feels different.

339
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,407
No, I've always been the same.

340
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,826
What? Do I look more handsome?

341
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,911
It's not that.

342
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,288
Well.

343
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,625
Don't lose this.

344
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,542
You got it?

345
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,752
How much is the pay?

346
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,797
Oh no, Mr. Driver, we're out of budget.

347
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,935
METROPOLITAN RAILWAY MAP

348
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,813
You said I was a driver. So why am I here?

349
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,482
He wants to take the subway.

350
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,609
But I can't drive a train.

351
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,156
I thought you said people can't find out.

352
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,411
All the people passing by
are staring at him.

353
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,634
I wonder why he wants to go
to Cheongnyangni Station by subway.

354
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,513
Well, don't be curious.
Don't ask questions.

355
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:37,559
Just do what the man wants.
That's the point of this escort mission.

356
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,669
Thierry.

357
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,964
I'm good, thank you.

358
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,510
Just try one.

359
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,311
What is it?

360
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,354
It's spicy.

361
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,980
-Spicy?
-It's spicy!

362
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,815
-Hot!
-It's hot?

363
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,733
He says it's hot!

364
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,194
-Not this one?
-Here!

365
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,614
-Hot! It's Hot!
-It's hot?

366
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,241
Hot!

367
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,326
-I'm sorry.
-Run!

368
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,372
EXIT

369
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,189
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,600
PLATFORMS

371
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,942
It's unique and pretty.

372
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,571
Are you launching
a purse line this season?

373
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,488
It's not that.

374
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,158
I just came up with the design.

375
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,534
When is the release date?

376
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,330
If it's Joseph's first purse,
I should be the first customer.

377
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,165
I'm not producing it.

378
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,168
We can't afford the production cost.

379
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,253
I'll just display samples
at a pop-up shop.

380
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,213
For my customers.

381
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,342
A purse that not even loyal customers
of Joseph can purchase.

382
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,678
A purse you can't buy,
a design you can't have.

383
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,221
What's the point of that?

384
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,681
I know.

385
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,184
You came up with a great design,

386
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,103
and yet you'll take away the chance
to buy it just because it's expensive?

387
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,190
You have to try everything.
That's more like you.

388
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,363
Oh, this one is good.

389
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,323
I like this too.

390
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,453
That pose is too much.
It's only a local brand.

391
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,455
Seon-ho!

392
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,084
Let's take five.

393
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,043
Okay.

394
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,878
Why are you so surprised?

395
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,506
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.

396
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,133
Why not? I can't come to the studio
I used to shoot at?

397
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,683
Didn't Mr. Gang tell you?

398
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,394
That I got cut off? Yeah, he did.

399
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,687
I just came to see you.

400
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,814
God, I was worried.

401
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,735
Anyway, who are they?
They don't look like models.

402
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,154
-Influencers.
-Influencers?

403
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,740
Twenty K.

404
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,242
Thirty-two. Forty-one.

405
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,369
And this one's, 70K.

406
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,372
Look who's here!

407
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:31,376
Did you have to look for yourself
that the influencers replaced you?

408
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,002
Ma'am.

409
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,675
What do you think? Do you feel threatened?

410
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,220
If we just take a few pictures with them,

411
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,098
and they do Instagram postings
for purchase orders,

412
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,100
I'll be in business 24 hours a day.

413
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,603
The sales from your magazine shoots

414
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,397
is nothing compared to them.

415
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,775
So you're a saleswoman?

416
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,279
Ye Seon-ho, you may be a famous model,

417
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,575
but in the fashion industry,
people always flock to what's new.

418
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,619
So, all the things you have

419
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,165
could also mean you're outdated,
don't you think?

420
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,334
How many followers do you have?

421
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,221
Come on.

422
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,348
You will go somewhere, not me.

423
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,600
Us?

424
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:33,396
My friend Ahn Nam-hee prepared
a beautiful Korean meal for me tonight.

425
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,566
I'm on a diet.

426
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,152
Also, I'm not familiar with local food.

427
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,280
What was that thing we ate earlier?

428
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,239
<i>Tteokbokki</i>?

429
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,700
Yeah, that one, I was so shocked.

430
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,495
That's why I'm done eating today.

431
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,497
Sorry, we didn't mean...

432
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,876
I don't want to disappoint my friend,

433
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,169
so you should go there

434
00:29:56,252 --> 00:30:00,715
and help me enjoy
that delicious feast from here.

435
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,395
-Did you get what he meant?
-Yup.

436
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,439
He'll just enjoy with his eyes.

437
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,357
What?

438
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,953
So spicy, I hate you! But you're cute.

439
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,958
It's so tasty.

440
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,793
Is it good?

441
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,214
Look how pretty that is!

442
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,971
It's hot!

443
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,182
Thank you!

444
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,270
Wow, the food looked and tasted great.

445
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,314
But I can't eat another bite.

446
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,817
Here, your paycheck for the day.

447
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,991
Are you still seeing that guy?

448
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,034
Who? Nam-jin?

449
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,620
Wow, this is so good.

450
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,206
What does it matter to you
if I'm with him or not?

451
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,837
Well, you broke up, so I was wondering
if you still had feelings for him.

452
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,425
I certainly misunderstood him.

453
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,970
He tried to take me as I am,

454
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,016
but I thought I had to change
who I was to better fit him.

455
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,225
So that was difficult.

456
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,065
Why? You worried
I'll start seeing him again?

457
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:41,983
No.

458
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,402
I'm just curious as a friend.

459
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,739
Maybe he's a great guy,

460
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,117
and I just didn't think
to look deeper into him.

461
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,789
If he turns out to be a bad guy,
you'd better have my back as my friend.

462
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,791
Why should I?

463
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,960
You have Seon-ho, too.

464
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,255
Seon-ho fights way better than me.

465
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,800
No way.

466
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:12,013
When our class lost at soccer
on sports day, things got scary.

467
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,182
I bet she even made some of the boys cry.

468
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,768
That's my friend Seon-ho, indeed.

469
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,186
And then she insisted to play

470
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,688
in the next game herself,
in a boys-only match.

471
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,273
But she's not a boy!

472
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,652
That's crazy.
She's really something, isn't she?

473
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,070
Ji-eun.

474
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,781
Hey, Nam-jin.

475
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,703
We're surely running
into each other often.

476
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,207
Did you have a meeting
around here or something?

477
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,417
Yes, I had dinner
with my college professors.

478
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,044
We had some drinks as well.

479
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,505
Looks like it. Your cheeks are red.

480
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,548
Just a few drinks.

481
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,551
I know a good place for a walk nearby.

482
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,762
If you're okay,
would you like to go with me,

483
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,097
and have a talk?

484
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,891
Oh, sure.

485
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,186
Woo-min, you should go on ahead.

486
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,397
No.

487
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,483
You have to transfer twice
on the subway to get home.

488
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,943
I'll wait.

489
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,528
I'll take her home.

490
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,490
Hey, I'm not a kid. I can take a cab.

491
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,619
I say mean things sometimes,
but I'm grateful for you, friend.

492
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,498
If it weren't for you,
I would've been exhausted today.

493
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,166
See you tomorrow, Woo-min.

494
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,002
Let's go.

495
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,722
Ji-eun.

496
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,557
Yes?

497
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,978
What is it? Did I forget something?

498
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,195
Go home early.

499
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,655
Go on, Woo-min.

500
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,170
I should apologize,

501
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,756
so that I can ask you to start over again.

502
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,674
Apologize?

503
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,010
I broke up with you back then

504
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,888
because I wanted to know more about you.

505
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,850
To see if you were dating me
because you needed me,

506
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,852
or because you liked me.

507
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,815
So, have you found an answer?

508
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,696
I know for sure that you didn't date me
just because you needed my help.

509
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,949
You mean

510
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,579
you're not so sure
whether I liked you or not?

511
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,002
Will you give me a chance
to figure that out?

512
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,757
It's so weird to see you
being so forward like this.

513
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,301
I like you a lot, Ji-eun.

514
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,974
I'm sure
I'll figure it out soon with your help.

515
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,816
Thank you for being honest with me.

516
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,336
<i>I thought about it,
and only after we broke up, I realized.</i>

517
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,713
So, I'd like to start over.

518
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,550
I want to do things right this time.

519
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:25,391
PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK

520
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,082
CHAT
SIGNED BY A FAMOUS DESIGNER? WHO?

521
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,751
I'LL TAKE IT IF IT'S FREE

522
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,919
JOSEPH... WHO'S THAT?

523
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,337
WHO'S JOSEPH?

524
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,255
Shoot, no one's buying.

525
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,840
Huh?

526
00:36:59,091 --> 00:36:59,926
What's this?

527
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,731
Next.

528
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,236
Next.

529
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,370
Thank you all for today.

530
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,206
We'll contact you individually
regarding the results.

531
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,132
You didn't like any of them?

532
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,219
Maybe just this one?

533
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,428
And the male models?

534
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,514
I want someone completely new.

535
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,226
Never-seen-before kind of new.

536
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,312
That way, it won't draw
attention away from the bag.

537
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,855
Should I search on Instagram?

538
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,278
I've got your DM.

539
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,405
Do you need a model for a pop-up shop?

540
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,743
Nice to see you here, sir!

541
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,245
Let's see your walk.

542
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,329
All right!

543
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,984
What are those old photos
he keeps looking at?

544
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,570
Why does he keep tracking down
the places in the photos?

545
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,449
What if he didn't come here
for a tailored suit,

546
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,659
but actually to find his birth mother?

547
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,414
He's retracing the steps
he used to take with his mom.

548
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,083
He does seem a bit sentimental,

549
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,794
and hesitant, too, from behind.

550
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,176
GYEONGGANG STATION

551
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,886
GYEONGGANG LOUNGE

552
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,355
It's been a long time
since trains ran at this station.

553
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,607
Now, they run rail bikes here.

554
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,508
Sorry, Thierry, I think
you should take off your glasses.

555
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,385
Lots of young people come here.

556
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,677
They'll recognize you.

557
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,137
I'm Thierry Henry.

558
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,223
I'm just being who I am!

559
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,563
But you said you wanted to come here.

560
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,024
-Wait, isn't that...
-It's him!

561
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,776
-Wow.
-Hey, take a picture of him.

562
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,069
Hey, who's that? What?

563
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,153
Excuse me,

564
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,240
did you just take pictures?
Please delete them.

565
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,326
I was taking pictures
of him, Thierry Henry, not you.

566
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,495
Nonsense, that's my uncle.

567
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,746
Look, I was right!

568
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,997
-See?
-It's his glasses!

569
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,749
-You're wrong.
-That's him!

570
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,127
No pictures, please. Please delete these.

571
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,294
My niece, let's go.

572
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,838
That's him, right?

573
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,215
-It's him, it is!
-For real?

574
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,762
Oh my gosh, ouch!

575
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,930
That hurt!

576
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,890
Wait, please, you can't take pictures.

577
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,146
No pictures!

578
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,065
No! I'm her uncle!

579
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,567
He's my uncle! My uncle!

580
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,011
Thierry, it's okay.

581
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,930
We checked everyone there
and made them delete the photos.

582
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,350
We asked them not to upload
the pictures online.

583
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,351
So...

584
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,406
I really don't know what to do.

585
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,036
He just changed his schedule, saying
he wants to go back to Paris right away.

586
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,456
Isn't that good if he's leaving
earlier than scheduled?

587
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:44,043
I have no idea what kind of escort
I'm doing right now.

588
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,795
He sobbed all the way back from Gapyeong.

589
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,924
No matter how much I comforted him,
he wouldn't stop.

590
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,010
He hasn't even mentioned
anything about getting a suit.

591
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,679
So, you're just going to let him go?

592
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,680
My guess is,

593
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,643
he's looking for his mother,
his birth mother.

594
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,104
If that's the case, I'd like to help him,

595
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,482
but I'm hesitant to bring that up.

596
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,818
You seem to be having
a hard time with this, Ji-eun.

597
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,155
So I went to see Ms. Ahn.

598
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,032
She gave me this.

599
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,243
What is this? An old magazine?

600
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,037
Read it.

601
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,793
{\an8}VINCENT CHA
THIERRY HENRY'S ESMOD CLASSMATE

602
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,051
I think
it's not his birth mother, but his...

603
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,691
Welcome, how can I help you?

604
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,651
Well.

605
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,945
We're here for a custom suit.

606
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,406
We're having dinner
with both of our parents.

607
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,741
It's for a special occasion.

608
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,493
This way, I'll measure you first.

609
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,925
I didn't know
there was a tailor shop here.

610
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,927
I saw in a magazine article

611
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,640
that you graduated
from a famous design school in Europe.

612
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,811
I didn't graduate.

613
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,397
Why? It must've been
difficult to get into.

614
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,567
The desirable way's
to cut your pants at the point

615
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,277
where your ankle bone shows a bit.

616
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,571
-Will that be okay?
-Well...

617
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,366
Yes, that sounds good.

618
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,370
Everyone prefers
ordinary things like this, right?

619
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,331
My father did, too.

620
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,250
Anything different from everyone else

621
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,419
was something he couldn't accept.

622
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,587
So I'm here in Korea.

623
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,591
You must've been sad.
That must've been your dream.

624
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,010
Still, I got my father's tailor shop.

625
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,722
And I've been making
suits for his old customers

626
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,768
and their children for happy occasions,

627
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,687
hoping that I could help
make them a little happier.

628
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,232
I wonder what kind of happiness
I'll get from this suit.

629
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,319
You wear a suit
on meaningful days of your life.

630
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,656
I think you might be my last customer.

631
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,493
I'll sew each
and every knot for your suit,

632
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,828
so that you can look
perfect at the dinner.

633
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,664
"Last customer"?

634
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,832
Tailored suits aren't popular anymore.

635
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,419
Off-the-shelf suits are good and cheaper.

636
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,798
Custom suits take days in the making.

637
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,883
They're only popular
among a few loyal fans.

638
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,385
We're closing down.

HAE-JUN TAILOR SHOP
CHA HAE-JUN

640
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,814
I was thinking you'd need
to change your return flight again.

641
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,654
No, this is good enough for me.

642
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,324
{\an8}I just wanted to check
some things out for myself.

643
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,992
That's enough for me.

644
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,247
But if you go like this, I'll be so sad.

645
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:16,088
This was the best I could do
while sticking to the rules you told me.

646
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,686
They're closing down soon.

647
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,580
This is the answer I can give you.

648
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,751
I won't be rescheduling.

<i>I mostly just sow on lapels,</i>

652

<i>Whenever I think of you,</i>

654
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,048
<i>I go to Seoul
and buy a French fashion magazine,</i>

655
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:47,012
{\an8}<i>and that's the one thing
I enjoy doing the most.</i>

HAE-JUN TAILOR SHOP

669
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,205
Welcome.

670
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:33,327
When you're done with the suit,
please send it to this address.

671
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,079
I don't think that'll work.

672
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,459
Customized suits require a fitting.

673
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,671
You'll have to come to see me again.

674
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,770
Pop-ups are usually about leaving
an impression that lingers on.

675
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,731
When people at the pop-up shop
see the bags on display,

676
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,566
what would they think?

677
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,277
Their first impression would be "pretty."

678
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,696
And it will linger on,
making them want it, maybe?

679
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,577
Then should we give
people those impressions?

680
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,246
That lingering impression...

681
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,626
Esther, get the design sketches.

682
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,546
Let's go by scooter.

683
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,932
Why are we going to the fabric market
in Sinseol-dong all of a sudden?

684
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,768
We'll make tote bags
with my design sketches on them.

685
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,687
Joseph!

686
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,523
Joseph, I like you so much!

687
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,609
Bosh. I like you too, Esther!

688
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,469
Now, that's more like Joseph.

689
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,973
This pop-up seems like a sign of promise.

690
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,558
You release the design,

691
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,935
promising that
it will be released one day.

692
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,104
Right, I'm making a promise to the world.

693
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,400
It's not like I can do it at the moment,
but I'll make it happen someday.

694
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,570
-Well, I hope your fans are patient.
-Gosh, seriously?

695
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,697
As long as it's not too late, Joseph.

696
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,575
Where's Woo-min?
This is a historical moment.

697
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,077
Today's an important day for Woo-min, too.

698
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,926
Thierry, what is he...

699
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,053
Thierry? Holy cow!

700
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,400
How come Thierry's here with you?

701
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,944
For the EARLAINE launch.
I've been interested in it.

702
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,323
With Ms. Ahn's help,
I was able to have a meeting with him.

703
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,951
One of his conditions
for the meeting was to bring him here.

704
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,578
-Nice to meet you.
-Me, too.

705
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,205
Hello.

706
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,956
Hello, Seon-ho.

707
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,752
You said he freaks out
at the mere sight of pink, right?

708
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,796
It's like Ms. Ahn mentioned,

709
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,548
"it changes from time to time."

710
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:38,929
Hello, everyone.

711
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,019
Oh my, that bag?

712
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,731
You're crazy!

713
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,569
I'm about to be a bad guy.

714
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,654
I'm gonna snatch it!

715
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:12,754
This is mine!

716
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,806
Now, let me introduce to you, Mr. Joseph!

717
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,310
Joseph!

718
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,896
Look this way!

719
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,190
Thank you! Wow!

720
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,048
Aside from these two,
please send me the rest my way.

721
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,801
Sure.

722
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,428
Thank you.

723
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,555
But it's not up to me
to get them published.

724
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,682
-Good work.
-Thank you.

725
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:17,444
I felt like Thierry was isolating himself
behind these tall, solid walls,

726
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,697
and now he's overcome them.
I'm so happy for him.

727
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,908
He showed his true self to you,

728
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,911
because you did a great job.

729
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,291
As the saying goes,
sincerity is often met with sincerity.

730
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,792
I like that.

731
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,923
I hope the same goes for my sincerity.

732
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,260
How about it?

733
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:46,473
I want something more than casual dating
with you this time.

734
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,599
An official date.

735
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,646
I want to sincerely convey how I feel.

736
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,827
My hand's cold.
Are you going to leave me hanging?

737
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,045
Please?

738
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,238
I HOPE THIS IS THE PERFECT SUIT
FOR THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND

739
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,515
I didn't know this place was so pretty.

740
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,184
Too bad it's just a pop-up shop.

741
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,398
What's with the look?

742
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,151
You look like you've got
a lot on your mind today.

743
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,489
I'm just tired.
I had a guest to escort, you know.

744
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,826
The pop-up runs until next week.

745
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,495
Why did Woo-min insist on
meeting us out here this late?

746
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,747
All of us together.

747
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,083
Today's the opening day.
He's being a loyal friend.

748
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,253
Wait here just a sec.

749
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,047
I've got to call my dad for a bit.

750
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,090
Sure, I'll wait here.

751
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,259
You're pretty today.

752
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,553
Your makeup's great.

753
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:50,805
What's with you?

754
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,753
Hey, Woo-min.

755
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,630
What's up with you?

756
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,882
Did you go to a wedding?

757
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,384
You're all dressed up.

758
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,637
Are you falling for me
for looking so handsome?

759
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,682
You must've not looked in the mirror.
Which part is handsome?

760
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,436
Look around and take pictures, too.

761
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,315
This is Joseph's pop-up shop
that even Thierry Henry fell in love with!

762
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:53,368
Do you remember this necktie?

763
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,999
Have you kept it?

764
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,587
I...

765
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,259
I'd like to go back to how I used to feel.

766
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,223
Let's stop being friends.

767
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,309
Don't you know how I feel?

768
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,355
You were never just a friend.

769
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,400
I've always seen you as my girl.

770
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,700
Let's start over, Ji-eun.

771
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:15,909
Ji-eun.

772
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,544
Do you think I'm a joke?

773
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,341
Did you think I'd be happy

774
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,468
if you asked me to start over?

775
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,060
Let's just stop being friends.
