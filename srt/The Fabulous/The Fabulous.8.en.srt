1
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,982
I've been saving
this champagne for you guys.

2
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,319
It's so good, Madame Jang.

3
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,530
Thank you for having us.

4
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,656
Where's Joseph?

5
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,535
-Should I go get him?
-No, just let him be, Ji-eun.

6
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,538
Artists go through moments like this.

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,791
The pain of creativity
that makes one isolate.

8
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,421
This is just a phase
for him to grow even more.

9
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:51,593
I'm sure my son will walk out of there
in the coolest way.

10
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,138
He won't miss the press conference, right?

11
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,390
He has to be there.

12
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,559
He'll be there.

13
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,562
A fashion field? It's more like passion.

14
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,983
What's more exciting
than the thrill that comes from passion?

15
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,361
That's what makes me keep working.

16
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,489
That's why we're serious about fashion.

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,158
And that's why we are friends.

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,705
Now, how could I resist
rooting for you guys?

19
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,373
All right. All together now!

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,084
-Okay, cheers!
-Cheers!

21
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,001
Jjoseph!

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,095
Madame Jang, I hope he's not sleepwalking.

23
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,180
Hey, Josephina!

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,814
Jjoseph, you okay?

25
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,775
What happened
to the pain of creativity? Is it over?

26
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,652
What's the boombox for?

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,867
My collection's

28
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,036
opening.

29
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,042
FASHION AND PASSION

30
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,096
{\an8}You'll be in charge
of this launching show, Ji-eun.

31
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,597
Me?

32
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,141
You're perfect for it.

33
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,018
Thanks to your escorting Thierry
last time,

34
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,771
Earlaine has entrusted us with this.

35
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,357
It's because you did such a great job.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,443
It would have been impossible
without your support.

37
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,823
I'll make sure to use everything
you've taught me until now.

38
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,241
Exactly!

39
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,826
That's what I'm talking about!

40
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,920
Okay, attention!

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,385
The global luxury brand
Earlaine's newest line,

42
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:04,350
Earlaine J will be holding
its very first launching event in Korea.

43
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:09,689
I am proud to announce that
all of Earlaine J's Korean marketing

44
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,401
will be done by us, Audrey.

45
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,864
Now, let's hear the details
from our chief manager, Pyo Ji-eun,

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,992
who'll be in charge of this project.

47
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,121
The event comprises the official
launching announcement of Earlaine J,

48
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,415
the press conference to introduce

49
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,085
the creative director, the Earlaine J
Collection show, and the after party.

50
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,131
The VIPs for each event will be
individually escorted by different teams,

51
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
so please keep this in mind.

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,301
And...

53
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,639
I ask for your support. I'll do my best.

54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,187
Ji-eun, I'm a little nervous.

55
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,691
Will we miss the days
when we had to do all the legwork?

56
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,860
No, never!

57
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,031
Just don't forget
the passion we had back then.

58
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,993
This is exactly why I like you.

59
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,669
We still have 20% left. The design
for the finale isn't even done yet.

60
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,421
I just had a feeling.

61
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,131
I'll screw this up.

62
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,802
No, we only have 20% left.

63
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,054
Don't you remember, Joseph?

64
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,474
You're always like this at this stage
when preparing for a collection.

65
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,517
Am I?

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,146
Am I doing okay?

67
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,483
Totally.
You're doing an even better job this time.

68
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,863
I do this every time, but it's always new,
dreadful, and clueless.

69
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,616
Even if I create the story and drawings,
it's useless

70
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,618
if the fabric doesn't match the design.

71
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,538
Even the pattern and volume
look different every time.

72
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,373
Gosh!

73
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,958
There's so much work to do,

74
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,751
but my head's just...

75
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,754
my brain's refusing to do its job.

76
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,300
You've been skipping meals, too.
What you need right now is...

77
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,136
A venti strawberry frappuccino.

78
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,178
Extra whipped cream?

79
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,447
You'll be out on the streets?

80
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,364
Well.

81
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,908
Sounds weird when you put it that way.

82
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,286
What's the difference, you punk?

83
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,788
No one cares
about street photography here.

84
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,124
You can't make a living.

85
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,044
Just stay as you are,
and work here for a few more years.

86
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,628
I like the streets.

87
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,757
Fashion photography is about connections.

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,258
You've never been an assistant,

89
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,762
so there's no way a part-time retoucher
can get a chance.

90
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,723
I'll build my portfolio from the streets.

91
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,933
It's going to be tough,

92
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,686
but I'm still young.

93
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,324
Have you been busy?

94
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,618
It's a big event,

95
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,745
so there's a lot of work and pressure.

96
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,748
You haven't been able to rest.

97
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,625
That's no big deal.

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,877
Leading a big event
like this was my dream.

99
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,338
My dream's finally coming true.

100
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,923
I'm over the moon right now.

101
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,720
Then that's a relief.

102
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,847
What did you talk about with Mr. Do?

103
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,354
I told him I'm leaving after this event.

104
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,022
Really?

105
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,526
I thought you started
enjoying your work there.

106
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,196
I want to go abroad
and start street photography.

107
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,991
No one will recognize my work,
and it'll be quite competitive,

108
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,202
but I want to learn more.

109
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,957
-That means you'll be...
-Only for the fashion week season.

110
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,293
Just a sec.

111
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,175
-What's up, Do-young?
-<i>Where are you right now?</i>

112
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,095
<i>What do I do? I'm really...</i>

113
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,641
Welcome.

114
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,312
Do-young, what's wrong? What happened?

115
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,606
Woo-min.

116
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,817
What do I do?

117
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,861
Man.

118
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,782
I got in.

119
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,367
Hey!

120
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,161
I'm going to make my debut!

121
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,580
I passed the Seoul Collection!

122
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,208
I'm going to debut as a model.

123
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,752
A bright future is waiting for me.

124
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,172
Woo-min, I'm going to keep my promise.

125
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,134
Even if a top photographer wants
to work with me, I'll only work with you.

126
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,760
I'll make you a star.

127
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,014
That will be a bit difficult.

128
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,809
He's going to be a busy man,
traveling around the world.

129
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,437
Woo-min, what does that mean?

130
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,105
Your girlfriend?

131
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,024
Hello.

132
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,444
Will you introduce me?

133
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:11,407
This is Woo-min,
my exclusive photographer. And this is...

134
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,329
His girlfriend.

135
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,830
Right!

136
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
You guys should come together.

137
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,504
A runway show would be more fun
than waiting for a bright future.

138
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,507
These are really hard to get. Thank you.

139
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,592
We'll get going.

140
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,470
This is to congratulate you
on landing the show.

141
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,222
Congratulations.

142
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,557
You really didn't have to.

143
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,686
Treat her well, and be faithful to her.

144
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,732
-See you.
-Goodbye.

145
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,569
What did she say?

146
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,654
Well.

147
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,531
She said you're pretty.

148
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,746
-I'm so proud of you, Woo-min.
-For what?

149
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,333
You're finally pursuing your dream
and trying to settle in.

150
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,547
I support you chasing after your dream.

151
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,758
-So don't worry about what I think.
-You wanna go too?

152
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,468
I'm a busy woman.

153
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,138
Drive safe, and text me when you're home.

154
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,352
You should let go of my hand.

155
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,693
Goodnight.

156
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,033
While you're away,

157
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,120
you need to face time me
all the time, got it?

158
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,625
Why? Miss me already?

159
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,795
What am I supposed to do?
Bring me with you in your pocket.

160
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,680
Good, Seon-ho.

161
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,356
I don't like your angular face.

162
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,484
I can't believe you're modeling
when you look like this.

163
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,278
So annoying.

164
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,531
Seon-ho,

165
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,618
your overall vibe is full of energy.
I love this.

166
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,830
I think it'd be better
to take the other two out, seriously.

167
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,082
Do you know
there are different kinds of models?

168
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,377
There's the beauty type
and the alien face type.

169
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,962
You're the alien face type.

170
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,173
And you too!

171
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,592
Did you think you were the beauty type?

172
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,302
Then what kind are you?

173
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,013
A rotten tongue type?

174
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,725
Photographers like him still exist?

175
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,436
I thought they've been cleaned out.

176
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,813
More cleaning needs to be done.

177
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,398
Seon-ho.

178
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,318
Are you saying this to me?

179
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,028
I believe so.

180
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,324
You think you've got enough experience
to act like the king of the hill?

181
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,411
This is why you always become
the gossip in Cheongdam Daily!

182
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,581
-Seon-ho.
-Do you want to be part of it, too?

183
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,291
-What?
-Ye Seon-ho.

184
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,543
I bought you coffee.

185
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,296
Cold!

186
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,173
Oh no, what do I do?

187
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,592
Who on earth are you?

188
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,636
Me? I'm Jo Gang-woo.

189
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,305
I'm her manager
and the director of her documentary.

190
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,724
We're filming her documentary right now.

191
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,227
Finally, we got drama!

192
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,770
Did you catch that?

193
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,438
Yes, I caught everything.

194
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,441
You don't take photos
with your mouth, do you?

195
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,902
Keep your mouth shut during shoots

196
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,987
if you don't want your teeth knocked out.

197
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,156
Great work, everyone.

198
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,241
-Great job!
-Great job!

199
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,284
Seon-ho, I was just kidding.

200
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,328
It was just a joke!

201
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,164
How could you film this
without telling me? Please delete it!

202
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,361
Pick up, please.

203
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,029
He's driving me insane.

204
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,782
Ji-eun, what in the world is going on?

205
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,825
Is Jjoseph not here?

206
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,619
He's not picking up his phone.
What if he went off the grid?

207
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,873
I don't think
he can face reporters right now.

208
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,584
We shouldn't have forced him
right before the collection.

209
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,877
I know, but still.

210
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,879
It's a live broadcast. What do we do?

211
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,507
First, take care of the reporters.
We need to go with plan B.

212
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,592
"Plan B"?

213
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,303
Will the global HQ be okay with that?

214
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,768
WAITING ROOM
JOSEPH

215
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,122
It's all over.

216
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,375
No point in being a designer
and doing a press conference.

217
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,545
The collection's just around the corner
and no finale yet.

218
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,923
You've finished everything but the finale.

219
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,509
You always work on the finale
until the very end.

220
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
Look at all your ideas.

221
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,971
They are all beautiful and shiny.

222
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,056
Right?

223
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,517
Especially number four,
with the color and volume.

224
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,644
That one's definitely for Seon-ho.

225
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,438
I agree.

226
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,982
Make sure to put that on Seon-ho, okay?

227
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,692
Ji-eun.

228
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,904
I'm sorry, I ruined everything.

229
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,990
But I really can't go.

230
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,910
I know how hard you prepared for this,

231
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,703
but I...

232
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,915
I'm not here to get you.

233
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,002
Then why?

234
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,588
Because you seem to need a friend.

235
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,717
Bosh. But the press conference?

236
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,972
I got someone to do it for you.

237
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,650
It's Thierry!

238
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,407
<i>Thierry.</i>

239
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,536
Jjoseph can't attend
today's press conference.

240
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,623
He's under a lot of pressure
preparing for his collection.

241
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,255
He's just like me!

242
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,841
He's my perfect other half!

243
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,929
I knew we shared
the same kind of creativity, but this too?

244
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,807
I didn't show up
for the Earlaine launch either.

245
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,437
"I don't wanna go!"

246
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,862
A designer only needs to prove
themselves through their collection.

247
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,407
It's the celebrities' job
to get photographed by journalists.

248
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,256
I present to you

249
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,593
the new face of Earlaine in Asia,

250
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,845
Earlaine J!

251
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,149
<i>And the first creative director
to lead Earlaine J,</i>

252
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,278
<i>Designer Joseph Jean Se-pyeong!</i>

253
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,747
See? Look at how many likes you got.
You still think you're not enough?

254
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,833
Look at those comments.
Everyone's proud of you.

255
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,295
So what? The studio is a mess.

256
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,173
Come on, only you are thinking that.

257
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,008
This is amazing!

258
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,719
Whatever comes to mind,
just improvise. Ride or die.

259
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,263
How is this a mess?
This is who you are, Jjoseph!

260
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,434
I gave everyone a hard time today, right?

261
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,686
You kind of did.

262
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,232
But everyone understands.

263
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,110
Thierry also relates
to the pressure you were under,

264
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,612
and he respects you as a designer.

265
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,030
He said that?

266
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,744
Slay, this is such bosh.

267
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,956
You guys are here to tease me.

268
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,126
There's just nothing better.
Come here, you!

269
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,628
-Okay, Joseph, cry.
-Say cheese!

270
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,130
Come on, stop it.

271
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,673
Stop it! It's okay, Joseph.

272
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,300
-Wow, you look ugly.
-Come on!

273
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,928
Go home now!

274
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,681
I need to finish Seon-ho's dress
for the finale. I'm busy.

275
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,392
It'll be the best one.

276
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,769
None of you come in until I call.

277
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,316
Let's go.

278
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,777
Gosh.

279
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,362
-Let's go!
-Huh?

280
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,119
Thank you.

281
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,752
Yes, Ms. Oh.

282
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,296
I came by the office and got what we need.

283
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,548
I think you can go straight to the venue.

284
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,472
Why is he so late?

285
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,267
Wait for me!

286
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,983
RESERVED

287
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,237
Esther, has everything been checked?

288
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,363
Except for the finale.

289
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,158
We couldn't miss the details,
so everyone worked all night.

290
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,618
Slay.

291
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,204
Right, we can't give up on the details.

292
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,623
Will it be ready before the show starts?

293
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,957
Speaking of which,

294
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,834
can you prepare without me?

295
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,837
Slay! How do I prepare
the collection without you?

296
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,132
I gotta go to the workshop
in order to make the finale on time.

297
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,845
It'll be fine. Ji-eun's there too.

298
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,389
I'll get it and be there on time,
no matter what.

299
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,976
Okay, leave it to me, Esther.

300
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,066
Now, get going, Joseph.

301
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,444
We're going to be awesome today.

302
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,706
Ms. Pyo.

303
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,208
Mr. Do, you're here.

304
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,044
Wow, how nerve-racking.

305
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,380
Ms. Pyo, even I'm nervous today.

306
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,758
I'm going to the showroom
to set up the cameras.

307
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,052
Thank you for the hard work.

308
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,179
It must be hectic.

309
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,890
I'll leave it to you, Woo-min.

310
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,060
The photos and videos
you take today will be in the press kit

311
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,479
sent to the fashion magazines
around the globe.

312
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,816
I'll make sure to capture
the real and raw backstage.

313
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,693
You dressed up.

314
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,362
I'm here as staff,

315
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,365
but also as Joseph's best friend
and a guest.

316
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,450
Not because of the after-party?

317
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,953
I'll check the backstage.

318
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,831
ENTRANCE

319
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,499
So handsome.

320
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,543
Whose boyfriend are you, Ji Woo-min?

321
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,795
Your boyfriend.

322
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,181
Yes, Ms. Oh. I'll be there in a sec.

323
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,310
-Seon-ho's here!
-Seon-ho!

324
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,394
Hello!

325
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,229
-Hello!
-Seon-ho!

326
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,522
How have you been?

327
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,858
-You were so amazing.
-You are so cool.

328
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,903
Seon-ho, you were so amazing.

329
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,113
What's this? It's not like you guys.

330
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,325
Your great work
is all over Cheongdam Daily!

331
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,160
"More cleaning needs to be done."

332
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,789
Hey, you're making me sound like a thug.

333
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,876
It's such a relief to have
a veteran like you backing us up.

334
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,212
-Right.
-It really is.

335
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,007
Great.

336
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,190
I heard the budget
for Earlaine's marketing campaign

337
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,816
was in the billions.

338
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,985
The global fashion world's watching Seoul,

339
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,320
so that's nothing.

340
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,657
Is the commercial plan already out too?

341
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,618
Right, did the global HQ say yes?

342
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,871
The campaign plan will come out
right after the collection.

343
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,209
We, Audrey, are incredibly busy.

344
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,419
So, I won't have time

345
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:59,341
to have caviar and champagne
with you anymore.

346
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,928
If the plan hasn't come out yet,

347
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,683
it means there's no ambassador yet.
Who's going to decide?

348
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,685
Thierry? Or Joseph?

349
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,770
Ambassador?

350
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,855
Oh! JD?

351
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,734
How confusing.
Who do I need to get along with?

352
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:22,072
Thierry is with Ms. Ahn.
Joseph is with Ji-eun.

353
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,949
I don't think so.

354
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,036
Who do you think communicates
with Earlaine J's global HQ directly?

355
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,041
Who do you think is responsible
for Thierry's escorting, other than me?

356
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,796
On top of that,
who do you think Ji-eun works for?

357
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,134
If you're going to choose,
don't look too far.

358
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,594
-Hello.
-Hello.

359
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,681
-My gosh, Ms. Oh...
-Oh gosh, Thierry!

360
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,023
You're looking gorgeous today.

361
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,026
-Exactly.
-Is that so?

362
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,240
It's an honor to meet you, Thierry.

363
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,035
-Who are you?
-Well, I'm...

364
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:12,039
This is Ms. Hong Ji-seon,
a famous stylist in Korea.

365
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,750
She has styled many stars.

366
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,293
Stars?

367
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,712
Like who?

368
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,006
-Well, I...
-Ms. Hong.

369
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,674
What are you doing?

370
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,010
I was bored all by myself.

371
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,012
JD?

372
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,056
Oh my.

373
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,225
How sharp of you to recognize
our international star JD right away.

374
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,270
You really are
on top of the trends, Thierry.

375
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,107
-JD will come and say...
-Would you like to take a photo together?

376
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,152
I'll take the photo.

377
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,988
The hottest faces
in the fashion world are here.

378
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,282
We're screwed if Thierry loses his temper.

379
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,992
Wow, beautiful.

380
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,744
-Now, in three.
-Wonderful...

381
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,953
Thierry!

382
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,291
I'm Joseph's mommy!

383
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,627
We talked on the phone

384
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,962
because of my stubborn little Joseph.

385
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,342
I've been dying to meet you!

386
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,013
Madame Jang, please join the photo.
They're all first-class stars.

387
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,349
Should I? I dressed up.

388
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,600
You look beautiful.

389
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,230
All right, here we go.

390
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,233
Wonderful.

391
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,360
All together now!

392
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,238
Three, two, one!

393
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,990
@JANG OK-JIN @AHN NAM-HEE
@AUDREY @HONG JI-SEON

394
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,446
YE SEON-HO

395
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,620
The finale outfit isn't here yet.
We need a plan B.

396
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,874
There is no show without it.

397
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,459
The finale wraps up the show.

398
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,918
Right, Ppyoji?

399
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,421
I know that, but...

400
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,632
Okay.

401
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,593
It'll be here. It has to.

402
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,053
Right.

403
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,148
Esther, where are you?
The show starts in 30 minutes.

404
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,983
Right, where?

405
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,735
Okay, I'll be right there.

406
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,034
It's been a while, Ji-eun.

407
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,079
You're here, Mr. Lee.

408
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,040
Congratulations.

409
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,501
I heard Audrey is in charge of not only

410
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,295
the Earlaine J launch show,
but also all the marketing.

411
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,381
I'm excited as the CEO
of a competing brand.

412
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,633
Thank you.

413
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,677
You can look forward to this collection.

414
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,554
Everyone worked hard on it.

415
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,805
It must feel great to see

416
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,058
the new collection of a friend
you've supported.

417
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,645
It's touching that Joseph's uniqueness is

418
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,689
being recognized
by an international luxury brand.

419
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,026
I really am proud and happy for him.

420
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,820
We'll be seeing each other
like this more often.

421
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,531
I hope you're not uncomfortable.

422
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,491
Of course not.

423
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,245
I'm looking forward
to working with you, Mr. Lee.

424
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,207
I look forward to working
with you too, Ms. Pyo.

425
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,266
Oh, shoot.

426
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,395
Joseph!

427
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,396
It's here!

428
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,982
Joseph, we don't have time. It's showtime.

429
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,692
-Esther.
-Jjoseph.

430
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,986
The show's in eleven, ten minutes.
Go on stage.

431
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,404
Slay! I can't.

432
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,198
I need to check
the finale outfit and add volume.

433
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,701
You have ten minutes.
You're the one opening the show.

434
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,330
What I wanted to say
on stage was our story.

435
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,208
Right. He can tell it.

436
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,626
What?

437
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,551
What?

438
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:37,887
What is it?

439
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,016
Find a style you like.

440
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,768
I'm so excited.

441
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,229
-I'm getting nervous!
-Right?

442
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,528
Don't be nervous.

443
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,323
I'll be watching from right here.
You can do it, right?

444
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,203
Wow, my friend's so cool.

445
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,448
<i>What's your dream?</i>

446
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,784
Doing what you want to do?

447
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,202
Hey,

448
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,331
this is a time capsule
we'll open when you come back to Korea.

449
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,041
Answer honestly, okay?

450
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,877
Then mine's to be on top.

451
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,463
Chanel, Prada, Diana, Earlaine.

452
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,092
A top model that all the luxury brands
want a contract with.

453
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,386
Who can do it better than me?

454
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,305
I know it. I'm going to make it happen.

455
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,974
Slay! Your confidence
will take you to the top, Seon-ho.

456
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,934
Hey!

457
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,436
Okay. What about you, Woo-min?

458
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,482
I'm not sure.
Well, I don't always have a dream.

459
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,318
I have a dream sometimes,
but then it changes,

460
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,195
and I find another by chance.

461
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,489
That's how dreams are.

462
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,617
What about you?

463
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,955
My dream is to have my own little atelier.

464
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,291
I want people to enjoy
the pretty clothes I make, and be happy.

465
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,169
I love the sound of scissors
cutting a piece of cloth.

466
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,506
I want my heart to reach people
with every stitch I sew.

467
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,261
What about you?

468
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,345
As for me,

469
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,849
you know I like pretty things.

470
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,352
In this fashion industry
surrounded by beautiful things,

471
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,021
I want to be a special
and indispensable person

472
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,441
who's more passionate
and capable than anyone else.

473
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,110
You have high aspirations.

474
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,279
Let's make them happen. Promise!

475
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,864
-Promise!
-How?

476
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:05,118
What do you mean,"How?"
As always, ride or die!

477
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,705
-Ride or die!
-Ride or die!

478
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,185
Okay!

479
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,862
Jjoseph!

480
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,990
Why are you crying?

481
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,116
I'm just so happy.

482
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,869
I've never felt happier.

483
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,999
You did so great. You worked so hard.

484
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,462
You too, Ppyoji.

485
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,674
We were awesome.

486
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,387
Seriously.

487
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,473
Joseph! Everyone's looking for you.
What are you doing? Come on!

488
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:11,280
-Joseph!
-Joseph!

489
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,203
Are you Ms. Pyo Ji-eun from Audrey?

490
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,080
Hello, ma'am.

491
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,416
You even know my name. What an honor.

492
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,877
I've heard about how Pyo Ji-eun
from Audrey does such great work.

493
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,587
No way.

494
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,881
You're keeping us at InFashion
on our toes.

495
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,843
Oh my, InFashion is
at the top of the industry.

496
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,220
How could I? That can't be true.

497
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,889
We handle 60% of Korean luxury brands,

498
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,307
you know that right?

499
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,894
And you're aware
of the celebrities I style.

500
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,189
-Am I right?
-Of course, I am.

501
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,235
Here's your ticket to a broader world.

502
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,739
It's my number. Take it.

503
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,659
Thank you.

504
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,870
Think about it. I'll see you around.

505
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,380
It's Thierry!

506
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,802
Woo-min.

507
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,222
Let's wake the kids up and go home.

508
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,057
Okay.

509
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,893
I can't find a driver.

510
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,145
What do we do with everyone?

511
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,980
Just wait.

512
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,858
And then what? You got an idea?

513
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,859
I do.

514
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,028
In a minute...

515
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,416
Kids, party's over. Let's go home!

516
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,709
Wow!

517
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,295
What did I tell you?

518
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,259
What are you doing? Get in!

519
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,593
It's time to go home!

520
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,511
Let's go.

521
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,264
Hey, Gang-woo.

522
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:42,932
Hurry up!

523
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:43,933
Let's go!

524
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,268
-Come on!
-Let's go!

525
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,741
Excuse me.

526
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,832
Hey.

527
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,668
Well.

528
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,964
Aren't you going home? The bus is here.

529
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,399
Shall we follow each other?

530
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:35,943
"We..."

531
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,695
Or forget about it.

532
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,780
Slay. Bosh.

533
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,040
Guys, the party must go on.

534
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,294
Mr. Driver, cue the music!

535
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,857
<i>There are people who shine
in hidden places.</i>

536
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,693
<i>Thanks to them, new fashion is born today.</i>

537
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,575
<i>The outfits you wear
pass through the hands</i>

538
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:29,080
<i>of cloth cutters, pattern makers,
and tailors in numerous workshops.</i>

539
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,251
<i>It goes without saying that
countless people's hard work</i>

540
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,630
<i>is involved in the process
before the outfit ends up in our hands.</i>

541
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,300
<i>From designers to brands,</i>

542
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,594
<i>from MDs to VMDs,</i>

543
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,390
<i>and from stylists to PR agencies.</i>

544
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,978
<i>The passionate world of fashion is
created by these people</i>

545
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,022
<i>who love fashion more than anyone else.</i>

546
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,899
PEOPLE IN FASHION WITH PASSION

547
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:01,070
<i>The new season that always comes
one step ahead of the world</i>

548
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,533
<i>excites us and captivates us
every moment with something new.</i>

549
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,468
Bosh.

550
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,763
All these people are waiting
for your clothes.

551
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,232
Let's go for collections abroad together.

552
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,193
Seon-ho is starting to work abroad again.

553
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,363
Don't give up on modeling.
You've got talent.

554
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,448
Seon-ho.

555
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,117
Whether you're a rookie or famous,

556
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,162
you have to start with auditions.
You know that, right?

557
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,456
Do you think I can make it?

558
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,041
I did it, so why can't you?

559
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,336
You said your dream was
to be friends and roommates.

560
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,879
Let's make it happen.

561
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:04,133
A dream is not something
you can just give up on.

562
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,263
Wow, my girlfriend's so cool.

563
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,310
MOMMY - GO SEON-HO!
DADDY - DON'T SKIP MEALS

564
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,189
<i>Mom and Dad are so proud of you, Seon-ho.</i>

565
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,782
She said we're people
who love fashion more than anyone.

566
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:33,329
I almost teared up
reading the editor's letter Ms. Ahn wrote.

567
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,498
You are tearing up now.

568
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,542
I...

569
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,546
I got an offer
from a top company in the industry.

570
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,631
Really?

571
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,176
So are you going? Are you quitting Audrey?

572
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,055
I'm okay with not being
the star of the show.

573
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,891
It's all right
if people don't know what I do.

574
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,142
Because I know.

575
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,148
Because I know how much I love my work

576
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,526
better than anyone else.

577
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,695
That's enough for me,
and it makes me happy.

578
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,325
It was nice to be recognized though.

579
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,495
We've never met before,
but she even knew my name.

580
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,166
I love you, Pyo Ji-eun.

581
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,169
We should kiss properly.

582
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,839
Should we?

583
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,007
Come on! There are lots of people here.

584
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,509
You wanted to kiss properly.

585
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,053
-It was a joke!
-What do you mean it's a joke?

586
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,806
People aren't watching us.
There's barely anyone here.

587
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,933
-Hey, don't!
-It's okay!

588
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,821
I'm getting an atelier in Paris.

589
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,031
I'm going to take over Earlaine.

590
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,617
I'll go to New York, London,
Milan, and Paris again,

591
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,786
to sweep collections in those cities.

592
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,038
My camera's going to be pretty busy, too.

593
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,498
Vogue called me yesterday.

594
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,584
Then I...

595
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,506
MS. OH

596
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,719
I will...

597
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,721
-Pick up the phone!
-Pick up the phone!

598
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,934
This is Pyo Ji-eun.

599
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,104
Yes, I got it.

600
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,943
Hey, wait up!

601
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,368
Is Ji-eun still
at the bottom of the caste?

602
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,162
No, I'm not!

603
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,581
-You're not at our level.
-That's not true!

604
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,499
Go higher.

605
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,834
-I did!
-Let's lower our levels for Ppyoji.

606
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,544
-What's up with you?
-It's fine.
