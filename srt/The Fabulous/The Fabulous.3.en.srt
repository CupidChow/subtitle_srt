1
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,776
Mr. Joseph!

2
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,739
Holy cow.

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,907
I didn't know Ji-eun's so popular. Cool.

4
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,910
-I'm a huge fan of yours.
-Oh.

5
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,705
Can I have your autograph?

6
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,957
-Okay.
-Nice!

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,925
Right here, in big letters!

8
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,435
<i>Him? I'm all for it.</i>

9
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,729
He isn't boring or passive.

10
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,189
He's rather confident, determined,

11
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,858
honest, brave, and has great taste.

12
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,986
He's just a stubborn little kid,
full of bravado.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,280
-And handsome!
-That's true.

14
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,574
Couldn't you feel
his refreshing, bubbly vibe?

15
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,159
He's basically a child.

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,078
That's why he's perfect!

17
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,163
His young age might be why
he's bright and youthful,

18
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,498
quick to act, and sociable.

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,793
And when he smiles,
his lip goes all the way up like this!

20
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,128
You noticed that, too?

21
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,505
He's adorable.

22
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:33,259
I like him way better than your snobby ex.

23
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,428
Does he look like a man to you, Jjoseph?

24
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,263
He's cute. That's all that matters.

25
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,641
Who's this cutie you're talking about?

26
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,934
Her new guy.

27
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,311
-Oh my.
-I know, right?

28
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,525
Welcome, sir. This way, please.

29
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,576
I came alone today.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,494
Understood.

31
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,341
Woo-min.

32
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,513
Stop working part-time like a nomad,
and just work here full-time.

33
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,597
Why?

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,515
What the...

35
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,768
No one is as good as you at retouching.

36
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,522
The pay is regular, so all you need to do
is work the same way you do right now.

37
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,108
You'll deal with some VIPs
once in a while,

38
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,777
but you can take your own pictures
all you want. How nice is that?

39
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,529
Just settle down here.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,741
What's in it for me?

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,702
Well,

42
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,662
a bright future?

43
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,747
A bright future?

44
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,583
I'll take that as a yes.

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,001
So the contract...

46
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,420
By the way,
what do you mean by deal with VIPs?

47
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,885
Birthday parties, engagements, weddings,
talent shows, picnics, house parties!

48
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,428
Hey, wait a minute!

49
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,929
I don't want to do that!

50
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,156
{\an8}THE VIP AND THE REGULAR

51
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,435
Sit.

52
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,318
Do you want champagne, too?

53
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,986
I'm okay.

54
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,289
Is there no way to renew our contract?

55
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,625
Who would've thought?

56
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,294
A VIP brand,
a client for the last five years,

57
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,755
would cut us off
because we blew JD's pictorial?

58
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,259
I have no excuse.
I'm really sorry, Ms. Oh.

59
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,427
I guess we just lost half of our sales.

60
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,473
We didn't lose that much.
We still have the domestic brands.

61
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,310
What's the point? We lost a VIP client!

62
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,771
Let's be honest.

63
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,693
That brand was the only reason why
AUDREY became a luxury brand PR agency.

64
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,655
It's not like we made
a lot of money off of this.

65
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,324
Pride and reliability as an agency

66
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,828
was our only driving force
in this brutal fashion industry.

67
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,249
Ms. Oh.

68
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,880
What do we do now?

69
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,801
We might even have to represent
a rice cooker.

70
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,928
"A rice cooker"?

71
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,181
It means we've downgraded!

72
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,893
I'm afraid to say,

73
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,856
we might have to close down AUDREY.

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,194
That's bitter.

75
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,366
Come on, Ms. Oh.

76
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,244
We can find another major brand!

77
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,664
There are tons of other luxury brands,
and we'll surely find at least one.

78
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,541
I'll start searching.

79
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,835
What are you going to do?

80
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,630
I'll use all my connections.
Ask friends or anyone around me.

81
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,840
Pyo Ji-eun and AUDREY,

82
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,801
let's show the fashion world
we still got it!

83
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,386
Do you even have a plan?

84
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,684
Thank you, Ji-eun!

85
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,465
You, stop.

86
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,634
I said stop!

87
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,104
I know it's you.
You're my husband's sugar baby.

88
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,023
Excuse me? "Sugar baby"?

89
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,527
Did you like all the lavish gifts
and nice places he took you to?

90
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,654
As if you're a rich man's wife, right?

91
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,990
Lady, I don't even know
who your husband is.

92
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,075
"Lady"?

93
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,829
How dare you call me a "lady"?

94
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,164
Are you insane? Do you have a death wish?

95
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,459
You bitch!

96
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,628
Did you just laugh?

97
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,755
Don't you dare.

98
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,008
I can make you vanish into thin air!

99
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,807
Who the hell are you?

100
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,727
Excuse me, noble ma'am.
You can't ruin the show like this.

101
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,480
Especially as a VIP.

102
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,565
What?

103
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,446
This doesn't suit your style as a VIP.

104
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:32,452
See, this brand doesn't invite
just anyone with money as a VIP.

105
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,330
Excuse me, there must be a mistake.

106
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,333
"Mistake"?
Everyone in Cheongdam-dong knows.

107
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,754
They all saw you with my husband,
so don't try to fool me, bitch!

108
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,301
-That hurts!
-What's happening?

109
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,094
Did you just push me?

110
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,390
Hey, where are you going?
Stop right there!

111
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,725
Do you know who I am?

112
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,438
Ouch! My neck!

113
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,995
Thank you.

114
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,085
It was unfair, wasn't it?

115
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,467
Back there,
you could at least tell her she was wrong.

116
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,803
But you can't say that again here.

117
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,225
Among all the staff, models, and VIPs,

118
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,062
the rumor will circulate
faster than you think.

119
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,191
"Model Jung Hye-na got slapped
by her sugar daddy's wife."

120
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,567
"She was grabbed by the hair."

121
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,779
"She had to pay for the damaged clothes."

122
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,451
Such groundless rumors
will be covered in Cheongdam Daily.

123
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,289
Soon enough,
you'll find out how shitty it is.

124
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,378
So you don't have to feel so bad.

125
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,880
You didn't do it anyway.

126
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,760
There's no point
in crying over a little incident.

127
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,428
Just let it go.

128
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,227
Ms. Ye, about last time...

129
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,478
Don't call me that.

130
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,066
You can call me by my name if you want.

131
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,484
Bye.

132
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,708
Yeonnam-dong, please.

133
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,782
He's sociable
and has a bright future ahead of him.

134
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,577
He has such great energy
that he'll do anything great.

135
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,370
What's with the flattery?

136
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,957
Not you, Woo-min. Ji-eun's new man.

137
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,836
-"New man"?
-Yeah, she's blessed with dating.

138
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,380
From a hot shot to a handsome young boy.

139
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,049
It's time for her to get married.

140
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,051
You seem too happy.

141
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,178
Who is he?

142
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,430
Way better than her ex, Nam-jin.

143
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,641
And you don't even come close.

144
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,145
I'm excited just thinking
about how he'll flirt with her.

145
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,107
When did she pick him up?

146
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,692
Is he the reason for her breakup?

147
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,779
I shouldn't have been there
for her that night.

148
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,656
If I wasn't there, they would have...

149
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,659
slept together, right?

150
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,079
Hey, are you okay?

151
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:03,996
Yeah.

152
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,122
Joseph!

153
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,167
Come to the showroom quickly!

154
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,293
Why? Who's there?

155
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,336
It's Ms. Hong.

156
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,047
I'm hanging curtains with Woo-min.

157
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,925
But she's a VIP. Just come out, quickly.

158
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,802
Since when was Hong Ji-seon a VIP?

159
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,470
She wants to pick out JD's clothes.

160
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,515
So what, I have to go out to greet her?

161
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,850
She's just going to be nitpicking.
I'm not going.

162
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,143
But it's for JD, Joseph!

163
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,064
Hey,

164
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,983
I got this covered. You should go to GD.

165
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,360
Not GD. It's JD.

166
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,033
Whatever. Bosh.

167
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,886
Smile.

168
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,472
Say your lines!

169
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,349
Ms. Hong!

170
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,393
Hello, Se-pyeong.

171
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,648
Ever since the show,

172
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,068
we've been wondering
when you'd stop by, Ms. Hong.

173
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,530
Do you see anything you like?

174
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,366
A lot of people have mentioned

175
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,327
that our MR. JOSEPH collection
for this season is unique.

176
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,957
Well, top celebrities have been
reaching out to us for collaborations...

177
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,877
Oh, so this must be it.

178
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,712
I saw this all over Instagram

179
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,089
getting chewed out.

180
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,924
Right, Se-pyeong?

181
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,389
You surely have great taste.
Would you like me to prepare that for you?

182
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,525
From here to there.

183
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,820
And there to there.

184
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,115
I'll take everything,
so ring them up, Se-pyeong.

185
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,744
Everything?

186
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,079
Oh my gosh, Ms. Hong!

187
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,981
Keep bowing.

188
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,692
She's probably watching you
through her rearview mirror.

189
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,824
Is she gone?

190
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,325
Yeah.

191
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,955
We're trying so hard.

192
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,082
We are so desperate.

193
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,625
Yes, but

194
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,127
we sold 89 pieces!

195
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,423
We broke the daily sales record.

196
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,217
Want a party?

197
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,642
But you know,
AUDREY is very good at handling events.

198
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,645
You're out of budget.

199
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,814
BELLE STELLAR
EDITION V

200
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,731
But ma'am,

201
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,609
if you work with one agency for too long,

202
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,944
you might lose your taste.

203
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,990
In the fashion world,
AUDREY is best known for our ideas.

204
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,742
You still have a year
left on the contract?

205
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,870
Can we at least give
a presentation to you?

206
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,413
Influencer marketing only?

207
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,914
And only on Instagram?

208
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,916
MEETING SOJIN

209
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,090
INCOMING CALL
NAM-JIN

210
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,228
AUTHENTIC CHINESE

211
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,577
Did you order?

212
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,370
Two <i>jajangmyeons</i> and dumplings.

213
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,040
I heard you're working
full-time now, is that true?

214
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,500
It kind of just happened.
For a bright future.

215
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,128
The only good thing about you
was answering my calls.

216
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,255
I guess I can't do that anymore.

217
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,882
You're useless now.

218
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,926
If I'm useless, why did you call?

219
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,386
You missed me?

220
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,059
Thank you.

221
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,689
I called you for mixing my noodles.
It tastes better when you do it.

222
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,359
I want to enjoy it.

223
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,655
Using me like this to kill time, right?

224
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,282
My life is full of stress and no fun.

225
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,701
I should at least eat something tasty.

226
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,038
Joseph told me
you've had a stroke of luck lately.

227
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,998
Oh, that?

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,752
Are you bothered?

229
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,965
Over a girl
that makes me mix her noodles for her?

230
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,049
Gosh.

231
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,012
Hello?

232
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,014
<i>Ji-eun, you haven't saved my number?</i>

233
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,933
I texted to see if you got home okay.

234
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,435
Oh, did you?

235
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,896
-It's the guy.
-That's the guy?

236
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,191
<i>Next time, call me directly
when you want to drink, not anybody else.</i>

237
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,568
I like it straightforward.

238
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,196
Is that so?

239
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,032
And since you're so popular<i>,</i>
I thought about it.

240
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,243
Today will be our first day together,
how's that?

241
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,953
First day of what?

242
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,124
<i>Actually,
that night was our first day for me,</i>

243
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,084
but you passed out.

244
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,003
So let's make today our day one.

245
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,463
As a fling, boyfriend, girlfriend, sister,

246
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,465
brother, darling, or honey.

247
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,595
He wants to make today
our day one together.

248
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,433
Wow, I really needed a laugh today,

249
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,642
and you made my day.

250
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,520
-Funny. All right, day one for whatever.
<i>-Nice!</i>

251
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,688
<i>Today's day one then!</i>

252
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,026
But well, I'm about to eat <i>jajangmyeon,</i>
so I gotta go.

253
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,864
Let's dig in!

254
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,786
Hey!

255
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,288
Ji Woo-min!

256
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,874
Woo-min!

257
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,294
What's up with him?

258
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,295
What the...

259
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,839
Are you guys getting back together?

260
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,091
No way, I'd rather die
than let that happen.

261
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,217
Don't be so sure.

262
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,512
From the way you squabble,
I can tell it's a fling.

263
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,765
I called him over to mix my noodles,

264
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,808
but he just poured red pepper powder.

265
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,226
Jeez.

266
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,020
I don't get it.

267
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,813
What do I do with you two?

268
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,360
<i>I wouldn't have missed it if I had known.</i>

269
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,030
But now I'm relieved.

270
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,449
It's safe! Reliable!

271
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,243
Stronger knees! Stronger bones!

272
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,872
From the age of 60 to 80.

273
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,166
The medical insurance for your bones.

274
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,543
No questions asked.

275
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:11,673
Call us now at 0588-6868.

276
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,761
That's 0588-6868.

277
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,471
{\an8}CONGRATULATIONS, MS. JANG

278
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,893
That hit the spot.

279
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,772
Chocolate ice cream is the best
when your sugar is low.

280
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,607
Perfect timing, you two.

281
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,068
You look amazing, ma'am!

282
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,862
Making a comeback with a commercial.

283
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,156
You're just on another level.

284
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,868
I was just trying to help
my friend's son's company.

285
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,412
And they wanted me in their commercial.

286
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,166
That's something not just anyone can do.
You have to be on that level!

287
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,001
I guess you're right!

288
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,547
Did you know you need

289
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,966
an insurance agent license
to be on an insurance ad?

290
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,592
Wow, is that so?

291
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,886
Stupid regulations!

292
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,639
But since you memorized your scripts well,

293
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,724
tests like this is a piece of cake, right?

294
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,726
Hey, that was long ago.

295
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,815
That's right. It was a lifetime ago.

296
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,488
By the way, what brings you here?

297
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,157
Your connections.

298
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,783
Could you talk to them for us?

299
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,702
About what?

300
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,873
Not Hepburn, just AUDREY!

301
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,085
No, it's not laundry, AUDREY.

302
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,214
Yes, the luxury brand agency, AUDREY.

303
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,134
Is Peter in charge?

304
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,889
But you're higher up than him, right?

305
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,808
Yeah, that's why I called.

306
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,978
They're just amazing.

307
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,607
Alex hates them?

308
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,777
AUDREY's CEO crossed you?

309
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,529
Oh.

310
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,407
I didn't know that.

311
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,993
Was it that bad? What did she...

312
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,078
Why would she do that?

313
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,663
Excuse me, she needs to go now.

314
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,165
She's on an important call.

315
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,500
Right, but everyone's waiting for her.

316
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,211
I said it's an important call.

317
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,131
Okay.

318
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,258
-Wait, are you...
-That's right.

319
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,510
I knew it! DOUBLE BELLS!

320
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,721
-You got so much prettier!
-Come on!

321
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,141
SELL YOUR ITEM

322
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,769
SELLING A T-SHIRT SIGNED
BY THE FAMOUS DESIGNER JOSEPH!

323
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,354
50,000 WON
NON-REFUNDABLE

324
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,486
Chief photographer!

325
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,280
Nice to meet you.

326
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,242
-I'm not the chief.
-An assistant, then? That's fine.

327
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,495
My perfect looks
will make up for what you lack in skill.

328
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,999
Don't feel too pressured.

329
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,712
I wonder
if you're the same as everyone else.

330
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,382
Everybody says
I give them creative inspiration.

331
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,721
It may just be for my profile pictures,
but you shouldn't take it lightly.

332
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,307
It might be a chance for you, too.

333
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,518
If I become big one day,

334
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,812
your pictures will get
some recognition too,

335
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,355
then boom!

336
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,773
Let's get started.

337
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,612
I say 100,000 won.

338
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,823
I think the price is reasonable

339
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,742
since you're
just an assistant photographer.

340
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,246
I'm ready.

341
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,458
About that "boom,"

342
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,794
I should let somebody else take it.

343
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,171
I shouldn't have come.

344
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,633
Wait a minute! Okay, I get it.

345
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,636
-I'll add 10,000 won.
-Thanks for your time.

346
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,682
What the heck! 120,000 won!

347
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,019
Oh, come on.

348
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,230
I'm a broke college student!

349
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,566
150,000 won for a profile picture

350
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,152
is a huge investment for me.
It's from my part-time job.

351
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,778
Please!

352
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,364
I really need to pass this audition.

353
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,532
-Please!
-All right.

354
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,992
You look like a movie star!

355
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,035
All right, fine.

356
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,513
Do you have a girlfriend?

357
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,391
How about I read your face?

358
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,186
Look at that jawline.

359
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,438
I can tell you're the kind of guy

360
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,565
who's way too confident in their looks.

361
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,402
Handsome men like us struggle

362
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,862
to make the first move.

363
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,365
Am I right?

364
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,243
Love doesn't stay still,
so don't just sit around for it.

365
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,662
You have to make a move
and show your feelings.

366
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,833
When she least expects it,
you take action!

367
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,586
That's the secret.

368
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,214
That's how I met her.

369
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,799
My future girlfriend.

370
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,012
-Thanks for today.
-You're leaving already?

371
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,725
Hey!

372
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,686
What's this? You said he was a VIP.

373
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,273
Mr. Photographer,
please edit the photos nicely!

374
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,035
<i>Party tonight. Sounds good?</i>

375
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,956
RIDE OR DIE
JOSEPH

376
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,501
<i>-Huh?
-Record high sales party!</i>

377
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,294
<i>-Sounds good!
-Everyone has to come.</i>

378
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,295
<i>Got it, Woo-min?</i>

379
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,507
<i>Ppyoji, I know you're busy with work,
but please come.</i>

380
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,935
Why me?

381
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,607
It's Ppyoji!

382
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,942
-Ppyoji!
-It's Ji-eun!

383
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,194
-Attack!
-Stop it!

384
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,579
-Hey! Woo-min, take this!
-Attack Woo-min!

385
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,309
<i>I've loved all pretty things
since I was little.</i>

386
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,396
I only dressed in pretty clothes
and wanted pretty things.

387
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,275
My mom said she had a hard time raising me
since I never stopped talking about them.

388
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,071
But she also said
recognizing pretty things was my talent.

389
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,158
I came all the way here
just because of those words.

390
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,618
I guess we're kinda pretty.

391
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,498
My childhood was totally different.
I just played soccer with Woo-min.

392
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,586
I like my job.

393
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,005
In the fashion field,

394
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,466
I'm always surrounded by pretty things.

395
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,801
Even if it's just a t-shirt,

396
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,971
the person who made it and the person
who'll wear it are connected.

397
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,767
And I'm proud I get to be
in the middle as a bridge.

398
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,852
I'm really proud of us too.

399
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,356
But the thing is...

400
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,615
A, B, C, D!

401
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,951
Life as a "D class"

402
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,620
is a little too harsh, don't you think?

403
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,705
It is.

404
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,511
What's he doing?

405
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,721
That's crazy!

406
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,497
Go, Ji Woo-min!

407
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,456
Very good!

408
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,060
<i>A bidding pitch?</i>

409
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,107
I can't believe it!

410
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,735
Every cloud has a silver lining.

411
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,197
RUBLANI picked us specifically

412
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,199
to prepare a bidding pitch!

413
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,329
Ji-eun, isn't this a huge success
if we win a contract with RUBLANI?

414
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,206
-What a blessing in disguise!
-It sure is...

415
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,626
You must have talked to friends, right?

416
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,253
I didn't expect it to be a guy.

417
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,713
Who are you talking about?

418
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,508
Come on.
Everyone in fashion knows about it!

419
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,429
That guy that was featured with you
in the Cheongdam Daily.

420
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,098
Lee Nam-jin, the CEO of RUBLANI!

421
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,726
-What?
-No need to be shy.

422
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,604
I said hi to him
at Cheongdam Fashion Circle. Remember?

423
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,899
I saw you two
having a private conversation.

424
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,068
I'm not the only one.
Ms. Hong saw it, too.

425
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,153
No way she would keep quiet about it.

426
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,531
Wait, I heard you broke up with him.

427
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,866
I guess not?

428
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,451
Ms. Oh, he's...

429
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,662
I asked around,

430
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,082
and it turns out
that Lee Nam-jin chose us for the bidding.

431
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,417
Right?
The moment I got the call from RUBLANI,

432
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,252
I knew right away

433
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,507
that this was
what Ji-eun was talking about!

434
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,800
It wasn't me...

435
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,385
What do you mean it wasn't you?

436
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,136
INFASHION, CRYSTAL, and us.

437
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,846
They only invited these three.

438
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,183
They're the top in the industry,
on another level.

439
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,643
Without you,

440
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,646
we wouldn't have gotten the bidding pitch.

441
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,733
And Cheongdam Daily reported
they're just going to be our sidekicks.

442
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,068
Way to go, Ji-eun!

443
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,820
-Way to go!
-Way to go!

444
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:20,949
This way, please.

445
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,165
I'm honored you reached out to me first.

446
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,291
What's with you?

447
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,377
Have a seat first.

448
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,219
Were you the one that picked AUDREY
for the RUBLANI bidding?

449
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,348
For all these years
I've been working in this field,

450
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,393
whether it be little tricks or just
a last-ditch effort, I did it myself.

451
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,271
I've managed to grow and come so far.

452
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,522
And I'll keep going.

453
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,818
So who do you think you are
to mess with that?

454
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,195
I guess we didn't date for too long.

455
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,614
That's not what I'm talking about here.

456
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,452
I thought I got to know you
pretty well over that time.

457
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,163
But you still don't know much about me.

458
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,999
I separate my professional life
from a personal one.

459
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,292
AUDREY was selected,

460
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,419
but you had nothing to do with it?

461
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:18,673
It was handled by experts
and staff members.

462
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,842
The decision was made at their will.

463
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,970
You earned that chance on your own.

464
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,473
No need to be upset with me.
Just do your best.

465
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,641
Well, it won't happen.

466
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,395
Your name was thrown into the mix.

467
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,481
You should know.

468
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,942
No matter how hard I try
with this pitch for the bidding,

469
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,695
your name will get dragged in.

470
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,239
If we win, it's because we're dating.

471
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,366
If we lose, they'd assume we broke up.

472
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,871
Either way,
my effort will have been in vain.

473
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,459
So how am I supposed to
prepare for the pitch now?

474
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,044
What people think,

475
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,879
what people say,

476
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,423
is that what matters to you?

477
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,720
At Cheongdam Fashion Circle,

478
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,473
why did you follow me out?

479
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,476
It's a place full of people
in the fashion field,

480
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,269
and everybody was watching...

481
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,312
I missed you.

482
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,191
That's why I did that.

483
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,986
This is so embarrassing.

484
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,822
I'm leaving.

485
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,657
Ji-eun.

486
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,327
Nice seeing you.

487
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,371
Good luck.

488
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:28,928
Here we go!

489
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,408
<i>When you're sad and upset,
when there's no way out,</i>

490
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,160
<i>shout it out. Don't cry about it.</i>

491
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,289
See? It's gone, right?
You feel better, right?

492
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,627
I guess I do feel kind of better.

493
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,047
See, it was I, Ji Woo-min,

494
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,507
who took care of
Pyo Ji-eun's grief and woes.

495
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,469
No way. It was the swing boat
that did everything.

496
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,823
INCOMING CALL
JI WOO-MIN

497
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,622
What is it?

498
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,082
Where are you?

499
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,504
Why do you care?

500
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,839
<i>Why did you call?</i>

501
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,511
<i>Hey, Woo-min,</i>

502
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,558
why aren't you saying anything? Hey!

503
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,019
Want some ice cream?

504
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,854
Pistachio?

505
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,819
I want Cherries Jubilee.

506
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,113
Okay!

507
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,337
Look at you, all sad.

508
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,092
Here.

509
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,692
Why are you always so immature?

510
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,901
Get over here!

511
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,194
Hey!

512
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,741
-Come here!
-Wait!

513
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,534
Hey!

514
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,209
I always end up choosing
pistachio over other flavors.

515
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,670
You're used to it, that's why.

516
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,548
Maybe I only like stuff that I'm used to.

517
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,092
That makes you comfortable, right?

518
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,554
Is that why I'm comfortable with you?

519
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,143
You've never really missed me, have you?

520
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,022
Why would I miss you?

521
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,566
I can see you any time.

522
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,526
Am I your regular diner?

523
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,320
That you can just visit anytime?

524
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,113
No, <i>I'm</i> your regular diner.

525
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,991
So, you can come by any time.

526
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,952
If there are no VIP privileges,
I'm not interested.

527
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,665
You...

528
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,209
Let's go.

529
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,377
This diner's about to close.

530
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,505
I have a shoot tomorrow.

531
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,881
I'm full-time now.

532
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,521
Come here.

533
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,190
Hey, let go, you're heavy!

534
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,526
Come on, I'm not that heavy.

535
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,860
You're really heavy!

536
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,196
Get over here!

537
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,211
Everything has been refunded.

538
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,337
Thank you.

539
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,594
Huh?

540
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,555
Esther, what's all this?

541
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,974
It's a refund request.

542
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:43,891
Slay.

543
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,769
That was Ms. Hong's assistant just now.

544
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,770
Bosh.

545
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,816
They returned 88 out of the 89 pieces.

546
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:57,113
This girl wants to fight, right?

547
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,907
I'm sorry, Joseph.
I wasn't able to protect you.

548
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,745
Hong Ji-seon, I'll have my revenge!

549
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,544
Ji-eun!

550
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,588
The RUBLANI presentation.

551
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,340
The pitch will be decided by VIP voters.

552
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,800
"VIP voters"?

553
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,220
They'll have VIPs from Houn Corporation

554
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,723
vote and decide the representative agency.

555
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,725
The pitch will be held
with a launch party,

556
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,269
and they want us to show
how worthy the brand is.

557
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,773
Is it a real competition?
We were not their pick?

558
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,360
I told you. We have to prepare properly.

559
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:45,369
But still, you have friends
that you can talk to, don't you?

560
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,915
You said the VIPs will be voting!
I don't have any VIP friends.

561
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,585
Hey! How are we supposed
to beat the top agencies?

562
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,920
They're in the top spot!

563
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,130
We can outcompete them.

564
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,257
Let's give it a shot!

565
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,301
I'm about to lose my mind.

566
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,735
Are you stalking me or something?

567
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,571
Hello to you, too, Ji-eun.
Wow, this is heavy.

568
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,031
I have no time to play around.

569
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,368
Come on. You've been ignoring my texts.
That's why I came.

570
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,370
Just let me help you with this one.

571
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,622
Then, thank you, I guess.

572
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,293
You remember how many days it's been
since our first day together?

573
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,087
Our first day of being strangers?

574
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,506
My gosh. My Ji-eun is so witty.

575
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,093
Calling my name is weird enough,
but you're adding "my" as well?

576
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,636
Is it wrong?

577
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,763
"Ji-eun" is
just another word for girlfriend.

578
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,807
It's like calling you baby or honey.

579
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,849
Gosh.

580
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,693
If you really want us to be
each other's honey or baby or whatever,

581
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,903
don't you think we need to be equal?

582
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,821
Equal?

583
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,450
You have a lot of free time
to come here whenever you want,

584
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,786
but I'm always busy with the job.

585
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,705
No time to fool around with you, kid.

586
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,207
Don't expect any interactions whatsoever.

587
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,711
If you do this again,
I'll report you as a stalker.

588
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,630
Why don't you like me?

589
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,215
Thanks for the help.

590
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,678
Can't I just stick around you, Ji-eun?

591
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,055
Ji-eun! Drive safe!

592
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,890
See you later, Ji-eun!

593
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,331
Move that a little more to the left.

594
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,332
RUBLANI EVENT GOODS

595
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,755
To the center, please.

596
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,051
A little more towards the center, please.

597
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,845
Yes, there. Perfect.

598
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,768
This looks great. Good work, Ji-eun!

599
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,103
Indeed, outdoor parties are the way to go.

600
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,897
It's so pretty.

601
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,316
INFASHION chose the Diamond Hall,

602
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,693
and CRYSTAL chose
Club Max, which is in the basement.

603
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,905
So luring the VIPs to come outside
might be a bit difficult for us.

604
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,658
But the others only focused
on jewelry and shoes.

605
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,286
Our focus is
on the overall brand campaign.

606
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,205
Sounds fun, don't you think?

607
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,791
They've got class
and elegance, but that's all.

608
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,461
But elegance is
one of the foundational values of RUBLANI.

609
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,670
We need that, too.

610
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,424
You know, I was so nervous today.
It's so exhausting. Let's go.

611
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,302
You go on ahead.
I'll do some final checks.

612
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,845
It'll be more hectic tomorrow.

613
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,389
-Let's do this!
-We can do this!

614
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:52,973
We got this!

615
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,859
SEON-HO
A RIDE-OR-DIE?

616
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,528
WOO-MIN
I'M AT A SHOOTING NOW

617
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,742
JOSEPH
DAMN HONG JI-SEON!

618
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,177
SEON-HO
I'LL HAVE FUN BY MYSELF

619
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,693
Nam-jin.

620
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,489
I thought nobody was around
since the lights were off.

621
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,409
Am I putting you in trouble again?

622
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,827
No.

623
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,955
I'm sorry for being
too dramatic the other day.

624
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,918
And thank you
for making the pitch an open vote.

625
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,755
You gave me a proper opportunity.

626
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,552
You told me not to do anything,

627
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,596
but I had to do something.

628
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,101
-Is everything all set?
-Yeah.

629
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,103
I'll do everything I can.

630
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,147
Me too.

631
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,026
I also want to do
everything I can for you.

632
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,615
The woman who gives her all
to what she loves,

633
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,366
the woman who's proud of her job,

634
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,244
that's the Pyo Ji-eun I wanted.

635
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,456
I want to be with you.

636
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,628
Please give me a proper chance, too.

637
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,967
Nobody would appreciate
your true value but me.

638
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,723
You should go.

639
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,060
You're the CEO of RUBLANI.

640
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,647
And I'll be competing at the pitching
for RUBLANI PR agency in Korea.

641
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,524
People would gossip.

642
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,251
Okay.

643
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,669
Your chauffeur's here.

644
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,266
Hey, Woo-min,

645
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,769
you'd better not expect
anything in return for this.

646
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,022
No, I just came out of my own will.

647
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,526
I guess this is what friends are for.

648
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,863
Tomorrow's a big day for me.

649
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:44,455
If it starts raining, you have to set up
a tarp in the sky for me.

650
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,000
I prepared a great speech.

651
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,460
That's not all.

652
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:53,047
I'll go beg God himself on my knees
to stop raining, so don't worry.

653
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,510
Gosh, don't get knocked over by God,
begging on your knees.

654
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,851
Actually, I need to tell you something.

655
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,479
What is it now?

656
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,315
What nonsense is it going to be this time?

657
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,275
I want to be more honest.

658
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,904
Yeah, you need that, some honesty.

659
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,658
I...

660
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,202
I've been thinking.

661
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,915
I want us to get back together.

662
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,419
If I let this go,
I might not get another chance.

663
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,589
Let's stop being friends...

664
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,119
<i>So it's #Joseph, or just Joseph?</i>

665
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,370
<i>It's MR. JOSEPH.</i>

666
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,455
<i>-This outfit is fantastic.
-Genius designer.</i>

667
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,540
<i>Perfect outfit.</i>

668
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,585
This is real, right?

669
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,088
It's real. Congratulations, Joseph!

670
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,297
Oh, bosh.

671
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,800
I should go to Ji-eun's party.

672
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,553
JD's coming, so dress up, Joseph.

673
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,221
All right!

674
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,731
Yes, right this way.

675
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,325
Ji-eun, it looks like it'll rain.

676
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,788
Are you sure they aren't my tears?

677
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,503
No way. It'll stop
after just a couple of drops.

678
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,348
Please stop arranging
the flowers! Come on out!

679
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,934
Ms. Yang, get out of there!

680
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,843
<i>If it starts raining,</i>

681
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,429
you have to set up a tarp
in the sky for me.

682
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,557
I prepared a great speech.

683
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,064
Where are you going?

684
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,440
Woo-min, wait up!

685
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,819
Hey, Woo-min!

686
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,203
The VIPs will be entering in two hours.

687
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,746
We still have time.

688
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,122
Ji-eun,

689
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,291
it was unexpected.

690
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,878
Nobody saw this coming.
It's not our fault.

691
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,172
No one will criticize us for giving up.

692
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,215
Let's stop here.

693
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,051
We have to do what we can, Ms. Oh.

694
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:30,556
We've been through this a lot,
a sudden change in concepts on rainy days.

695
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,765
You're right.

696
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,477
But this is different.

697
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,563
There's nothing we can't do.

698
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,481
You said we do everything at AUDREY.

699
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,414
Right!

700
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,833
Get up.

701
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,669
Everyone gather round.

702
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,298
Ji-eun, what do we do? Where do we start?

703
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,049
First, let me make a few calls.

704
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,510
Everyone come here!

705
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,971
Cheer up, we got this!

706
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,099
Ms. Yang, you get out there...

707
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,391
This is nice.

708
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:00,562
I'm sorry, may I see your invitation?

709
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,441
-Invitation?
-Yes, ma'am.

710
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,360
I'm her stylist, Hong Ji-seon.

711
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,444
I see.

712
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,738
You're not a VIP.

713
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,824
-Just wait here.
-What?

714
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,495
No, JD, wait!

715
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,704
JD?

716
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,122
-Excuse me.
-Oh.

717
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh my, this is embarrassing.

718
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,302
What's up with her?

719
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,805
I think she's JD's stylist,

720
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,349
but she doesn't have an invitation.

721
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,393
Thank you.

722
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,769
Hello...

723
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,622
I was in Canada.

724
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,428
Jeez.

725
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,269
She's a guest, so please let her in.

726
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:27,816
Me?

727
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,280
Break a leg, Ji-eun.

728
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,538
Good evening, everyone,
I'm Pyo Ji-Eun from AUDREY.

729
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,377
You might think
what AUDREY is presenting here

730
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,463
might not be suitable for RUBLANI,

731
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,131
a luxury brand.

732
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,675
Due to unexpected weather,

733
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,386
we had to make adjustments
to the original theme.

734
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,307
Today's theme is the joy of clients.

735
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,767
Thanks to you,

736
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,229
RUBLANI is launching in Korea.

737
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,440
We sincerely hope you
thoroughly enjoy AUDREY's party.

738
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,817
Yes!

739
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,819
Applause!

740
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,276
What's over there?

741
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,161
Oh my.

742
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,784
JD, let's dance!

743
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,191
Hey, this is...

744
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,027
I was in shape back then. Take a look.

745
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,530
That's crazy.

746
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,990
And it went out like this.

747
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:04,950
I'll be right back!

748
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,619
You guys!

749
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,997
Thank you so much!

750
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,958
I couldn't have done it without you guys.

751
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,419
This is nothing for party animals like us.

752
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,796
But the star of the day is...

753
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,507
Woo-min.

754
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,427
I wouldn't have even imagined
something like this without you.

755
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,638
So was the mission accomplished?

756
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,183
This was all thanks to you.

757
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,560
The DJ and the model were amazing.

758
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:38,483
Today, the AUDREY party got
the highest number of VIP Instagram posts

759
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,360
of all three agencies.

760
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,281
Ji-eun, you really have
some amazing friends.

761
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,282
Right!

762
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,451
That was nice!

763
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,918
I've wanted to do this since earlier.

764
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,971
Thank you, Woo-min.

765
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,309
Ji-eun.

766
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,523
I'll treat you for this later.

767
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:22,777
Ji-eun needs to head
to the after party with Mr. Lee.

768
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:47,635
Oh...

769
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,266
Hey, Ji-eun!

770
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,852
Drama! What a drama!

771
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,692
-Wait...
-She's having an after-party with us!
