00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,750
the USB drive.

188
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
It was in a private club on the 13th floor.

189
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,390
Which private club?

190
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Chengguang Club.

191
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,080
Officer Luo,

192
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,630
we meet again.

193
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,670
Name?

194
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,870
Didn't I give you my business card?

195
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,510
Answer me.

196
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,910
Zhou Hongchuan.

197
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,390
Any previous names used?

198
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,120
Why?

199
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,270
Don't you like the name

200
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,440
your parents gave you?

201
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
Zhou Fengnian.

202
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,000
Officer,

203
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,910
are you here to discuss my name?

204
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,720
If you are,

205
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,750
I'll request to leave now.

206
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
What's the rush?

207
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,550
It's not time to release you yet.

208
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,150
We can still talk for a while.

209
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
Besides, you're obligated

210
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,510
to cooperate in our investigation.

211
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,000
You should know this better than I do.

212
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,840
I don't need to remind you of that, right?

213
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,440
Go ahead.

214
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,240
This morning,

215
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,630
you snuck into Gemini Building in Xindong

216
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,200
and loosened the security fence
on the rooftop of Block B,

217
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,150
which almost caused a...

218
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,390
I've told you

219
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,390
I didn't know someone would jump

220
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,030
at that time and place.

221
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I'll admit to vandalism if you say so.

222
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I'll accept the punishment for that.

223
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,270
You don't have to

224
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,080
ask such a simple question again, do you?

225
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,080
I've been with the police force for so many years.

226
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,600
It's really rare to see

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,870
such a defiant suspect like you.

228
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,200
Officer, please be careful
with your choice of words.

229
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,510
What evidence do you have
to consider me a suspect?

230
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,870
Okay.

231
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,720
You're not a suspect

232
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,910
but a lawyer.

233
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,080
I just have a few things

234
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,630
I'd liked to consult with you about.

235
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
The lady

236
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,440
who almost fell off the roof yesterday

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,720
recognized you after seeing your photo.

238
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,870
She said your previous name was Zhou Fengnian,

239
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,630
who happened to be from the same hometown as her.

240
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,600
Based on her testimony,

241
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,510
we've conducted a preliminary investigation

242
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,750
of your background.

243
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,750
You were born in a fishing village in Ex-Island.

244
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,270
Your parents had disabilities.

245
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
You have three younger siblings.

246
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,390
You came from a poor family.

247
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,240
It shows

248
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,630
you didn't have an easy life.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,240
You see, your village

250
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,510
doesn't produce
many university graduates a year.

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,120
Let alone attend

252
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,630
one of the best schools in Xinzhou

253
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,670
and still manage
to maintain a decent appearance.

254
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,750
I also noticed

255
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,840
you don't really have any accent.

256
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,440
Did you speak the Xinzhou accent

257
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,120
when you were in your hometown?

258
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Mr. Tao.

259
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,480
how did it go?

260
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,910
Captain Luo is still probing
into his background

261
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,720
instead of the case.

262
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,790
The villagers put a lot of effort
into supporting you.

263
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,360
You mustn't be ungrateful.

264
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,440
This is not right, Mr. Zhou.

265
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,550
Captain Luo is provoking him.

266
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,630
It's been so many years.

267
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,870
There are many people and things

268
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,000
that I no longer remember.

269
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,510
One more thing, Officer Luo.

270
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,390
I need to set one thing straight.

271
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,480
I paid for my university tuition

272
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,390
with a scholarship.

273
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,840
I saved up the fares

274
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,630
to Xinzhou myself.

275
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,360
I never troubled anyone to support me.

276
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,670
As for whether I've gone back to my hometown...

277
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,270
You seem to be overreaching
in your investigation.

278
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,240
Maintaining public order
and upholding the norms of society

279
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,240
are also part of our job as police officers.

280
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,270
So you are officially appointed mediators.

281
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,790
No wonder so many major and important cases

282
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,870
end up unresolved.

283
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,390
We accept your criticism

284
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,120
and shall actively make improvements.

285
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,550
There is a serious and important case

286
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,360
that we need to consult with you about.

287
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,480
This girl's name is Chen Yuan.

288
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,150
She died from overdosing several months ago.

289
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,000
She's your alumna.

290
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,790
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,320
Her death was quite odd.

292
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,240
She contacted her classmate

293
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,510
named Cui Ying two weeks before her death.

294
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,900
She passed some important evidence

295
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,540
about the drug traffickers
in Xiaxi District to Cui Ying.

296
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,900
We've talked to this girl.

297
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,990
She submitted the evidence

298
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,510
and also mentioned you.

299
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,510
She said

300
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,230
she once told you about Chen Yuan.

301
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,470
But you stopped her from reporting to the police.

302
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
Do you recall that?

303
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,270
Yes.

304
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,750
I did watch the video.

305
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,540
It made my blood run cold.

306
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,540
But who should I report it to?

307
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,870
As far as I know,

308
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,820
Jin Zaihong, who appeared in the video,

309
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,780
and Deputy Director Cui Hongliang
of Xiaxi District

310
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,660
are closely acquainted.

311
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
And I'm only an ordinary person.

312
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,820
I don't have that much influence.

313
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,990
Is it wrong to protect myself

314
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,060
from danger?

315
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,150
Not at all.

316
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,870
I understand.

317
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,940
As an attorney,

318
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,390
you do know what's good for you.

319
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,110
I just don't get one thing.

320
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,820
What did you do after you found out

321
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,230
about this incident?

322
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,270
After watching the video,

323
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,030
I did go there to do some fieldwork.

324
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,140
But I didn't dare to probe deeper

325
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,710
because one time

326
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,950
when I pretended to drive by,

327
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,910
I was targeted
by several suspected drug traffickers.

328
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,470
I realized

329
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,750
it was very dangerous for me.

330
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,580
So I went back to tell Cui Ying

331
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,670
not to tell anyone about this.

332
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,470
We can only pretend it didn't happen.

333
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,780
Cui Ying said

334
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,860
you mentioned to her before

335
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,950
that if someone was killed,

336
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,300
just dump the body
at the drug market in Xiaxi District.

337
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,820
Do you recall saying that?

338
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,430
I'm nice to Cui Ying.

339
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,910
We studied under the same professor.

340
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,230
I've always been protecting her.

341
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,300
I don't know why she would say that.

342
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,540
It's obviously a joke.

343
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,950
Where were you on the evening of 3 May?

344
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,710
I went to Chengguang Club with my friends.

345
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,380
After that, I returned to the office
to work overtime

346
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,430
and only left late at night.

347
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,270
Where's your office?

348
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:00,950
Wenchang Road.

349
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,300
We got a hold of surveillance footage

350
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,710
from Bus Route 34.

351
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
He Zongyi, the victim of Case 503,

352
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,060
got off at Wenchang Junction

353
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,580
at about 10 PM that day.

354
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,230
He was murdered soon after that.

355
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,670
The killer disposed
of the victim's body in Xiaxi District

356
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,100
in an attempt to confuse the investigation.

357
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,140
That happens to be a drug trading market area.

358
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,190
What do you have

359
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,910
to say about this?

360
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,990
He got off at Wenchang Junction.

361
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,470
What happened after?

362
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,710
What happened during the time
between getting off the bus

363
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,620
and his murder?

364
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,860
You don't even know anything,

365
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,750
right?

366
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,750
You have nothing.

367
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,470
You tried to trick me

368
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,060
into turning myself in with one joke

369
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,540
and one unreliable surveillance footage.

370
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,780
Captain Luo,

371
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,060
don't you think you guys
are rather sloppy in your investigation?

372
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,620
They say those in the SID

373
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,230
are Xinzhou's most elite detectives

374
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,750
and the last hope for Xinzhou.

375
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,030
I don't think what's so special about it.

376
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,470
It's not much longer until my release.

377
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,710
I don't think
you have any further questions, right?

378
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,580
Can I leave earlier?

379
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,950
If I can't,

380
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,190
you can lend me a bed.

381
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,860
I need to lie down for a while.

382
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,100
[One hour until release]

383
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,270
Where's Qiao?

384
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,620
Captain Luo sent her out.

385
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,540
Where to?

386
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,860
She said she was looking for evidence.

387
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Captain Luo, just a reminder.

388
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,910
Not everyone

389
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,230
will be intimidated

390
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,430
by your outdated interrogation techniques.

391
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,710
Don't be too presumptuous.

392
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,510
Zhou Fengnian,

393
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,100
don't be too presumptuous.

394
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,990
Those collections

395
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,060
on the 13th floor of Chengguang Club

396
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,580
are waiting for your return.

397
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,750
Can you explain

398
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,910
why the paper bag

399
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,750
that He Zongyi held before his death

400
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,510
was in your private collection?

401
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,380
Search!

402
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,380
Yes, ma'am!

403
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,120
[Her secret]

404
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,400
[University]

405
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,820
[Internship]

406
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,100
[Freedom]

407
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,950
(Fire! Fire!)

408
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,340
Mr. Tao,

409
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,670
Zhou Hongchuan is such a terrible man.

410
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,910
He rented a building in Chengguang Club

411
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,620
as if he's obsessed with collections.

412
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,750
[Freedom]
How could he collect all these?

413
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,820
He kept that sleeve as his collection too.

414
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,670
This place is practically an evidence depot.

415
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,380
It seems he asked Cui Ying to meet him there

416
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,710
because he regards her as one of the trophies

417
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,860
of the collection.

418
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,860
Zhou Hongchuan

419
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,300
sure is proud and conceited.

420
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,030
Have you found He Zongyi's belonging
from the collection?

421
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,540
Yes.

422
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,250
[Trash]

423
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,820
Lan Qiao just found

424
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,470
the collection belonging to He Zongyi.

425
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,860
Why did Captain Luo...

426
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,710
Captain Luo was tricking him?

427
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,580
Ninety percent of the investigation relies on
evidence and ten percent of it depends on speculation.

428
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,710
Zhou Hongchuan was so confident

429
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,950
that we couldn't find

430
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,340
Chengguang Club.

431
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,430
When he's most proud,

432
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,860
telling him the key evidence

433
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,470
can directly crush his psychological defense.

434
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,470
What 13th floor?

435
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,190
What do you mean?

436
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,820
I don't get it.

437
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,380
Are you saying those aren't yours

438
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,510
and they have nothing to do with you?

439
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,270
Mr. Zhou,

440
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,340
with so many private collections,

441
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,750
will it be difficult to trace your DNA?

442
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,820
Besides,

443
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,620
who told you

444
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,620
we couldn't find He Zongyi

445
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,860
after he left the bus stop

446
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,340
at Wenchang Junction?

447
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,910
Impossible.

448
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,190
You are suspected of intentional murder
and disposing of the body.

449
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,750
You were afraid
the victim's family would recognize you.

450
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,300
So you lured and coerced an innocent woman

451
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,380
to commit suicide in public.

452
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,750
You even damaged the protective fence.

453
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,820
You intervened and misled

454
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,910
the SID's investigation time and time again

455
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,380
and framed someone else.

456
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,230
Zhou Hongchuan,

457
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,300
we have concrete evidence.

458
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,230
So do you have anything else to say now?

459
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,470
You arrived here without anything

460
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,510
and worked so hard for many years.

461
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,860
You've finally made something of yourself

462
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,510
and are dating a wealthy girl.

463
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,950
You almost had it all.

464
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,580
But with one wrong step,

465
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,060
you became a murderer.

466
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,780
If it's meant to be, it will happen eventually.

467
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,950
If it's not meant to be, don't force it.

468
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,060
Zhou Fengnian,

469
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,060
you look pathetic.

470
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,430
You can't call this evidence.

471
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,340
Do you have a video of me murdering anyone?

472
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,750
Are my fingerprints on the paper bag?

473
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,620
Zhang Donglan's fingerprints were visible

474
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,100
over the bloodstains on the tie.

475
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,540
Isn't that more direct evidence?

476
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,300
Is it just because his family is rich,

477
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,270
or is it because he doesn't...

478
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,860
Did you say Zhang Donglan's fingerprints

479
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,380
were visible over the bloodstains

480
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,910
on the tie?

481
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,950
Mr. Zhou,

482
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,030
you're even better

483
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,950
than our forensic team.

484
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,100
It will take them quite some time to find that as they
have to use the equipment to compare the fingerprints.

485
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,430
But you could know that
just based on subjective speculation.

486
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,510
Suspect.

487
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,580
So can I address you as a suspect now,

488
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,750
Mr. Zhou?

489
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,670
Cuff him.

490
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,860
We have confirmed that he committed the crime.

491
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,230
The rest are just some minor details.

492
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,430
I won't be wasting my time here with you anymore.

493
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,750
Wait!

494
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,950
It was self-defense.

495
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,910
What did you say, Mr. Zhou?

496
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,820
I acted in self-defense.

497
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,100
You are a legal industry elite

498
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,470
who has received professional legal education.

499
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,540
Do you consider the situation

500
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,710
a legitimate defense?

501
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,820
Did you suffer a rebound in your head

502
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,340
when you struck He Zongyi's head with a stick?

503
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,950
He Zongyi was suspected of drug trafficking.

504
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,100
I was compelled

505
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,670
to do it.

506
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,060
I know you're investigating Chen Yuan's case.

507
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,910
I can appear as the main witness.

508
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,270
I can cooperate with your investigation.

509
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,100
As long as you agree

510
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,100
to reduce my sentence.

511
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,580
Zhou Hongchuan,

512
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,510
I've reported this to Chief Du.

513
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,860
We did what you asked too.

514
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,140
So can you tell us now?

515
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,060
At the end of last year,

516
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,340
as a legal consultant, I took the team

517
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,190
to Xiaxi District to meet our client.

518
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,780
We didn't drive because we were planning to drink.

519
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,670
I encountered someone who was following me

520
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,710
when I was waiting for a taxi after the gathering.

521
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,430
Was it He Zongyi?

522
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,910
He recognized me.

523
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,340
He blackmailed me. Asking for 100,000 yuan.

524
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,540
Is this Mandheling?

525
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,780
It would've tasted better

526
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,950
if the water temperature
had been two degrees lower when brewing.

527
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,470
(He came on his own)

528
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,380
(and deliberately showed up nearby my office.)

529
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:13,990
(With no other options,)

530
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,470
(I could only try to appease him for the time being.)

531
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,580
(So I asked him to meet me)

532
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,670
(at the coffee shop downstairs from my office.)

533
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,510
This is Mandheling.

534
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,780
I know.

535
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,820
When I delivered the goods,

536
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,860
I saw this name.

537
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,990
Fengnian,

538
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,950
I'm working at a coffee shop now.

539
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,300
Do you like this coffee?

540
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,190
Do you want some?

541
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,670
I can get them at a lower price.

542
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,030
It's okay. Thanks.

543
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,310
Fengnian,

544
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,310
you're doing pretty well

545
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,550
in Xinzhou.

546
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,820
I'm really happy for you.

547
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,990
By the way,

548
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,900
I thought

549
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,070
I saw you with a girl several days ago.

550
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,510
Was that your girlfriend?

551
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,900
What do you want?

552
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,070
I'm just asking.

553
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,900
Your parents

554
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,340
would feel relieved

555
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,790
to see how well you do now.

556
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,470
He Zongyi, don't bring this up.

557
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,310
Since high school,

558
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,820
I've never spent a dime of their money.

559
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,340
I gathered cicadas,

560
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,310
carried things for others,

561
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,420
and helped the teachers run errands.

562
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
I'd done almost everything,

563
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,070
so I could keep studying

564
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,340
to become successful one day.

565
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,860
Now, I finally have gained a foothold in Xinzhou.

566
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,790
No one can pick on me now.

567
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,660
I wasn't...

568
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,790
I wasn't...

569
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,140
Fengnian!

570
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,230
Fengnian, I...

571
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,420
From that day onward,

572
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,660
my nightmare began.

573
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,420
He Zongyi clung to me

574
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,860
like a rat in a sewer.

575
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,340
You assumed he wanted to harm you

576
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
after only meeting him once.

577
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,860
Yes, he wanted to harm me!

578
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,860
He told me

579
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,420
his mom had contracted uremia

580
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,230
and needed 100,000 yuan.

581
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,620
Of course, I knew he was blackmailing me

582
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,580
and extorting me.

583
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
But I had no choice

584
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,230
but gave him the money.

585
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,270
But he ended up going to Zhang Ying.

586
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,230
After that, I went to see him once.

587
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,030
I gave him a new phone

588
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,510
and begged him not to come to me again.

589
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,180
But his greed knew no bounds.

590
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,070
Later,

591
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,660
he went to Chengguang Club

592
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,070
to humiliate me

593
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,100
in front of Zhang Ying and Zhang Donglan.

594
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,310
Is that why you decided to kill him?

595
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,470
I just want to settle this matter peacefully!

596
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:18,900
After that,

597
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,030
I went to check that place out

598
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,180
after watching Chen Yuan's video.

599
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,180
I saw He Zongyi

600
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,900
with a skinny young boy.

601
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,510
They were in the same spot

602
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,030
where the drug trade took place.

603
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,380
He was a drug addict.

604
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,340
Look at this photo carefully.

605
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,030
Is this the drug addict

606
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,990
you mentioned?

607
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,580
Yes, that's him.

608
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,030
I followed him home.

609
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,230
Through the shadows in the window,

610
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,180
I noticed he was sharing drugs

611
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,140
with He Zongyi.

612
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,100
Based solely on the shadow you saw,

613
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,750
you can be certain

614
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,860
that He Zongyi is a drug addict and extortioner.

615
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,620
What else

616
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,950
could it be?

617
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,180
I've seen them dealing several times.

618
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,900
You saw He Zongyi dealing drugs?

619
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,950
He was very cautious.

620
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,030
He would always ask that friend of his
to do the deeds.

621
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,740
But there was one time

622
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,470
I saw a text message

623
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,470
on his phone.

624
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,510
They were changing trading locations.

625
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,850
[The trade location has been changed
to the vacant land at Golden Triangle.]

626
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,470
You don't believe me?

627
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,180
On the evening of the 3rd,

628
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,470
he came to Chengguang Club again.

629
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:37,950
He shamelessly insisted on meeting me

630
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,350
under the pretense of wanting
to pay back the money.

631
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,660
Officer Luo, tell me.

632
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,180
An addict who blackmailed you

633
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,470
said he wanted to pay you back.

634
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,660
Would you believe

635
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,180
that he had turned over a new leaf?

636
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,470
Of course not.

637
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,830
He might want to pay you that 100,000 yuan.

638
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,180
But he was coveting 200,000 yuan
or even two million yuan.

639
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,470
These greedy scums

640
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,070
don't know anything except money.

641
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,070
I'm the crab in the basket

642
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,070
who wants to climb up.

643
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,390
No one can hold me down.

644
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,180
I acted in self-defense

645
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,350
to protect people from harm.

646
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,700
Did I do anything wrong?

647
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,740
Mr. Zhou, you're right.

648
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,430
I have the last three things to say.

649
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,260
I hope you

650
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,780
can humble yourself and hear me out.

651
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,700
First,

652
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,390
this is He Zongyi's autopsy report.

653
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,100
It shows

654
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,780
that He Zongyi had never taken any drugs.

655
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,950
[He Zongyi's was negative
for drug-related agents upon examination.]

656
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,470
Second,

657
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,220
He Zongyi had to borrow 100,000 yuan from you

658
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,260
because his mom had to do dialysis.

659
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,580
Every day since that day, he...

660
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,470
Look at this carefully.

661
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,140
It's every day.

662
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,470
He was trying hard to save money

663
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,660
to pay you back the money.

664
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,470
Because he was afraid that you would get upset.

665
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,140
He never mentioned your name to anyone at all.

666
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,580
Let alone your background.

667
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:30,950
Yes.

668
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,030
Someone who has no empathy as you

669
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,350
can never understand this.

670
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,390
Mr. Zhou,

671
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,910
you're too clever.

672
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,780
So clever that you always take
the initiative to gain the upper hand.

673
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,870
You thought he wanted to mooch off you.

674
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,550
That's why you killed him.

675
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,450
You thought Zhang Donglan was your obstacle

676
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,970
to marrying into the Zhang family.

677
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,370
That's why you framed him!

678
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
You even thought He Zongyi's mother

679
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,490
would accuse you if she met you

680
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,850
at the door of the SID.

681
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,680
That was why you had to kill her.

682
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,720
But the truth is,

683
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,640
these three people

684
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,450
never wanted to pester you,

685
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,120
hold you down,

686
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,450
or accuse you.

687
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,970
If you weren't so confident,

688
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,680
arrogant, and conceited,

689
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,370
we wouldn't have captured you so quickly.

690
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Lastly,

691
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,320
I didn't report to the chief.

692
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,410
As for the promise I made,

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,280

00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,600

Why?
