195

Does he know who he's working for?

196
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,820
All he does is staking out.

197
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,340
I will ask him to come to you right away.

198

Here. Attempted robbery.

[Lan Qiao, Officer of the 6th Brigade, SID]
According to the Xiaxi Patrol Detachment,

240
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,100
the victim is He Zongyi.

241
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,460
Male. 18 years old.

242
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,010
He came from Ex-Island to look for a job in Xinzhou.

243
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,100
He was a deliveryman.

244
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,460
We are still determining his cause of death.

245
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,650
His time of death is presumed to be

246
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,940
around 8 to 11 PM yesterday.

247
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,060
His body was found

in the alley

249
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,180
behind the community apartment
that the victim rented.

250
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,530
It was easy to identify the victim.

251
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,580
Have you heard? Four homicides already.

252
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,890
Even the SID is here now.

253
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,250
It's not like they can stick their nose in here.

254
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,940
Who cares about the SID anyway?

Where does the serial killer rumor online

256
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,460
come from?

257
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,460
Apparently, the victim was robbed of

258
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,530
all his valuables on him.

259
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,770
His phone is gone

260
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,490
and his wallet was emptied and discarded
to the side.

261

The one who filed the report

262
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,250
said the victim's face was covered
by a sheet of paper.

263
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,700
And there was a strip of sellotape

264
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,420
stuck on his hair.

265
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,530
And it says one hundred thousand on it.

266
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,610
One hundred thousand? As in money?

267
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,610

That paper note

270
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,130
doesn't look like it fell on him by accident.

271
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,250
It looks like the perpetrator
purposely taped it on him.

You are here to...

290
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,610
What is this smell?

291
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,700
It stinks.

293
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,820
Why are you here?

294
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,340
It's just a small crime in a shabby area.

295
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,650
Why did you come here in person?

296
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,060
I have to.

297
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,730
Crime scenes

298
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,340
might bring bad luck.

299
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,100
Don't you think?

300
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,530
And this place

301
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,820
is dark and dank.

302
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,700
No one wants to stay here at all.

303
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,580
Indeed.

304
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,220
Usually, I don't need to be present.

305
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,850
But the Ministry of Supervision called me

306
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,010
and said that they'll send someone here.

307
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,370
I guess you guys are not happy

308
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,580
with our security measures here.

309
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,010

310
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,130
No way.

311
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,370
We? Not happy? Impossible.

312

Come. A cig to brighten your mood.

313
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,250
Chief Zhang told me

314
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,300
about the online rumors

315
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,460
regarding an Apath criminal on the run.

316
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,980
We came here

317
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,250
because of public pressure.

318
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,130
I'm sure you know

319
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,130
how touchy of a subject

320
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,130
Apath criminal is in Xinzhou.

321
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,770
However,

322
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,850
is it really a genetic crime

323
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,300
just because some people said so online?

324
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,530
I don't think so.

325
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,940
I agree.

326
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,610
An Apath criminal on the run?

327
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,370
They made it all up online.

328
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
The way I see it,

329
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,650
it's committed by someone he knows.

330
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,460
I'm sure of it.

331
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,340
Just look around.

332
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,250
A complex layout.

333
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,130
If an outsider comes in here,

334
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,650
he'll have a hard time finding his bearings.

335
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,580
Exactly.

336
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,130
We were lost too.

337
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,980
Right?

338
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,980
-Yes.
-Yes.

341
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,390
Look.

342
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,660
This place has all sorts of people.

343
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,820
We don't want to be here at all

344
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,630
but we are forced to.

345
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,580
Now that you know about our situation too.

346
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,110
Can you let us in?

350
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,660
Go.

351
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,230
They are my colleagues.

352
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,230
It'll be fine.

353
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,390
Sure. I guess you can have a look around.

354
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,870
Yeah. They'll just have a browse.

355
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,540
It's not like there's anything to see anyway.

356
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,110
I know

357
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,660
why you guys are here.

358
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,150
It's because of the three previous cases.

359
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,540
But tell me,

360
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,750
does this case look like it has anything

361
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,510
to do with those cases?

362
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,510
What are the previous cases about? Drug overdose.

363
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,690
But this one? Strangulation.

364
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,780
It's definitely a separate case.

365
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,420
God knows why they sent you here.

366
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,870
Yeah.

367
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,150
I agree with you.

368
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,820
Stop taking photos.

He's... What's his name?

375
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,510
The owner of Hongfu Real Estate,

376
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,510
Jin Zaihong.

377
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,900
We came from the same hometown.

378
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,060
[Jin Zaihong]
He's just an acquaintance.

379
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,990
[Chairman of Hongfu Real Estate]

380
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,820
We have checked

381
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,270
the victim's background.

382
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,710
He wasn't a local.

383
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,030
He got into some kind of trouble

384
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,300
and got killed.

385
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,230
How complicated can it be?

386
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,540
I bet it's just a simple robbery.

387
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,230
Since he's not a local in Xinzhou anyway,

388
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,030
it's not worth the hassle.

389
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,030
Come.

390
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,670
Take the body away.

391
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,860
Wait.

392
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,230
What's the matter?

393
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,190
Is there a problem?

394
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,430
No. Just a work habit.

395
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,670
I always take a second look at the body.

396
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,860
Deputy Director Cui,
do we have the cause of death?

397
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,100
As you know, SID has tons of rules.

398
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,300
I have to submit a report.

399
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,510
I count on you, Deputy Director Cui.

400
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,340
If the report is not approved,

401
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,820
we'll have to come here again.

402
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,510
What's his face? Xiao Hanyang.

403
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,720
[Xiao Hanyang,
Officer of Xiaxi District Patrol Detachment]

404
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,230
Yes, sir.

405
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,950
Come.

406
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,470
Brief the officers

407
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,750
from SID.

408
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,430
Sir.

409
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,860
Based on the crime scene,

410
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,780
we found no bruises indicating
that the victim struggled to break free.

411
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,470
But the back of his head was hit by a blunt weapon

412
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,430
and was bleeding.

413
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,580
Clear strangulation marks
were found on his neck

414
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,060
and his valuable belongings were all looted.

415
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,270
That's why netizens said that it was committed

416
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,430
by the robbers who'd strangulated their victims.

417
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,750
Have you determined the cause of death?

418
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,580
The preliminary evaluation

419
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,860
is that the victim was knocked
unconscious from behind

420
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,470
before being strangled to death

421
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,190
by a soft and thin rope.

422
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,860
The victim was killed when he was unconscious.

423
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,990
That's why there is no sign of a struggle.

424
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,060
The rope used to strangle the victim

425
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,140
and the blunt weapon used

426
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,990
have not been identified.

427
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,860
There is no clear evidence

428
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,190
showing that this is the crime scene.

429
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,780
That's all, sir.

430
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,340
How dare you utter all that nonsense
before obtaining solid evidence?

431
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,780
Preliminary evaluation?

432
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
You haven't even talked to me

433
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,820
and you already got
your preliminary evaluation?

434
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,430
If this is not the crime scene,

435
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,780
where is the crime scene then?

436
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,670
Is this the place
where the culprit discarded the body?

437
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,950
Why discard the body here then?

438
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,470
What's the advantage? Tell me.

439
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,230
I just think that...

440
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,860
Think what?

441
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,580
That this possibility exists.

442
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,620
What possibility?

443
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,380
Deputy Director Cui.

444
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,430
He's just a rookie in this new job.

445
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,710
It's normal that he's more motivated.

446
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,670
Don't mind him.

447
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,030
Oh.

448
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,270
For the report I have to submit,

449
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,510
I need a testimony.

450
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,460
I heard the victim stayed nearby.

451
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,750
It's all community apartments here.

452
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,860
Does he have any roommates?

453
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,190
-SID is so nosy.
-He does.

454
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,270
His roommate is Miao Xiaowei.

455
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,100
A NEET.

456
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,780
When we were there,

457
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,140
he was seen arguing with someone else.

458
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,910
We have brought him back
for further questioning.

459
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,470
Excuse me.

460
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,580
Sir, netizens say
that this is committed by an Apath.

461
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,620
Is it true?

462
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,820
Xiaxi citizens are very supportive

463
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,950
of the Genetic Screening Bill.

464
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,030
Do you think it has something to do

465
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,710
with the homicide here?

466
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,300
We are still investigating this homicide

467
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,780
and we cannot reveal further information.

468
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,580
Please leave.

469
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,190
More comments, please.

470
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,910
As I said, we are investigating the case.

471
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,910
Once we get to the bottom of it,

472
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,230
we will release a press statement.

473
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,190
All right now, please leave.

474
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,540
More comments, please.

475
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,910
What's the matter, Luo?

476
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,060
Tell us more.

477
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,750
Once the investigation has been concluded,

478
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,860
we will explain

479
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,950
everything, all right?

480
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,990
Just go back.

481
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,060
Nothing.

482
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,580
I might have mistaken someone.

483
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,780
Does the intervention of SID

484
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,670
mean that this case

485
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,430
is somehow related to those previous cases?

486
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
Let's go and have a look.

487
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,230
Say something, please.

488
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,340
Say something.

489
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,380
(Last night, a body was found)

490
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,030
(behind a community apartment.)

491
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,750
(Although the crime scene has been cordoned off)

492
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,460
(and the body is transported
to the Patrol Detachment,)

493
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,580
(Deputy Director Cui of Xiaxi District
has nonetheless)

494
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,380
(debunked the online claim that the crime)

495
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,140
(was perpetrated by an Apath)

496
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,100
(and insisted that it was committed
by someone close to the victim)

497
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
(because the victim He lived)

498
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,750
(near the crime scene.)

499
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,140
It happened in Xiaxi District...

500
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,470
What a coincidence.

501
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,380
What's the matter?

502
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,670
Mr. Pei.

503
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,300
There was a homicide last night

504
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,580
and it is all the rage on the internet now.

505
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,910
Look. People are streaming it live.

506
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,510
Is that so?

507
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,990
Ask our staff members to be extra cautious.

508
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,620
Their lives

509
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,380
are more important than their work.

510
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,710
Mr. Pei.

511
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,100
The community housing area
where the crime scene was

512
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,580
is the area Mr. Su

513
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,860
mentioned he wanted to develop several days ago.

514
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,470
That city transformation plan?

515
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,470
Yes.

516
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,100
[SID steps in to investigate the homicide in Xiaxi]
A homicide took place

517
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,620
right after Mr. Su said
he wanted to develop that area.

518
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,430
Mr. Su also said

519
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,270
that since it was close to Xindong,

520
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,580
it would be very lucrative

521
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,300
after some urban planning.

522
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,820
But now it just looks

523
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,530
like a place for anyone,

524
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,710
a place for those who just moved here.

525
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,430
Even if it holds high commercial value,
developing it will be difficult.

526
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,710
Please make way. We...

527
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,340
-Sir, is this committed by an Apath?
-What are you doing?

528
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,710
I don't know why

529
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,670
Mr. Su wanted the Pei Group

530
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,750
to develop it with Hongfu Real Estate.

531
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,990
Doesn't he know Hongfu Real Estate

532
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,540
has a bad press lately?

533
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,140
Mr. Pei?

534
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,470
Sorry. I can't attend the meeting at the office.

535
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,380
A friend of mine

536
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,510
got into trouble again.

537
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,270
I have to go see him.

538
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,910
Mister, make a U-turn now.

539
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,670
Mr. Tao, when that bespectacled man

540
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,820
said that the crime scene wasn't there,

541
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,540
why did Deputy Director Cui
give such a huge reaction?

542
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,620
Probably because this place

543
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,780
is not what it seems.

544
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,230
I find his last question

545
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,140
particularly intriguing.

546
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,270
"Why discard the body here then?"

547
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,950
"What's the advantage?"

548
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,710
Why are you here?

549
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,300
I was nearby

550
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,950
and I want to have lunch

551
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
with Officer Tao here.

552
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,300
Mr. Tao, he's your friend?

553
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,030
You have no place in Xindong?

554
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,990
Why are you here?

555
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,540
On-site verification. Will you believe me?

556
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,230
There is a crime scene.

557
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,580
I agreed to develop this land

560

I have crossed someone by doing so.

561
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,100

562
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,430

563
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,620

Well then, Mr. Pei.

593

Don't ever sit
in our prisoner transport trucks then.

594

Kind citizens like us don't need to eat at all.

655
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,470
It's a yes

656

You don't need to think that long.

658
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,270
I might have overheard some of it.

659
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,060

00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,990
Do you know

666
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,950
you're the homicide's prime suspect?

667
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,300
No.

668
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
It wasn't me.

669
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,300
That accent sounded familiar.

670
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,780
It sounded like the local dialect
from Zongyi's hometown.

671
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,140
So I thought to go down to take a look.

672

It really wasn't me.

685

I don't think he did it.

686
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,580
He has a fragile mentality.

687
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,620
He won't be able

00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,780

But saying it's haunted is odd, to say the least.

00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,820
Isn't that normal?

745
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,950
Getting a change of clothes is normal.

746
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,660
But he didn't even

747
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,140
remove the tag.

748
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,180
I believe

749
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,820
that he didn't remove the tag

750
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,750
because this article of clothing

751
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,310
is way beyond his budget.

752
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,820
However, he needed it for certain occasions.

753
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,380
He planned to return it once he was done.

754
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,100
If the truth was like what Miao Xiaowei said,

755
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,990
the victim merely went to see a friend

756
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,620
from his hometown and they got into a quarrel,

757
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,820
did the victim

758
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,140
have to rent such an expensive suit?

759
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,860
I'm afraid only the victim has the answer.

760
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,820
The role of SID

761
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,470
is to speak up

762
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,270
for the silenced.

763
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,100
Don't utter useless statements

764
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,990
like that ever again.

765
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,310
Right. I'm sorry.

766
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,310
Our next step is ascertaining

767
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,820
the possibility that the crime
was committed by an acquaintance.

768
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,070
Let's start by investigating
the victim's social circle.

769
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:58,860
Tao Ze.

770
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,550
Head to Xiaxi tomorrow.

771
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,950
You will question Miao Xiaowei

772
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,230
and anyone related to He Zongyi

773
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,470
within the community housing area.

774
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,950
Noted.

775
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,550
Qiao.

776
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,550
You'll visit

777
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,470
the coffee shop to which
He Zongyi often delivered the goods.

778
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,750
Check their security camera footage

779
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,100
and don't miss any details.

780
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,750
Noted.

781
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,660
Wu.

782
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,660
Trace back the phone

783
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
using the serial number

784
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,100
on the phone case.

785
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
I need the list of people the victim

786
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,580
contacted regularly.

787
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,180
Noted.

788
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,790
Lastly.

789
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,030
Even though this case is not under SID,

790
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,140
Cui Hongliang tried his hardest

791
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,470
to stop us from associating this case

792
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,470
with the three previous cases.

793
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,820
He doesn't want SID to intervene.

794
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,340
I'm sure you know

795
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,090
what this implies.

796
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,340
A precious life is lost.

797
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,420
Treat this case like it's one of ours.

798
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,620
That's all for today.

799
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,950
Keep everyone in the loop.

800
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,100
-Noted.
-Okay.

801
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,750
Hello?

802
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,380
Captain Luo, is this person your friend?

803
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,580
I told him he couldn't park his car here
and he would be fined 300 yuan.

804
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,310
And then?

805
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,660
He gave me 1,500 yuan,

806
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,950
saying that it was an upfront payment
for future fines.

807
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,950
I'll teach him a lesson on your behalf.

808
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,180
He's getting bolder

809
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,420
and more disrespectful.

810
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,550
You aren't going to move your car?

811
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,510
Stop smiling.

812
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,510
Don't act cute in front of me.

813
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,990
So? Who's driving? You or me?

814
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,300
Hop in.

815
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,300
Honestly though,

816
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,220
you know what he's like.

817
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,470
Don't give him

818
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,950
the cocky attitude like a spoiled brat.

819
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,030
He was so grumpy just now.

820
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,990
That will be tricky.

821
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,620
After all, my existence

822
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,470
is the greatest offense

823
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,140
to self-righteous individuals

824
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,140
like Captain Luo.

825
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,780
Pei Su.

826
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,390
Fine.

827
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,660
I'll just avoid

828
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,140
Captain Luo who's going through andropause.

829
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,430
Please.

830
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,220
Luo and I were born in the same year.

831
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,550
You will also get old one day.

832
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,580
I don't understand.

833
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Why can't you two

834
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,870
get along with each other?

835
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,660
Well.

836
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,740
Since you're here already,

837
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,780
let's drop this topic.

838
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,910
Let's eat something,

839
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,910
Tao Ze.

840
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,740
Excuse me?

841
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,740
Have some manners.

842
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,910
You can't call me by my full name.

843
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,260
Take this.

844
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,830
What?

845
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,470
What is that?

846
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,990
A dead body?

847
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,350
They are important documents.

848
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,660
-Just hold them. Don't move.
-No.

849
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,220
I faint at the sight of blood.

850
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,470
For real?

851
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,470
There's no blood. Just hold the documents for me.

852
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,910
You aren't afraid of the cold-blooded Captain Luo

853
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,210
but you are afraid of a dead body?

854
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,580
Let's go.

855
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,340
♪When I am down♪

856
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,220
♪And oh, my soul, so weary♪

857
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,060
♪When troubles come♪

858
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,540
♪And my heart burdened be♪

859
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,070
♪Then, I am still♪

860
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,300
Humans love to delude themselves,

861
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,100
don't they?

862
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,820
♪And wait here in silence♪

863
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,870
♪Until you come♪

864
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,510
What is it?

865
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,100
I was thinking about the victim.

866
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,470
The victim?

867
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,830
He was all excited to see someone.

868
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,580
But unbeknownst to him, that someone

869
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,030
wanted him dead.

870
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,700
What?

871
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,100
The blazer he was wearing.

872
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,470
He put it on without removing the price tag.

873
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,220
Perhaps it was too pricey for him.

874
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,870
(Because this article of clothing)

875
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,510
(is way beyond his budget.)

876
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,510
However, he needed it for certain occasions.

877
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,140
He planned to return it once he was done.

878
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,780
Cash-strapped students do that

879
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,620
when they go for an interview.

880
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,550
You think like Captain Luo,

881
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,070
even saying the same things.

882
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,180
Is that so?

883
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,350
Who do you think

884
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,990
he dressed himself up for?

885
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,030
Someone important to him.

886
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,910
And someone powerful too.

887
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Powerful?

888
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,700
What makes you think so?

889
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,300
But that blazer doesn't suit his size.

890
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,390
And it's expensive.

891
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,180
If he puts it on,

892
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,740
he'll look too formal and uptight.

893
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,830
Since this isn't for an interview,

894
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,660
he must have worn it to see

895
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,030
someone important to him.

896
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,100
And that someone is way more well-off than him.

897
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,620
Then why do you think

898
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,740
the perpetrator taped a note

899
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,140
on the victim's forehead?

900
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,070
To prevent the victim from turning into a zombie.

901
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,430
Or perhaps

902
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,550
he felt remorseful after killing the victim

903
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,510
so he subconsciously did what others would do

904
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,660
to pay respect to the dead.

905
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,550
But if the note didn't cover the entire face?

906
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,580
Just a small note

907
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,470
on the victim's forehead,

908
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,740
right between the eyes.

909
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,100
Forehead?

910
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,140
When an elderly reproaches a youngster,

911
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,070
a strong person bullies and a weak person,

912
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,350
or when we want to chastise pets,

913
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,180
we target their forehead.

914
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,830
Or perhaps it's some sort of label.

915
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,950
Everything in a shopping mall has a label.

916
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,620
Either way, I think the perpetrator is...

917
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,700
What do you call it?

918
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,350
An individual
with empathy deficiency disorder.

919
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,660
Right?

920
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,220
Narcissism

921
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,830
is one of the most common archetypes, isn't it?

922
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,660
A narcissistic criminal

923
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,700
loves to follow the police investigation.

924
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,070
And when they are so full of themselves,

925
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,550
they might even take something
from the crime scene as a token.

926
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,300
But why?

927
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Why?

928
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,470
To commemorate it.

929
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,260
-If I were the perpetrator...
-Pei Su.

930
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,580
