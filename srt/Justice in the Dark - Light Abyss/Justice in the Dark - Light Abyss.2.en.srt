00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,630
Father.

4
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,830
Do you know who can dictate life?

5
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:20,020
[This is a prop bird.
No animals were harmed during the shooting.]

6
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,140
Us,

7
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,270
the ones who are chosen by Heaven.

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,720
[Chengguang Club, Shizi Road East Junction]

9
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,900
(Excuse me.)

10
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,510
(Do you know)

11
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,070
(where Chengguang Club is?)

12
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,420
(Chengguang Club is a private club
located at the back.)

13
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,390
What? Are they recruiting deliverymen too?

14
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,990
Hello, we're from the SID.

15
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,460
We have several questions for you.

16
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,950
All right, got it. I'll be there immediately.

17
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,180
You came to work on time again.

18
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,350
Are you heading to Xiaxi District?

19
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,230
Yeah.

20
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,700
Xiao Hanyang interrogated
Miao Xiaowei again this morning.

21
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,020
He got an important lead from it.

22
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,550
What is it?

23
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,420
Miao Xiaowei said

24
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,700
He Zongyi said that his phone

25
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,900
was given to him by his fellow townsman.

26
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,670
Fellow townsman?

27
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,420
Back then, I thought it was strange too.

28
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,510
It's because I didn't hear

29
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,270
that he knew someone from here.

30
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,180
But that phone was too expensive for him.

31
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,510
Only then did he tell me

32
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,990
that during one of his deliveries,

33
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,990
he got into a fight with someone.

34
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,270
He was beaten up.

35
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,860
After that, I didn't know
if the other party regretted his action or what,

36
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,230
but they bought that phone to make it up to him.

37
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,910
Don't you think it's strange too?

38
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,230
If Miao Xiaowei was speaking the truth,

39
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,300
He Zongyi would have had no need to hide the fact

40
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,740
that he got into a fight with someone.

41
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,620
And all of them were staying together.

42
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,860
If the others had no idea,

43
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,790
that means he wasn't seriously injured.

44
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,940
If so, did the other party

45
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,820
need to buy him something that expensive

46
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,860
to make it up to him?

47
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,740
And

48
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,060
I rechecked the evidence yesterday.

49
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,710
Come with me.

50
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,350
Look.

51
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,420
Not only is this suit expensive,

52
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,990
but it's also a traditional suit.

53
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,300
If he was meeting a fellow townsman his age,

54
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,500
He Zongyi could've used the money

55
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,740
[Money Lender, one hundred thousand]
to rent a modern suit.

56
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
So, in my opinion,

57
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,350
if he wasn't seeing an elder,

58
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,710
that means...

59
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,030
He was seeing someone powerful.

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,350
You're right.

61
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,990
That's what I mean.

62
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,380
You arrived at the same conclusion as I did.

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,790
Seems like our hearts are interconnected.

64
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,670
It wasn't me.

65
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,740
Don't tell me it's him.

66
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,820
Tao Ze, I told you before.

67
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,740
Our case details shouldn't be...

68
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,710
I know.

69
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,420
It was purely an accident yesterday.

70
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,300
And don't worry.

71
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,590
We didn't go against the regulations.

72
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,910
What else did he say?

73
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,710
Sticking a note on the victim's head

74
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,380
can be seen as an elder
trying to teach a junior a lesson

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,420
or as an act of bullying.

76
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,180
And the culprit
has a narcissistic personality disorder.

77
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,300
So you think

78
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,470
that the person He Zongyi was going to meet

79
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,740
and the person who bought him the phone,

80
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,260
or even

81
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,620
-the 100,000 yuan...
-They're the same person.

82
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,150
We have no evidence.

83
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,710
That's right.

84
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,150
That's why I wish to investigate it further.

85
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,470
All right.

86
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,590
We'll proceed with that.

87
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,670
Tao Ze.

88
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,060
You know what I think about Pei Su.

89
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,550
People who suffer from empathy deficit disorder

90
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,590
are the most dangerous bunch

91
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,860
among Apaths.

92
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,260
They understand fear

93
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,420
and guilt.

94
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,150
However, they have no empathy.

95
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
They take themselves to the top of society

96
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,940
and manipulate other people's lives
for pleasure and enjoyment.

97
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,550
And, regarding how those people end up,

98
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,350
I'm sure you've seen plenty of it by now.

99
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,590
Pei Su...

100
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,420
Maybe he's...

101
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,030
It's because you didn't witness it yourself.

102
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,350
Do not let Pei Su get a hold of our case details.

103
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,790
Do not let him turn into someone like that.

104
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,300
We made that promise before.

105
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,550
And even if Pei Su is sensitive to crimes,

106
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,590
those are just his speculations.

107
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,860
You cannot use them as leads.

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,350
Just like what our mentor kept telling us.

109
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,910
That's we need to do things based on evidence.

110
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,990
Go now.

111
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,970
[He Zongyi]

112
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,740
Is this the person?

113
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,350
Yes.

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,300
Hello, Captain Luo?

115
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,670
Understood.

116
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,590
I'll see if there are any witnesses.

117
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,500
Excuse me. When He Zongyi
was delivering the goods,

118
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,380
have you ever seen

119
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,230
or heard

120
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,620
that he got into a fight?

121
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,420
A fight?

122
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,990
Does it count if he was beaten up?

123
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,380
It happened at that door.

124
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,740
Do you have surveillance cameras here?

125
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,350
We do.

126
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Captain Luo, I told Wu to do
an investigation just now.

127
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,590
The guy who beat up He Zongyi
is called Zhang Donglan.

128
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,300
He's the son of Zhaonan Group's CEO.

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,790
That means...

130
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,820
He's Chief Zhang's nephew.

131
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,590
That's right.

132
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,940
Did you find out why he beat him up?

133
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,620
No.

134
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
They said they had no idea
why they got into a fight.

135
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,470
However, He Zongyi didn't retaliate.

136
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,550
So the fight didn't last long.

137
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,470
He was fine in the end.

138
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,260
And the fight was over.

139
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,230
On the day the crime happened,

140
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,790
did the staff who saw He Zongyi say

141
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,990
that they witnessed

142
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,860
any abnormal behaviors from He Zongyi?

143
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,420
They said he was acting normally.

144
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,620
However, one of them said

145
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,420
that He Zongyi tried

146
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,180
to inquire about a private club

147
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,230
on the day the crime happened.

148
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,990
Find out where it is.

149
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,590
I need to know its name.

150
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,990
This club is crucial to our investigation.

151
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,470
Please wait a moment. I'll ask them right now.

152
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,620
Hello?

153
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,420
Luo,

154
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,260
Miao Xiaowei dropped another important lead.

155
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,940
What is it?

156
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,420
We followed the lead,
which was He Zongyi's suit,

157
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,150
and inquired about the meeting from him.

158
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,430
He said he had never heard He Zongyi mention

159
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,780
that he knew any elders

160
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,070
or powerful figures in Xinzhou.

161
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,310
But on that day,

162
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,990
He Zongyi inquired about a place from him.

163
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,830
What place?

164
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,310
Captain Luo, I got the name.

165
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,430
The place is called...

166
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,620
-Chengguang Club.
-Chengguang Club.

167
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,160
Tao Ze,

168
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,010
do you miss me already?

169
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,680
Were you at Chengguang Club

170
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,250
two nights ago?

171
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,760
I was.

172
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,970
What's the matter?

173
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,640
Were you together with someone
named Zhang Donglan?

174
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,040
Yes.

175
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,370
Captain Luo, how did it go?

176
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,040
Have you confirmed that it was the suspect?

177
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,730
Yes.

178
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,130
The Chengguang Club you found

179
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,210
was actually a private club
that Zhang Donglan designated.

180
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,370
And during the day the crime happened,

181
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,210
Zhang Donglan was at Chengguang Club.

182
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,450
Did you bring that person back?

183
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,880
The guys at Xiaxi District
didn't obstruct you, did they?

184
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,520
They didn't.

185
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,520
This case

186
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,010
has implicated the SID.

187
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,040
But now,

188
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,450
we do have a solid reason to bring him back now.

189
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,850
The guys at Xiaxi District were happy
to let him go

190
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,130
when they heard that he's Chief Zhang's nephew.

191
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,640
That's why we brought him back.

192
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,560
However,

193
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,250
he's a tough nut to crack.

194
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,020
[Zhang Donglan, Nephew of Zhang Zhaojin]

195
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,380
Yes.

196
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,190
I might have beaten him up before.

197
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,740
So?

198
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,470
What's wrong with that?

199
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,620
I've beaten up plenty of people.

200
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,110
However, this truly has nothing to do with me.

201
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,990
You can ask Pei Su if you don't believe me.

202
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,900
Didn't I tell you already?

203
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,950
I was together with him on that day.

204
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,070
Officer Tao,

205
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,260
listen up.

206
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,740
If it weren't for Mr. Pei,

207
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,780
do you know what I would do

208
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,660
if you detained me like this?

209
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,260
I guess Mr. Tao will have a hard time.

210
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,710
Captain Luo,

211
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,380
a person with the surname Pei

212
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
wants to see Mr. Tao.

213
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,590
A person with the surname Pei?

214
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,470
Is it him again?

215
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,350
Please have a seat.

216
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,900
You really take this place as your home, huh?

217
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,190
Where's Tao Ze?

218
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,070
He's busy.

219
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,540
Officer Luo,

220
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,660
the coffee you have here

221
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,380
has a strange fragrance.

222
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,140
Do you need me to bring you guys

223
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,500
some top-quality coffee?

224
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,830
On the night of the third,

225
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,020
which was two nights ago,

226
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,190
where were you,

227
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,020
who were you together with,

228
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,740
and what did you do

229
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,430
between 8 to 11 PM?

230
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,990
Think twice before answering me.

231
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,470
Are you guys in charge of the case now?

232
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,130
If so, you should treat me better.

233
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
I would have no obligation
to answer your questions

234
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,330
if no one requested your interference.

235
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,520
I can leave at any time

236
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,250
if you upset me.

237
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,140
So, I have to please you?

238
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,110
Fine.

239
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,830
Tell me then.

240
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,540
How can I please you?

241
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,990
Do you want me to sing you a song?

242
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,430
Or do you want me to buy you some candy?

243
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,110
I'm sorry. I do mind it.

244
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,190
I have

245
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,380
pharyngitis.

246
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,590
World peace would dawn upon us

247
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,500
if you became mute.

248
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,710
I can't stand that.

249
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,070
Have you seen this person before?

250
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,230
I have.

251
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,950
Tell me the time and location.

252
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,230
I saw him two nights ago

253
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,070
at the entrance of a cafe in Xindong.

254
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,310
You remember him this clearly

255
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,350
even though you only saw him once?

256
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,470
The features on his forehead
are too obvious to forget.

257
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,540
You know this too.

258
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,110
I've been like this since I was young.

259
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,430
I'll remember something for the entire month
once I see it.

260
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,830
Have you been

261
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,500
to Chengguang Club two nights ago

262
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,020
between 8 to 11 PM?

263
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,990
Can you testify for Zhang Donglan?

264
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,190
Around 8:30 PM,

265
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,350
he received me at the entrance
of Chengguang Club.

266
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,990
I left the place around midnight.

267
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,380
I did greet him

268
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,900
at these two time slots.

269
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,230
Are those two the only time slots?

270
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,540
There was three and a half hour
between our meetings.

271
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,860
Officer, I'm sure you wouldn't believe me

272
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,260
if I said I was together with him
for the entire period.

273
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,540
That means

274
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,900
you cannot prove

275
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
that he had no time to commit the crime that night.

276
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,710
I cannot.

277
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,140
But someone else can.

278
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,430
If it's necessary,

279
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,950
I can make everyone

280
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,070
who got into contact with him on that night

281
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,660
come here within two hours.

282
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,660
Are you hinting at me

283
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,310
that you guys are planning
to forge false evidence

284
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,260
using your money and intimacy?

285
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:43,860
What?

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,310
Even so, it'll only involve
several models from the club.

287
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,140
Captain Luo, even a person like you is afraid

288
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,500
that you cannot find out the truth?

289
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,140
No.

290
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,350
I'll tell you

291
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,740
why it's impossible for Zhang Donglan
to be the culprit.

292
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,780
If it was him,

293
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,310
he would not need to kill him personally.

294
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,470
He could have hired someone

295
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,780
and kidnapped the victim for him.

296
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,950
The population of Xiaxi

297
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,500
consists of a floating population
from all islands.

298
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,950
People disappear every day.

299
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,150
No one will notice

300
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,870
when a single person is missing.

301
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,750
Killers are usually irrational

302
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,150
when they commit a crime.

303
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,870
Are you saying

304
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,470
that it's a crime of passion then?

305
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,870
If so, Officer Luo,

306
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,390
besides the blow

307
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,270
that knocked out the victim,

308
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,820
were there any other blunt force injuries
on the victim's body?

309
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,750
Who's doing the interrogation now?

310
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,110
Sounds like it's a no to me.

311
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,940
If so, I suggest you focus

312
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,990
on the victim's relatives and friends.

313
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,420
This might be an inside job.

314
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,660
They might have gone way back with each other.

315
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,510
Are you trying to clear Zhang Donglan's name now?

316
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,420
I'm just taking the matter on its merits.

317
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,750
A crime of passion is defined

318
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,030
as a murder committed by the culprit by accident
or someone unknown to the victim

319
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,150
when they lose their rationality
in a short period of time.

320
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,270
If so, the culprit did it out of spite.

321
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,390
Their rage will reach its peak in a short period.

322
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,580
After that, they'll vent it in an extreme way.

323
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,510
Facing a helpless victim

324
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,230
who was knocked unconscious,

325
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,150
I think the victim's head

326
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,180
would've been bashed in.

327
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,700
However,

328
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,180
if it were someone I longed to kill,

329
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,450
I would choose...

330
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,350
Strangulation.

331
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,860
Strangling a victim

332
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,740
is a type

333
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,460
of prolonged murder that's truly enjoyable.

334
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,100
Sometimes, it might

335
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,310
even turn people on.

336
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,030
Do you think a person who's dying of thirst

337
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,910
has the time to sit down and enjoy tea?

338
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,150
In my opinion,

339
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,510
this process is unnatural.

340
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,470
So, you're saying

341
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,100
that killing people is just like enjoying tea?

342
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,750
It's just a metaphor.

343
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,180
Don't split hairs.

344
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,820
I'm saying

345
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,100
that Zhang Donglan isn't the culprit.

346
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,660
If he did kill him,
he would not dispose of his corpse.

347
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,510
If he did try to dispose of his corpse,

348
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,790
he wouldn't dispose of it in an alley in Xiaxi,
which was unfamiliar territory to him.

349
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,660
I'm speaking from a rational perspective.

350
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,180
According to my hunch,

351
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,790
Zhang Donglan's father,

352
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,620
Zhang Zhaolin,

353
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,990
is the CEO of the famous Zhaonan Group.

354
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,470
And his uncle is the chief of SID.

355
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Moreover, he has been pampered all his life.

356
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,820
And he's a good-for-nothing.

357
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,340
Even if he's angry, at most, he'll insult you.

358
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,470
Even if committing heinous crimes isn't illegal,

359
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,230
I assume he doesn't have the guts to do so.

360
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,550
So, Captain Luo,

361
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,990
can I go now?

362
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,270
Sign here.

363
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,620
Confirm your statement.

364
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,230
Thank you for your cooperation.

365
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,550
Don't mention it.

366
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,340
I did it for Tao Ze.

367
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,270
This is standard procedure.

368
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,990
I wasn't sincere in thanking you.

369
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,100
Captain Luo,

370
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,230
don't you think there's a bigger doubt

371
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,620
you need to investigate?

372
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,820
Why is the SID

373
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,470
involved in this case?

374
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,070
This case of yours

375
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,990
has attracted public attention

376
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,030
for no reason

377
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,510
from the start.

378
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,340
And it's a serial killing from the get-go.

379
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,900
That's why you guys were involved.

380
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,550
Normally,

381
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,660
after a short period of abnormal attention,

382
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,180
people will lose interest.

383
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,510
But at this moment,

384
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,380
Zhang Donglan had to intervene in the fray.

385
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,070
If it was him,

386
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,990
to the SID,

387
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,030
which people refer

388
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,100
to as the last hope of Xinzhou,

389
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,550
it would be a huge scandal.

390
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,820
Is this merely a coincidence?

391
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,950
Or is there

392
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,230
a mastermind behind it?

393
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,580
This is normal, anyway.

394
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,990
It's just like that saying.

395
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,420
What was it again?

396
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,100
There's nothing new

397
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,710
in Xinzhou anyway.

398
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,070
The surveillance footage from cameras

399
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,340
outside Chengguang Club and on Shizi Road,
and the pictures.

400
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,860
I've sent all of them to your phone.

401
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,270
I might be a little nosy here.

402
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,030
[Crossroad Surveillance Camera Footage]
Since you guys have found Chengguang Club,

403
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,750
I believe you guys will find this too.

404
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,180
Just treat it

405
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,310
as if a normal civilian

406
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,270
is providing you guys with some leads.

407
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,710
Pei Su.

408
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,820
It's next week, right?

409
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,070
It's been seven years.

410
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,380
Are you still dwelling on it?

411
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,470
Big-Eyed Lan, what's the matter?

412
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,550
The guys at Xiaxi District
arrested Miao Xiaowei.

413
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,030
What?

414
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,270
[Trial Room]

415
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,790
How did it go?

416
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,510
That brat said

417
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,270
he might have drunk a little that night.

418
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,140
He saw someone pestering his sister.

419
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,310
He thought it was a hooligan.

420
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,140
That's why he beat him up on impulse.

421
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,100
After that, he forgot about the person

422
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,550
he had beaten up.

423
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,100
I showed him a picture of the victim.

424
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,340
He only said that he kind of remembers him.

425
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,420
And, according to him,

426
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,990
he never apologized to anyone

427
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,310
or bought anyone a phone.

428
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,620
I think he was speaking the truth.

429
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,820
Even now, he doesn't realize

430
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,310
that he's in the wrong for beating someone up.

431
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,030
Maybe it was someone else.

432
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,900
It's hard to say.

433
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,140
Have you told someone

434
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,950
to investigate Zhang Donglan's alibi?

435
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,820
I told Qiao to retrieve the surveillance footage
in Chengguang Club.

436
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,380
By the way,

437
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,580
was Pei Su here just now?

438
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,470
He left long ago.

439
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,180
Listen, that brat

440
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,070
is crossing the line here.

441
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,950
I told you not to let him get his way, right?

442
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,310
Look at how arrogant he is right now.

443
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,900
Pei Su said

444
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,820
that Zhang Donglan

445
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,270
was flirting with girls

446
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,710
when he wasn't beside him.

447
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,620
He should have been in Chengguang Club
for the entire duration.

448
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,510
If Zhang Donglan has no time to commit the crime,

449
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,820
at least the SID's name is clear.

450
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,860
That doesn't matter

451
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,030
right now.

452
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,340
Why?

453
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,270
Just now, Xiao Hanyang called us

454
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,230
and said that Cui Hongliang
had arrested Miao Xiaowei.

455
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,580
And Cui Hongliang
identified him as a major suspect.

456
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,470
What?

457
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,950
What's the evidence?

458
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,310
It was He Zongyi's phone.

459
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,580
Wu and the rest located his phone

460
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,750
using GPS.

461
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,510
The phone buyer confessed immediately.

462
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,270
He said Miao Xiaowei was the one

463
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,510
who sold the phone to him.

464
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,790
After that, Xiaxi District Patrol Detachment

465
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,900
found the fingerprints of Miao Xiaowei

466
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,180
and the victim on the phone.

467
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
The chain of evidence isn't complete
with just a phone.

468
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,230
This can only prove that Miao Xiaowei

469
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,420
stole He Zongyi's phone.

470
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,620
It's not enough to prove that he's the culprit.

471
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,510
He gave them his statement too.

472
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,380
When they interrogated him

473
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,550
and asked him where he got his phone,

474
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,750
he paused for a second

475
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,860
and said that he picked it up at the crime scene

476
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,270
after he heard that someone is having a fight.

477
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,660
It's like he's turning himself in.

478
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,270
Yeah.

479
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,230
It's been many years

480
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,620
since we encountered such an honest culprit.

481
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,510
There's even more.

482
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,990
They even discovered track marks

483
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,420
on Miao Xiaowei's arms.

484
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,710
He's a drug addict too?

485
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,710
Don't you think

486
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,710
it's too much of a coincidence?

487
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,950
This is unbelievable.

488
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,580
Initially, it was a kill-and-dump.

489
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,270
But now, it's involving the Zhaonan Group

490
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,180
and a drug crime.

491
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,990
Oh, yeah.

492
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,750
What did Chief Zhang

493
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,380
think about our interrogation
of Zhang Donglan?

494
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,270
He didn't comment on it to avoid suspicion.

495
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,620
What?

496
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,700
Du Yuliang, Acting Chief of SID]

497
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,270
Chief Du?

498
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,030
Chief Du.

499
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,230
What are you doing here in person?

500
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,180
You already brought Zhang Donglan here.

501
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,550
Of course I have to be here.

502
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,030
I'm doing it for Chief Zhang's sake.

503
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,100
If we detain Zhang Donglan,

504
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,140
other people won't be able
to get the goods on the SID.

505
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,550
Brat,

506
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,790
you're afraid that people might stir up
a commotion over their relationship.

507
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,950
You think I don't know that?

508
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,030
This case involves Chief Zhang.

509
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,100
The Ministry of Supervision
is paying much attention to it.

510
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,470
Zhang wants to avoid suspicion,

511
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,900
so I shall take over his position

512
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,380
for the time being.

513
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,180
It's that serious?

514
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,270
Come with me.

515
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,310
Captain Luo,

516
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,420
what about He Zongyi's call history

517
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,230
and the surveillance footage
of Chengguang Club?

518
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,620
I'll take care of the call history.
You can take the footage.

519
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,990
Continue your investigation.
There's no overtime pay here.

520
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:19,950
Okay.

521
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,100
Big-Eyed Lan, time to work overtime.

522
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,620
Are you saying

523
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,380
that the place of disposal

524
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,820
has something special about it?

525
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,420
Yes.

526
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,510
We checked the soles of the victim's shoes.

527
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,750
They're clean

528
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,950
even though the crime scene
is filled with mud and garbage.

529
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,750
And Miao Xiaowei has confirmed

530
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,030
that He Zongyi did wear that pair of shoes

531
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,230
when he went outside.

532
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,340
Basically, we can eliminate the possibility

533
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,710
of the culprit changing the victim's shoes.

534
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,310
If the culprit intended to go to another place
to commit the crime,

535
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,950
why would he choose a risky place like that

536
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,750
to dispose of the victim's body?

537
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,620
Unless...

538
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,790
Continue.

539
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,230
Unless that place

540
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,140
has something that people dare not talk about

541
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,270
even if they see them.

542
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,750
When Miao Xiaowei was interrogated,

543
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,030
he said

544
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,420
that he heard someone fighting
near the crime scene.

545
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,990
But when we asked him
what he saw after heading downstairs,

546
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,470
he hesitated to speak.

547
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,380
That means

548
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,270
certain events

549
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,790
will happen in that place frequently,

550
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,550
which people dare not talk about.

551
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,900
Luo Weizhao,

552
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,230
what are you trying to say?

553
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,510
Chief Du,

554
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,470
at first, I only had my doubts.

555
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,510
But when Chief Zhang told me about it,

556
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,580
I knew

557
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,620
the fugitive was just an excuse

558
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,860
to get us involved in the case.

559
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,030
I'm afraid the drug overdose cases

560
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,510
that happened in Xiaxi a few months ago

561
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,950
are the cases

562
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,550
we should pay attention to.

563
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,900
Just now, Qiao told me

564
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,100
that they discovered

565
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,340
track marks on Miao Xiaowei's arms.

566
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,750
That's how I was able to confirm my speculation.

567
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,550
This is a file containing reports
from anonymous individuals.

568
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,860
It contains the three cases
you mentioned just now.

569
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,270
Deputy Director Cui Hongliang,
who is in command of Xiaxi District,

570
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,270
is the drug syndicate's protective umbrella.

571
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,180
What's your evidence?

572
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,820
Just like what you've noticed,

573
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,620
the crime scenes of the three cases

574
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,070
are in the same area.

575
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,750
All of them are in the same area
where He Zongyi's body was disposed to?

576
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,790
But these are just speculations.

577
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,510
We lack conclusive evidence.

578
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
That's why Chief Zhang

579
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,550
wants us to get involved.

580
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,580
The leads are many and complicated.

581
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,420
Many things aren't as simple as they seem.

582
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,310
That's why

583
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,820
I didn't show it to you before this.

584
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,100
If these reports are valid,

585
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,510
we'll know why his body was disposed of.

586
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,470
And we'll know why everyone
wasn't willing to talk about it.

587
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,580
As for He Zongyi,

588
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,270
it's either he was colluding
with the drug traffickers,

589
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,030
or the culprit moved his body there

590
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,580
because the culprit
knew some inside information.

591
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,140
The culprit wants those drug traffickers
to pay for the victim's life.

592
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,180
These doubts alone

593
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,340
are not enough.

594
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,420
We still lack conclusive evidence.

595
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,750
Otherwise, the SID still has no right

596
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,420
to join the investigation officially
without it.

597
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,990
Tell Tao Ze and the rest

598
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,030
to continue investigating the leads
Zhang Donglan provides.

599
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,310
As Chief Zhang is involved,

600
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,820
it concerns the SID.

601
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,030
As for the other lead,

602
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,030
you can investigate it alone.

603
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,580
Do not alert the guys at Xiaxi District for now.

604
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,820
Report to me immediately if there's any update.

605
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,550
Yes, sir.

606
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,660
We'll investigate both leads.

607
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,790
I'll request an official intervention
when I find conclusive evidence.

608
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,470
All right, resume your work.

609
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,470
Weizhao,

610
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,420
Xiaxi District is a complicated place.

611
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,820
Many drug traffickers aren't afraid of death.

612
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,270
Don't forget about your mentor's instructions.

613
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,710
Do not act recklessly.

614
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,420
Don't worry about me, Du.

615
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,070
Mr. Tao, I've reviewed all of them.

616
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,140
I think I'm going blind.

617
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,860
How did it go?

618
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,990
Zhang Donglan exited the place
four times in total.

619
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,380
The total time he spent was 40 minutes.

620
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,820
However, each exit was short.

621
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,950
At around 9 PM,

622
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,030
the dinner in Chengguang Club was over.

623
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,580
Zhang Donglan left the room,

624
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,380
and, for the first time, his face was caught
by the surveillance camera in the courtyard.

625
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,990
He spent some time in the courtyard.

626
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,820
After that, he went back inside.

627
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,990
At 9:45 PM,

628
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,860
he was seen in the courtyard again.

629
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,950
He went to the courtyard with a girl,
and they spoke for a while.

630
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,030
After that, they walked into the forest.

631
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,900
That makes sense.

632
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,070
The surveillance camera outside the hotel

633
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,310
recorded Zhang Donglan

634
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,950
coming out of the forest with a girl.

635
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,140
Since his schedule was so packed,

636
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,340
it seemed like

637
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,900
he had no time to commit the crime.

638
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,860
Did the surveillance camera record He Zongyi?

639
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,340
There are too many cameras outside.

640
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm reviewing them one by one.

641
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,380
Captain Luo said

642
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,070
that we could try checking out

643
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,310
the surveillance camera on Shizi Road.

644
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,470
Shizi Road?

645
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,420
Why?

646
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,710
I don't know.

647
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,820
But I think

648
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,900
Pei Su said it.

649
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,750
Pei Su?

650
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,030
Mr. Tao,

651
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,380
actually, I've wanted

652
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,820
to ask you this for a long time.

653
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,580
Can I ask you now?

654
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,790
Is it about Pei Su?

655
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,140
Who exactly is Pei Su?

656
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Why does Captain Luo
still value his suggestions

657
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,070
even though he treats him like his sworn enemy?

658
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,510
And what do they mean by seven years?

659
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,270
What happened seven years ago?

660
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,180
Seven years ago?

661
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,550
Who did you hear that from?

662
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,750
I heard Captain Luo saying that
when I was at the entrance.

663
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,660
But I wasn't eavesdropping on them.

664
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,100
So,

665
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,860
what exactly is going on?

666
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,420
Pei Su reported a suicide case

667
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,990
when Weizhao and I

668
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,470
were handling a case.

669
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,510
It was seven years ago.

670
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,660
Weizhao and I just graduated
from university back then.

671
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,620
You know this too.

672
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,070
He was born in Xinzhou, and he had good grades.

673
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,270
And there were not many people
who were more capable than him.

674
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,180
That's why

675
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,620
when we first started patrolling the community,

676
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,820
Weizhao tried his best

677
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,340
to save everyone from everything.

678
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,030
When they told him
to mediate a community conflict,

679
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,660
he turned it into a fight instead.

680
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,380
However, there weren't many cases

681
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,030
we could investigate in the community.

682
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,310
The first and only case

683
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,230
we received

684
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,900
was Pei Su's.

685
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,750
Mom?

686
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,370
[Seven years ago]

687
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,100
(According to our investigation,)

688
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,270
(all evidence led to suicide.)

689
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,550
(However, Pei Su never believed it.)

690
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,580
-(He was very agitated.)
-No.

691
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,100
My father is an Apath.

692
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,950
I'm sure he killed my mother.

693
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,710
It's impossible for my mother
to take her own life.

694
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,790
It's my father.

695
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,380
(He insisted that his father)

696
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,820
(was related to his mother's death.)

697
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,030
It's impossible for my mother
to take her own life.

698
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,470
It's impossible for my mother
to take her own life!

699
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,470
That's impossible!

700
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,710
Mr. Pei,

701
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,580
although we've revoked the case,

702
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
there are still

703
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,950
some procedures we need to go through.

704
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,140
Please cooperate with us.

705
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:47,990
Okay.

706
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,580
Sorry for the trouble.

707
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,270
Wait!

708
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,620
Officer Luo,

709
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
is there anything else?

710
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,180
There are still some doubts about this case.

711
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,180
Don't tell me Captain Luo

712
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,820
went against the rules
and helped him investigate the case?

713
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,030
That's impossible. That's not how he works.

714
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,950
Technically, it's not an investigation.

715
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,180
Back then, there was conclusive evidence
for the case.

716
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,580
So we had nothing to investigate.

717
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,340
Although his father, Pei Chengyu,

718
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,860
didn't pay enough attention to his family,

719
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,550
he had no motive to murder his mother.

720
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,340
If so, Pei Su must be...

721
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,860
In the end,

722
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,470
Weizhao was the one who broke the news to him.

723
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,470
(I don't know what Weizhao told him back then.)

724
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,300
(But since then,)

725
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,740
(they've been at odds with each other.)

726
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,580
(We thought that Pei Su wasn't able)

727
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,550
(to get over his mother's death)

728
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,910
because his subconscious mind

729
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,620
might be resenting his mother
for abandoning him.

730
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,030
However,

731
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,620
he never listens to us.

732
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,470
(Although we had taken care of him for seven years,)

733
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,700
(one)

734
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,700
(was rash)

735
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,740
(and unrestrained,)

736
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,620
(while the other was meticulous)

737
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,180
(and aloof.)

738
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,580
(When they're together,)

739
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,510
(they'll argue non-stop)

740
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,260
(over something silly.)

741
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,510
(They've been contacting each other less and less)

742
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,220
(since Pei Su inherited
his father's inheritance.)

743
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,220
(I think it might be because...)

744
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,620
[Letter of Report]
(they still haven't let go of the past.)

745
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,260
If so, why did he insist
that his father was the one who killed his mother?

746
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,660
His father, Pei Chengyu,

747
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,220
is the CEO of Pei Group.

748
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,430
He's a talented businessman.

749
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,620
He doesn't spend time with his family usually.

750
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,260
I guess Pei Su firmly believes

751
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,740
that his father's absence

752
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,780
was related to his mother's suicide.

753
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,870
It's pretty cruel

754
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,260
to a child.

755
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,510
If so, has his relationship

756
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,950
with his father gotten any better?

757
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,140
His father was caught in a traffic accident
three years ago.

758
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,510
He is in a persistent vegetative state now.

759
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,070
Don't tell me

760
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,070
both of them are Apaths.

761
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,700
Although we couldn't find anything conclusive,

762
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,870
Weizhao held a grudge against him.

763
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,350
He said he found out

764
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,070
that this child has a special talent.

765
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,620
What talent?

766
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,550
He's a genius at committing crimes.

767
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,140
(His memories)

768
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,070
(are cruel.)

769
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,030
(They resurface, detail by detail,)

770
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,350
(recalling the scene that happened that night.)

771
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,740
[Du Jia]

772
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,300
Mr. Pei, what's the matter?

773
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,870
I have an update.

774
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,260
What is it about this time?

775
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,030
It's about Julien.

776
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,990
[8th March, with my little brother, Chen Zhen]
8th March?

777
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,660
Little brother?

778
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,780
Shoo, Frying Pan!

779
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,580
Get off.

780
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,400
[The trade location has been changed
to the vacant land at Golden Triangle]

781
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,390
The vacant land at Golden Triangle?

782
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,660
Hello, Tao Ze. Go ahead.

783
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,830
Captain Luo, we found something.

784
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,220
Around 8:50 PM,

785
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,740
He Zongyi appeared at Shizi Road,

786
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,740
which was nearby Chengguang Club,
with a kraft paper bag.

787
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,830
Kraft paper bag?

788
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,070
That's right.

789
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,350
The kraft paper bag

790
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,780
[Chengguang Club, Shizi Road East Junction]
didn't appear at the crime scene.

791
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,030
But we suspect

792
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,660
the "one hundred thousand" note
taped on the victim's forehead

793
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,430
was torn down from this kraft paper bag.

794
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,070
If so, that means He Zongyi

795
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,180
met the money lender last night.

796
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,830
That's right.

797
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,550
Judging from the shape of the kraft paper parcel,

798
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,180
it should contain the 100,000 yuan.

799
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,580
What else is there?

800
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,780
He Zongyi smoked a cigarette
under the street lamp for a moment.

801
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,660
He answered a phone call too. He left at 9:30 PM.

802
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,660
[Twelve seconds]
9:30 PM?

803
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,390
That number doesn't exist either.

804
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,350
Either?

805
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,580
Is there anyone else besides him?

806
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,180
It's nothing.

807
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,100
Did you find out where he went?

808
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,990
I did.

809
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,390
When he left,

810
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,220
he wasn't heading toward Chengguang Club.

811
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,700
He headed in another direction.

812
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,780
There was a bus stop over there.

813
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,780
Lan Qiao and I retrieved the road camera footage.

814
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,030
We did locate He Zongyi.

815
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,620
He got on Trolleybus Route 34.

816
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,740
And he got off the trolleybus

817
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,990
at Wenchang Junction Stop at around 10 PM.

818
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,780
If that's the case,

819
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,140
that means Miao Xiaowei's testimony
doesn't add up.

820
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,220
It's impossible for He Zongyi

821
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,470
to be in Xiaxi District at this time.

822
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,620
That's right.

823
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,910
Good job.

824
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,510
Gather all of our men.

825
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,580
Search the entire Wenchang Road tomorrow.

826
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,950
Yes, sir.

827
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,700
Pei Su,

828
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,990
why are you here again?

829
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,510
Are you here to deliver some warmth to us again?

830
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,470
All right, don't be anxious.

831
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,780
I'll notify them for you later.

832
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,030
I'll ask them to give you a stack of VIP fines, okay?

833
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,300
Do I have to be fined
even when I'm accompanying my friend's sister

834
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,350
to cooperate with your investigation?

835
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,780
Captain Luo,

836
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,870
don't you think you're being too harsh
on a normal civilian?

837
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,550
Zhang Ying?

838
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,200
[Zhang Ying, Zhang Donglan's younger sister]

839
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,620
Let's cut it short.

840
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,910
Do you know this guy?

841
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,870
Can't you treat a lady nicer?

842
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,950
It's fine. Don't be afraid.

843
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,070
Miss Zhang,

844
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,300
this is the reception room,
not the interrogation room.

845
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,350
Your brother is a major suspect now.

846
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,220
This concerns a homicide.

847
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,300
Every single word you utter
is of utmost importance.

848
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,660
Understood?

849
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,390
It's fine.

850
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,220
Just tell him the truth.

851
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,550
Captain Luo arrived at the same conclusion as me.

852
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,300
We both believe

853
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,140
that it's impossible for your brother
to be related to this case.

854
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,180
I saw that guy before.

855
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,390
Back then, I was doing my internship
at a trading company.

856
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,350
I was working overtime that day.

857
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,390
I wanted to buy some coffee as I felt sleepy.

858
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,990
But for some reason,

859
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,390
one guy kept following me.

860
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,070
He kept mumbling.

861
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,910
He asked me if I knew a guy called Feng Nian

862
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,390
or Feng Nianguo.

863
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,780
His surname is Feng?

864
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,390
Is it Nianguo or Nian?

865
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,870
I don't know.

866
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,740
Anyway, that sounded like what he uttered.

867
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,780
He doesn't seem like he's from Xinzhou.

868
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,470
He spoke with an accent.

869
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,100
I didn't know which word he was uttering.

870
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,510
I don't know

871
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,580
if it was a nickname

872
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,910
or his true name.

873
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,550
I was so afraid back then.

874
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,910
I wanted to avoid him.

875
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,100
When did that happen?

876
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,660
It's been some time.

877
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,870
After that?

878
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,550
Did he retaliate?

879
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,660
No.

880
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,910
He was just dodging while protecting his face.

881
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,620
Only then did I find out

882
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,620
that he was pretty young.

883
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,100
I thought I misunderstood him.

884
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,510
I dragged my brother immediately.

885
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,660
I told him to stop.

886
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,780
Who else was there back then?

887
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,180
My boyfriend was there too.

888
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,870
My brother was drunk that day.

889
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,780
So my boyfriend drove.

890
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,070
They went there together.

891
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,870
Seems like all nice girls
already have boyfriends, huh?

892
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,780
Who was it? He was pretty quick.

893
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,910
It's Rongshun's Zhou Hongchuan.

894
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,300
We met each other at Chengguang Club.

895
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,740
So it's the law firm
that Pei Group employed, right?

896
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,740
Captain Luo, you're pretty resourceful, aren't you?

897
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,260
What happened after that?

898
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,950
Did you see He Zongyi after that?

899
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,700
Captain Luo,

900
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,300
my brother will never kill anyone.

901
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,660
He Zongyi's dormmate said

902
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,470
He Zongyi brought a new phone back to the dorm

903
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,550
and said the other party compensated him with it

904
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,620
after he got involved in a fight.

905
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,990
Did you know about that?

906
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,740
I didn't.

907
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,260
My brother told me nothing.

908
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,300
I don't think that'd be the case either.

909
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,950
My brother only punched him

910
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,300
because he wanted to stand up for me.

911
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,870
After that,

912
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,660
we never saw him again.

913
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,830
My brother will never kill a person

914
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,100
because of a trivial matter like this.

915
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,070
It's impossible for him to kill anyone.

916
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,100
Captain Luo,

917
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,830
please trust me, okay?

918
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,510
Okay.

919
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:17,660
Don't worry.

920
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,070
Since your brother didn't kill anyone,

921
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,830
he'll be fine here.

922
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,780
Zhang.

923
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,510
Yes, sir?

924
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:31,870
Sorry about that.

925
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,620
There's a procedure we need to go through.

926
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,070
Please follow my colleague

927
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,740
and give

928
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,580
your statement.

929
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,620
It'll be fine.

930
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,990
Go now. Don't be afraid.

931
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:41,830
I'll wait here for you.

932
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:48,830
Goodbye, Captain Luo.

933
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,470
Where's Tao Ze?

934
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,470
Thanks to the lead provided
by a civilian who's eager to help,

935
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,660
he's rushing off his feet in the city
to investigate the case.

936
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,830
He hasn't found it yet?

937
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,550
Pei Su,

938
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,990
don't you think you're too concerned

939
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:19,990
about this case?

940
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,220
I remember someone once telling me

941
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,580
that everything that happens in the world

942
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,780
will leave traces behind.

943
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,070
And these traces

944
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,070
are the only evidence

945
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,870
that can prove our subjective will.

946
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,510
They're very important.

947
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,390
Where's the badge?

948
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,870
(Everything that happens in the world)

949
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,070
(will leave traces behind.)

950
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,910
(And these traces are the only evidence)

951
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,740
(that can prove our subjective will.)

952
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,100
The door and windows were locked.

953
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,300
There were no signs of a break-in.

954
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,070
The security system in the house,

955
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,510
which was considered
the most advanced back then,

956
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,870
was untouched.

957
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,260
She put on makeup,

958
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,830
changed into a dress,

959
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,430
and even played music.

960
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,780
There was a sense of ceremony to it.

961
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,470
And a written will was on the table.

962
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,180
After verification,

963
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,390
we determined that the handwriting
belonged to the victim.

964
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,070
The person who wrote the letter

965
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,140
was obviously depressed.

966
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,780
She was an adult.

967
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,550
There were no signs

968
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,070
of drugs in her body.

969
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,780
There was no wound on her body either.

970
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,950
Those were all the pieces of evidence
we gathered back then.

971
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,700
You were the one who reported the case.

972
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,180
You reached the crime scene earlier than we did.

973
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,510
Unless you tell me

974
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,550
that you were hiding some sort of evidence,

975
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,430
it was most certainly suicide.

976
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,780
Back then, I told you

977
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,260
everything that happens in the world

978
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,550
leaves traces behind,

979
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,070
only if they're true events.

980
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,910
Pei Su,

981
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,950
you might have a special hunch.

982
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,780
You might be good at digging out
people's true feelings.

983
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,100
However, we can't solve cases with hunches alone.

984
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,740
Fine.

985
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,260
Speaking about psychology,

986
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,100
I don't know

987
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,550
if you have heard of this foreign theory before.

988
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,950
According to the theory,
if someone wishes to take their life,

989
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,660
they might suddenly confess
their feelings to their family members

990
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,830
in a certain way.

991
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,140
You heard

992
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,580
what she said back then too.

She's been dead for seven years.

999
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:57,950
The case was closed long ago.

1000
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,030
Evidence that was related to the case is gone too.

1001
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,580
You can choose to remember her

1002
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,830
as a sort of emotional sustenance.

1003
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,740
However, it's meaningless

1004
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,390
for you to dwell on the past.

1005
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,740
I do not accept your conclusion,

1006
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,660
