Wu's rank is higher than yours.

189
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,660
Hanyang, ignore her.

190
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,420
Mr. Tao.

191
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,810
Don't play favorites.

192
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,850
Don't give him special treatment

193
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,020
just because he's new.

194
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,980
Young lady.

195
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,570
If you have time for ragging,

196
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,090
you might as well help Captain Luo in the kitchen.

197
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,770
Run along.

198
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,290
Oh my!

199
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,570
Captain Luo,

200
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,900
you're a good cook.

201
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,130
And it's Chinese food.

202
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,050
You guys can try my cooking.

203
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,530
Tao Ze hasn't had this for a long time.

204
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,850
All right, you should go out now.
Don't mess things up here.

205
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,220
Mind your manners.

206
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,290
The food is tempting me.

207
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,570
It's been so long since I had Chinese food.

208
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,660
Captain Luo.

209
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,810
Since you're good at cooking,

210
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,370
why do you still go to the canteen every day?

211
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,220
What? Am I supposed to whip a feast up

212
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,090
and eat with my cat?

213
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,850
You think I'm insane?

214
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,260
When will Pei Su be here?

215
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,420
-Pei Su?
-Pei Su...

216
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,130
Pei Su is coming?

217
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,050
Why are you asking him?

218
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,020
Nothing.

219
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,020
When I went to report to duty,

220
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,020
I bumped into Chief Du.

221
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,460
He wanted me to give Pei Su this.

222
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,220
Brave and courageous, dedicated to Xinzhou.

223
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,120
[Brave and courageous, dedicated to Xinzhou]

224
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,260
Here's the brave and courageous guy
who's dedicated to Xinzhou.

225
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,090
Hello?

226
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,570
Ze,

227
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,290
which floor are you on?

228
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,460
12th floor.

229
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,220
By the way,

230
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,330
the lifts are out of order.

231
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,020
You'll have to use the stairs.

232
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,260
You didn't bring anything heavy, did you?

233
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,740
See you later.

234
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,980
Which floor are you going?

235
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,050
Do you need help?

236
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,020
Sorry about that.

237
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,330
I must be in your way.

238
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,850
Oh, no.

239
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,810
He should have been here in five minutes.

240
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,900
Why isn't he here yet?

241
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,740
Maybe he's doing another brave deed.

242
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,980
The ribs are almost done.

243
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,290
Do you have rock sugar?

244
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,810
No.

245
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,570
I'm going down to check on Pei Su.

246
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,370
I'll buy some rock sugar too.

247
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,220
What kind of sugar do you need?

248
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,810
You're bringing him here?

249
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,050
You're spoiling him.

250
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,530
Where are you going?

251
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,090
To buy some rock sugar.

252
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,530
You don't know what I want.

253
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,090
What are you staring at?

254
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,610
I realized that recently,

255
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,810
you seemed to have grown closer to Pei.

256
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Me, closer?

257
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,900
I just don't want to stoop to his level.

258
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,500
I'm off.

259
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,740
They're gone.

260
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,570
Then, should we...

261
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,770
I don't think so.

262
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,940
That's how the lifts here are.

263
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,900
They're out of order sometimes,

264
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,370
but I guess they'll be fixed soon.

265
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,370
It's okay. I'm not in a rush.

266
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,610
Besides,

267
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,700
with you girls around,

268
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,020
I don't feel bored.

269
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,260
Hey, Mr. Pei.

270
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,050
What are your legs for?

271
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,180
Can't you even climb some stairs?

272
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,940
Tastes great.

273
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,810
Tang Ning.

274
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,810
[Tang Ning]
Tao Ze.

275
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,530
What are you doing here?

276
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,530
I just moved in.

277
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,020
I'm staying here now.

278
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,940
What are you...

279
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,050
I'm staying here.

280
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,610
What a coincidence.

281
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,330
By the way,

282
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,330
sorry about last time.

283
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,500
I couldn't show up for our dates

284
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,810
because I was either busy or stuck in a jam.

285
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,460
I'm sorry.

286
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,740
You were busy with work.

287
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,700
I understand.

288
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,700
Mister.

289
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,940
[Zhang Yuchen]
I'd like to borrow your handkerchief.

290
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,290
Sure.

291
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,220
Well,

292
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,420
if you're not busy today,

293
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,900
why don't you come to my house?

294
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,740
Sure.

295
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,530
My sister is working overtime today,

296
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,020
so only Chen and I are home.

297
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,810
That's great.

298
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,130
Let's go. I'm staying on the 12th floor.

299
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,020
It's kind of high up there.

300
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,370
It's okay. We're staying on the 17th floor.

301
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:57,980
Let's go.

302
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,180
That fool is finally trying to pick up a girl.

303
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,900
I have complicated feelings now.

304
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,540
[Fully automatic coffee machine]

305
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,850
Hey, youngsters.

306
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,500
Don't you have some sense of respect?

307
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:29,980
Coffee machine?

308
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,130
Here.

309
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,570
To your new house!

310
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,050
Thank you, everyone.

311
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,330
Dig in.

312
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,700
Tang Ning,

313
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,020
so you were classmates
with Mr. Tao back in high school,

314
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,740
and you met each other on a blind date.

315
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,260
You guys must be fated.

316
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,810
Has Mr. Tao always been this good

317
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,940
since high school?

318
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,980
He was good,

319
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,570
but he was also a meek guy.

320
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,660
I didn't expect him to join the SID.

321
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,330
Mr. Tao may not be

322
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,130
the best fighter,

323
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,500
but he's good at everything else.

324
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,370
He's knowledgeable and enthusiastic at work.

325
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,500
He's dedicated to society,

326
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,610
and he loves animals.

327
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,050
Besides,

328
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,180
over the years,

329
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,220
in order to protect us, his minions,

330
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,050
he teamed up with our cold-blooded captain

331
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,500
to fight against crimes.

332
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,810
It's all for Mr. Tao.

333
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,260
We need to support our own kind.

334
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,740
I will remember what you did for him on his behalf.

335
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,330
Tao is a patient man.

336
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,700
Yeah, Mr. Tao is quite a good guy.

337
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:46,900
Very good.

338
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,220
If he ever has children,

339
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,850
he will be a model father.

340
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,220
I caused him much trouble when I was young.

341
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
My mom left early,

342
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,050
and my dad didn't care much about me.

343
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,260
He took care of me voluntarily
for quite some time.

344
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:06,980
Actually, back then,

345
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,220
I was already a teenager.

346
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,050
Even if left alone,

347
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,530
I wouldn't die of starvation either.

348
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,370
But from him,

349
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,500
I learned what it means to live seriously.

350
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,660
Ning.

351
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,740
He may look nonchalant

352
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,530
when alone,

353
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,180
but if you were under his care,

354
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,770
he'd take care of everything for you.

355
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,050
Such high praises from everyone.

356
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,810
Looks like

357
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,810
Tao Ze is a popular guy.

358
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,740
Yes.

359
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,700
No, not at all.

360
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,260
I didn't take care of Pei Su alone.

361
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,810
Everyone cared about you.

362
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,740
When my mentor heard about you,

363
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,050
he'd often ask about you.

364
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,900
Also,

365
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,660
there's Luo.

366
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,370
He may look quiet usually,

367
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,050
but he really cares about you.

368
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,090
Also,

369
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,700
your game console

370
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,500
was actually...

371
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,420
Really?

372
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,370
Our captain did that?

373
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:01,850
What's wrong?

374
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,330

562
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,930

it's hard to challenge the fact
that his mother died of suicide.

00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,090
Give me more time.

569

If the result remains the same,

570

I will tell him myself.

571

575
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,050

from the black market.

barking at all these years

You didn't let me read your mentor's notebook

605

606

about how Guo Feiling's father

608

started his own investigation

609
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,860
and claimed that he found the suspect,

610
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,050
then used a long blade

611
