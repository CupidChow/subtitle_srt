00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,840
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,320
Where is it?

191
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll lead you the way.

192
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,320
Mr. Pei, come with me.

193
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,050
[XWI Children's Palace]

194
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,080
What was she looking at?

195
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,480
Was there someone outside the window?

196
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,630
Mirror.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,790
She used the window as a mirror.

198
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,510
She only needed to turn her head
to look at the view.

199
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,080
She didn't have to turn her whole body

200
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
to get a closer look.

201
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,870
She also played with her hair
using a ballpoint pen.

202
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,960
All girls know what this means.

203
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,000
Pause it.

204
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,000
What is the location across the window
that Chen was looking at?

205
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,870
Playground.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,750
Get the surveillance footage

207
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,510
of the playground before

208
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,440
and after 5:12 PM.

209
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,600
What's this?

210
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,000
Didn't you say your surveillance camera
covers every corner of the park?

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,600
It's not that.

212
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,320
The red row in the northwest corner
is a public toilet.

213
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,080
There's no surveillance camera there.

214
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,320
What else is there except for the public toilet?

215
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,720
Tell us now.

216
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,630
This is the place.

217
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,720
It was left from the repair of the playground.

218
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,910
No one repaired this fence,

219
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,030
so a hole was left behind.

220
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,910
Where does this lead to?

221
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,120
A small park.

222
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,910
It's not big.

223
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,510
No one goes deep into the park.

224
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,630
Are you planning to head inside?

225
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,480
Tell our men to search the park.

226
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,080
Yes, sir.

227
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,270
Do I need to bring them inside?

228
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,030
It's okay.

229
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,270
I need to talk to all the kids

230
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,670
in the footage.

231
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,750
Please follow our men

232
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,200
to contact their parents as soon as possible.

233
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,910
Okay.

234
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,440
-Captain Luo.
-Yes.

235
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,720
Where's Xu Dongyu?

236
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,720
At home.

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,550
He made a copy of the dashcam for Mr. Tao.

238
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,750
After we left,

239
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,150
he drove to a restaurant

240
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,720
for a takeaway. He didn't go anywhere
after he reached home.

241
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
Are you sure he's at home?

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,750
Yes.

243
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,720
He didn't draw his curtain.

244
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,910
He has been in the living room.

245
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,240
He was never away from our sight.

246
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,240
What's wrong, sir?

247
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,870
Nothing.

248
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,150
Keep watching him.

249
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,360
Don't make any mistakes.

250
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Captain Luo,

251
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,720
did we suspect the wrong person?

252
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,720
Wu said Xu Dongyu

253
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,150
didn't draw the curtain after he reached home.

254
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,510
It's already dawn, but he didn't draw the curtain.

255
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
So he's very certain

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
that Xu Dongyu is at home.

257
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,910
But don't you think it's weird?

258
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
The person being watched

259
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,670
is very cooperative.

260
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,200
Logically,

261
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,910
the more perfect and reasonable it is,

262
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,120
the more suspicious it is

263
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,600
in reality.

264
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
I need to go in and check things out.

265
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,440
Stay here.

266
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,630
When you got into contact with the kids,

267
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,270
call me.

268
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,870
Yes, sir.

269
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,720
It was my fault.

270
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,320
Why didn't I even think of checking it myself?

271
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,550
Mr. Zhang,

272
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,510
it's said that the child tracking system
on the mobile phone

273
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,790
can switch on and off remotely.

274
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,510
The SID

275
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,600
should have traced Chen's phone

276
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,870
using this way just now.

277
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,670
Why didn't you think

278
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,200
about switching it on remotely just now?

279
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,360
I tried.

280
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,240
But I don't know what happened

281
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,270
to the application.

282
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,150
It kept showing

283
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,750
connection failure again and again.

284
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,870
I don't really know how to use that application.

285
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,360
Do you call yourself a dad?

286
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,550
-Calm down.
-It'll be okay.

287
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,550
-Calm down.
-Don't be anxious.

288
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,870
When we found Chen's phone,

289
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,200
the battery had at least half.

290
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,480
I think the pickpocket

291
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,550
had already stolen the phone

292
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,390
when you called her at 5:30 PM.

293
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,790
Could it be she noticed her phone was missing,

294
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,910
so she went looking for it?

295
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
It's too risky to steal around Children's Palace.

296
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,030
It's not very likely.

297
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,390
She must have left Children's Palace

298
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,030
for some reason.

299
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,910
But she wouldn't go too far.

300
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,720
That way,

301
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,270
when she got a call from you,

302
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,390
she could return
to Children's Palace's entrance right away.

303
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
But it's the downtown area.

304
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,320
It was also during rush hour.

305
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,270
It shouldn't be dangerous.

306
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,750
Except for the small park
in the northwest corner.

307
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,360
She wouldn't do that.

308
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,750
Chen is very timid.

309
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,030
She wouldn't dare to sleep alone

310
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,270
after reading suspense stories.

311
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:40,960
How could she possibly

312
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,240
go to a place where no one was there?

313
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,200
That's right.

314
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,630
What if she wasn't alone

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,320
but with her friends?

316
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,510
Mr. Zhang,

317
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,390
what was the time when you tried

318
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,320
to switch on your kid's phone remotely?

319
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,550
It was 6:30 PM.

320
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,000
Her teacher reminded me.

321
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,070
Can you show me

322
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,070
how you did it?

323
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,720
Okay.

324
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,960
I used this

325
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
to connect to this.

326
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,070
But it kept prompting failed to connect.

327
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,570
[Warning]

328
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,070
Go deeper

329
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,160
and search thoroughly!

330
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes, sir!

331
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,750
Captain Luo!

332
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,550
Captain Luo.

333
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,200
What?

334
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,590
The teacher helped contact the students

335
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,920
from the surveillance footage.

336
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,240
This is their registration information.

337
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,550
Based on the kids' recollection,

338
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,200
they went to the public toilet to get changed.

339
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,110
After that, they went to the small park
to snap some photos.

340
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,270
Snap photos?

341
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,000
A student from a photography class
had one assignment to complete.

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,480
So he asked several girls to be models.

343
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,160
Several of these kids

344
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,750
even brought some clothes for the photo session.

345
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,960
It was a while

346
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,640
after they finished taking photos,

347
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,110
Zhang Yuchen said
she was going back to Children's Palace.

348
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,750
They went separate ways at the park's entrance.

349
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,640
No one knows

350
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
where Zhang Yuchen went after that.

351
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,000
Here.

352
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,000
Hello?

353
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,960
I think that the pickpocket

354
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,790
didn't steal the phone from Chen.

355
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
His excuse was reasonable.

356
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,030
I think she left her phone

357
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,790
during the photo shoot.

358
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,920
How did you know?

359
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,550
Mr. Zhang tried to turn on

360
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,920
the child's phone remotely around six o'clock

361
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,880
but failed.

362
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
He didn't make any mistakes
while operating the application.

363
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,110
So I deduce

364
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
someone took out the battery

365
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,680
from the child's phone at the time.

366
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,920
The thief picked up the phone at 6:30 PM.

367
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,110
They didn't have to put it back

368
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,880
after taking the battery out.

369
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,240
And they might not know

370
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,510
what kind of applications

371
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,680
are installed on the phone.

372
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,310
So I came up with the greatest possibility.

373
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,750
Hurry!

374
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,440
Leave our things here.

375
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,270
Let's go.

376
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,310
Time to take some photos!

377
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,350
Come here quickly.

378
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,240
Someone took advantage of Chen's time

379
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,880
while she changed her clothes
or posed for photos

380
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,880
and hid her phone.

381
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,070
[Exit]

382
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,480
(After the photo session,)

383
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,350
(she noticed her phone had gone missing.)

384
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,640
(When she noticed her phone was gone,)

385
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,200
(she wanted to head back to look for it.)

386
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,110
(At this time,)

387
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,720
(someone suggested)

388
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,830
(finding it at the small park.)

389
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,310
It's you.

390
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,920
Let's go.

391
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,830
(And they volunteered to go with her.)

392
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,270
(She must have trusted this person.)

393
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,200
(Someone her age.)

394
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,240
(A kid.)

395
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,330
Captain Luo.

396
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,660
When the teacher from Children's Palace

397
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,530
called the students,

398
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,740
was there any call

399
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,020
that wasn't answered by the parents?

400
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,940
Tell me! Stop daydreaming.

401
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,530
Okay.

402
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,900
Which one was not answered by the parents?

403
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,770
I think there was one.

404
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,810
It's her.

405
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,610
Her name is Su...

406
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,420
Su Ruowan?

407
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,870
[Emergency Contact: Su Lingnai, Mother]

408
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,770
She's Su Lingnai's daughter.

409
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,740
She just came of age.

410
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,330
Hello, is there anyone home?

411
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,050
Is there anyone home?

412
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,260
I'm a tenant who just moved upstairs.

413
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,850
Sorry,

414
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,570
but my place was leaking.

415
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,660
Did it leak into your place?

416
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,290
Move aside!

417
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,420
Sir!

418
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,740
This is Qu Tong's dress.

419
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,700
She just left.

420
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,130
She didn't have time to close the music box.

421
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,290
Where could she be now?

422
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,660
He doesn't care about me anymore!

423
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,130
When Chen noticed her phone had gone missing,

424
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,260
the first thing she'd do was find a phone

425
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,420
to text her dad.

426
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,090
It was very likely that Su Ruowan used

427
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,900
the excuse of going to her home to make a call home

428
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,050
to lure Chen to leave with her.

429
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,850
Without any transport,

430
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,260
Chen wouldn't want to go too far.

431
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,570
The place Su Ruowan chose

432
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,850
[XWI Children's Palace]
wouldn't be far from Children's Palace.

433
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,090
One kilometer.

434
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,050
No,

435
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,740
five hundred meters.

436
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,460
What was Su Lingnai's registered address

437
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,770
20 years ago?

438
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,050
Wait.

439
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,020
What is it, Wu?

440
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,090
Captain Luo,

441
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,220
we installed a bug

442
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,130
in Xu Dongyu's room.

443
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,020
There were two incoming calls.

444
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,940
He heard them.

445
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,700
But he didn't answer.

446
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,370
Is it possible that he knew he was being watched?

447
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,180
Captain Luo, over here.

448
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,900
We've traced the number that called.

449
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,290
[No. 56, Luojie Road, Xindong District]
The landline address is at...

450
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,420
No. 56, Luojie Road.

451
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,290
Sir, how did you know?

452
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,090
Bring Pei Su with you.

453
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,570
We're taking Su Ruowan in. He would come in handy.

454
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,180
Move!

455
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,380
He doesn't care about me anymore!

456
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,940
He doesn't care about me anymore.

457
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,330
Open the door!

458
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,460
Why are you making so much noise
in the middle of the night?

459
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,570
I'm trying to sleep here!

460
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,700
What's going on inside?

461
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Open the door! Open up!

462
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,770
If you don't, I'll call the police.

463
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,180
Why are you watching a horror movie

464
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,370
and screaming in the middle of the night?

465
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,500
Do you think you and your family
are the only ones living here?

466
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,700
I'm sorry, mister.

467
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,610
My parents aren't home.

468
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,050
I can't open the door for any stranger.

469
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,090
I'll keep quiet.

470
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,290
What?

471
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,740
A kid?

472
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,050
Come out!

473
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,770
I'll help your parents to teach you a lesson.

474
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,090
Come out now!

475
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Mister,

476
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,370
Can't I just apologize?

478
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,810
What did you say? I can't hear you.

479
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,850
You were loud

480
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,090
when screaming just now.

481
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,420
Open this door!

482
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,900
Quickly!

483
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,660
Freeze!

484
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,460
Su Ruowan.

485
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,090
It's okay.

486
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,810
Where's the criminal you want to catch?

487
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,220
Why is there another kid here?

488
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,570
Where's the kidnapper who was with you?

489
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,810
Unbelievable.

490
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,020
He forced a kid to be his decoy

491
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,500
while he was hiding out.

492
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,850
It's the first time

493
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,900
I've encountered such a sneaky criminal.

494
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,810
Am I right, Captain Luo?

495
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,850
Have you caught the bad guy?

496
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,770
Yes.

497
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,020
Little girl,

498
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,900
it's okay.

499
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,420
I've already subdued the bad guy.

500
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,460
This place is surrounded by SID.

501
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,530
He won't be able to escape.

502
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,530
We'll protect you.

503
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,020
You're even holding such a big knife.

504
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,900
Isn't it heavy?

505
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,330
It's okay.

506
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,050
We're here to help you.

507
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,980
Did anyone kidnap you

508
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,370
or coerce you?

509
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,090
Give the knife to me.

510
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,660
After that, show us who the bad guy is.

511
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,290
Is that okay?

512
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,050
Was it Xu Dongyu?

513
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,260
He used you

514
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,940
to kidnap Qu Tong.

515
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,610
Did he do anything

516
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,900
to hurt you?

517
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,980
Don't be afraid.

518
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,050
It's all over.

519
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,530
I know

520
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,420
you're a good girl.

521
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,330
It was the bad guy

522
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,130
who coerced you to do this.

523
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,290
You will be fine.

524
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,660
It's okay. It's all over now.

525
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,500
-Chen!
-Chen!

526
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,330
Are you hurt?

527
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,570
-Are you okay?
-Chen, are you hurt?

528
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,050
-What happened to your hands?
-Are you okay, baby?

529
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,940
Are you injured?

530
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,090
Does your arm hurt?

531
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,180
What happened to your hand?

532
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,090
Don't be scared.

533
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,290
There, there. I'm here.

534
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,500
I'm here.

535
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,660
Don't be scared.

536
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,290
Doctor!

537
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:25,850
Her arm.

538
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,500
-Please check on her.
-How did this happen?

539
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,700
-You're okay now.
-What is going on?

540
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,290
Let's go.

541
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:29,940
Captain Luo,

542
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,740
can we arrest Xu Dongyu now?

543
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,330
Yes.

544
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:32,980
Inform Wu.

545
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,570
Yes, sir.

546
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,530
How's Chen?

547
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,180
Except for being scared

548
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,980
and having some bruises,

549
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,090
she's okay.

550
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,130
She went missing for nine hours.

551
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,130
It's a miracle

552
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,570
that she came back intact.

553
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,900
What a long night.

554
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,180
Tao Ze.

555
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,050
What a "loyal" friend.

556
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,380
I was afraid you'd feel embarrassed

557
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,250
for putting up your hand for long.

558
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,020
So I did you a favor.

559
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,130
How childish,

560
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,570
Captain Luo.

561
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,460

I'll buy you a feast next time.

What about social insurance?

593

We don't need social insurance and salaries

594
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,170
because we usually receive stock dividends.

595
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,980
