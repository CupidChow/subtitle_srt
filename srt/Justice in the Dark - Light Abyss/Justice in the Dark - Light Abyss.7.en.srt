00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,390
I don't like keeping pets.

191
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,120
It's too troublesome.

192
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,030
Besides,

193
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,630
you guys made a summary.

194
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,390
The three signs of an Apath.

195
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,600
Wetting the bed, setting fires,
abusing little animals.

196
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,790
I worried that I wouldn't be able
to control myself.

197
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,030
Captain Luo.

198
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,150
Is the explanation

199
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,390
reasonable?

200
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,600
Captain Luo!

201
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,080
Over here!

202
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,550
Sir, take a look over there.

203
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,000
Here.

204
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,200
We showed it to the parents.

205
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,030
They confirmed the shoelace

206
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,600
came from Qu Tong's sandals.

207
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,790
(Qu Tong ran all the way here
after escaping from the bus.)

208
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
(She tripped on a tree branch and fell.)

209
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,790
(The branch cut her ankle.)

210
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,600
(A person stood in front of her.)

211
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,550
(An adult.)

212
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,750
(She left with them.)

213
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,120
Looking at the scene,

214
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,750
someone must have passed through here

215
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,120
and saved Qu Tong.

216
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,390
Sir, that's good news, right?

217
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,960
After all, it was raining.

218
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
And we're on the mountain.

219
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,550
Loose soil can be a safety hazard.

220
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,960
Someone passed by

221
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,150
and saved the girl.

222
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,960
At least tonight,

223
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,600
she wouldn't be out in the wilderness.

224
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
Did she go willingly, or was she forced?

225
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
We don't know that yet.

226
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,720
Are you saying...

227
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,240
Don't assume.

228
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,960
Get the forensic team to come take a look.

229
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,120
See if they're able to discern from the traces

230
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,750
whether the girl left willingly or not.

231
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
Look out for any reports nearby

232
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,390
regarding a found child.

233
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,080
Also,

234
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,390
get in touch

235
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,440
with the heritage park the kids visited today.

236
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,870
Check the visitor list for today.

237
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,910
And get access to the surveillance cameras
around the area.

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,790
Check and see

239
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,030
what other vehicles passed through.

240
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
Keep a lookout

241
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
for a solo male driver.

242
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,550
Increase search efforts.

243
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
Remember, time is of the essence.

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Yes, sir.

245
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,870
Captain Luo.

246
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,840
When the girl went missing,

247
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,840
was she also wearing a floral dress?

248
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,120
(Recently,)

249
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,670
(a teenage girl went missing
in the mountains of Xiling.)

250
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
(The missing girl, surnamed Qu,)

251
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,720
(is a Year 10 student at Kangxin High School.)

252
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,270
(After SID took over the case,)

253
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,910
(an emergency plan was immediately initiated.)

254
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,550
(With Xiling as the center,
a joint task force was formed)

255
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,840
(with the Patrol Detachments
of the nearby three districts.)

256
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,630
(A missive has been issued to go down the streets)

257
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,030
(and investigate even the smallest unit,)

258
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,480
(a joint online and offline operation.)

259
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,360
(Presently, Qu has been missing)

260
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,030
(for over 24 hours.)

261
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,270
(As we all know,)

262
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,120
(the first 24 hours)

263
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,510
(are crucial in finding a missing person.)

264
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
(Every minute saved)

265
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,510
(means a higher chance of survival for the child.)

266
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,850
[16-year-old girl missing in Xiling. A 200-strong
search party, 25 hours later, still no news]

267
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,170
[Missing person]
[16-year-old girl missing in Xiling]

268
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,550
I don't know who left it there.

269
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
Nor when it was left there.

270
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,550
I found it in our milk crate.

271
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,270
Our child has gone missing.

272
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,150
[Qu Tong's father]
This was the least of our concerns.

273
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,150
Today, when the milkman knocked at our door,

274
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,720
I opened the crate,

275
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,720
and this fell out.

276
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,320
What's in it?

277
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,630
It...

278
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,080
It's an audio recording.

279
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,270
We don't have much to go on right now.

280
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,750
I don't want to think too much,

281
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,360
but after listening to Yang droning on

282
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,630
about Lotus Hill's Case,

283
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,120
it's practically etched in my mind.

284
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,320
That's why I'm here to confirm it with you.

285
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,750
The missing girl, Qu Tong,

286
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,150
has a lot of similarities

287
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,510
to the victim of Lotus Hill's Case.

288
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,600
They were both wearing floral dresses
when they went missing.

289
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,910
There were no calls asking for ransom.

290
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,000
Rather, we got suspicious audio recordings.

291
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,360
You mean this recording?

292
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,240
Qu Tong's parents submitted it.

294
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,790
A case that happened 16 years ago.

295
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,150
We only ever heard about it.

296
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,600
But you experienced it personally.

297
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,960
After you heard this recording,

298
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,790
do you think

299
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,550
it sounds like

300
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,480
the call the kidnapper
made to the families back then?

301
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,510
Lotus Hill's Case

302
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,550
was a high-profile one.

303
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
Even now, you can easily find

304
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,630
a multitude of newspaper reports on the case.

305
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,550
However,

306
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,550
there was one detail

307
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,310
we never revealed to the outside.

308
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,350
I remember the first missing girl,

309
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,160
the one where your mentor received the call.

310
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,750
During the investigation,

311
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,510
the victim's parent

312
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,720
mentioned one thing.

313
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,310
During the call,

314
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,880
I heard the sound of jingle bells
from my daughter's pencil case.

315
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,440
It must have been the kidnapper.

316
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,510
Could you have heard it wrong?

317
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,880
No way!

318
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,830
Don't get so worked up. Tell me slowly.

319
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,790
Ling...

320
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,200
She collected colorful jingle bells

321
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,350
(and placed them in the pencil case.)

322
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,790
(When she was bored,)

323
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,030
(she'd shake the pencil case like a shaker.)

324
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,440
She is my daughter.

325
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,880
I wouldn't have heard wrong.

326
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,310
(The parent firmly believed)

327
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,640
that it was his daughter in the recording.

328
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,510
Of course.

329
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,200
That was just a small detail.

330
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,880
We didn't keep any audio records.

331
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,240
There's only the testimony from the parent.

332
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,000
No wonder.

333
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,590
My mentor didn't mention it in his notes either.

334
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,270
There was no reason for SID

335
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,340
to reveal a dubious detail like that
to the public.

336
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,130
Could it be the wrong person was killed

337
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,330
in the old case?

338
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,370
The culprit

339
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,900
is back at it again

340
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,180
after over a decade.

341
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,660
A serial killer

342
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,330
wouldn't just halt his desire to kill

343
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,130
without any reason.

344
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,420
If they had indeed gotten the wrong person,

345
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,740
the culprit could've killed
thousands of people during this time.

346
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,850
So I'm pretty sure

347
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,900
he is an Apath.

348
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,090
Chief Du.

349
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,260
What was the ultimate factor

350
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,570
determining Wu Guangchang

351
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,740
as the suspect in the serial kidnappings?

352
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,290
Was it because he had

353
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,220
a few pieces of bloodied children's clothing?

354
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,940
No.

355
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,980
Apart from the shredded pieces of clothing,

356
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,610
the main reason

357
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,050
Wu Guangchang was ascertained
as the main suspect

358
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,700
was that there was a seventh girl.

359
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,460
We found

360
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,500
signs of abuse on her body.

361
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,130
When she woke up,

362
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,850
she quickly identified Wu Guangchang.

363
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,940
The girl was called... What was it...

364
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,900
Su... Su something.

365
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,770
Su Lingnai?

366
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,850
Yes, that's her name.

367
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,700
It's been too long.

368
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,260
I've forgotten many things.

369
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,130
Go and retrieve the case file.

370
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,900
I'll go to the archive right away.

371
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,090
Mr. Du.

372
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,050
Here's what I think.

373
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,220
Currently, the investigation on Qu Tong

374
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,570
has come to a bottleneck.

375
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,940
Whether you follow the trail
of the audio recording,

376
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,500
search the school buses, or track the vehicles,

377
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,130
it's basically like finding a needle

378
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,130
in a haystack.

379
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,980
My idea

380
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,500
is we switch up our train of thought.

381
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,900
Start with the case from 16 years ago.

382
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,090
A merged investigation.

383
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,500
Do you mean

384
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,290
we should reopen the case?

385
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,090
But that case was concluded long ago.

386
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,660
Although the suspect is dead,

387
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
the missing girls were never found.

388
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,090
We can't conclude the case is closed

389
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,370
just based on one survivor's testimony.

390
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,810
Whereas the current case,

391
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,130
it not only has

392
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,850
highly similar characteristics to the suspect,

393
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,530
but the detail of the jingle bells

394
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,290
in the pencil case also happened.

395
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,050
If it weren't someone involved in the case

396
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,370
or a participant in it,

397
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,020
they wouldn't have known such details.

398
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,810
Based on what we have so far,

399
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,850
the missing person case in the Xiling mountains

400
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,180
is definitely not a coincidence.

401
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,050
The person who kidnapped Qu Tong

402
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,370
could very well be

403
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,700
an Apath that we failed to capture back then.

404
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,460
Weizhao.

405
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,700
The expectation the whole of Xinzhou

406
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,460
has on SID,

407
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,130
you know it, right?

408
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,660
Once the old case is reopened,

409
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,500
whether it turns out right or wrong,

410
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,420
SID's reputation

411
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,740
will be on the line.

412
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,050
If it fails...

413
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,180
We will not fail.

414
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,370
Fine.

415
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,330
I will brief the Ministry of Supervision.

416
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,810
Weizhao.

417
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,130
It's your world in the future.

418
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,660
We are old.

419
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,570
Some have left, and some have passed on.

420
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm the only one left to lead you bunch of monkeys.

421
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,570
It won't be long before I retire.

422
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,900
Isn't that a good thing?

423
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I can only dream of the day when I retire.

424
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,530
Being able to wake up when you feel like it.

425
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,220
I can go on a trip around the world with my spouse.

426
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,220
When taking the subway,

427
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,940
youngsters have to give up their seats for me.

428
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,090
Dream on.

429
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,940
You don't even have a love interest.

430
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,810
Get lost if you're not going to talk seriously.

431
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,570
Yes, sir.

432
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,020
I'll get lost.

433
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,090
Little monkey.

434
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,250
[The ID "Janitor" you follow has a new update]

(She can wilt.)

441

(Anything is fine.)

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,370
(But so long as I catch a glimpse of her,)

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,050

00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,420
So... Sorry.

449
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,810
What's the matter?

450
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,700
There... There was a weird man.

451
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,500
Where? I don't see anybody.

452
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,290
Thank you.

453
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,530
It's fine.

454
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,660
Mister.

455
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,090
Do you sell drinks?

456
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,700
Take it yourself.

457
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,810
The rain is a little heavy.

458
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,130
Don't mind me taking cover here.

459
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,900
Sit down.

460
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
The rain's not going to stop any time soon.

461
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,940
What do you do?

462
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,980

463
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,370
[Guo Shinan]

464
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,460
Mr. Guo.

465
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,290
I'd like to talk to you

466
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,740
about Guo Feiling's case from 16 years ago.

467
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,090
She's been dead for 16 years.

468
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,500
I sent the perpetrator to the underworld

469
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,850
with my own hands.

470
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,330
I was sentenced. I served my time.

471
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,020
What is there to talk about?

472
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,020
Mr. Guo.

473
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,530
I didn't come

474
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,810
to pick on old wounds for no reason.

475
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,810
We're currently working on a case.

476
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,220
It's also a missing teenage girl.

477
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,260
It's the one you just read on the paper.

478
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,020
You saw it wrong. I didn't read it.

479
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,090
Mr. Guo.

480
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,740
There's evidence to show that this case

481
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,850
is possibly related to what happened back then.

482
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,570
Related, how?

483
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,980
The girls were both wearing floral dresses.

484
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,530
Children go missing all the time.

485
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,660
What has it got to do with me?

486
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,090
Three days after,

487
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,130
the culprit sent an audio recording

488
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,290
to the child's parents.

489
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,810
Aside from the girl's cries,

490
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,770
we also hear a noise.

491
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,180
Something like a tin case with bells inside.

492
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,500
Mr. Guo, this is

493
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,770
exactly like what happened to Ling.

494
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,900
That can't be true.

495
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,810
I had killed him.

496
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,290
This girl

497
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,420
is Qu Tong.

498
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,220
She's a sensible child.

499
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,090
Today is the fifth day since she went missing.

500
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,290
Mr. Guo.

501
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,050
The six girls from Lotus Hill's Case are dead.

502
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,020
But this girl

503
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,130
could still be alive.

504
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,290
Please help us find her.

505
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,220
Let Ling

506
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,900
and the other girls
whose bodies weren't even found

507
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,700
rest in peace.

508
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,530
I just have a few questions.

509
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,850
I'll leave right after.

510
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,020
I won't bother you any longer.

511
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,090
Mr. Guo.

512
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,770
The detail about the bells

513
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,900
placed inside a pencil case.

514
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,610
Did you tell anyone about it?

515
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,130
Yes.

516
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,130
Can you give me a name list?

517
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,370
Ling's homeroom teacher.

518
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,420
A relative who was working
at the telecommunications bureau.

519
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,530
The one that called.

520
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,740
The cleaners who worked

521
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,220
near the garbage dump.

522
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,180
They heard bits and pieces.

523
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,420
It was a blur.

524
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,370
Some stuff,

525
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,980
I repeated to many people many times.

526
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I don't quite recall now.

527
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,610
There was also the officer in charge.

528
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,370
Officer Yang.

529
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Yang Zhengfeng.

530
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,420
He knows

531
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,740
the ins and outs the best.

532
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,770
You can ask him.

533
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,130
He was my mentor.

534
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
He died in the line of duty.

535
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,460
Let's keep to the timeline.

536
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,940
When did you start investigating?

537
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,370
How did you end up with Wu Guangchang?

538
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,610
At the time,

539
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,850
SID was making no progress.

540
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,090
I was anxious.

541
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,460
I couldn't wait,
so I started investigating myself.

542
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,980
(The garbage disposal site
the culprit mentioned in the call)

543
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,370
[Garbage Disposal Station]
was the only clue I had.

544
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,050
(So I wondered)

545
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,850
(if the person who kidnapped my daughter)

546
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,660
(was perhaps someone who came out of town.)

547
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,220
(Because there's a road
connecting Lotus Island to the city.)

548
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,260
(To avoid the hill,)

549
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,090
(it has to pass by the garbage disposal station.)

550
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,700
Who is it?

551
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,220
Who are you looking for?

552
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,900
Have you seen my daughter?

553
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,130
No.

554
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,050
(I didn't have time to be sad.)

555
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,180
(I knew,)

556
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,290
(the sooner I found clues,)

557
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,290
(the safer Ling would be.)

558
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,900
You mean,

559
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,500
Guo Feiling's kidnapper

560
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,610
took her and left Lotus Hill.

561
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,050
But for some reason,

562
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,260
he stopped his car
before going onto the expressway.

563
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,130
He then took the girl to the nearby garbage dump

564
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,220
and made the call.

565
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,610
Why would he do that?

566
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,460
It doesn't make sense.

567
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,530
He kidnapped a teenager.

568
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,460
Not a small, lightweight toddler.

569
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,180
He ditched his car on the expressway

570
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,940
and brought a grown child

571
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,660
to an unfamiliar place

572
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,770
and assaulted her.

573
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,260
That was much too risky.

574
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,260
Your mentor said the same thing.

575
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,260
The case later

576
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,020
turned into a cross-district serial crime.

577
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,500
They were investigating multiple cases at once.

578
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
I couldn't wait.

579
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,940
I couldn't even wait one more day.

580
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,610
So I followed the clue

581
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
of it possibly being an outsider.

582
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,570
I checked all the hotels and inns

583
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,610
near Ling's school.

584
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
At last,

585
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,460
I found Wu Guangchang.

586
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,420
Yes, Wu Guangchang wasn't a Xinzhou local.

587
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,130
But I heard

588
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,180
he was an inpatient at the nearby hospital.

589
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,940
Why did you think it was him?

590
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,420
A nurse saw

591
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,810
a girl going to see him.

592
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,980
Do you understand?

593
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,770
If you had a teenage daughter

594
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,770
and she suddenly disappeared,

595
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,420
you'd become sensitive

596
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,050
to whatever you saw.

597
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,900
So I followed him.

598
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,770
I didn't see any girl.

599
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,330
But I saw a boy dressed in a school uniform.

600
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,260
The boy was secretly following him.

601
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,610
He claimed a girl from his class

602
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,500
had been skipping class.

603
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,810
He was the class monitor.

604
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,810
The homeroom teacher had told him
to find out what had happened.

605
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,980
The girl who played truant didn't go home.

606
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,940
After school, he said he saw the Wu dude there

607
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,610
to pick someone up.

608
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,850
But when he went to question him,

609
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,330
Wu denied it.

610
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,330
What happened next?

611
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,090
One day,

612
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,570
the boy suddenly called me.

613
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,570
When I rushed there,

614
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,180
I found Wu Guangchang

615
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,090
with a girl.

616
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,500
The girl was fighting him off.

617
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,020
But he forcefully pulled her away.

618
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,130
You mean Su Lingnai?

619
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,940
I told the boy who tipped me off to leave first.

620
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,530
I followed Wu Guangchang back to his house.

621
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,900
(I saw the bastard)

622
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,610
pulling the girl back with him.

623
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,610
I...

624
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,300
Who is it?

625
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,570
Here for the electricity payment.

626
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,300
Come another day.

627
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,530
What are you doing?

628
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,650
What are you doing?

629
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,090
Get out!

630
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,530
Get out!

631
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,530
What are you doing?

632
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,460
Mr. Guo.

633
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,500
In your opinion,

634
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,610
did Wu Guangchang

635
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,690
seem like an Apath?

636
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,530
I don't think so.

637
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,530
One last question.

638
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,130
Do you still remember the name of the boy?

639
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,730
The surname is Xu.

640
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,210
I think it was...

641
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,210
Xu Dongyu.

642
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,420
Captain Luo, that's weight-loss tea I just made.

643
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,170
I didn't find

644
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,500
anything special in Xu Dongyu's data.

645
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,050
Second-generation migrant. Came from Yashima.

646
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,730
His family is wealthy.

647
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,170
He currently works as a freelance photographer.

648
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,970
[Xu Dongyu]

649
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,380
What about Su Lingnai?

650
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,530
[Photographer's Certificate]
She's gone.

651
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,070
[Xu Dongyu]

652
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,170
Gone?

653
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,980
She left Xinzhou and went back to her hometown?

654
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,090
Yes.

655
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,900
But not back to Yashima.

656
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,610
It's the home up there.

657
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,610
She's dead.

658
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,380
How old was she when she died?

659
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,610
After the incident, she became a wreck.

660
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,980
Her dance career got nowhere.

661
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
And her results were bad.

662
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,460
She somehow managed to get a certificate

663
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,610
from a community college.

664
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,690
With her being young and pretty,
she hung around rich people.

665
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,340
Her life was pretty much a mess,

666
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
and she got herself sick.

667
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,340
[Medical Death Certificate]
She died two months ago.

668
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,300
[Su Lingnai]

669
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,570
This is how it ended for the last survivor.

670
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,340
Everything is in one thin file.

671
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,340
Looks like everything

672
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,530
points back to Xu Dongyu.

673
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,570
Relax.

674
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,050
We mean no harm.

675
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,650
We'd just like you to help us

676
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,820
remember some things.

677
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,340
Okay.

678
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,730
[Xu Dongyu]

679
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,820
Did you go to Pingzhao High School?

680
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,300
Yes.

681
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,530
Do you remember a student

682
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
named Su Lingnai?

683
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,380
Yes.

684
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,860
Can you tell us about her?

685
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,730
She...

686
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,340
We haven't kept in touch for many years.

687
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,050
She

688
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,500
was a very cheerful girl.

689
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,050
She liked to wear all sorts

690
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,730
of floral dresses.

691
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,340
You summoned me here

692
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,860
because of the case about the girl
aired on the radio, right?

693
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,650
I heard about it on the way.

694
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,530
Then, I'll just get straight to the point.

695
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,690
Regarding the old case
of Wu Guangchang's kidnapping and murder,

696
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,820
how much do you know?

697
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,860
Well...

698
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,940
Not a lot.

699
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,170
Because I was only a kid back then.

700
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,780
The adults

701
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,940
wouldn't let a kid know so much about such a thing.

702
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
But a victim's father from back then

703
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,820
said he once met you.

704
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,820
Su Lingnai was saved in time

705
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,940
because you

706
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,210
had tipped off the authorities.

707
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,300
That

708
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,860
happened more than ten years ago. I...

709
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,300
I really don't remember.

710
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,900
When the serial kidnappings
and murders happened,

711
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,610
one of the victims' fathers

712
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,570
went to Pingzhao High School to investigate.

713
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,860
He chanced upon you

714
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,570
who were secretly tailing Wu Guangchang.

715
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,980
So he approached you.

716
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,170
You two suspected
that Wu Guangchang was up to no good.

717
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,860
So you tailed him together.

718
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:30,820
Remember?

719
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,500
I think...

720
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,340
Yes, that probably happened.

721
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,300
I really don't remember the details.

722
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,690
This guy seems to be tripping over his own words.

723
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,780
Why is he so obtuse?

724
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,860
Sir, do you think he's suspicious?

725
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,530
Just because he mentioned the floral dress?

726
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,530
That's not enough.

727
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,050
Pingzhao High School is a private school.

728
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,780
The students wear school uniforms.

729
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,650
They have strict rules.

730
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,860
Probably only a handful of special students

731
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,340
get exempted from following them

732
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,690
due to personal image requirements.

733
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,780
He remembers Su Lingnai

734
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,860
because she was the only special one in the class.

735
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,940
That's normal.

736
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:14,860
But...

737
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,340
But

738
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,570
I find it strange.

739
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,210
Back then, Wu Guangchang's case
was the talk of the town.

740
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,460
How come you,

741
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,820
who were personally involved,

742
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,650
couldn't remember?

743
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,090
It's like this.

744
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,020
I...

745
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,500
I fell really sick

746
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,460
in high school one time.

747
