123
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,340
he would have come across Zhang Ying and the rest.

124
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
You mean it's likely that the person

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,420

should I inform Chief Du

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,890
Does that not count as evidence?

172
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,220

173

Xiaxi is already in this state.

191
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,530
How can you prove yourselves

192
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,690
as Xinzhou's last hope?

193
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,100
Chen Zhen.

194
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,460
If the SID agreed with their case findings

195
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,170
as Xiaxi did,

196
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,890
we'd have every right

197
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,500
to summon you to the station for questioning.

198
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,860
I wouldn't be having a conversation

199
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,220
with you in secret

200
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,770
in a place like this.

201
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,340
Chen Zhen.

202
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,620
I don't care whether or not you trust us.

203
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,260
If you want to find out
what really happened to your sister,

204
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,090
the SID is your only hope.

205
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,050
My sister left this.

206
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,900
It's the only thing I have now.

207
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,260
She had no time to tell me anything.

208
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,700
During that time,

209
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,940
she had trouble sleeping.

210
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,900
It's as if she was constantly afraid of something.

211
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,570
I asked her about it.

212
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,570
But she told me to mind my own business.

213
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,180
At the time,

214
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,050
I think she made a call to someone.

215
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,530
Who?

216
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,740
Have you heard anything

217
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,900
about the vacant land at Golden Triangle?

218
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,850
If I knew anything,

219
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,260
I wouldn't be asking you.

220
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,290
This has my number.

221
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,500
[Luo Weizhao]

222
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,810
One last reminder.

223
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,810
Regarding this case,

224
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,940
the SID is already secretly on it.

225
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,770
Whether you believe it or not,

226
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,050
some things can only be carried out by us.

227
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,330
It's no use even if you find proof.

228
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,980
Understand?

229
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,420
Call me if you remember anything.

230
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,200
[15th September. Joined Tea Ceremony Club
with Cui Ying. Glad to have you.]

231
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,090
Hello?

232
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,220
I need you to look into a person.

233
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,050
The name is Cui Ying.

234
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,130
Mr. Tao.

235
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,330
That Zhang Donglan is a retard.

236
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,260
I asked him to write down

237
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,530
everyone he saw that night.

238
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,130
Check the list he gave me.

239
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,290
I'd dare say the list contains
all of the influential, rich heirs

240
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,220
in Xinzhou.

241
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,810
Guess we'll have to narrow down

242
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,940
which ones fit the narcissistic personality.

243
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,300
Call them in.

244
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,610
We'll talk to them one by one.

245
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,570
What about Zhang Donglan then?

246
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,060
His detainment limit will be up soon.

247
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,020
What else can we do?

248
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,260
We don't have enough evidence.

249
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,700
The protocol is to release him.

250
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,660
That's it?

251
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,460
Yes.

252
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,060
Don't just stand there. Get to it.

253
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,180
It's been quite a while.

254
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,620
-How come he's not out yet?
-Not out yet?

255
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,300
Should be soon.

256
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,540
He has to come out soon.

257
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,500
-He should be out.
-Wait a bit more.

258
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,940
I'm just a little anxious.

259
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,540
He's the last person I'd be worried about.

260
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,580
Captain Luo.

261
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,860
I just can't wrap my head around it.

262
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,100
Why on earth are you hanging around people

263
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,940
like Zhang Donglan?

264
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,620
Because I find his life philosophy interesting.

265
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
I'm back!

266
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,380
Donglan, you poor thing.

267
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,860
Donglan.

268
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,140
-I, Zhang Donglan, am back.
-Are you okay?

269
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,820
You've suffered.

270
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,700
All good.

271
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,780
All of you are Donglan's closest friends.

272
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,300
Next time, just holler.

273
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,500
I, Donglan, will be there for you guys.

274
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
I'll take the bullet

275
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,060
like a meat shield.

276
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,980
-Come on.
-Here.

277
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,980
Come on.

278
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,300
Mr. Pei.

279
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,260
Gosh, I've missed you so much.

280
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,940
Why did you only come for me now?

281
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,420
I almost lost it.

282
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,380
Which one of you

283
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,540
hurt my son?

284
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,740
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am?

285
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,780
-Who was it?
-It's not us, ma'am.

286
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,460
-Ma'am.
-Who hurt my son?

287
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,860
-Who hurt my son?
-Ma'am!

288
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,780
-Ma'am!
-Calm down.

289
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,020
-Who hurt my son?
-What's wrong with you?

290
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,940
-Let go.
-What are you doing?

291
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,260
-Let go. What are you doing?
-Who?

292
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,940
Ma'am.

293
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,260
All of you, dismiss.

294
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,780
-Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

295
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,820
-You can't leave!
-Ma'am...

296
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,820
-You cannot leave!
-Hey!

297
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,220
It wasn't us, ma'am.

298
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,940
Stop pulling me. It wasn't me!

299
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
What is wrong with you? Let go!

300
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,620
Ma'am.

301
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,220
Not so hard. She's...

302
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,780
I don't think she means any harm.

303
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,580
It's okay.

304
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,900
Ma'am.

305
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,020
You guys can't leave.

306
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,740
I want an answer.

307
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,580
Zongyi, I'm so sorry.

308
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,100
You guys have to give me an answer.

309
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,620
My Zongyi was so young.

310
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,780
What do I do?

311
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,260
Ma'am.

312
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,180
Let me help you up.

313
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,380
Won't you stand up?

314
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,340
Come on, stand up.

315
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,060
Ma'am.

316
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,740
Come on.

317
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,100
You guys go.

318
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,300
Don't mind me.

319
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,220
-No, you can't leave.
-Let's go.

320
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,940
-You can't leave.
-Let's wait a bit.

321
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,340
You can't leave...

322
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,300
You can't leave...

323
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,540
Can I stay with her for a bit?

324
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,540
Ma'am.

325
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,580
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?

326
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,340
Let's go inside.

327
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,980
Ma'am, let's go inside.

328
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,100
Captain Luo.

329
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,700
Thank you on behalf of my brother.

330
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,660
No need to thank me.

331
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,100
We're just acting according to the rules.

332
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,460
You're too humble, Captain Luo.

333
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,610
If you hadn't helped clear Donglan's name,

334
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,700
he wouldn't have been able to leave SID today.

335
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,130
Who said his name was cleared?

336
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,460
We didn't have enough evidence.

337
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,180
So he was released after the time limit.

338
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,460
Is he your boyfriend?

339
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,660
Yes.

340
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,810
I'm an attorney.

341
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,570
We're likely to cross paths in the future.

342
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,810
This is my business card.

343
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,290
[Zhou Hongchuan]

344
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,660
A criminal defense lawyer?

345
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,940
I'm in SID.

346
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,130
It's better

347
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,770
we don't see each other.

348
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,420
Looks like you're quite close with Zhang Donglan.

349
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,460
On the day of the incident,

350
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,090
were you also present at Chengguang Club?

351
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,770
Donglan and I go way back.

352
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,370
So I'm usually invited to his gatherings.

353
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,290
Here, take mine.

354
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,370
Thanks.

355
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,500
Captain Luo.

356
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,980
Let me change another one for you.

357
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,290
Is there a difference?

358
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,610
Nothing wrong.

359
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,370
It's just an old family tradition.

360
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,180
When you open a packet of cigarettes,

361
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,570
take one out and put it back the other way around.

362
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,610
Make a wish.

363
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,530
Keep the cigarette for yourself
and smoke it last.

364
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,610
Then your wish would come true.

365
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,090
That's news to me.

366
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,810
Learned something today.

367
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,610
Ying.

368
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,610
Let's go. I'm tired.

369
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:36,980
Captain Luo.

370
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,050
See you.

371
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,740
See you again, Captain Luo.

372
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,420
Make sure you verify the alibis

373
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,740
for every person that night.

374
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,330
Will do.

375
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,500
Why are you still here?

376
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,810
I offered to take her to a guesthouse.

377
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,050
She refused.

378
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,330
She said she'll keep watch

379
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,460
until you guys catch the culprit.

380
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,740
She can't sleep here, though.

381
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,940
Ma'am.

382
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,370
Ma'am?

383
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:36,940
Ma'am.

384
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,090
Officer.

385
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:40,900
My son...

386
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,610
Did you catch the culprit?

387
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,020
Not yet.

388
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,130
But we're still investigating.

389
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,330
Ma'am.

390
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,850
Let me take you to the guesthouse to rest.

391
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,980
It's right next door.

392
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,180
I'll bring you here again tomorrow.

393
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,370
Okay?

394
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,700
Hold on.

395
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,330
Ma'am.

396
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Did He Zongyi mention a guy

397
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,260
named Feng Nianguo to you?

398
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,420
Feng...

399
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,330
No.

400
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,180
-Then...
-Weizhao.

401
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,570
You said there isn't enough evidence.

402
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,770
But you did it on purpose, right?

403
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,260
You told the public Zhang Donglan was released

404
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,530
due to insufficient evidence.

405
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,900
But the real reason

406
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,280
is that you've checked
the surveillance footage from Chengguang Club.

407
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,180
He most likely has an alibi, right?

408
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,050
Who told you that?

409
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,740
I don't need anyone to tell me.

410
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,900
I just need to use my brain.

411
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,770
Mr. Pei.

412
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,370
Are you too bored or what?

413
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,660
Doesn't your empire

414
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,220
require your personal supervision?

415
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,610
If you're so free, pay more taxes.

416
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,810
Don't be such a meddler.

417
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,530
Are you two done?

418
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,980
What is up with you two?

419
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,050
What brought this on this time?

420
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,020
How is the old lady?

421
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,810
She seems emotionally stable.

422
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,570
But she still doesn't think

423
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,900
we're serious about the case.

424
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,850
By the way,

425
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,700
I asked her.

426
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,660
She'd never heard He Zongyi talk

427
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,370
about anyone special he had met in Xinzhou.

428
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,090
She doesn't know about the 100,000 yuan either.

429
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,260
Who could it be?

430
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,980
Being so mysterious.

431
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,260
No idea.

432
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,850
We only have Zhang Donglan's list to start with.

433
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,500
I...

434
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,850
What is it?

435
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,130
Nothing.

436
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,020
Never mind.

437
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,610
Just say it.

438
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,300
I'd like to take some time off.

439
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,740
I won't be having dinner with the team.

440
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,580
Take time off?

441
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,460
For what?

442
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,660
I...

443
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,100
I...

444
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,460
I have a blind date.

445
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,620
-Blind date?
-Blind date?

446
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,140
Ze.

447
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,700
You're going on a blind date?

448
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm not getting younger.

449
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,620
My family set it up for me.

450
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,540
I...

451
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,340
-Pei Su.
-It's okay, Ze.

452
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,900
You don't have to explain.

453
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,420
You've done enough for me over the years.

454
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,620
It's time for you to move on.

455
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,820
But before she becomes my sister-in-law,

456
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,060
I should at least meet her first.

457
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,660
It's just a blind date.

458
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,180
And you're wearing that?

459
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,220
Why would what he wears matter?

460
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,020
What matters is, after you eat,

461
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,500
what kind of car you are using to send her home.

462
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
-Need my car?
-Need my car?

463
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,420
Eat.

464
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,660
[No food is too delicate. No meat is too fresh.]

465
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:38,980
Eat.

466
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,180
Why aren't you eating?

467
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,620
You have food taboos?

468
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,180
Yes, I do.

469
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,100
What is it?

470
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,700
I don't eat raw onions

471
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,900
and cooked garlic.

472
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,500
I don't eat ginger raw or cooked.

473
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,540
Don't eat sour, spicy, or animal fat.

474
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,660
Don't eat plant stems.

475
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,220
Don't eat tomatoes and eggplants with skin.

476
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,900
Don't eat the animal parts below the knee,

477
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,340
above the neck, or innards.

478
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,140
And I don't eat boiled egg yolk

479
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,260
or brined tofu.

480
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,620
What about prawns?

481
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,780
You don't eat prawns either?

482
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
My hands will get oily peeling them.

483
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,780
Too much of a hassle.

484
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,380
Sweet food?

485
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,380
No taboo on that, right?

486
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm curious

487
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,460
how you actually grew up.

488
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,460
You're fussier than my cat.

489
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,340
Guess I'm feeding a cat.

490
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,460
Here you go, Mr. Pei.

491
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,220
Prawn for you.

492
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
I think

493
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,540
Tao Ze has indulged you too much.

494
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,850
Just say you want prawns,

495
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,770
and he'll rush out in the middle of the night
to get them.

496
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,090
If you lived with me...

497
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,700
I'd only have noodles to eat.

498
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,460
Before I went to college,
I used to go to Tao Ze's house a lot.

499
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,330
I must have inconvenienced him.

500
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,050
I wouldn't say that.

501
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,820
Back then, I already had this thought.

502
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,820
If one day he got married

503
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,420
and had a family,

504
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,940
I wouldn't be able
to frequent his house like this.

505
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,460
Pei Su.

506
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,650
My psychiatrist said

507
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,610
that when a friend starts a family or moves away,

508
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,090
when a family member grows older,

509
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,690
falls ill, and dies,

510
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,690
those are not considered events.

511
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,570
Rather, they are part of natural law,
just like a sunny day, rain, or snow.

512
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,820
Objective and eternal.

513
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,250
There's nothing more to it.

514
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,730
Being overly attached

515
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,610
is just like shedding tears
over the change of seasons.

516
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,610
It's meaningless.

517
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
The world is changing.

518
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,460
People are changing, and so am I.

519
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,730
Rejecting separation

520
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,210
or change

521
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,170
does not fit the logic.

522
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,460
So I gradually came around.

523
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,650
Tao Ze is right.

524
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,860
I shouldn't hang on to the past so tightly.

525
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,780
You're seeing a psychiatrist?

526
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,130
Is it because you're still having that dream?

527
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,020
It stopped long ago.

528
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,620
Hello? Who is it?

529
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,460
Help... Help me! I...

530
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,100
Hello?

531
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,420
Hello?

532
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,100
(Hello.)

533
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,620
(The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.)

534
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,580
You eat. Something came up.

535
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,300
I have to go.

536
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,460
(Hello?)

537
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,940
Okay, I'll be right there.

538
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,620
You eat.

539
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,820
Throw it away if you can't finish it.

540
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,500
I have to go.

541
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,940
Same old, same old.

542
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,540
It's just like before.

543
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,260
Nothing has changed.

544
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,900
Hello, Captain Luo.

545
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,140
Wu.

546
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,060
Get someone to track down these two numbers.

547
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,340
One owner is Chen Zhen.

548
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,500
23991169511.

549
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,860
The other is an unknown number.

550
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,300
23600031212.

551
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,220
I reckon these two people are active

552
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,180
in Xiaxi.

553
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,100
Quickly.

554
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,900
Speak.

555
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,100
Captain Luo, we've got it. The name is Hu Xuechun.

556
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,140
Hu Xuechun?

557
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,020
Yes.

558
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,900
I've sent you
