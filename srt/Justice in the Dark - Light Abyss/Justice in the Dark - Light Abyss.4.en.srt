00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,070
[Episode 4]

3
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,190
Move it!

4
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
What's wrong with you?

5
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,870
Watch out!

6
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,960
Pei Su!

7
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,430
Move it!

8
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,000
-Dodge!
-Dodge!

9
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,870
Dodge!

10
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,280
Pei Su!

11
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,680
Fire!

12
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,360
It's a dead end!

13
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
Pei Su!

14
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,910
Hey!

15
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,910
-Wake up!
-Pei Su!

16
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,590
You drive like a wild bull.

17
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,800
Who told you to take the shotgun seat?

18
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,910
I'm about to puke.

19
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,280
You're the one who opened the door.

20
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,310
You're a man. Why would you want to puke?

21
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,590
I've told you many times
that I get sick when I see blood.

22
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,680
Blood makes me sick.

23
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,750
I get carsick, though.

24
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,480
Get something to cover it up.

25
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,950
Here.

26
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,270
Pei Su, watch out!

27
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,430
Your fancy car isn't as good as it looks.

28
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,070
You might as well invest in a bulletproof car.

29
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm not the president. Why should I?

30
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,360
We're not paying for the car repairs, right?

31
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,360
Tell me.

32
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,120
You didn't come here alone, right?

33
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
Reinforcements won't be coming soon.

34
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,070
We have to deal with this ourselves.

35
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,390
You're lucky to get a good partner.

36
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm not as lucky as you are.

37
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,510
Pei Su, the road is blocked!

38
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,070
Looks like these darned fools

39
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,240
are going to fight till the end.

40
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,870
Captain Luo.

41
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,870
Say,

42
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,830
if I ran over every one of them,

43
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,920
would that be considered self-defense?

44
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,720
Pei Su.

45
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,480
Your life

46
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,630
is worth more than theirs.

47
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,480
Now! Don't move!

48
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,830
-Get off the bike!
-Freeze!

49
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,040
Hurry up!

50
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,920
-Stay put!
-Don't move!

51
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,920
Move it!

52
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,950
Pei Su.

53
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,630
It's okay now.

54
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,480
Pei Su.

55
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,360
Captain Luo!

56
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,600
Are you guys okay?

57
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,390
Are you hurt?

58
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,750
You frightened me.

59
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,360
With me around, what could possibly happen?

60
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,920
Pei Su...

61
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,630
It's an accident.

62
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,750
An accident.

63
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,270
You're Hu Xuechun, right?

64
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,800
Do you feel unwell?

65
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,950
No, I'm fine.

66
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,750
Then, follow us back to SID

67
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,000
so we can take your detailed statement.

68
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,070
Okay.

69
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,190
Luo Weizhao.

70
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,360
Do you know what you have done?

71
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,190
You're trying to play the hero.

72
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,390
Our reinforcements were still on their way,

73
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,360
and you acted recklessly.

74
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,270
It's okay now.

75
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,000
You do not care about discipline at all.

76
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,480
Chief Du, stop lecturing me.

77
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
I know I was wrong

78
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
for trying to play the hero.

79
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,630
Next time, I...

80
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,270
Next time? Will there be a next time?

81
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,910
No.

82
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,440
Absolutely not.

83
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,960
I guarantee there won't be next time.

84
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,000
Chief Du.

85
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,910
How's Hongfu Nightclub now?

86
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,390
There's a receptionist

87
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,600
whom I need to interrogate.

88
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,870
Don't worry. We've taken care of everything.

89
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
We've brought them all back.

90
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,550
Take your time interrogating.

91
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,480
That includes Jin Zaihong.

92
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,320
Whether it's He Zongyi's case

93
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
or the drug trafficking case,

94
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,200
I've obtained permission
from the government of Xinzhou

95
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,790
and the Ministry of Supervision.

96
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,240
We will handle the entire process.

97
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,030
That's great.

98
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,200
By the way,

99
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,550
what about Chen Zhen?

100
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,840
The doctors couldn't save him. He's dead.

101
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,480
Luo Weizhao.

102
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,270
Whether these two cases

103
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,510
are related or not,

104
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,870
the SID

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,030
must investigate them thoroughly.

106
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,390
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,320
You must be thirsty.

108
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
Where are you hurt?

109
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,630
It's okay.

110
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
It was just a little bump.

111
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
-Why did you...
-How did you agitate them?

112
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,080
I thought

113
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,750
this was an ordinary homicide.

114
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,440
Who knew it led to another case?

115
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
And when we traced the clues,

116
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,750
we managed to bust a drug trafficking ring.

117
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,960
Drug trafficking?

118
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,960
What a coincidence.

119
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,510
Why are you here?

120
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,870
You were not following me, were you?

121
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,440
I was checking out He Zongyi's house.

122
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Why?

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,080
His mother said

124
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,150
that she wanted to see
where her son lived before he died.

125
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,510
It's a dilapidated and remote area

126
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,630
with all sorts of people inside.

127
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,910
Still, many new immigrants

128
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,080
chose to live there.

129
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,840
They brought their entire families,

130
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,150
old and young,

131
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,720
and some chronically ill.

132
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,390
They worked like a slave outside

133
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,080
to feed their families.

134
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,960
Did He Zongyi take drugs too?

135
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,720
No.

136
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
He was a good son.

137
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,000
He stayed out of drugs and gambling

138
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,480
and worked hard to pay his mother's medical fees.

139
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,670
So why did he die there?

140
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,080
Hello, Tao Ze?

141
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
You were right.

142
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,840
As soon as we released Zhang Donglan,

143
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,550
we got new clues knocking at our door.

144
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,270
What clues?

145
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,030
Zhang Donglan's driver just came.

146
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,000
He said that he found

147
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,750
a blood-stained necktie on his car.

148
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,720
Have you sent it to the lab?

149
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,000
The results just came out.

150
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
It's He Zongyi's.

151
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,720
The necktie is probably the murder weapon.

152
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,440
I've sent you the picture.

153
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
[Mrs. He]

154
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,510
Luo Weizhao.

155
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,080
What's wrong with you?

156
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,840
Something big happened,

157
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
and you didn't even tell us

158
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,550
before you went investigating alone.

159
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,550
What?

160
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,320
You really think you're a superhero?

161
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,150
Mr. Tao Ze.

162
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,750
Chief Du has given me an earful,

163
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,120
so don't add salt to my wound.

164
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,240
What do you mean?

165
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,080
Are you hurt?

166
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,360
That was just a metaphor.

167
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,750
I don't get injured that easily.

168
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,080
When I come back,

169
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,270
I'm going to give you a piece of my mind.

170
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,480
Yes, of course.

171
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,960
It's late.

172
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,870
What brings you here?

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,870
He Zongyi's mother called me.

174
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
We might have to spend the night

175
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
in the visitors' lounge of your station.

176
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,030
Okay.

177
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,480
I'm going in, then.

178
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,670
Pei Su.

179
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,360
Thank you.

180
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,600
Let's get down to business,

181
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,750
or else none of us will get to sleep tonight.

182
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,550
How's it going?

183
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,360
Those street racers and Jin Zaihong
were in the interrogation room earlier.

184
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,910
But, judging from Jin Zaihong's attitude,

185
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,630
I don't think we can get
anything out of him for now.

186
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,630
What about the driver?

187
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,440
We're still interrogating him.

188
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,390
He said that after driving Zhang Donglan back,

189
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,150
he found the necktie below the co-driver's seat.

she had to take her medicine
and undergo treatment every day.

She couldn't work.

214
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,720
Back then, my father was so busy with work.

215
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,840
So he wasn't around most of the time.

216
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,030
My school was quite far from home,

217
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,750
so I stayed with a nanny near the school

218
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,270

She must have looked forward
to seeing you come back every day.

is seeing our children.

It's not him.

257
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,810
Miao Xiaowei said

258
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
that ever since he got addicted to drugs,

259
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,420
he has often run out of money,

260
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,180
so he plotted to steal He Zongyi's new phone

261
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,370
to trade it off.

262
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,050
That day, after He Zongyi got back from work,

263
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,940
he suddenly remembered his phone

264
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,570
and couldn't find it.

265
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,130
So he confronted Miao Xiaowei.

Miao Xiaowei exchanged the phone for drugs.

The note on He Zongyi's forehead

301

was outrageous.

Just like what Pei Su said,

303
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,940
the culprit has a narcissistic personality.

304
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,810
He was bold enough
to expose himself in front of us,

305
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,130

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,770

Based on your inference,

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,330
ever since we arrested Zhang Donglan,

310
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,570
the culprit has been trying
to make Zhang Donglan take the rap

311
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,660
and has been keeping a close eye
on the case's development.

Miao Xiaowei was with the Patrol Detachment.

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,460
None of these two suspects is the culprit.

316

So, who killed He Zongyi,

375

and surround He Zongyi's community apartment.

Search the area around Zhang Donglan's house too.

377
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:57,770
The person who took her away

378
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,900
is very likely to be the culprit.

379
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,420

Officer Luo, can I go too?

382

No.

383
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,220
She's planning to kill herself.

384
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,900
How do you know that?

385
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,420
She told me herself.

386
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,810
The funny thing is,

387
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,810
I didn't understand back then.

To think I didn't get that.

396
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,050
Officer Luo.

397
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,740
If I go there,

398
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,220
at least she will listen to me.

399
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,180
To be honest,

400
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,420
I've been in the force for so long,

401
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,610
but this is my first time seeing

402
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,810
such an outrageous culprit.

403
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,370
Right at this point in time,

404
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,180
he took He Zongyi's mother from the SID

405
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,370
so that Mrs. He wouldn't identify him.

406
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,420
Looks like a lame attempt at hiding his crime.

407
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,610
A psycho killer like him

408
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,940
cannot be evaluated normally.

409
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,700
His extreme narcissism

410
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,220
has developed into a clinical obsession.

411
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,050
Moreover,

412
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,740
Officer Luo, you gave him the impression

413
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,290
that your suspect was Zhang Donglan

414
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,220
and that you didn't arrest him

415
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
because of his background.

416
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,460
So, at this time,

417
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,700
he instigated Mrs. He to commit suicide

418
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,500

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,770

get in a private taxi.

429
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,130
The registered name is fake.

430
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,740
The surveillance footage showed

431
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,980
that the car disappeared at 5:54 AM

432
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,810
after entering Nanping Avenue North.

433
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,020
The car wasn't seen at the end of the road,

434
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,610
so they probably drove
to the east or west district.

(and clean my room.)

532
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,210

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,380
(She didn't like staying with my nanny,)

534
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,570

537
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,980
when I returned home full of anticipation,

538
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,820
I opened the door and saw

539
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,900
only wilted stems in the vase.

that my mother must have
looked forward to my return.

But the investigating officers told me

549
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,060
that she killed herself on the day I went back.
