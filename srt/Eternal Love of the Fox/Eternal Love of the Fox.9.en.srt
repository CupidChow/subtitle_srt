1
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,220
What's this?

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,620
Skipping meals like that,

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,420
your stomach must be suffering.

4
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,360
I'm swamped every day.

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,070
How would I have time to eat?

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,100
You're going to starve yourself sick.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,740
Beware—your internal organs may rise up

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,340
to settle accounts with you.

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,020
Let them come then.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm not afraid of that.

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,020
What I fear most now

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,040
is that I won't be able

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,170
to stay at Ningshuang Palace anymore.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,460
I finally found a lead.

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,320
I can't let it slip away like that.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,620
Do you think

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,940
I'm beautiful?

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,420
Would you want to marry me?

20
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,320
What I mean is,

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,920
if you married me,

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
then

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,700
my father

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
would be your father too, right?

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,100
If your father went missing,

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,360
wouldn't you

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,539
do everything possible to find him?

28
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,280
Am I right?

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,420
You mean

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,380
I'm standing idly by now?

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880
What I mean is,

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,420
aren't you cultivating
to become an immortal?

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,220
Then among your friends,

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,380
there must be some immortals, right?

35
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,340
Could you maybe

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,740
spend some money,

37
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,620
pull a few strings,

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,020
and use some connections

39
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
to help me find my father?

40
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,199
What do you think immortals are?

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,220
What's the difference?

42
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,320
When people go to temples to burn incense,

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,900
aren't they just asking them
to do favors anyway?

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,220
It's different.

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,060
Burning incense is about sincerity.

46
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,579
The so-called sincerity

47
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,460
is still measured by
how much money you spend, isn't it?

48
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,360
If it's truly about sincerity,

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,640
why would incense be divided by

50
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,800
size,

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,600
length,

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
or price?

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,220
The ones you speak of

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,880
are nothing more than profiteers
using the name of the immortals.

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,860
If immortals truly cared about
worldly possessions,

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,200
could they still be immortals at all?

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,500
If that's the case,

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,020
then there really is no way
to pull strings.

59
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,020
How am I supposed to keep digging then?

60
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,960
You still want to stay at
Ningshuang Palace?

61
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,340
You...

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,270
You've got any other magic tricks?

63
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,560
In this world,

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,600
the most powerful magic

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,680
is the human heart.

66
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,940
Who are you?

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Your Majesty.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
My name is

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,720
Huo Xiangjiu.

70
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,080
You've met before.

71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
Is that so?

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,100
Your Majesty, you've indeed
met her before.

73
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
She's His Grace's...

74
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,100
Sit down and talk.

75
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,900
Please, sit.

76
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,159
How could I presume to sit

77
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,480
in Your Majesty's presence?

78
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,260
His Majesty respects His Grace.

79
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,900
His Grace bringing you to Ganquan Palace

80
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,900
shows he considers you one of his own.

81
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,420
Anyone close to His Grace

82
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,180
is naturally considered close to
His Majesty as well.

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,140
Steward Sun.

84
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,940
Yes.

85
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,300
Bring the All-Inclusive Tonic Soup.

86
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

87
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,540
Come on.

88
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,659
Have a seat.

89
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,460
Yes.

90
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,040
Brother Fuying.

91
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,160
What Princess Ningshuang said—

92
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,340
even if you can bear to hear it,

93
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,700
I can't bear to repeat it.

94
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,100
It was way too offensive.

95
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:24,940
She...

96
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,760
She called you

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,820
completely useless, Prince Fuying.

98
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,680
She said you...

99
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
You're only lucky
to be born into a good family.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,240
Otherwise, you'd be begging
on the streets by now.

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Look at yourself—

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,170
and you want want to be the Emperor?

103
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,180
Dream on!

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,820
You're just like a toad

105
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,680
dreaming of...

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,640
She really said that?

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,810
Brother Fuying.

108
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,340
Not only did they say that,

109
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,580
but they also hit me!

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Let me show you where she hit me.

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
She hit me so bad.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,960
Let me show you.

113
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
Enough!

114
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,300
I saw nothing!

115
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,580
Also,

116
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,970
was Princess Ningshuang
really that unreasonable?

117
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,280
You don't believe me, do you?

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,960
Fine.

119
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,380
Gongsun Hao!

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,560
You tell them.

121
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,020
Isn't that what happened?

122
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,420
Speak up!

123
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,440
Are you mute?

124
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,580
Say something!

125
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,400
I

126
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,140
am feeling unwell.

127
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,970
I feel like throwing up.

128
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,660
Don't leave!

129
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,500
Finish what you were saying!

130
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,500
You're making it seem like
I'm talking nonsense here!

131
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,180
Your Highness.

132
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,900
Princess Ningshuang opposes you
at every turn.

133
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,880
She's really a big problem.

134
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,750
Brother Fuying.

135
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,380
I have an excellent plan.

136
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,180
Please listen carefully.

137
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,900
This plan of mine

138
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,400
is absolutely brilliant.

139
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,980
You should ask His Majesty...

140
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,220
Come on,

141
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,420
let's eat.

142
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,440
Judging from your bearing,

143
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
you must be from a prominent family.

144
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,760
My father always taught me

145
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,360
to be

146
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,700
gentle and virtuous,

147
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,080
well-educated and courteous,

148
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,820
beautiful enough to make
fish sink and geese fall

149
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,620
and to keep...

150
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,260
I have always

151
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,720
kept it in mind

152
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,760
and dare not forget.

153
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,660
This is a soup made from
a thousand-year-old turtle

154
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,740
and hundreds of precious herbs

155
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,300
brewed together.

156
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,980
You

157
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,180
are truly blessed.

158
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,860
Delicious.

159
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,900
So gentle and virtuous.

160
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,420
Your father is truly blessed.

161
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,640
You're also blessed to have

162
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,770
a daughter like Princess Ningshuang.

163
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,460
When it comes to my Ningshuang,

164
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,790
she gives me headaches.

165
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,220
She's always playing with swords

166
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,750
and has such a fiery temper.

167
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,180
If she were half like this young lady,

168
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,020
I would be satisfied.

169
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,580
If you wish Princess Ningshuang
to temper her disposition,

170
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,340
perhaps

171
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,980
you could transfer Xiangjiu
to Ningshuang Palace

172
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,420
and have her teach Princess Ningshuang
proper etiquette.

173
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,140
What do you think?

174
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,940
I...

175
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,840
I wouldn't dare!

176
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,700
How could I teach Her Highness?

177
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,220
That's actually a good idea.

178
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,780
It's just

179
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,420
Ningshuang is really stubborn.

180
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,920
Young lady,

181
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,180
you'll be in for a rough time.

182
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,340
You really care about me, Your Majesty.

183
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,140
I, Xiangjiu, am truly grateful.

184
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,540
Since Your Majesty shows
such concern for me,

185
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,180
I definitely won't disappoint
Your Majesty.

186
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,540
I will certainly teach Her Highness well.

187
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,700
Princess Ningshuang

188
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,300
has been unruly for years,

189
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,220
with no sense of propriety or etiquette.

190
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,060
We hereby appoint Huo Xiangjiu

191
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,340
who is wise, kind, virtuous,

192
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,820
dignified, graceful,

193
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,340
illustrious and benevolent,

194
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,900
as the respected Mentor

195
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,180
to teach the Princess proper etiquette.

196
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,580
The Princess must reflect deeply
on her mistakes

197
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,360
and thoroughly mend her ways.

198
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,620
Until she has been properly instructed

199
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,820
and has corrected her faults,

200
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,480
she shall not see His Majesty.

201
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,780
Your Highness,

202
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,260
please accept the decree
and express your gratitude.

203
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,180
I'll obey the decree.

204
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,840
Call me Mentor!

205
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,000
You tried every means
to enter my Ningshuang Palace.

206
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,860
What the hell do you want to...

207
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,440
Wouldn't asking me
"what your intention is"

208
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,820
have been more elegant?

209
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,560
I refuse!

210
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,900
What the hell do you want to...

211
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,780
Fine!

212
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,600
I'll tell you then!

213
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,460
I want to...

214
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,380
I heard that at Ningshuang Palace,

215
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,840
just because a maid let out a fart,

216
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
you had her beaten 50 times.

217
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,520
She's already working so hard.

218
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,700
Can't she even fart freely?

219
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,500
So what?

220
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,080
You...

221
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,700
What a...

222
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,080
From now on,

223
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,440
at Ningshuang Palace,

224
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,760
fart as you please.

225
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,460
I, the Mentor, said so.

226
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,820
At Ningshuang Palace,

227
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,380
no matter who you are,

228
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,220
I will find you.

229
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,180
Father,

230
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,140
wait for me.

231
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,240
Why not bestow Princess Ningshuang

232
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,340
upon me in marriage?

233
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,740
If I marry her,

234
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,580
she'll be your sister-in-law,

235
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,220
and we'll be family.

236
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,340
If she ever dares to disobey again,

237
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,540
I'll beat her.

238
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,940
I'll beat her every day.

239
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,470
See if she still dares to
make you angry again.

240
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
You?

241
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,880
Your Highness!

242
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,600
Your Highness!

243
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,000
Your Highness.

244
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,320
Your Highness.

245
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,700
Your Highness,

246
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,020
is there any problem?

247
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,940
That girl Huo Xiangjiu
is really something.

248
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
She's been

249
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,260
assigned by my father

250
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,860
to teach Princess Ningshuang etiquette.

251
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,220
It seems that girl

252
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,700
does have some tricks up her sleeve.

253
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,180
What trick could she possibly have?

254
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,780
Brother Fuying,

255
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,060
just use that brilliant, brilliant plan

256
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,380
I just told you.

257
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,220
By the way, Brother Fuying,

258
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,940
have His Majesty bestow that girl—

259
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,060
what's her name again, Huo Jiuxiang

260
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,780
or Jiu Xiangjiu—

261
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,940
upon me too.

262
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,460
I'll marry both of them.

263
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,440
Wouldn't that be

264
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,820
killing two birds

265
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,940
with one stone, Brother Fuying?

266
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,620
More like you're the bird.

267
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,300
Get up.

268
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,860
Let's go.

269
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,700
Get up!

270
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,260
Let's go!

271
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,260
Wait,

272
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,360
didn't you hear my brilliant plan
just now?

273
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,640
My plan is exceptionally brilliant.

274
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,670
He's exactly like a toad
lusting after swan meat.

275
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,900
Your Highness,

276
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,000
Feng Mochen alone

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,260
is troublesome enough.

278
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,700
Now

279
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,740
there's also Huo Xiangjiu.

280
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,220
Misfortune and fortune go hand in hand.

281
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,140
I don't think it's a bad thing.

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,820
Why do you say so, Your Highness?

283
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,860
I've observed

284
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,140
that Feng Mochen and that girl

285
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,020
have an unusual relationship.

286
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,110
If we control Huo Xiangjiu,

287
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,940
we control Feng Mochen's weakness.

288
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,140
I also heard that

289
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,580
not long ago,

290
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,200
regarding the Princess Consort matter,

291
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,100
His Majesty sent Steward Sun
to the Eastern Palace.

292
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,900
It was that Huo Xiangjiu

293
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,560
who reported that matter to His Majesty.

294
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,580
I've told you

295
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,380
not to come looking for me again.

296
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
Do you really want

297
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,820
to spend the rest of your life like this?

298
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,020
That's my business.

299
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,990
The Crown Prince isn't
as simple as you think.

300
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,340
You're too innocent.

301
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,600
You don't belong here.

302
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,940
If he finds out,

303
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,580
your entire family will die.

304
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,450
You still care about me.

305
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,579
Honey,

306
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,380
are you still angry?

307
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,900
Couples quarrel at the head of the bed
and make up at the foot, they say.

308
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,829
You should have calmed down by now.

309
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,500
Lord Gongsun gave me

310
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,400
a pearl necklace from the South Sea
as a gift.

311
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,300
Do you like it, Honey?

312
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,180
I'll

313
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,430
put it on for you, Honey.

314
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,500
No need.

315
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,060
I'll put it on myself later.

316
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,700
How can this be?

317
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,340
Such a beautiful pearl necklace—

318
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,220
of course I should be the one

319
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,060
to put it on you personally, Honey.

320
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,060
Honey.

321
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,620
Look how beautiful you are.

322
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,100
Since the first time I met you,

323
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,980
I have been deeply

324
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,700
enchanted by you.

325
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,620
We could have been a loving couple.

326
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,760
Why make a fuss about
some peaceful divorce?

327
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,060
I admit sometimes I act
without thinking things through.

328
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,480
Including how I dealt with

329
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,700
Huo Xiangjiu's matter earlier.

330
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,780
I heard

331
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,100
she entered Ningshuang's palace today.

332
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,820
When you have time,

333
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,900
you should visit her more often, Honey,

334
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,840
and offer my apologies

335
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,660
on my behalf.

336
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,460
Okay.

337
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,940
Today,

338
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
consider it

339
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,740
a reward from me.

340
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,920
Your Highness.

341
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,900
Not today.

342
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,960
Please, not today.

343
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,060
You should

344
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,500
be grateful.

345
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,940
Has Xiangjiu really become
Princess Ningshuang's mentor?

346
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,540
I heard it from Attendant Lü.

347
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,700
It should be true.

348
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,180
Otherwise, wouldn't I be
putting you in danger,

349
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,510
letting you go find her?

350
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,000
So you're quite concerned about my safety,
Attendant Bai.

351
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,540
You're Xiangjiu's good friend.

352
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,000
Of course I care about you.

353
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
So you only care about me
because of Xiangjiu, Attendant Bai?

354
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,740
What else?

355
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
Without Xiangjiu,

356
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,320
how would I have known you?

357
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,100
Let's go.

358
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,300
Xiangjiu is waiting.

359
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,500
Oh.

360
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,200
Your turn.

361
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,560
I...

362
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,320
What,

363
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
are you scared?

364
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,700
I knew you weren't capable of much.

365
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,220
Pack your things

366
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,360
and get out of Ningshuang Palace!

367
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,160
Bring it on then.

368
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,360
I'm not afraid of you.

369
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,300
Don't tell me you've grown up

370
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,820
without ever holding a bow.

371
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,220
What natural talent!

372
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,680
Call me Mentor!

373
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,500
The food from the Imperial Kitchen

375
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,060
isn't available to just anyone.

376
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,860
Go ahead and eat.

377
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm not hungry.

378
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,860
It's mealtime.

379
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,220
You should eat even if you're not hungry.

380
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,350
Otherwise, His Grace will be worried.

381
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,000
Mao Jin!

382
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,560
What brings you here?

383
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,080
His Grace specifically ordered me

384
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
to bring you some food.

385
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,700
For someone of your status,

386
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,600
two dishes would be quite generous.

387
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,520
Not just two.

388
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,810
Look!

389
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,620
So many dishes?

390
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
And there's more.

391
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
These

392
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,480
are all skilled masseurs.

393
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,010
His Grace specifically asked me to
bring them here to serve you.

394
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,100
When will you two stop?

395
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,020
Why don't I just vacate
my Ningshuang Palace for her to live in?

396
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,820
Your Highness.

397
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,720
Thank you for reminding me.

398
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,960
I almost forgot the important matter.

399
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,060
Your Ningshuang Palace

400
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,900
is too small.

401
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,500
His Grace said

402
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,860
he'll build a Huoxiang Palace
next to your Ningshuang Palace,

403
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,460
twice the size of Ningshuang Palace.

404
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,260
This is

405
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,620
the blueprint painted by
the Ministry of Works.

406
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,260
If you're satisfied with it,

407
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,460
the Ministry of Works
will start construction immediately.

408
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,040
This...

409
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,280
Hurry up

410
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,300
and put it away.

411
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,720
This is way too extravagant

412
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
and wasteful.

413
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,140
Go back and tell him

414
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,980
to leave the food

415
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
and take everything else away immediately.

416
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,020
That won't do!

417
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,660
I came here on His Grace's order.

418
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,460
If I return like this,

419
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:31,920
then...

420
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,990
His Grace will surely scold me.

421
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,740
Go back and tell him

422
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,140
that it was my decision.

423
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,220
If he scolds you,

424
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,420
I'll deal with him myself when I'm back.

425
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,660
Look at how smug you are.

426
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,900
As you command!

427
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,620
Let's go!

428
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,460
Off you go!

429
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,620
He's really something.

430
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,300
So much food.

431
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,760
How can I possibly
finish all this by myself?

432
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,620
Xiangjiu!

433
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,820
Le Ning?

434
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,380
Why are you here?

435
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,780
This is the food
His Grace prepared for you.

436
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,800
Didn't he just bring
a whole table of food?

437
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,560
What are you doing with that food box?

438
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,740
This is what Chief Steward Sun
asked me to bring to His Grace.

439
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,070
What's with that smile?

440
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Bai Yu!

441
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,500
Help!

442
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Bai Yu!

443
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Bai Yu!

444
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,660
Stop right there!

445
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,420
I can't hear anything.

446
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,300
Stop!

447
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,740
I can't hear anything!

448
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,620
I said stop!

449
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,880
I can't hear anything!

450
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,380
Turtle, oh turtle.

451
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,400
Would you like to

452
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
cultivate immortality with me?

453
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,820
You've got talent.

454
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,220
You'd pick it up fast.

455
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,260
Wily fox, save me!

456
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,580
Bai Yu!

457
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,860
Bai Yu!

458
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,100
Congratulations,

459
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,030
Prince Consort.

460
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,940
What are you talking about?

461
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,140
Don't talk nonsense.

462
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,700
Your Grace.

463
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,300
You can take whatever medicine you want,

464
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,100
but you can't speak carelessly.

465
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,380
I honestly think

466
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,700
you two

467
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,500
have some spousal resemblance.

468
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,500
Let me ask you,

469
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,260
that night when you entered
my Ningshuang Palace,

470
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,340
what was your intention?

471
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,660
What were you after?

472
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,300
It was him.

473
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,820
He told me Huo Xiangjiu was there.

474
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,140
I see.

475
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,340
So you

476
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,420
and His Grace

477
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,820
and Huo Xiangjiu

478
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,180
are all connected.

479
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,780
You three tried every possible way
to sneak into my Ningshuang Palace.

480
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,820
What dark secret are you hiding?

481
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,100
Before you expelled Huo Xiangjiu

482
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,620
from Ningshuang Palace,

483
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,300
did you ask her the same question?

484
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,140
How did she answer?

485
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,020
She said

486
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,780
she wanted to help me
reconcile with my mother.

487
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,780
That's one of the answers.

488
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,650
So that's not the complete answer.

489
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,700
You

490
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,500
will get what you want

491
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,060
from her.

492
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,200
And she will get

493
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,600
what she wants from you.

494
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,160
That's enough.

495
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,040
Xiangjiu.

496
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,890
Where are you going
in the middle of the night?

497
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,800
Go back to sleep.

498
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,160
I'll be back soon.

499
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,920
I wonder

500
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,420
if I'll run into that guy.

501
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,200
Finally found you!

502
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,000
Wait.

503
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,320
Xiangjiu.

504
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,040
It's me.

505
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,500
Yu?

506
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,270
What are you doing here?

507
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,220
I wanted to ask you.

508
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,460
Why are you so determined
to stay in Ningshuang Palace?

509
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,540
You know Princess Ningshuang's temper.

510
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,500
I do,

511
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,700
but

512
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,060
I suspect

513
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,700
my father's disappearance

514
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,580
is connected to someone
in Ningshuang Palace.

515
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,260
I see.

516
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,270
Since the Ganquan Register
has Princess Ningshuang's scent on it,

517
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,580
and there's an evil spirit
hiding in Ningshuang Palace,

518
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,380
they must be connected somehow.

519
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,220
That's why I want to find that thing.

520
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,940
Once I find it,

521
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,860
everything will be explained.

522
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,310
Don't worry.

523
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,940
With me, Bai Yu, here,

524
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,140
we'll definitely catch that thing

525
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,540
and find Father-in-law.

526
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,220
Stop calling him your father-in-law.

527
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,340
What's wrong with that?

528
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
We were betrothed since childhood.

529
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,940
Our marriage is just a matter of time.

530
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,220
Prince Consort!

531
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,660
Xiangjiu.

532
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,620
Don't listen to that wily nonsense...

533
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,860
Don't listen to that wily fox's nonsense.

534
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,540
Alright, alright.

535
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,180
I'm done talking.

536
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,260
You stay here.

537
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,830
I'm going to the toilet.

538
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,660
I'll go with you.

539
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,340
No!

540
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,540
Xiangjiu.

541
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,620
You wily fox.

542
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,700
I'll skin you alive!

543
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,100
Just don't run into
that troublesome Ningshuang.

544
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,700
I lost my mother at a young age.

545
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,400
I know the pain of
being separated from your mother.

546
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,660
Therefore,

547
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,620
I wish to help Your Highness

548
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,880
reunite with Old Madam

549
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,100
as a family.

550
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,340
You

551
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,540
will get

552
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,980
what you want from her.

553
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,340
And she'll get

554
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,670
what she wants from you.

555
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,640
And that'll be enough.

556
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,640
Finally, you're here.
