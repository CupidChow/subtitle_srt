1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,820
Your Highness, everything you instructed

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,540
has been taken care of.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,860
Huo Xiangjiu

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,280
will soon

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,820
find her father.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,980
She's getting the easy way out—

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,860
she deserved to die anyway.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,020
Saves us the trouble, I suppose.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,060
Someone who deserves death

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,500
will die without fail.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,740
But weren't Your Highness

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,580
worried before

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,820
that killing her

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,140
might provoke His Grace…

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,340
A dutiful daughter,
upon learning of her father's death,

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,800
is overwhelmed with grief

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
and takes her own life
to follow him in death.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,680
Such is

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,040
the very model of filial piety.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,140
Your Highness!

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,960
Your Highness,

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,360
what are you doing here?

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,100
Your Highness,

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,340
why are you here?

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,580
I brought some ginseng soup

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,580
for His Highness.

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,140
Honey,

28
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,400
have you been standing here long?

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,380
Your Highness, you once reminded me

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,660
not to disturb you

31
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,870
while you're discussing matters.

32
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,710
Honey, you are truly obedient.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,430
The weather has turned chilly lately.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,180
Honey,

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,620
to avoid falling ill,

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
you should stay in your room for now

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,479
and not venture outside.

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,560
Yuan Xiang,

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
accompany the Princess Consort
at all times.

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,920
Get some rest.

41
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,440
Your health

42
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,140
has only just begun
to improve these past few days—

43
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,339
you can't afford to let your guard down.

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,640
Y-

45
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,580
You clumsy guard!

46
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,500
Don't you know

47
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,960
that being badly frightened
can seriously harm one's health?

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,140
Miss Xiangjiu,

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
please stay.

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
I am

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
Gongsun Hao.

52
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,020
I've heard that the long-standing conflict
between Princess Ningshuang

53
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,300
and the Old Madam was finally resolved,

54
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,159
all thanks to your intervention.

55
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,900
Oh, that matter—

56
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,510
it was nothing more
than a misunderstanding.

57
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,659
There is also something

58
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,740
I'd like

59
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,620
to ask you to help with.

60
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,300
It is urgent—

61
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,320
a matter of life and death
for the Princess Consort.

62
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,340
Do you know what Gongsun Hao said to me?

63
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,540
Whatever it is, it can wait…

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,160
It's about the Princess Consort, isn't it?

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,640
How did you know?

66
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:27,980
You...

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,320
have you already found out everything?

68
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,120
Go to sleep.

69
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,900
You have nothing to say?

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,040
I do.

71
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,520
Go to sleep.

72
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,380
How can you be so indifferent?

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,700
Go to sleep.

74
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,600
Push me again and see what happens.

75
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,040
So… we're sleeping like this?

76
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,300
Yes, just like this.

77
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,300
Xiangjiu,

78
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,260
there's news about your father.

79
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,940
Last night, the Eastern Palace arrested
a palace servant for theft.

80
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,960
Under intense interrogation,

81
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
it was discovered that 2 years ago,

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,780
after being caught stealing,

83
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,420
he beat an elderly palace servant
to death inside the palace.

84
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,820
However, as the victim
had secretly entered the palace

85
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,020
and had no official identity,

86
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,220
the death had gone unnoticed until now.

87
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,880
Heaven-Mandated

88
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Celestial Lord

89
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,440
of Supreme Purity

90
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,100
and Ultimate Divinity

91
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,760
and the Mentor of Virtue,
Compassion, Benevolence, Rectitude,

92
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,520
Harmony, Wellness, Nurturance, Felicity,

93
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,360
Illumination, Preparedness,
Solemnity, Humanity,

94
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
Hmm.

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,640
Reverence, Admiration, Dedication,
and Nobility

96
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,420
are here.

97
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,140
Stop looking.

98
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,670
For the next few days,
stay put in your room and behave yourself.

99
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,340
Has His Grace arrived?

100
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,870
So what if His Grace has?

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,120
The last time I met the Mentor,

102
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,890
we talked about ornaments.

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
She said

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,260
she was very fond of items
made from combed silk.

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
I mentioned that I happened
to have a combed silk hairpin

106
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,980
and promised to give it to her.

107
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,820
Since she's here now,

108
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,220
I'd like to give it to her—

109
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,150
so she won't have

110
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,760
to ask me for it later.

111
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,340
Your Highness, you're truly generous—

112
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,180
such a fine hairpin,
and you're just giving it away?

113
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,100
I've served you for so long

114
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,360
and never received any treasure myself.

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
These earrings

116
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,720
were a gift from His Highness back then.

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,040
The craftsmanship is exquisite—

118
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,370
far superior to that combed silk hairpin.

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
If you like them,

120
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
I'll give them to you.

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,620
All right then.

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,240
I'll deliver the combed silk hairpin

123
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,440
to her on your behalf.

124
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,520
What brings

125
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,620
Your Grace to the Eastern Palace?

126
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,640
Is he

127
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,740
the thief the Eastern Palace
apprehended last night?

128
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,669
That's correct.

129
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,200
His name is Zhang Jia.

130
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
His Highness

131
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
intended to hand him over
to the Ministry of Justice.

132
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,860
This matter hardly
warrants troubling His Grace—

133
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,780
unless

134
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,800
he also stole something
from the Fucang Palace?

135
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,540
Two years ago,

136
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,060
did he beat a palace servant to death?

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,780
After we caught him last night,

138
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,880
his skills suggested

139
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,480
he was a habitual offender,

140
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,010
so we subjected him
to severe interrogation.

141
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,820
Turned out

142
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,440
he was spineless—

143
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,920
after just a few blows,

144
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,200
he confessed to many crimes,

145
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,780
including the killing
of the palace servant.

146
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,990
I will interrogate him myself.

147
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Since His Grace is questioning you,

148
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,200
answer truthfully—

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,720
so you won't have to suffer
further corporal punishment.

150
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,160
As long as I'm not beaten again,

151
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,100
I'll tell the truth,

152
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,960
I swear.

153
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
Let me ask you.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
Answer me—

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,520
are you

156
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,920
adept at lying?

157
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,840
I am not good at lying.

158
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,120
Not good at lying?

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,180
That statement itself

160
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,640
is a lie.

161
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,240
You've stolen within the palace for years

162
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,120
without

163
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,360
being discovered—

164
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,240
even after killing someone
and covering it up.

165
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
That speaks to a meticulous mind.

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
By that logic,

167
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,480
your claim

168
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
that you're not good at lying

169
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,880
is itself a lie.

170
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Please spare my life, Your Grace.

171
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
Spare my life, Your Grace

172
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,980
Please spare my life, Your Grace.

173
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,380
Since

174
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,980
you may lie again,

175
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,680
I will make an agreement with you.

176
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,370
What kind of agreement?

177
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,340
For every lie you tell,

178
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,500
I will

179
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,460
sever one of your limbs.

180
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,200
You have 5…

181
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,740
no—

182
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,340
4 chances to lie.

183
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,100
Cherish them carefully.

184
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,060
What are you staring at?

185
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,780
Whatever His Grace asks,

186
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,000
just answer truthfully.

187
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,960
Your Grace,

188
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,190
this is the Eastern Palace.

189
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,260
Splattering blood
all over the Eastern Palace...

190
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,960
wouldn't that be rather inappropriate?

191
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,000
If he doesn't lie,

192
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,860
won't everything be fine?

193
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
And if what he says is true,

194
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,810
yet you mistake it for a lie—

195
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,160
what is to be done then?

196
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,480
Misfortune

197
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,840
happens every day,

198
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,040
doesn't it?

199
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,740
Answer me—

200
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,940
2 years ago,

201
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,170
did you beat a palace servant to death?

202
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,770
His Grace is asking you a question.

203
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,520
Tell the truth now,

204
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,600
exactly as you did

205
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,660
during last night's interrogation.

206
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,850
Yes, your Grace.

207
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,220
Where did you kill him?

208
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,760
That night

209
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,280
I went to Ganquan Palace to steal.

210
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,200
I happened to run into him.

211
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,560
He looked unfamiliar—

212
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,480
didn't seem to belong to Ganquan Palace—

213
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,800
so I hardened my heart

214
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,100
and killed him.

215
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,500
What did he look like?

216
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,080
He was a little over six feet tall,

217
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,400
thin in build,

218
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,440
and about 50 years old.

219
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,880
Come here.

220
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,640
What for?

221
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,980
The Princess Consort said

222
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,340
she previously promised
to give Huo Xiangjiu

223
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,800
this combed silk hairpin.

224
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,620
Take a look—

225
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,420
do you see anything suspicious?

226
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,760
It's just an ordinary
combed silk hairpin.

227
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,120
Nothing suspicious.

228
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,220
Then deliver it to Huo Xiangjiu
on the Princess Consort's behalf.

229
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,020
Come back—

230
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,280
how about keeping me company tonight?

231
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,000
His Highness is right inside.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,280
Aren't you afraid he'll hear?

233
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,740
He hardly has time for me right now.

234
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,340
If His Highness
doesn't summon me tonight,

235
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,220
I'll come to you.

236
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,140
I'll be waiting.

237
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,560
Where was the body hidden?

238
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,280
It was thrown

239
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
into the

240
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,440
w-well

241
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,970
in the Imperial Garden.

242
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,560
Miss Xiangjiu,
this is

243
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,160
the combed silk hairpin
that the Princess Consort promised you.

244
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
Your Grace,

245
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,510
what's the matter with Miss Xiangjiu?

246
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,140
Old Fox, what are you trying to do?

247
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,540
I've already sent Mao Jin
and Le Ning there.

248
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,620
No.

249
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm going to the Imperial Garden myself.

250
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,460
Even if you go now,

251
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,860
you won't find anything.

252
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,680
Why are you so certain?

253
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,590
Concern clouds your judgment.

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,800
Don't you think

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,860
the Crown Prince was worried

256
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,120
that Zhang Jia might say the wrong thing?

257
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,360
Yes.

258
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,200
The 2 missing pages
from the Ganquan Register

259
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,130
should have nothing to do with him.

260
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,520
Are you saying

261
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,220
all of this

262
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,510
was arranged by Prince Fuying?

263
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,320
Did they believe it?

264
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,740
So you really

265
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,260
did hear everything last night,
in the reception hall.

266
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,420
I may not agree with what you're doing,

267
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,060
but since you insist,

268
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,860
as your wife,

269
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,420
I will support your decision.

270
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,730
Aren't you even curious

271
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,180
why I did this?

272
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,000
It doesn't matter

273
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,000
whether I know.

274
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Was this arranged by Prince Fuying?

275
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,220
Why would he do all this?

276
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,470
There's only one possibility:

277
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,680
he knows who your father is,

278
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,640
and he doesn't want you
to keep investigating.

279
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,640
What matters is

280
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,440
that from the moment you tried
to mislead Huo Xiangjiu,

281
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,560
you were already telling her…

282
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,620
He was involved

283
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,640
in my father's death.

284
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,480
Master,

285
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,960
we checked that well
in the Imperial Garden.

286
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,660
It leads to the moat.

287
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,160
The moat connects to the river—

288
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,960
how are we supposed to find anything now?

289
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,420
If this has nothing to do
with Prince Fuying,

290
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,000
I really can't understand

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,130
why he would do this.

292
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,980
I'll confront Prince Fuying.

293
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,010
With no evidence at all,

294
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,660
why would he ever admit it?

295
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,580
This combed silk hairpin

296
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,580
was sent to me
by the Princess Consort through Gao Wei.

297
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,500
She said she'd promised it to me earlier.

298
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,860
But we

299
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,520
never talked about this at all.

300
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,820
What a beautiful hairpin!

301
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,280
Maybe she gave it to you

302
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,800
simply because she thought it was lovely?

303
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,760
If that were the case,

304
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,560
she could have given it to me herself.

305
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,290
Why send someone else instead?

306
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,480
True.

307
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,440
We were at the Eastern Palace.

308
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,200
Logically speaking,
if Xiangjiu is acquainted with her,

309
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
she should have come out to greet us.

310
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,200
She was probably not able
to move about.

311
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
She can't even move about...

312
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,000
but she still sent someone
to bring it to me?

313
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Could it be

314
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,570
that she wants you to do something
with this hairpin?

315
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,600
A hairpin is

316
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,120
for pinning up your hair.

317
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,800
What else would it be for?

318
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,680
It could also be used to kill someone.

319
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,240
Look,

320
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,640
how sharp it is.

321
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,940
The Princess Consort wants Xiangjiu
to kill someone with it?

322
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,780
You really have quite an imagination.

323
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,580
Then what—

324
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,760
suicide?

325
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,220
Commit suicide?

326
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,180
Combed silk...

327
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,700
Commit suicide...

328
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,450
She's trying to warn you

329
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,090
that someone may force you
to commit suicide.

330
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,320
I need to see Song Lian.

331
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,720
She must know something.

332
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,260
If she really did know something,

333
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,140
it would be very hard
for you to see her now.

334
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,720
Prince Fuying would
have her under tight watch.

335
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,200
I've thought of an intermediary.

336
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,460
She's the best choice.

337
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,600
You're saying…

338
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
your father's disappearance
is connected to Prince Fuying.

339
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,220
Otherwise, there's no way to explain

340
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,760
why he did all those things.

341
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,360
Song Lian should know some of the truth.

342
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,060
Who is Song Lian?

343
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,260
The Princess Consort.

344
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,700
She's your sister-in-law—

345
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
how could you not even know her name?

346
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,980
After she entered the palace,

347
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,680
everyone just called her
Princess Consort.

348
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,810
How am I supposed to remember all that?

349
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,740
But she's the Princess Consort—

350
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,070
can she really help you?

351
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,140
She's not the same as Prince Fuying.

352
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,460
And

353
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,740
I only just learned

354
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,020
that she was forced
to marry Prince Fuying.

355
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,260
Bastard!

356
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,020
Do you know

357
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,780
which royal line she comes from?

358
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,880
Why didn't her family help her at all?

359
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,580
She's just a girl
from an ordinary farming family.

360
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,020
Years ago,

361
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,580
Father went hunting

362
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,120
and chased his prey
to the edge of a cliff.

363
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,900
He slipped

364
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,780
and fell,

365
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,560
and she saved him.

366
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,800
She took care of Father day and night,

367
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,880
and Father came

368
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,280
to value her greatly.

369
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,360
Presumably,

370
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,760
Prince Fuying forced the marriage

371
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,020
to win Father's favor.

372
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,920
No wonder His Majesty treated her so well—

373
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,040
so that's how it all began.

374
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,460
The Princess Consort

375
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,820
has had a cruel fate.

376
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,280
Not long after she married,

377
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,210
she miscarried.

378
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,900
Song—

379
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,880
She was pregnant?

380
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,940
It must have been connected
to Prince Fuying.

381
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,710
Ningshuang,

382
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,710
I need to see her right away.

383
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,740
Fine.

384
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,910
Then have Bai Yu come and plead with me.

385
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,860
Why?

386
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,160
A few days ago,

387
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,480
when you were ill,

388
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,400
Bai Yu humiliated me.

389
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,240
This time,

390
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I want him

391
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,840
to pay it back.

392
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,520
Your Highness,

393
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,900
would you like to hear a joke?

394
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,860
I've prepared

395
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,460
quite a few over the past few days,
just for you.

396
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,440
Someone

397
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
as pampered,

398
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,720
indulged,

399
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,120
and unreasonable as I am—

400
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,130
how could I possibly
be worthy of hearing your jokes?

401
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,600
Your Highness,

402
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,100
I know I was wrong.

403
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,360
And what were you wrong about?

404
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,160
I was wrong

405
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,310
to speak to Your Highness that way.

406
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,440
Be specific.

407
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,950
More specifically—

408
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,580
being pampered

409
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,540
and indulged

410
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,680
doesn't mean one
lacks understanding or compassion.

411
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,600
Your Highness is of noble birth

412
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,520
and yet deeply considerate.

413
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,680
When Xiangjiu fell ill,

414
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,320
Your Highness not only sent tonics,

415
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,840
but often kept her company.

416
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,240
If Your Highness were truly unreasonable,

417
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,970
how could you be so thoughtful?

418
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,600
Being pampered

419
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
is a matter of birth;

420
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
being understanding

421
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,010
is a matter of the heart.

422
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,360
If you call me pampered,

423
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,280
I won't deny it.

424
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,520
But to say I lack understanding

425
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,680
is to insult me

426
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,340
by calling me heartless.

427
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,420
Should I

428
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,420
be angry with you?

429
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:24,900
You should—

430
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,960
without question.

431
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,540
Take my humble origins, for example.

432
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,100
If people say my family was poor,

433
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,430
I cannot object to that.

434
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
But if they say I'd become a thief
because of it,

435
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,100
that insults my character.

436
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,280
What does one's birth

437
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,700
have to do with one's virtue?

438
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,160
Isn't that a shallow view?

439
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,360
That's deep.

440
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,680
This time,

441
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
I shall spare you.

442
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,900
But what if

443
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,180
there's a next time?

444
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,260
This mistake alone

445
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,500
has already made me reflect deeply

446
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,700
and improve a great deal.

447
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,860
If I make a few more,

448
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,300
wouldn't I undergo a complete rebirth—

449
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,260
and ascend to immortality?

450
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,620
So you've been using me
as your path to immortality?

451
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,180
If I were to ascend,

452
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,710
wouldn't Your Highness

453
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
be the one who benefits in the end?

454
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,540
Throughout history,

455
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,180
which princess has ever
had an immortal at her service?

456
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,700
Only Your Highness could manage that.

457
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,860
Bai Yu,

458
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,190
have you been doing all this

459
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,980
just for Xiangjiu?

460
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,630
Okay, I understand now.

461
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,060
Your Highness, where are you going?

462
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,660
To see the Princess Consort.

463
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,580
Oh, by the way—

464
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,440
the wily fox...

465
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,420
the wily fox told me to remind you:

466
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,060
you never set foot in the Eastern Palace.

467
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,460
If you go there suddenly,

468
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,900
Prince Fuying may grow suspicious.

469
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,740
Nonsense!

470
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,700
Do you really think
I need you to tell me that?

471
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,860
I'm not a fool.

472
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,140
Bai Yu,

473
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,040
would you ever like me?

474
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,640
No.

475
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,420
That's fine.

476
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,880
I'll teach you slowly.

477
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,220
Gongsun Hao,

478
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,560
patrolling like this every day

479
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,680
is dull as dirt.

480
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,760
Why don't we go find some fun?

481
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,450
You'd better not stir up trouble
for your sister.

482
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,520
Do you have any idea how much
she's suffered under Prince Fuying

483
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,320
just to secure this post for you?

484
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,910
That's where you're wrong.

485
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,540
Who gets married
without suffering?

486
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,920
You really think

487
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,760
marrying a commoner means an easy life?

488
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
If hardship is inevitable no matter
whom you marry,

489
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,680
why not marry someone
with power and influence?

490
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,280
That way, even if you suffer,

491
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,930
you at least get gold and silver
in return.

492
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,300
You're nothing but a beast.

493
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,460
I'm just being realistic.

494
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,940
Didn't your father

495
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,120
always want you

496
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,960
to marry Princess Ningshuang anyway?

497
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,220
I will never marry Princess Ningshuang.

498
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,240
Nonsense!

499
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,240
Do you really think Princess Ningshuang
would ever look at you?

500
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,370
You're puncturing above your weight.

501
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,340
It's "punching above one's weight."

502
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,120
You even want to punch?

503
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,840
Know your place—

504
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,040
who do you think you are?

505
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,640
If anyone's worthy of her, it's me.

506
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,160
Princess Ningshuang and I—

507
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,760
that's what you call
a match of equal standing.

508
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,340
Look. It's Princess Ningshuang.

509
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,940
Greetings, Princess Ningshuang.

510
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,500
So you're Prince Fuying's brother-in-law?

511
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,740
The princess remembers me—

512
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,660
she must have taken an interest.

513
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,460
You have an excellent memory,
Your Highness.

514
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,860
I am indeed
the Crown Prince's brother-in-law,

515
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,480
the Princess Consort's own brother—

516
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,940
the future Imperial Uncle,

517
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,060
Song Yicheng.

518
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,250
Imperial Uncle, you are rather handsome.

519
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,800
Thank you for the compliment,
Your Highness.

520
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,520
Your Highness,
you are the true beauty of the realm.

521
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,160
Indeed—

522
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,960
as the saying goes,

523
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,960
a single glance from your smile
could make flowers...

524
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,970
Imperial Uncle,

525
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,480
you're quite witty, too.

526
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,920
Your Highness may not know—

527
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm not only witty,

528
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,100
but also quite flirtatious.

529
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,700
Oh?

530
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,780
Then would the Imperial Uncle

531
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,340
care to come up here and show me

532
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,240
just how flirtatious you are?

533
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,040
With so many people watching,

534
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,520
she must enjoy excitement.

535
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,720
Fine.

536
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,060
I've got this.

537
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,860
My darling,

538
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,080
here I come.

539
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,680
Guards!

540
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,640
Help!

541
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,120
How dare you!

542
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,240
Your Highness,

543
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,860
you intend to send Gongsun Hao

544
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,390
to finish off Huo Xiangjiu?

545
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,180
I'm afraid Gongsun Wugui

546
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,760
wouldn't agree if he found out.

547
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,100
Since when

548
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,080
has my business required his approval?

549
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
True enough.

550
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,040
But with so many people available,

551
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,440
why insist on sending Gongsun Hao,
Your Highness?

552
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,860
He seems

553
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,900
rather dull and rigid.

554
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,540
Don't you think he's too clean?

555
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,000
I want his hands

556
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,180
stained with blood—

557
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,740
otherwise,

558
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,200
how am I supposed to control him?

559
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,440
Your Highness is most wise.

560
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,650
Greetings, Your Highness.

561
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,160
Something's happened to Mr. Song.

562
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,300
In full public view,

563
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,160
he harassed Princess Ningshuang

564
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,820
and was taken by Her Highness
to Ningshuang Palace.

565
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,540
That Song Yicheng—

566
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,880
short in stature,

567
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,260
but his nerve keeps growing.

568
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,140
Is he tired of living?

569
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,620
Princess Ningshuang has quite the temper.

570
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,100
He's courting death.

571
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,840
Princess Ningshuang has made it clear:

572
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,680
if Your Highness does not go
to Ningshuang Palace to offer an apology,

573
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,240
she will first cripple Mr. Song,

574
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,880
then present him
before His Majesty,

575
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,320
and lodge an accusation
against the Eastern Palace

576
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,450
for poor governance

577
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,050
and lax discipline.

578
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,160
Then let the Princess Consort go.

579
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,140
It's her own brother—

580
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,160
she can deal with him herself.

581
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Have Yuan Xiang

582
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,900
stay with her at all times.

583
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,030
Yes, Your Highness.

584
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,200
Lian!

585
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,760
Lian!

586
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,180
Lian, you're finally here!

587
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,900
Lian.

588
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,340
Lian, save me.

589
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,200
Lian!

590
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm the only heir of the Song family!

591
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,640
Lian.

592
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,520
They...

593
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
t-they beat me—

594
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,160
and even knocked out my gold tooth.

595
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,280
Look—

596
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,400
look!

597
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,680
Princess Ningshuang
even said she'd castrate me.

598
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
Lian, think of something—

599
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,940
if it's too late,

600
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,960
the Song family line will end!

601
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,400
Lian!

602
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,600
What a troublemaker.

603
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,640
Mind your own business!

604
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,440
Lian,

605
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,960
think of something.

606
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm still a virgin—

607
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,400
I can't be castrated!

608
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,380
Lian.

609
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,560
Please announce

610
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,520
that the Princess Consort wishes
to see Her Highness.

611
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,500
Princess Ningshuang is inside.

612
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,830
Your Highness, please.

613
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,990
Please try your best, Lian.

614
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,120
Her Highness's private chambers—

615
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,920
who do you think you are to enter?

616
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,620
I'm the Princess Consort's personal maid.

617
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,660
I go wherever the Princess Consort goes.

618
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,260
Move aside, you lowly wench!

619
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,620
This is Ningshuang Palace,

620
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,950
not the Eastern Palace.

621
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,840
Step out of line again,

622
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
and I'll knock your front teeth out.

623
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,140
Gongsun Hao,

624
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,660
your hands are too clean.

625
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,460
I...

626
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
want you to stain them with blood.

627
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,930
I know you don't want
to kill innocent people.

628
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,160
but she...

629
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,840
must die,

630
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,700
It is because

631
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,280
her father's death

632
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,620
is tied to your own.
