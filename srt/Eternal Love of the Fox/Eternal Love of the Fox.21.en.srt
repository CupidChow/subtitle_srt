1
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,620
May I ask, Your Grace,

2
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,300
who exactly are you?

3
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,140
And who are you?

4
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,500
This is the price you pay
for hurting Xiangjiu.

5
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,350
I deserve this, Your Grace.

6
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,000
In a momentary lapse,

7
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,300
I was led astray.

8
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,900
Therefore,

9
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,140
when Prince Fuying

10
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,300
ordered me to accuse
Your Grace of being a demon,

11
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,620
I felt too ashamed

12
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,660
to show up.

13
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,700
If Your Grace

14
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,540
is still angered by me,

15
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,580
I'm willing to accept punishment.

16
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,840
Was it Prince Fuying who instructed you?

17
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,920
Who had Mao Jin transferred away?

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,120
It was someone sent by Prince Fuying.

19
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,320
Who exactly was that?

20
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,040
That I don't know.

21
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
For such a secret matter,

22
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,960
Prince Fuying would surely entrust it

23
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,400
to someone he trusts.

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
It was Gao Wei.

25
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,079
All the schemes Prince Fuying has plotted

26
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,079
were carried out by Gao Wei.

27
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,760
From now on,

28
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,980
if you ever think of
hurting Xiangjiu again,

29
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,090
even if Xiangjiu pricks her finger
picking flowers,

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
I

31
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,360
will consider it your fault

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,780
and will destroy you completely.

33
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,040
Your Grace.

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Can you

35
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,040
truly help Lian escape her suffering?

36
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,960
Xiangjiu's promise

37
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,680
is my promise.

38
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,960
For Your Grace's boundless kindness,

39
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
I have no way to repay you.

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Please accept my bow.

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,250
There's no need for thanks.

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,080
Xiangjiu is doing this to help
Princess Consort.

43
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,680
It has nothing to do with you.

44
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,540
Demon!

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,320
Mao Jin!

46
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,920
Le Ning!

47
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,480
Demon!

48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,640
I saw a demon!

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,520
Your master is a demon!

50
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,980
Let's run away when we still can!

51
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,380
Le Ning!

52
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
Oh right,

53
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,460
let's take Xiangjiu with us!

54
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,380
Le Ning!

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,420
Are you really that afraid of demons—

56
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,490
even ones that have never hurt you?

57
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,960
But they're demons.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,240
Whether they hurt me or not,

59
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,500
they're still demons.

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
What are you waiting for?

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,880
Let's go!

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,140
I'm a demon myself too.

63
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,300
So we really are family.

64
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,960
You're not afraid of me at all.

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,130
Why did you faint again?

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
Princess Consort has been suffering
from stomach pain since this morning.

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Come quickly and check on her!

68
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
Hurry!

69
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,420
What's happening? Tell me!

70
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,820
Congratulations, Your Highness!

71
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,860
Congratulations, Your Highness.

72
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,900
Her Highness Princess Consort

73
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,260
is with child.

74
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,860
I have an heir.

75
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
I have an heir!

76
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,810
Congratulations, Your Highness!

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,760
Our congratulations!

78
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,880
May Your Highness be blessed with a son
at the first try,

79
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,340
and may our Muxi State
flourish and prosper!

80
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,740
Go away.

81
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,220
That wretched woman is really something.

82
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,820
His Highness beats her all the time,

83
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,950
yet she still managed to get pregnant.

84
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,140
This is bad.

85
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,460
Now that Princess Consort's pregnant,

86
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,580
there's no way she can be driven out.

87
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,580
Doesn't that mean

88
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,380
I won't be able to go to Fucang Palace
after all?

89
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,380
How could that be?

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,940
Attendant Mao,

91
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,060
what brings you here?

92
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,260
News came that
Princess Consort is with child.

93
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,820
Master was worried about you

94
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,880
and specially sent me to check on you.

95
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,900
Why would His Grace worry about me

96
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,920
just because Princess Consort's pregnant?

97
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,080
You really don't know?

98
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,910
How have you been treating
Princess Consort?

99
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,400
If Princess Consort gives birth
to a boy,

100
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,350
do you think you'll be able to survive?

101
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,700
That's true.

102
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,860
So what should I do?

103
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,980
You work for Master.

104
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,140
Surely Master

105
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,700
has planned a way out for you.

106
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,020
This...

107
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,840
Your Highness,

108
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,400
please have some ginseng soup.

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,640
It helps stabilize the pregnancy.

110
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,700
Just leave it here.

111
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,140
I'd like to speak with

112
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,740
His Highness alone for a bit.

113
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Your Highness, I'll take my leave.

114
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Okay.

115
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
From now on,

116
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,480
focus on nourishing the pregnancy

117
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,680
and give me a fair, chubby son.

118
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,260
Father will surely be overjoyed,

119
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,680
and you'll

120
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,400
have good days ahead as well.

121
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,980
So I'll only have good days

122
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,640
if I bear you a son?

123
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,720
Isn't your life now

124
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,480
good enough?

125
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,700
If it weren't for me,

126
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,920
you'd probably still be
living out in the countryside

127
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,780
as some backwater village woman.

128
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,140
I often think about it too.

129
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,480
If it weren't for you,

130
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,200
I would probably be
living a peaceful, happy life

131
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,960
with the one I love,

132
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,560
raising children together.

133
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,480
The one you love?

134
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,720
Other than me,

135
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
you dare have someone else you love?

136
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,280
Says you.

137
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,530
Even your own father doesn’t love you.

138
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,160
What makes you think you're worthy of
having someone you love?

139
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,020
Prince Fuying,

140
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,760
I want to divorce you.

141
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,860
Dream on!

142
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,320
Even if it means death,

143
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,540
we will never divorce.

144
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,000
Since you love hitting me so much,

145
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,240
this time,

146
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,020
I'll let you have your way.

147
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,020
Are you insane?

148
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,260
Yes, I am insane.

149
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,220
Ever since I married you,

150
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,300
I've gone mad.

151
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,180
Only a madwoman would marry
someone who raped her.

152
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,140
What you care about most

153
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,200
is your image in your father's eyes.

154
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,780
From this moment on,

155
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,580
all your efforts

156
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,140
will be completely wasted.

157
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,340
You think

158
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
you can destroy me?

159
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,460
You unfilial wretch!

160
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,380
Lian!

161
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,420
You unfilial wretch.

162
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,400
Are you all right?

163
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,120
Father.

164
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,660
Father.

165
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,960
Father.

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,640
Father.

167
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,640
Listen to me.

168
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,810
It's not what it looks like.

169
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,300
Please hear me out.

170
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,120
Father,

171
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
His Highness forced me to drink
the ginseng soup.

172
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,000
When I refused,

173
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
he flew into a rage.

174
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,820
You unfilial wretch.

175
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,260
She's carrying a child,

176
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,780
and you dare to hit her?

177
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,020
Your Majesty,

178
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,660
there's something off
with this ginseng soup.

179
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,240
You actually tried to poison our child?

180
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,760
No,

181
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,520
I didn't.

182
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,560
Father,

183
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,520
I didn't do it.

184
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,340
This ginseng soup...

185
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,640
I wasn't the one who brought it in.

186
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
It was Yuan Xiang.

187
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,020
Yuan Xiang!

188
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,020
No, no, no.

189
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,920
Stop making those fart-like noises

190
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,740
and speak!

191
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,620
It wasn't me.

192
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,560
You unfilial wretch!

193
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,960
What else do you have to say?

194
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
It wasn't me.

195
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,180
You even tried to poison
your own flesh and blood.

196
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,640
You've always called me lowborn.

197
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,450
I thought you were just
dissatisfied with me.

198
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,940
I never imagined

199
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,280
you could be so cruel.

200
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Don't listen to her nonsense.

201
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,560
You venomous woman!

202
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,760
You unfilial wretch!

203
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,140
You've disappointed me beyond measure.

204
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Father.

205
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,720
Guards!

206
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Father,

207
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,920
it's not what you think.

208
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,000
They're framing me!

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,640
Lock this unfilial wretch up

210
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,740
and place him in confinement
to reflect on his actions.

211
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,540
Without my order,

212
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,620
he is not to take a single step outside!

213
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,680
How could I possibly do such a thing?

214
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,560
Please hear me out.

215
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,200
Father!

216
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,860
Hear me out!

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Let go of me!

218
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,420
They're framing me!

219
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,520
Father!

220
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,660
They're setting me up!

221
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,580
Father!

222
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,600
Chief Steward Sun.

223
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,980
Quickly summon the imperial physician
to check on Lian.

225
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,460
Yes.

226
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,580
Father,

227
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,480
there's something

228
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,870
I need to speak with you privately.

229
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,840
You still want a divorce?

230
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,640
Years ago,

231
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,380
I fell from a cliff,

232
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,000
and you saved me.

233
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,140
Without knowing who I was,

234
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,580
you took care of me attentively.

235
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,780
I saw you were virtuous and kind,

236
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,300
and I thought you'd make
an excellent wife and mother.

237
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,980
So I deserved to marry your son?

238
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,560
What kind of talk is that?

239
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,780
Virtuous and kind,

240
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,890
excellent wife and mother—

241
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,860
if these fine qualities

242
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,660
are the source of my misfortune,

243
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,280
then I'd rather not have them.

244
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,400
Misfortune?

245
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,630
Have you really been

246
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,420
living in such pain all these years?

247
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,800
You keep saying you care about me

248
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,440
and treat me as your own daughter.

249
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,260
But if you truly care so much,

250
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,340
how could you not know
how I've been living?

251
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,800
You knew that Prince Fuying raped me
back then, didn't you?

252
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,100
I'm sure you did.

253
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
And yet you never once brought it up.

254
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,540
That was all in the past...

255
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,820
You may have moved on,

256
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,120
but I haven't.

257
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,980
But you're carrying our family's child.

258
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,920
Since when did the child in my womb

259
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,740
become yours?

260
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,420
Lian.

261
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,780
Lian,

262
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,020
when did you enter our household?

263
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,780
Father,

264
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,980
there's no one else here.

265
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
There's no need to pretend anymore.

266
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,780
You're smarter than I thought.

267
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,060
Father, you only lose your memory
at critical moments.

268
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,440
How about this?

269
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,360
Since you're pregnant,

270
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,060
I

271
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,500
won't argue with you.

272
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
As for divorce,

273
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,100
do not bring it up again.

274
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,700
And as for Prince Fuying,

275
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,380
I'll discipline him.

276
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,680
If you fear he may hurt you again,

277
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,320
I'll have him

278
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,850
confined to the Cold Palace

279
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,850
and bar him from returning to
the Eastern Palace.

280
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,720
Father,

281
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,970
I want to ask you one more question.

282
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,300
If you can answer it,

283
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,040
I'll agree to your terms.

284
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,120
But if you cannot,

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,560
you must allow me to leave.

286
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,050
Why did you castrate
my brother Song Yicheng?

287
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,500
He dared to harass Ningshuang.

288
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,820
Was I wrong to do so?

289
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,300
And if he had raped Ningshuang,

290
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,740
how would you have dealt with him, Father?

291
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,140
I'd definitely have had him
torn to pieces!

292
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,680
When your daughter is raped,

293
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,040
you tear the man to pieces;

294
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,560
but when your son rapes someone,

295
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
you make her marry him.

296
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,920
Don't you think

297
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,160
your shamelessness and hypocrisy
are no less than Prince Fuying's?

298
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,660
Tomorrow, I will leave the palace
openly and with dignity.

299
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,700
If you insist that you're in the right,

300
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,620
then have the guards come and stop me.

301
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,020
But if you still consider me
your daughter,

302
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,580
then grant me my freedom.

303
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,060
Your Grace.

304
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
You really must save me this time.

305
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,000
I can never

306
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
return to the Eastern Palace again!

307
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,380
Your Grace?

308
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,960
I have two questions for you.

309
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,360
Answer them truthfully,

310
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
and I'll let you stay.

311
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,160
Please ask away, Your Grace.

312
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
I work for Your Grace now.

313
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,560
I will tell you everything I know

314
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
without reservation.

315
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,280
Where did Prince Fuying

316
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
hide

317
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,690
Huo Xiangjiu's father?

318
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,080
I really don't know about this.

319
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,020
It probably wasn't Prince Fuying
who did it.

320
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,520
I heard Prince Fuying
talking with Lord Gongsun.

321
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,850
Prince Fuying seemed to think
it was Lord Gongsun who did it.

322
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,380
Is that truly so?

323
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,680
If I speak even a single word
of falsehood,

324
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,140
may I die a horrible death.

325
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,680
I've already offended Prince Fuying.

326
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,340
If it was really him who did it,

327
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,760
why would I cover for him?

328
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,800
The second matter.

329
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,180
Why did you steal datura
from Ningshuang Palace

330
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
to poison Princess Consort?

331
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,320
Princess Consort once had a miscarriage,

332
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,250
and datura can cause miscarriage.

333
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,960
Princess Ningshuang is the only one
in the palace who grows datura.

334
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,000
The time when datura went missing
from Ningshuang Palace

335
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,130
was close to when Princess Consort
had the miscarriage.

336
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,320
You're wronging me, Your Grace!

337
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,360
I only know

338
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,240
Princess Consort had a miscarriage.

339
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,960
How would I know about da...

340
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,260
That da-whatever?

341
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,080
My father's disappearance
has something to do with you?

342
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,600
Why are you bringing up
your father's disappearance again?

343
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,560
I really don't know anything!

344
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
She probably doesn't know anything.

345
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,720
Then what you just said...

346
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Just testing her.

347
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,520
You almost scared me to death.

348
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,940
Your Grace,

349
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,670
that was really mean of you.

350
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,460
How could you scare me
with something like that?

351
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,700
My poor heart

352
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,740
was pounding so hard that

353
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,620
it almost jumped out of my chest.

354
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,660
Your Grace.

355
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,620
How about

356
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,980
letting me

357
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,300
serve you tonight?

358
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,540
Mao Jin.

359
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,700
Take her to bathe Xiaofu.

360
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,020
Your Grace,

361
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,380
who is Xiaofu?

362
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,340
Your... Grace...

363
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,460
Jin,

364
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,100
don't drag me.

365
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,230
I can walk by myself.

366
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,860
Your Grace!

367
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,020
So

368
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,580
you've suspected all along

369
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,240
that datura was related to
Lian's miscarriage?

370
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,220
I'm not sure.

371
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,820
I only know that

372
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,260
the missing datura,

373
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,020
Princess Consort's miscarriage,

374
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,680
those two torn pages
from the Ganquan Register,

375
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,270
and your father's disappearance—

376
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,790
all these things

377
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,320
seem to be connected somehow.

378
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
There really isn't any scent of datura
in the Eastern Palace?

379
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,250
Mao Jin has checked.

380
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,980
There's definitely none.

381
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,520
It's probably been too long,

382
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,850
and the scent has faded.

383
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,280
I'll go there again tomorrow.

384
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,460
Did His Majesty agree to
Princess Consort's divorce?

385
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,360
I don't know.

386
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,160
His Majesty trusts you so much.

387
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,320
Why don't you talk to him again?

388
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,540
This doesn't concern me.

389
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,300
Feng Mochen!

390
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,480
What's wrong with you these days?

391
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,900
Why are you so cold to me?

392
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,950
I've always been like this.

393
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,440
Feng Mochen

394
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,760
has suddenly become very cold toward me.

395
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,700
All men are the same.

396
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,820
He's probably just grown tired of you

397
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,750
after being around you for so long.

398
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
Why are you sighing?

399
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,120
At worst, just find someone else.

400
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,720
Three-legged toads are hard to come by,

401
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,460
but two-legged foxes...

402
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
They aren't easy to find either.

403
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,080
Xiangjiu!

404
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,000
Le Ning?

405
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,880
Xiangjiu,

406
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,160
quick, run!

407
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,360
Your Highness,

408
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,160
let's run!

409
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,240
What happened?

410
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,740
We've fallen into a den of demons.

411
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,020
Lord Feng and Mao Jin are both demons.

412
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,520
They really are demons!

413
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,100
One is a fox,

414
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,300
and the other's a dog.

415
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,100
What, can they eat you?

416
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,710
That's quite possible.

417
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,060
Have you ever seen foxes and dogs

418
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,220
eating people?

419
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,940
I, on the other hand,

420
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,900
have seen plenty of people
eat foxes and dogs.

421
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,540
Right.

422
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,020
There are also people who eat monkeys,

423
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,060
cats,

424
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,900
and even turtles.

425
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
Stop, stop.

426
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,780
We just want to tell you that

427
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,960
some humans are scarier than them.

428
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,040
Yeah.

429
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,100
That's different.

430
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,840
They've become spirits.

431
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,820
I've become a spirit too.

432
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,670
What kind of spirit are you?

433
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,970
A beautiful spirit.

434
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,260
Your Highness,

435
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,320
at a time like this,

436
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,040
you're still joking with me?

437
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,960
Le Ning.

438
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,200
Let me ask you,

439
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,400
have they ever harmed you?

440
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,620
Well, they haven't.

441
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,680
On the contrary,

442
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,340
they've helped

443
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,340
Princess Ningshuang
and Princess Consort Song Lian.

444
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,400
That's true.

445
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,040
Why not try a different perspective?

446
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
Think about it.

447
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,500
If your friends include not just humans

448
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,220
but also demons,

449
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,820
wouldn't your life be more interesting?

450
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,400
Can I really think of it that way?

451
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,600
Of course you can.

452
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,300
As they say,

453
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,520
"a fixed mindset only leads to dead ends,

454
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,080
while a new perspective opens new paths."

455
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,280
That does make some sense.

456
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,620
Xiangjiu.

457
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,180
What's it like having a fox as a lover?

458
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,820
You should know, being with Mao Jin.

459
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
Don't talk nonsense.

460
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
Mao Jin and I are family.

461
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,960
The one I fancy

462
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,760
is Attendant Bai Yu.

463
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,960
That man is completely worthless.

464
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,480
No looks to speak of,

465
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,920
no wisdom whatsoever,

466
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,120
just a complete fool.

467
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
You little devil.

468
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,620
He's just an ordinary man.

469
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,960
Why do you fancy him?

470
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,000
I think he's quite nice.

471
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,920
That's all an illusion.

472
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,420
Compared to Mao Jin,

473
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,140
he's worlds apart.

474
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,560
Really?

475
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,960
I find him quite amusing.

476
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,620
Is that so?

477
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,400
I am a princess.

478
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,860
Princesses never lie.

479
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,660
Just set your heart on Mao Jin.

480
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,790
You won't regret it.

481
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,340
Even though you're a princess,

482
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,380
you can't dictate who others like.

483
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,400
I consider Le Ning my good friend,

484
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,530
so of course I want what's best for her.

485
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,540
Your Highness,

486
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,620
you're so kind.

487
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,780
Xiangjiu.

488
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,200
What about your situation with Lord Feng?

489
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,400
What do you plan to do?

490
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,200
I don't know.

491
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,020
Tomorrow,

492
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,080
I'll first

493
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,600
escort Song Lian out of the palace,

494
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,460
then we'll see.

495
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,380
Will it go that smoothly?

496
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,580
Life is never that smooth.

497
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,180
It's just

498
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,500
one hurdle after another,

499
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,030
but we get through them all.

500
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,760
The road ahead is long,

501
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,600
but also bright!

502
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,660
Take my sedan chair

503
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,280
to leave the palace today.

504
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,220
I'd like to see who dares to stop you.

505
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,180
Thank you for your help this time.

506
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Don't mention it.

507
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,380
Back then,

508
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,840
you helped me the same way.

509
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,530
Ningshuang,

510
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,800
thanks a lot.

511
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,980
Stop the carriage.

512
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,920
Princess Ningshuang's sedan chair

513
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,800
is leaving the palace.

514
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,400
Today,

515
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,680
without His Majesty's token,

516
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,740
no one is allowed to leave the palace.

517
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,610
Get out of my way!

518
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,980
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

519
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,640
We're just following orders.

520
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Mochen,

521
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,360
am I wrong?

522
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,600
It depends on your perspective.

523
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,240
From what perspective

524
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,480
am I not wrong?

525
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,520
A villain's.

526
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,740
You

527
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,860
always say such hurtful things.

528
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,180
How could Miss Xiangjiu tolerate this?

529
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,100
I don't talk to her like this.

530
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,500
However,

531
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,580
now I have to be.

532
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
Are you trying to

533
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,780
force me to break in?

534
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,400
If Your Highness insists on this,

535
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,530
we'll have no choice but to offend you!

536
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,480
What's the right thing to do?

537
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,800
Do you know

538
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,560
why I've stayed by your side for so long?

539
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,360
A long time ago,

540
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,890
you were once a good person.

541
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,240
Eat this, Miss.

542
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,440
Please.

543
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,560
Go ahead.

544
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,360
You know what to do.

545
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,060
Ningshuang,

546
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,300
forget it.

547
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,720
Let's go back.

548
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,660
No way.

549
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,180
We've come all this way.

550
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,860
We can't just go back like this.

551
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,840
Are you guys trying to

552
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,740
force me to get physical with you?

553
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,540
Here comes His Majesty's order!

554
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,880
Here comes His Majesty's order!

555
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,560
Here comes...

556
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,320
Here comes His Majesty's order!

557
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
Here comes His Majesty's order!

558
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,740
Let them pass!

559
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,340
Let them pass.

560
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,360
Your Highness.

561
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,680
His Majesty asked me to
deliver a message to you.

562
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,340
His Majesty instructed

563
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,670
that you need not kneel.

564
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,100
Just one sentence:

565
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,800
may the rest of your life be well.

566
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,120
With so many people seeing you off,

567
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,920
I'll bid you farewell

568
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,000
here.

569
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,260
Ningshuang.

570
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,560
Thank you.

571
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,520
Mochen.

572
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,000
You've changed.

573
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
You never liked meddling in
other people's business.

574
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,960
There's no such thing as
"other people's business."

575
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
What we call "other people's business"

576
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,960
is just trouble that hasn't
happened to us yet.

577
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,480
If you're so eager to find your father,

578
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,760
why meddle in other people's business?

579
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,720
That flower spirit

580
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,420
will soon

581
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,540
vanish into nothing.

582
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,640
Why bother doing something pointless?

583
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,880
There's no such thing as
"other people's business."

584
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,180
What we call "other people's business"

585
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,240
is just trouble that hasn't
happened to us yet.

586
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,100
How I wish

587
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,400
someone could help me too.

588
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,460
Gongsun Hao.

589
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,360
Lian!

590
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,640
Are you all right?

591
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,620
I'm fine.

592
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,060
What's this about?

593
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,500
You...

594
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,740
If you hadn't lent us a hand,
Miss Xiangjiu,

595
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,500
Lian and I

596
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,840
would never have been reunited.

597
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,680
I even

598
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,880
hurt you before.

599
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,600
I'll never forget

600
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,480
your

601
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,680
great kindness.

602
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,460
Get up quickly.

603
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,800
Please rise.

604
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,800
I missed my chance

605
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,720
once before.

606
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,920
This time,

607
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,180
I won't miss it again.

608
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,200
Lord Gongsun?

609
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,320
So you've chosen this path after all.

610
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,040
Father,

611
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,840
please grant us your blessing.

612
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
Don't call me Father!

613
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,840
I have no son like you!

614
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,360
Since you were young,

615
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,840
I've taught you

616
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,240
each generation must be
more ruthless than the last.

617
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,500
But what have you done?

618
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
For this woman,

619
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,770
you've abandoned your bright future!

620
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,900
Our ancestors

621
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,430
were farmers for generations.

622
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,960
Until your great-grandfather's generation,

623
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,460
when we moved to the city
to weave mats and sell shoes

624
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,880
so your grandfather could study.

625
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,400
Our Gongsun family

626
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,380
climbed step by step to where we are now.

627
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,820
As long as you marry Princess Ningshuang

628
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,350
and become a royal consort,

629
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,600
our Gongsun descendants

630
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
will carry royal blood.

631
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,800
We'll no longer be called

632
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,760
lowly peddlers and servants!

633
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,600
Yet you,

634
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,040
for this woman,

635
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,540
have betrayed the hard-earned achievements

636
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,360
by generations upon generations

637
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,700
of our Gongsun family!

638
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,500
Lord Gongsun,

639
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,030
do you despise your own bloodline so much?

640
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,320
Does being descended from
peddlers and servants

641
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,640
bring you such shame?

642
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,360
Silence!

643
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,200
Without your instigation,

644
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,800
he wouldn't have become like this.

645
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,900
And you, you wretched woman.

646
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,540
I warned you

647
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,780
not to seduce my son,

648
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
but you refused to listen.

649
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,440
Even after I had His Highness rape you,

650
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,240
you still wouldn't let go.

651
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,890
What are you saying?

652
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,380
So that incident

653
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,720
was your doing?

654
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,800
That's right.

655
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,020
His Highness's poisoning

656
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,780
was my doing.

657
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,980
However,

658
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,420
it was your brother

659
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,360
who brought him to your door.

660
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,140
She's the woman
your son loves most in this life.

661
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,940
How could you have brought yourself
to do this?

662
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,120
So what if she is?

663
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
She ruined our family.

664
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,900
I

665
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,300
must destroy you with my own hands.

666
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,020
Father.

667
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,200
You're not taking revenge on her.

668
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,040
You're taking revenge on me.

669
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,639
Since you want to destroy me so badly,

670
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,780
I'll grant your wish.

671
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,659
Gongsun Hao!

672
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,020
Hao!

673
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,060
Gongsun Hao!

674
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:23,820
Gongsun Hao!

675
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,280
Le Ning,

676
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,199
fetch a doctor!

677
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm on my way!

678
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,560
Gongsun Hao!

679
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,080
Hao!

680
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,659
Gongsun Hao!

681
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
I'm sorry.

682
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,400
Hao!

683
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,520
I...

684
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,900
Gongsun Hao!

685
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,159
Hao...

686
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,340
Old Fox.

687
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,400
Old Fox!

688
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,700
Slow down.

689
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,060
Old Fox!

690
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,600
Old Fox!

691
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,920
You don't think he'll eat me, do you?

692
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,600
I will.

693
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,920
Stop scaring her.

694
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,440
Lian didn't want to implicate Gongsun Hao,

695
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,480
so she returned to the palace.

696
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,180
Don't you find it strange?

697
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,340
No matter how hard

698
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,660
Princess Consort tries,

699
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,300
she always ends up back here.

700
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,780
It seems someone doesn't
want her to leave.

701
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,040
I don't understand.

702
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,380
Can you be more direct?

703
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,540
Master,

704
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,700
I found it!

705
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,680
I found it!

706
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,640
Master,

707
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,340
fortunately you sent me to search
the Eastern Palace again.

708
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,620
I really found it.

709
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,280
There's no scent left at all.

710
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,260
It seems to have withered
for quite some time.

711
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,920
Could this be the one
Princess Ningshuang lost?

712
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,460
The stem is solid.

713
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,120
It seems to have grown naturally,

714
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,140
rather than being transplanted here
when mature.

715
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,300
I thought only Ningshuang
could grow these in the palace.

716
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,560
Then who planted this?

717
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,880
If someone planted it,

718
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,880
why is no one tending to it?

719
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,870
There's another possibility.

720
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,750
Someone might have planted it
accidentally.

721
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,860
You mean

722
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,640
someone accidentally

723
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,020
dropped datura seeds here?

724
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,000
Yes.

725
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
Since it was planted accidentally,

726
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,140
even that person didn't know
flowers would grow,

727
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,710
which explains why no one
is tending to it.

728
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,740
Master,

729
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,540
there's a strange smell!

730
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,280
That's impressive.

731
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,340
My father's clothes!

732
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,590
These are my father's clothes!

733
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,120
These belong to my father!

734
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,680
Then whose is this one?

735
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,240
Gongsun Hao.

736
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,710
Who's there?

737
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,420
Hao?

738
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,700
Why are you still awake so late?

739
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,540
Especially with your injuries.

740
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,900
Lian has returned to the palace.

741
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,060
That's good.

742
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,460
From now on,

743
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,860
stay away from her completely.

744
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,580
Hao.

745
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,800
Obey my arrangements.

746
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,380
Once you control the palace guards

747
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,660
and marry Princess Ningshuang,

748
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,440
our Gongsun family

749
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,220
will rise to prominence.

750
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,260
Father, you really lack ambition.

751
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,220
Rising to prominence

752
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,340
is enough for you?

753
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,220
I want my son

754
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,200
to become the Emperor.

755
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,900
What did you just say?

756
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,580
The child Princess Consort is carrying

757
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,860
is mine.

758
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,520
You...

759
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,140
How dare you!

760
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,780
When did you become so timid, Father?

761
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,540
What you did before

762
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,420
suits my wish perfectly.

763
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,980
Father...

764
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,380
Father, how can you look at your son
like that?

765
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,300
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

766
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,780
Haven't you taught me since childhood

767
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,960
that each generation must be
more ruthless than the last?

768
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,090
Actually, I'd learned this as a child.

769
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,820
You just

770
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,120
never noticed it.

771
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,620
What's

772
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,300
your next move?

773
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Next...

774
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,480
The story continues with

775
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,640
my failed suicide attempt,

776
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,280
still pining for Lian.

777
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,280
And you, Father,

778
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,360
to break my obsession,

779
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,290
will attempt suicide to wake me up.

780
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,130
From then on,

781
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,400
kind-hearted Lian will feel
even more guilty toward me.

782
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,160
She will raise our child well,

783
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,400
who'll eventually

784
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,740
take the Emperor's throne.

785
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,240
And our Gongsun family

786
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
will reach its peak

787
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,620
in my generation.

788
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
I...

789
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,920
I'm your father!

790
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,220
You...

791
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,420
Father.

792
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,520
You are a successful father.
You taught me since childhood

793
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,720
that each generation must be
more ruthless than the last.

794
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,600
And I

795
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,680
did it.
