1
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,880
You really gave the pastries
that Prince Fuying gave you

2
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
to Huo Xiangjiu?

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
So what? Why not?

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
To trade Huo Xiangjiu's life

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,620
for your chance to escape the palace?

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,450
Those pastries weren't poisoned.

7
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,940
How can you be so sure?

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,900
Huo Xiangjiu is Lord Feng's beloved.

9
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,380
If the pastries I sent
had poisoned her to death,

10
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,700
how could Prince Fuying possibly
escape responsibility?

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,140
Prince Fuying isn't stupid.

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,800
He wouldn't dig his own grave.

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,039
Then why did he...

14
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,880
He probably wanted to test me.

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,320
I never imagined

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,490
you could see through his mind.

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,360
And there's even more you wouldn't guess.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,200
Do you know

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,820
why Huo Xiangjiu entered the palace?

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,940
I heard her mentioning this to
Princess Ningshuang.

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,270
It seems she came to
search for her father.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
If Xiangjiu knew

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,810
that her father's death
was connected to Prince Fuying,

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,200
would she ever let him off?

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,410
But with just her own strength,

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,479
how could she stand against
Prince Fuying?

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,479
How could she be alone?

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,720
Don't forget,

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,920
she has

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,920
Lord Feng backing her.

31
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,360
Take your medicine.

32
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,420
You'll feel better after some sleep.

33
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,900
I can't sleep.

34
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,640
I want to hear a story.

35
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,020
What kind of story would you like?

36
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,000
I want to hear

37
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,659
a story about cultivation.

38
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,730
Once upon a time,

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,580
a little white fox

40
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,840
was caught by a hunter.

41
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
The hunter's daughter,

42
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,280
named Qinghua,

43
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,120
had a kind heart,

44
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,360
so she set it free.

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
She even

46
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,840
got beaten by the hunter for that.

47
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,080
Don't let my father catch you!

48
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
God.

49
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,140
Poor thing.

50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,360
The little white fox was grateful,

51
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,080
so it found a cave near Qinghua's home

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,720
and settled down.

53
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,070
Qinghua loved dancing among the flowers,

54
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,220
and the little white fox
would watch from afar.

55
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,240
In order to be with her forever,

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
the little white fox sought the help
of the mountain god

57
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,260
to transform into a human.

58
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,360
But the mountain god said

59
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,200
only through cultivation
could it be possible.

60
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
Years later,

61
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,680
Qinghua got married.

62
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
Shortly after the wedding,

63
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,180
she was killed by her in-laws.

64
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,540
The little white fox
was full of frustration,

65
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,070
but all it could do was
diligently cultivate,

66
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,940
hoping to see her again.

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,800
After hundreds of years of cultivation,

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,860
it finally gained the ability
to transform into a human

69
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,820
and set out across the lands
in search of her.

70
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,100
In the end,

71
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,980
he found her.

72
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,000
But by then, Qinghua

73
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,450
had already become a formidable
female general,

74
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,630
just setting out on a campaign.

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,560
Xiangjiu!

76
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,460
What's happening?

77
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,120
Which organ spirit is acting up
inside her?

78
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,520
It's the Stomach Spirit.

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Bring her out.

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,980
Yu.

81
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,700
You're here.

82
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,460
You bastard!

83
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,840
Even Old Fox couldn't do anything to me—

84
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,240
what makes you think you can?

85
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,680
What exactly do you want?

86
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,640
To go to the underworld

87
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,000
with her.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,060
Wouldn't you dare!

89
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
Try me.

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,640
Let's talk.

91
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,380
Don't waste your effort.

92
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,180
She will

93
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,520
die for sure.

94
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,990
If she dies, you'll die too.

95
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,950
Why put yourself through this?

96
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,240
Look at my body.

97
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,420
See what she's done to it.

98
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,460
You're right.

99
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,320
This body

100
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,920
doesn't belong to her alone,

101
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,240
but it doesn't belong to you
alone, either.

102
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,780
If we summon the other organ spirits
to keep you in check,

103
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,980
what will you do then?

104
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,240
Heaven above,

105
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,720
I pray that Xiangjiu stays safe and sound.

106
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,080
As long as she remains safe,

107
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,660
I'd gladly sacrifice years of my own life.

108
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,440
Pah, pah, pah.

109
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Miss Le Ning,

110
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,580
you shouldn't make such reckless wishes.

111
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,920
I'm not being reckless.

112
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
I truly mean it.

113
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,600
All my family is gone.

114
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,460
To me,

115
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,190
Xiangjiu is my only family now.

116
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,230
As long as my family is safe,

117
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,980
even if I have to sacrifice myself,

118
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,500
it's worth it.

119
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,320
Then...

120
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,630
Then please take...

121
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Then please take years from my life,

122
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,060
Heavenly Lord.

123
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,220
Why...

124
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
Why would you say that?

125
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,540
I...

126
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,420
I also want to become

127
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,640
your family, Miss Le Ning.

128
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,720
You want to be my family too?

129
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes.

130
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,410
To be able to become your family

131
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,340
must be a truly happy thing, Miss Le Ning.

132
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,100
Mao Jin,

133
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,670
there's something I've wanted to ask you.

134
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,500
What is it?

135
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,180
Why do you treat me so well?

136
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,420
Because you

137
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,780
deserve it.

138
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,860
Yellow,

139
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,190
you should eat quickly.

140
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,940
Or, do you want me to feed you?

141
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,420
I like you so much.

142
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,100
You're just too adorable.

143
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,620
People like us

144
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,900
are nothing but stray dogs.

145
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,260
Not being tortured or beaten

146
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,680
is already a blessing.

147
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
If we meet someone who treats us kindly,

148
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,320
then it's a blessing bestowed by Heaven.

149
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,100
Miss Le Ning,

150
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,870
please allow me to become your family.

151
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,700
We are already family.

152
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,220
I've always seen you as an older brother.

153
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,660
Xiangjiu.

154
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,100
Why are all your internal organs

155
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,540
in such a sorry state?

156
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,720
Staying up late frequently,

157
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,620
eating irregularly,

158
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,540
getting angry easily—

159
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
how could I possibly be well?

160
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,580
You wretched girl,

161
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,160
always eating cold, spicy,

162
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,540
and fried stuff.

163
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,420
I used to be

164
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,140
as beautiful as a flower!

165
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,620
Look,

166
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,380
you've reduced me

167
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,700
to this condition!

168
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Why are you so dark?

169
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,320
You wretched girl,

170
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,740
how...

171
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,800
You wretched girl,

172
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,860
how dare you ask me?

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,600
Ah.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,130
You've got the nerve to criticize him?

175
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,220
Not only have you fed him
until he's fat and bloated,

176
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,210
but you also stay up all night a lot,

177
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,800
wearing him down to this sorry state.

178
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,180
Stay up all night?

179
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,040
Since my father passed away,

180
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,520
I've been helping him take care of
the poor people in Bronze County,

181
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,240
cooking meals for them.

182
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,820
I barely get any rest.

183
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,520
Where is the Heart Spirit?

184
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,320
It's the head of all organ spirits.

185
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
Why isn't it here?

186
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,400
Everything you've done—

187
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,530
she's the one who ends up
paying the price.

188
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,080
Dear organ spirits,

189
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,040
I'm truly sorry.

190
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,020
I always believed that

191
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
since I was young,

192
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,720
grave illnesses and death
were still far away from me.

193
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,440
I never imagined that

194
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,720
seemingly trivial habits in everyday life

195
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,520
could sow the seeds of disaster.

196
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
All these years,

197
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,810
I've truly put you all through so much.

198
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,480
However,

199
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,880
I don't want to die yet.

200
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,820
If I were to leave so like this,

201
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,420
I truly couldn't accept it.

202
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,440
Dear spirits,

203
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,730
starting tomorrow,

204
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,920
I'll definitely live a healthy life.

205
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,860
I hope you all

206
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,940
can give me another chance.

207
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,220
You saw with your own eyes

208
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,980
that she took the pastries inside?

209
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,780
That's right.

210
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,270
Huo Xiangjiu even ate some.

211
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,980
By the way,

212
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,570
there's one more thing.

213
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
On her way back,

214
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,360
she walked with Gongsun Hao.

215
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,680
What's so strange about that?

216
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,400
They walked one ahead of the other,

217
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
a few steps apart.

218
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,960
It's not like they don't know each other.

219
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,020
Why keep such a deliberate distance?

220
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
If you ask me,

221
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,800
they must be up to something shady,

222
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,890
which is why they were intentionally
keeping apart.

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,600
You're back so soon, Honey.

224
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,400
I chatted with her briefly.

225
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,640
I noticed she was tired,

226
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,800
so I came back.

227
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,580
Your Highness, on your way back,

228
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,820
did you meet anyone?

229
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,280
Fucang Palace and the Eastern Palace
are quite far apart.

230
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,560
How could I not meet anyone on the way?

231
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,600
I don't know

232
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
who you're referring to.

233
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,600
Lord Gongsun's son,

234
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,860
Gongsun Hao.

235
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes, I did meet him.

236
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,800
Did you talk with him?

237
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,960
I didn't.

238
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,500
Then why was he following behind you?

239
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,720
He and his father both serve His Highness.

240
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,460
Since he ran into me,

241
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,200
he escorted me to protect me.

242
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,530
What's wrong with that?

243
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,360
The palace is quite safe.

244
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,220
What's there to protect against?

245
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,180
If it's so safe,

246
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,540
why do we need guards?

247
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
Your Highness has quite
the silver tongue today.

248
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,740
It's like you've become
a different person.

249
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,800
I haven't changed.

250
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,280
I just know who I am now.

251
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,240
So who are you?

252
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,480
Princess Consort.

253
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,560
So what?

254
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,970
I'm entitled to do this.

255
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,000
Since you claim to have met me,

256
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,130
why didn't you pay your respects to me?

257
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,000
Your Highness,

258
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,380
please stand up for me!

259
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,720
She's my wife.
Isn't she entitled to discipline you?

260
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,250
Get lost!

261
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,700
Honey, you seem

262
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,080
quite angry today.

263
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,610
I was humiliated at Fucang Palace,

264
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,560
and now I have to deal with
this maid's attitude—

265
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,000
how could I not be angry?

266
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,880
Did Huo Xiangjiu upset you?

267
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,660
Not exactly.

268
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,380
It's just she asked me for a favor,

269
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,340
but it was one

270
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,080
beyond my ability.

271
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Then she made some sarcastic remarks
about me,

272
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,880
saying as the Princess Consort,

273
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,280
I'm nothing more than a female figurehead
with no real power.

274
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
What favor did she ask of you?

275
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
She made me swear

276
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,000
not to tell anyone else.

277
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,240
What is it

278
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,800
that's so mysterious?

279
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,920
Why the need for a sworn vow?

280
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,980
She wants me to help her

281
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,420
find

282
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,860
her missing father.

283
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,140
His name is

284
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,420
Huo...

285
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,260
Huo Zhongren.

286
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,980
She must be very worried.

287
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,580
It's just a pity

288
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,760
that since she ate
those poisoned pastries,

289
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,060
she likely won't live

290
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,680
to see that day.

291
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,580
You feel guilty about it, Honey?

292
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,670
She's a nice person.

293
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,980
I ended up causing her death.

294
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,700
How could I not feel guilty?

295
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,740
If you knew it would come to this,

296
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,340
why agree in the first place?

297
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,420
As the saying goes,

298
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,880
"a wife stands by her husband,

299
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,080
for better or worse."

300
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,680
From the moment I married into
the Eastern Palace,

301
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,830
Your Highness, I became yours.

302
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,360
How could I refuse anything

303
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,820
Your Highness asked of me?

304
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Honey,

305
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,900
you're like a completely
different person now.

306
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,860
You've been so kind to me, Your Highness.

307
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,040
Of course I should repay you properly.

308
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,520
You needn't feel guilty, Honey.

309
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,450
Those pastries weren't poisoned.

310
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,760
Since Your Highness has
no intention of killing her,

311
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,580
why not

312
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,280
help her find her father?

313
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,560
She misses her father dearly

314
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,290
and is searching everywhere
like a headless fly.

315
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If she gets deceived

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,920
or goes in the wrong direction,

317
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
wouldn't all her efforts be in vain?

318
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,400
If Your Highness

319
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,360
could lend a hand

320
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,420
and point her in the right direction,

321
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,280
you could

322
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,480
help her

323
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,880
reunite with her father,

324
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,520
and at the same time

325
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,880
earn a favor from Lord Feng.

326
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,680
Wouldn't that be killing two birds
with one stone?

327
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,880
If Father were to learn that

328
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Your Highness had done such a thing,

329
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,810
he'd surely praise you
for your benevolence.

330
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,500
I will consider it.

331
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,820
I promised I'd take you

332
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,140
out of the palace for two days
to have some fun.

333
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,940
Honey,

334
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,360
where would you like to go?

335
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,020
That won't be necessary.

336
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,540
Right now, I still find this place

337
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,000
the most fun.

338
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,520
Since I caused a scene at Fucang Palace
last month,

339
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,580
Father already knows

340
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,860
Huo Xiangjiu and I don't get along.

341
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,020
If she dies now,

342
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,660
I'll be the prime suspect.

343
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,560
Even so,

344
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,940
there's no need to help her.

345
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,040
What if it's traced back to us?

346
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,440
If she's to investigate on her own,

347
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,570
she'll definitely trace it back to us.

348
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,560
But if we help her investigate

349
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,540
and send her chasing
in the opposite direction,

350
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,460
she'll only get further from the truth

351
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,120
and eventually hit a dead end,

352
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,540
from which she'll never escape.

353
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Your Highness is so clever.

354
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,660
That's indeed a good plan.

355
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,640
Getting involved in this mess
for no reason.

356
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,960
We didn't kill her father,

357
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,820
yet we have to go through all this trouble
to lead her in circles.

358
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,150
What concerns me is that

359
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
it might really have been one of our men
who killed him.

360
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Your Highness,

361
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,760
are you suspecting me?

362
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,740
Whether I am or not

363
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,920
doesn't matter.

364
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,340
As long as I'm not implicated.

365
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,620
Since she wants to find her father,

366
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,880
Lord Gongsun,

367
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,100
please arrange a father for her.

368
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,060
It's all my fault for being useless.

369
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,540
Father has been missing for so long,

370
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,540
and I've gotten myself sick as well.

371
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,280
You've done very well.

372
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,480
If it weren't for your persistence,

373
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,200
Qiaoru

374
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,860
would have left with regrets,

375
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,130
Princess Ningshuang and Old Madam

376
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,760
wouldn't have reunited
as mother and daughter,

377
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,420
and the maids from
the Imperial Servants Bureau

378
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,880
wouldn't have received what they deserved.

379
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,640
Besides,

380
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,440
Lady Zhao's position

381
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,170
has been filled by someone new.

382
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,280
The overdue wages

383
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,360
have all been paid back to the maids.

384
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,820
No one will make them
work overtime anymore.

385
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,040
Now

386
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,370
there's only my father's situation left.

387
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Where do you think

388
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,540
my father could be right now?

389
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,240
Master.

390
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,780
Have you found the dogs I asked you
to look for outside the palace?

391
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,220
I was just about to tell you about this.

392
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,140
All 20 dogs

393
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,160
have been brought in the palace

394
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,560
and assigned positions.

395
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,440
I've also let them smell
the datura flowers.

396
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,660
Lord Howling Celestial Dog
is watching from above.

397
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Please rest assured, Master.

398
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,500
I will handle this matter

399
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,340
perfectly.

400
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,120
Working inside the palace

401
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
is different from outside.

402
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,580
You must be extra careful.

403
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,400
Go on.

404
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,040
Yes.

405
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,420
I'm leaving.

406
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,140
No need to see me out.

407
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,740
You can set your mind at ease now.

408
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,700
Focus on getting well first.

409
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,980
Only then will your father be happy

410
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,940
when he sees you.

411
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,500
Why did you ask Prince Fuying

412
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,700
to help Huo Xiangjiu?

413
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,760
Now that Prince Fuying has a way
to mislead Xiangjiu,

414
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,600
he won't feel the need to kill her,

415
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
so she'll be safe.

416
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,960
But if she finds out

417
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,280
that her father's disappearance

418
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
is connected to Prince Fuying,

419
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,770
wouldn't that put her in danger again?

420
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,520
If her father's disappearance

421
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,320
is truly connected to Prince Fuying

422
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,050
and she knows nothing about it,

423
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,040
then Prince Fuying
operates from the shadows

424
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,570
while she remains exposed.

425
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,320
If she knows her father's disappearance
is connected to Prince Fuying

426
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,580
but Prince Fuying

427
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,560
doesn't know she knows,

428
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,040
then she operates from the shadows

429
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,960
while Prince Fuying remains exposed.

430
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,420
The exposed are in danger,

431
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,730
while the ones in the shadows are safe.

432
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,500
Lian.

433
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,800
You're playing with fire.

434
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,320
Come with me.

435
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,380
Let's leave this place together.

436
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,560
Unless Prince Fuying falls,

437
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,920
we'll never have peace.

438
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,120
No matter where we flee,

439
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,600
he'll never let us go,

440
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,440
nor will he spare our families.

441
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,560
But have you considered

442
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,400
what would happen
if Prince Fuying finds out

443
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,100
you're the one who told Huo Xiangjiu
about her father's disappearance?

444
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,360
What would he do to you?

445
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,240
You're right.

446
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,480
This kind of information

447
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,320
obviously can't come from me directly.

448
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,060
What do you want?

449
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,640
Why have you captured me again?

450
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Today,

451
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,580
what kind of joke will you tell me?

452
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,490
Why should I tell Your Highness jokes?

453
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,600
Because

454
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,740
I'm a princess,

455
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,280
and you're

456
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,000
a servant.

457
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,140
That's right.

458
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,220
You're a princess,

459
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,220
and I'm a servant.

460
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,510
It seems our fates were determined
from the moment we were born.

461
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,380
Someone like you—pampered from birth,

462
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,380
living in luxury,

463
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,820
utterly detached from real life—

464
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,620
how could you ever  understand
others' hardships?

465
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,550
What are you talking about?

466
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,840
Have you heard of swifts, Your Highness?

467
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,280
It's a very peculiar kind of bird.

468
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,660
It spends its entire life flying,

469
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,740
until it dies.

470
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,580
Just like people like us.

471
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,540
From the moment we're born,

472
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,600
we never stop struggling to survive,

473
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,060
doing dirty, exhausting work,

474
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,500
earning pitiful wages,

475
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,500
and still being mocked by
privileged people like you.

476
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,670
This kind of life

477
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,660
goes on endlessly,

478
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,600
until the end of our lives.

479
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,180
Bai Yu,

480
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,010
what's going on with you today?

481
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,880
Xiangjiu...

482
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,760
Xiangjiu fell seriously ill.

483
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,340
Mentor.

484
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,490
