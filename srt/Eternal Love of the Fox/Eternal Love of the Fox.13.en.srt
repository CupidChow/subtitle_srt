1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,620
Last night,

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,120
Princess Consort had many drinks
at Princess Ningshuang's place,

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,460
and got in a fight with the Crown Prince
till late at night.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,660
His Highness is still asleep now.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,640
I have an urgent report to give.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,440
Attendant Gao, may I trouble you

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,140
to wake His Highness up?

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,360
Lord Gongsun,

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,300
are you trying to get me in trouble?

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,800
You know His Highness goes livid
when he's awakened from sound sleep.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,520
This is a pressing emergency

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,650
that concerns His Highness's safety.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
If something goes wrong,

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,440
can you bear the consequences?

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,640
Is it that serious?

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,300
Listen,

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
it's about Huo Xiangjiu. She...

18
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,980
You wait here.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,460
Your Highness,

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,940
has His Highness got up yet?

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,670
I have an urgent report to give.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,960
You need to wait till he wakes up.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,520
All will be too late by then!

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,740
Out of my way!

25
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,140
Why are you so annoying?

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,960
Your Highness?

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,600
Your Highness.

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,880
Your Highness?

29
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,820
That gave me quite a fright,

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,520
Your Highness.

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,759
What's the matter now?

32
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,320
Your Highness,

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,920
I have an important issue to report.

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
What's so urgent

35
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,700
that you must tell me before I get up?

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,960
Lord Gongsun has found out

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,039
that Huo Xiangjiu is the daughter
of Huo Zhongren,

38
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,080
the registrar of the Bronze County.

39
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,220
Have you had

40
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,740
enough of hangovers yet?

41
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,760
What does this have to do with hangovers?

42
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,080
You never eat on time

43
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
or have regular meals.

44
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,320
How can it not affect your health?

45
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,840
I'm so young.
What could possibly happen to me?

46
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,940
Besides,

47
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,340
even if I get sick,

48
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,120
I'll be healed by you, right?

49
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,240
Just now,

50
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,330
you simply held my hands like this,

51
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,220
and I immediately got well.

52
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,580
Don't underestimate
the power of handholding.

53
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,900
Hands connect to one's energy base.

54
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,830
The five fingers

55
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,800
correspond to the Five Elements.

56
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,920
Two people's interlaced fingers

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
forge the union of the Five Elements
in them.

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,780
When that happens,

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,260
renewed vigor arises.

60
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,760
Nonsense.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,160
Isn't the compatibility

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,920
of two people's Five Elements

63
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,360
decided by their birth charts?

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
Regardless of birth charts,

65
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
once two people's fingers interlock,

66
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,410
the Five Elements in them just harmonize.

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,840
Does handholding...

68
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
really have that much power?

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
Of course.

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,730
When hands are held,

71
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,920
many things can be achieved.

72
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,640
What kinds of things?

73
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,420
A large number

74
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,340
of things.

75
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,659
Mom,

76
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,620
since I'm a nine-tailed fox,

77
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,659
I will

78
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,760
certainly marry foxes in the future.

79
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,460
These are all your daughters-in-law.

80
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,300
They'll give birth to many little foxes

81
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,880
as your grandchildren.

82
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,520
Anything wrong?

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,440
You pervert!

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,680
What was that about?

85
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,920
How terrifying!

86
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,960
Why would I have that kind of thought?

87
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,960
Le Ning?

88
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,080
Who upset you?

89
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,220
Where are you going?

90
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,780
Your Highness,

91
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,159
what can I do for you?

92
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,080
You took advantage of me.

93
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
You think you can just walk away?

94
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,980
Your Highness

95
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,160
must be mistaken.

96
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,340
I'm a eunuch. How...

97
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,470
You're not a eunuch.

98
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,100
No, no, no.

99
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,640
I couldn't have done anything to her.

100
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,500
Your Highness,

101
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,960
although...

102
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,440
we are disheveled,

103
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,480
at least we're still dressed.

104
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,760
Obviously, nothing happened between us.

105
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,980
Even though we didn't do anything sexual,

106
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,700
we did lie in the same bed

107
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,110
and have physical contact, right?

108
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,720
On top of that,

109
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
you're not castrated, which means

110
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,260
you gained entry to the palace
through deceit.

111
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,460
That adds to the gravity of your crimes.

112
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,220
Now,

113
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,140
there are two options for you.

114
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
One

115
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
is death.

116
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,300
The other one...

117
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,140
I choose

118
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,470
to go for a third option.

119
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,180
Then your life

120
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
will be in my hands.

121
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,740
From now on,

122
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,620
you must obey me.

123
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,880
If I tell you to go east,

124
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,120
you can't go west.

125
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,840
If I ask you to drink,

126
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,170
you can't do otherwise.

127
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,000
All those...

128
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,480
sound like slim pickings.

129
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Can Your Highness

130
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,480
give me some leeway?

131
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
This is as good as you can get.

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,400
What more can you ask for?

133
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,940
Your Highness,

134
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,380
I helped with the reconciliation

135
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,240
between you and Old Madam.

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,800
Given my contribution,
slight though it was, can we both

137
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
make a small compromise?

138
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
What compromise?

139
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,260
Let's pretend nothing happened.

140
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,120
You call that a small compromise?

141
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,340
Your Highness,

142
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,120
countless people would love
to do your bidding.

143
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,380
Why must you choose me?

144
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,280
Because you're fair-skinned.

145
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,080
What?

146
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
No more crap.

147
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,980
Which option will you choose?

148
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,600
If you choose the first one,

149
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I'll have Xiangjiu collect your dead body
right away.

150
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,400
What a vicious woman!

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,760
Such a crafty devil!

152
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,040
This vixen has me in her clutches now.

153
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,770
I'll definitely suffer badly.

154
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,620
Xiangjiu is on good terms
with the princess.

155
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,130
I should ask her to put in a good word
for me.

156
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,000
Right.

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,940
I should talk to Xiangjiu.

158
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,940
Master,

159
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,900
I saw Huo Xiangjiu

160
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,660
run away like crazy.

161
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,860
What did you do to her?

162
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,760
What could I have done to her?

163
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,240
Who knows what you did to her?

164
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,660
Master!

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,930
I plan to bring in

166
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,040
some reliable dogs
from outside the palace,

167
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
make them smell datura, and have them

168
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,170
conduct a search with us in the palace.

169
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,000
It'll speed up our investigation.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
At the moment,

171
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,880
there's a trickier task

172
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,220
than finding Xiangjiu's father.

173
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,200
What is it?

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,200
Last night,

175
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,960
I saw the Stomach Spirit.

176
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,160
You stay away from her.

177
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,980
Feng Mochen,

178
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,340
I bet you know

179
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,460
I'm not afraid of you.

180
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,960
The Stomach Spirit?

181
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,440
Why would she show up?

182
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,060
Is she going after Huo Xiangjiu?

183
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,560
Yes.

184
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,500
Her target is exactly Xiangjiu.

185
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,060
Oh my!

186
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,790
T-T-This...

187
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,800
is

188
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,760
terrible news.

189
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,320
The Stomach Spirit never appears
without cause.

190
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,780
Now that she's out on a hunt,
Huo Xiangjiu...

191
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
will be in danger.

192
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,020
Is the information accurate?

193
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,720
Yes, without a doubt.

194
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,820
No wonder Huo Xiangjiu
always meddles in others' affairs.

195
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,860
It turns out she takes from her father.

196
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,400
Look, my son

197
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,860
simply seized some houses

198
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,200
and abducted a few women

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,880
in the Bronze County.

200
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,200
He didn't lay a hand on

201
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,820
Huo Zhongren's house or his daughter.

202
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,420
Why did he have to intervene?

203
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,240
He was just going out of his way
to cause us trouble.

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,520
What a hateful man.

205
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,260
You shouldn't have fooled around
with women

206
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,730
before entering the royal palace.

207
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,420
Your Highness,

208
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,000
that's just what men do.

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,880
There would be

210
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,010
no opportunity for that in the palace.

211
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,500
Besides,

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,900
that son of mine...

213
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,600
How many sons do you have?

214
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,940
Everyone has a past.

215
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,100
That son of mine

216
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,580
has been diligent in his duty

217
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,720
to rake in money

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,900
for Your Highness

219
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,220
and Lord Gongsun,

220
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,940
hasn't he?

221
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,100
All the gold and silver he's got

222
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,220
have been spent

223
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,620
on currying favor with officials
to fight the other princes.

224
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,940
He hasn't kept a dime for himself!

225
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,260
Huo Xiangjiu came to the palace
with the purpose

226
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,000
of finding her son...

227
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,020
You interrupted my train of thought.

228
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,800
She's looking for her father

229
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,240
Huo Zhongren, who vanished into thin air

230
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,080
right after infiltrating the palace.

231
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,880
Lord Gongsun,

232
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,120
did you do something to...

233
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,380
Attendant Gao, watch your mouth.

234
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,380
Although Huo Zhongren is a minor official,

235
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,040
he was appointed to his job by the court.

236
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,520
How would I dare to kill him at will?

237
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,280
Lord Gongsun.

238
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,840
If my father were dead,

239
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,980
I wouldn't hesitate
to eliminate my opponents

240
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,780
and stain the palace with blood.

241
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,040
But my father is still alive now.

242
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,700
I have no choice but

243
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,630
to submit myself to many a constraint.

244
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,900
How very odd.

245
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,960
Neither did Your Highness

246
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
nor Lord Gongsun kill Huo Zhongren.

247
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
Why is he, or a trace of him,

248
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,460
nowhere to be found

249
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,940
in the palace at all?

250
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,580
In fact, compared to Huo Zhongren,
Huo Xiangjiu is a bigger threat to us now.

251
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,360
If she ever finds out

252
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,460
your son's connection to us,

253
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,460
she will surely blame us

254
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,440
for Huo Zhongren's disappearance.

255
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,400
What's worse, Lord Feng has her back now.

256
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
Even Princess Ningshuang

257
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
has become close friends with her.

258
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,620
We'll be in for a real disaster.

259
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,760
In the beginning,

260
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,980
I meant to get Huo Xiangjiu to our side.

261
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,500
But now it seems

262
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,220
we have to silence her forever.

263
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,020
But she's always with Lord Feng.

264
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,980
I'm afraid it's not that easy

265
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,860
to get rid of her for good.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,920
Killing

267
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,600
becomes effortless

268
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,280
with the right weapon.

269
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,740
Your Highness sounds very confident.

270
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,700
Has

271
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,020
the right weapon been found yet?

272
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Princess Consort

273
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,540
had a drinking party with Feng Mochen,

274
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,800
Huo Xiangjiu, and others
at Ningshuang Palace last night.

275
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,740
This proves

276
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,380
she has gained trust from those people.

277
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,440
And trust...

278
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,200
is the best weapon of all.

279
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,240
Come on, piggy.

280
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,170
Have some melon.

281
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Look how much my baby is enjoying it.

282
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,240
Red Dragon,

283
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,600
this is

284
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,520
your salary for this month.

285
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,620
Lady Zhao,

286
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,350
why is it only 2 tales of silver?

287
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,620
You were late for roll call
3 times this month.

288
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,140
I was only late for 3 days.

289
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,540
How could you deduct 3 taels
from my salary?

290
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,960
You can't take out your frustration on me
for being punished

291
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,280
by Lord Feng and the Crown Prince.

292
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,600
Cut that nonsense!

293
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,880
Only 2 taels of silver for you.

294
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Take it or leave it.

295
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,680
Go away if you don't want it.

296
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,480
Next!

297
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,320
I'll take it.

298
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,280
Piggy, come on.

299
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,210
Have some melon.

300
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,020
The Mentor of Virtue,
Compassion, Benevolence, Rectitude,

301
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,620
Harmony, Wellness, Nurturance, Felicity,

302
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,100
Illumination, Preparedness,
Solemnity, Humanity,

303
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,340
Reverence, Admiration, Dedication,
and Nobility

304
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,860
has arrived.

305
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,580
It's the Mentor.

306
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,620
One Bam?

307
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,900
Greetings, Mentor.

308
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,640
Greetings, Mentor.

309
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,120
Step aside.

310
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,620
Mentor,

311
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,060
you've risen to prominence now.

312
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,339
You've not only gained Lord Feng's favor,

313
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,319
but also

314
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,660
fraternized with the overweening

315
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,099
Princess Ningshuang.

316
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I heard that you had

317
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
a drinking party with Princess Consort

318
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
last night.

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,119
I said before

320
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,760
that clearly,

321
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,880
you had the look of someone

322
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,240
bound for wealth and prosperity,

323
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,220
and that you would succeed
sooner or later.

324
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,420
I was right, wasn't I?

325
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,960
Enough!

326
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
Knock it off.

327
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,280
Last month,

328
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,780
I worked here for 15 days.

329
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,780
Shouldn't I be paid for that?

330
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,780
Yes, of course.

331
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,060
I heard...

332
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,120
you boldly withheld Le Ning's salary.
Was that so?

333
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,720
Mentor,

334
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,600
you got it wrong.

335
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,160
It wasn't like that.

336
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,600
I just made a calculation error

337
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,200
back then.

338
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,370
Here you are.

339
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,020
Your salary, 5 taels of silver.

340
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,350
They're yours, Mentor.

341
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
Mentor...

342
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,680
Oh, right.

343
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,440
Mentor,

344
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,480
Le Ning is a good friend of yours.

345
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,400
These are for Le Ning.

346
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,080
Le Ning, come here!

347
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,680
Take them.

348
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,000
Thank you, Lady Zhao.

349
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,120
That's not right,

350
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,760
Lady Zhao.

351
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,880
Mentor got full pay for finishing
half a month's work.

352
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,980
I was only late for 3 days,

353
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,440
yet more than half of my salary
was deducted.

354
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,400
How dare you compare yourself with Mentor?

355
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,530
Do you think I'm abusing my power here?

356
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,740
I've always been
a fair and just administrator.

357
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,240
Mentor did 2 maids' work

358
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,220
when she worked here.

359
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,880
The salaries

360
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,940
for 2 people working 15 days

361
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,060
amount to 5 taels, and 30 days to 10.

362
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,340
Mentor spent 15 days working here,

363
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
so her pay is 5 taels.

364
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,460
Aren't I being fair?

365
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,340
Aren't I?

366
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,520
Lady Zhao!

367
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,840
Come with me.

368
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,080
Yes.

369
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,580
Move!

370
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,460
Shut up!

371
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,240
Don't you speak ill of my good friend.

372
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,300
The two of us are...

373
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,840
-kindred spirits.
-Kindred spirits.

374
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,640
Crazy dog.

375
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,660
Where is Xiangjiu?

376
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,520
She's not here.

377
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,860
Where has she gone?

378
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,150
How would I know?

379
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,850
Why does she have to run around?

380
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,160
You really are

381
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,880
shameless and despicable.

382
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,560
How can you drool over another woman
when you're already with one?

383
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,220
What kind of nonsense is that?

384
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,420
I didn't share a bed
with Princess Ningshuang.

385
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,940
I meant Xiangjiu and Le Ning.

386
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,970
Why is Princess Ningshuang
involved?

387
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,960
She's not.

388
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,640
The princess is by no means involved.

389
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,040
Oh.

390
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,680
Besides,

391
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,340
how is Le Ning part of this now?

392
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440
Le Ning has a crush on you.

393
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,220
Don't tell me you didn't know.

394
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,720
What does she have to do with me?

395
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm not into her.

396
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,170
You're not into Le Ning?

397
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,780
Are you insane or what?

398
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
Le Ning is wonderful.
Why don't you like her?

399
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
Do you mean those who aren't into Le Ning
are all insane?

400
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,600
Then are you insane?

401
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,740
Of course I'm not.

402
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,220
So you're into her?

403
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,600
A dog's love

404
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,240
is different from a human's.

405
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,160
The notion of love in the human world

406
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,360
is far too narrow.

407
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,080
Then tell me

408
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,250
what's so great
about your way of loving someone.

409
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,490
When I love someone,

410
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
I devote my all
and ask for nothing in return.

411
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,140
As long as my loved one is happy,

412
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,420
I am happy.

413
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,540
As long as my loved one is fine,

414
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,520
I am fine.

415
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
It's just like how I treat my master.

416
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,840
That's how dogs show  affection.

417
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,600
Of course!

418
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,680
Can humans do that at all?

419
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,760
You lose your mind

420
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,560
when you see a pretty face.

421
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,340
You're easily swayed

422
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,860
when you see money or beauties.

423
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,700
You humans can never

424
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,430
resist any kind of temptation.

425
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,900
You're biased.

426
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,270
Give me an objective view then.

427
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,680
I can't speak for others,

428
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,090
but at least I'm sure

429
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,580
Xiangjiu is nothing like what you said.

430
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,960
She is...

431
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
a real accentric.

432
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,600
She is a very nice person.

433
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,140
There are too many bad people.

434
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,460
So good people seem like eccentrics.

435
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,400
Where on earth has Xiangjiu gone?

436
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,360
How am I supposed to know?

437
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,490
How can you not know?

438
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,440
She and Master didn't even come back
last night.

439
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,300
How would I know where she's gone?

440
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,900
The two of them were out all night?

441
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,480
It had happened before.

442
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,240
It had happened before?

443
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,970
How many times has it occurred?

444
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,240
During all the time I stayed here,

445
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,000
I not only worked diligently,

446
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,320
but also often took on extra workload

447
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,680
after working hours.

448
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,240
Even so,

449
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,570
never did we receive our salaries in full.

450
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,140
But now,

451
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,740
you've given me a whole month's salary

452
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,920
for working for only 15 days here.

453
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,480
I get it.

454
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,200
I really do.

455
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,500
I'll make up for your pay

456
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,430
that was docked.

457
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,160
Oh, right.

458
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,760
Le Ning will have her deducted salary back

459
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,080
as well.

460
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,880
Really?

461
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,680
Really.

462
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,880
I always keep my word.

463
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,060
Xiangjiu,

464
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,620
that's quite a fortune.

465
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,740
We'll be rich.

466
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,540
What about

467
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,540
the other maids treated unfairly by you?

468
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,500
How amusing.

469
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,220
They're just a bunch of servants.

470
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,680
Why should I pay them back?

471
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,820
Lady Zhao is way out of line!

472
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,460
How could she do this?

473
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,740
We've been running around
at her beck and call,

474
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,260
yet she repays us with malice!

475
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

476
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,100
What an outrage.

477
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,760
How can she treat us like this?

478
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,820
Of all people,
why do you compensate us only?

479
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,140
Mentor,

480
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,620
you know

481
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,200
the answer, don't you?

482
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,020
Don't you see you're of high status now?

483
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,680
I will let

484
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,220
your and Le Ning's names stay

485
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,800
on the payroll
of the Imperial Servants Bureau.

486
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,360
But you don't need to work here at all.

487
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,440
I'll still pay you

488
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,720
your full salaries

489
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,400
on time every month.

490
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,240
I'm a real friend

491
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
to you, aren't I?

492
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
What a great idea.

493
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,960
Xiangjiu,

494
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,160
we'll get paid without working.

495
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,400
Where else
could we get such a good bargain?

496
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,900
Be quiet.

497
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,500
A bargain indeed.

498
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,320
Lady Zhao,

499
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,760
is this how you manage
the Imperial Servants Bureau?

500
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,560
Mentor,

501
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,640
many others do the same thing.

502
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,680
I don't care
how other institutes are managed,

503
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,080
but things in this bureau

504
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,040
must change!

505
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,600
What do you mean?

506
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,730
Here's my decision.

507
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,340
You must

508
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,620
return all the wages
you withheld from everyone.

509
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
From now on,

510
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
pay what's due,

511
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,400
not a penny less.

512
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,190
Arbitrary deductions are forbidden.

513
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Also, you must not

514
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,660
impose

515
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,060
extra

516
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,520
workload

517
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,160
without reason!

518
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,680
Huo Xiangjiu!

519
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,400
What?

520
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,020
You've only been in the powerful's
good graces for a few days.

521
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,580
You think you're a big shot now?

522
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,880
You got where you are today

523
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,600
by seducing Lord Feng

524
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
and sleeping with him, didn't you?

525
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,540
That's ridiculous!

526
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,400
You wretched woman!

527
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,300
Even my mother has never hit me!

528
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,780
They're fighting in there.

529
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,340
We have to do something, right?

530
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,300
Yeah.

531
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,030
Of course we must do something.

532
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,260
Let's go!

533
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,180
-Go!
-Go!

534
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,840
Let go of Xiangjiu!

535
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,480
Lady Zhao will pay us what she owes us.

536
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,240
We'll also receive salaries every month

537
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,560
from now on without working.

538
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,880
Isn't it nice?

539
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,060
What about the others?

540
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,120
How can just sit back and watch Lady Zhao

541
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,100
withhold the other maids' salaries?

542
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,660
But Lady Zhao is offering us money
with no strings attached.

543
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,100
However, one day,

544
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,040
we'll pay a steep price

545
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,500
for accepting this money.

546
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,020
That said,

547
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,700
won't it be a waste

548
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,660
of your current position

549
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,520
if you don't take advantage of it?

550
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,760
How about

551
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,020
we help all those maids to get back

552
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,800
their deducted salaries

553
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,860
and strive for

554
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,980
the rest time they deserve?

555
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,340
Think about it.

556
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,240
Seeking benefits for a group

557
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,640
versus for oneself only—

558
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,360
which holds more worth?

559
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,580
I can't beat you in this argument.

560
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,140
Anyway, I don't think it's wrong
to gain as many benefits

561
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,760
as possible for ourselves, as long as

562
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,220
we're not harming others.

563
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,500
When you bend the rules for profit,

564
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,540
you're already damaging
the interests of others.

565
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,200
Fairness should be upheld
not just to protect

566
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,080
ourselves, but everyone.

567
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,500
You may subvert fairness for personal gain
now.

568
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,880
But you will finally wind up

569
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,210
being a victim yourself
when some others do the same one day.

570
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
Xiangjiu!

571
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,260
W-What

572
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,390
is going on with you?

573
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,180
I apologize. Alright?

574
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,340
Xiangjiu.

575
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,040
Xiangjiu!

576
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,380
Honey,

577
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,280
I see you're in a good mood.

578
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,460
Are you still mad at me

579
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,980
for what I did last night?

580
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,360
Lovers' quarrels are soon mended.

581
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,020
There's nothing to hold a grudge over.

582
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,220
You're a man of great talent and vision.

583
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,020
As your wife,

584
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,780
how can I let you be distracted

585
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,440
by a trivial matter like that?

586
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,260
As the saying goes,

587
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,900
a united couple

588
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,140
is invincible.

589
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,480
It seems last night's beating

590
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,320
has really worked.

591
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,560
It has worked quite well.

592
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,960
I heard

593
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
your good friend fell ill.

594
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,040
Why don't you pay a visit to her?

595
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,600
Just an innocent visit?

596
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,260
Put it here.

597
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,700
Go and have some rest.

598
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,390
I will take good care of her.

599
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,520
Xiangjiu,

600
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,220
get some good rest.

601
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,750
I'll visit you again later.

602
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,520
From today on,

603
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,340
you need to take medicine on time
every day.

604
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,500
You'll have 3 meals a day,

605
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,630
following the diet I designed for you.

606
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,220
You must go to bed before 9 p.m.
every night.

607
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,180
Also,

608
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,540
do not overeat.

609
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
Do not get angry.

610
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,480
Do not get sad.

611
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,140
Then

612
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,180
what's the point of living?

613
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,420
Observing my instructions

614
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,520
is your only choice.

615
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,400
Why?

616
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,000
You're in trouble now—

617
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,420
a prominent life threat.

618
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,180
W-Why does she look exactly like me?

619
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,060
She

620
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,640
is the Stomach Spirit.

621
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,900
Why is she in this condition?

622
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,630
Do you remember what I told you?

623
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,040
Flowers can become spirits?

624
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,900
That kind of potential lies in everything.

625
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,420
She

626
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,800
is your stomach.

627
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,040
My... what?

628
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,640
Your own stomach.

629
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,040
Now,

630
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,780
I'm already failing.

631
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,880
The moment I shut down

632
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,300
will be the moment

633
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,260
your life ends.
