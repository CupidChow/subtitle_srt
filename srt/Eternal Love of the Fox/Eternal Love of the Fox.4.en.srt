1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,200
Your Grace, you've honored
my Ningshuang Palace with your presence.

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,320
What is it for?

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,960
Well...

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,200
You...

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,000
I...

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,860
I happened

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,960
to be passing by.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,200
Your Grace, are you trying to seduce

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,320
Madam Chen?

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
Princess Ningshuang,
you have quite a sense of humor.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
I'll take my leave now.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,000
It's you!

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,130
What did you say?

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
Nothing.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,240
Goodbye.

16
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Don't move!

17
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,700
Well, One Bam,

18
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,960
now that you've caught
Attendant Bai's favor,

19
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
I wouldn't dare to treat you poorly.

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
So many!

21
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
These

22
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
are for you.

23
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,960
I don't like eating these things.

24
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Do you have chicken?

25
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,360
Either drumsticks or chicken wings

26
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
will do.

27
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,580
Finish these buckets,

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and you'll get everything you want.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
Buckets?

30
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,280
Who could possibly eat buckets?

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
What I mean is

32
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,579
that you should finish
these chili peppers.

33
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,209
I don't like eating chili peppers.

34
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
Pure Suit, Triple Dragons,

35
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,840
make sure One Bam eats her peppers!

36
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

37
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,360
I've said

38
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,800
I don't like eating chili...

39
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,130
Will you eat them or not?

40
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,440
Lady Zhao,

41
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
please stop hitting Xiangjiu.

42
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,820
I'll eat those for her.

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
This is none of your business!

44
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,159
You're a Sichuan girl.

45
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,600
Making you eat peppers
is practically doing you a favor!

46
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,440
Get lost!

47
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,340
Boss,

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,040
let me try talking to her.

49
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,640
Xiangjiu,

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
if you don't want to eat them,
just apologize to Lady Zhao.

51
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,080
Come here.

52
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
Just apologize to Lady Zhao.

53
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,300
I'll take you to the Imperial Kitchen
for some delicacies later.

54
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Guard Mao, who's by His Grace's side,
sent me to taste dishes for His Grace.

55
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,640
I can eat any dish

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,570
prepared for His Grace as I please.

57
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,130
Aren't you afraid
of getting caught by His Grace?

58
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,520
There's nothing to be afraid of.

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,100
I'd venture to guess

60
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,840
that His Grace must be an idiot.

61
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,290
Will you eat them or not?

62
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,409
What are you dawdling here for?

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,800
Someone come here!

64
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,180
Lady Zhao.

65
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,640
Take her away!

66
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Please let me eat them for Xiangjiu.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,320
Both of you, let me go!

68
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,200
Will you eat them or not?

69
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,280
Eat!

70
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,080
Take more!

71
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,180
There's no way
you can survive these chili peppers!

72
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,980
Eat!

73
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,280
That's it.

74
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,950
This is the exact scent.

75
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,700
It's the same as the one
on Princess Ningshuang.

76
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,880
Why did she tear out these two pages?

77
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,180
Since she did it in secret,

78
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,100
asking her directly

79
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,630
would only make her deny it.

80
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,460
Is there a spell
that could make her tell the truth?

81
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,760
I'll go find the Old Fox.

82
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,090
He'll surely have a way.

83
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,640
Just walking over there like this

84
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,100
is not impressive enough.

85
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,500
I've got it!

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
What's going on?

87
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,120
The Old Fox said I need to focus my mind
when casting spells.

88
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll give it a try.

89
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I'll teach you a lesson,

90
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,760
One Bam!

91
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,860
Eat!

92
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
Hurry up!

93
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,299
What...

94
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,179
What is it?

95
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,170
Which bastard dares...

96
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,540
Your Grace.

97
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,180
Your Grace, spare me!

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,080
Your Grace.

99
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,880
Your Grace.

100
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,180
Your Grace, spare me!

101
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,500
My mouth!

102
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,900
Who did this?

103
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,110
Triple Dragons,

104
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,950
should we go break up the fight?

105
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,780
That's Lord Feng!

106
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,020
But Lady Zhao is our supervisor,
after all.

107
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,300
It doesn't seem right

108
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,030
to just stand by and do nothing.

109
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,380
That's true.

110
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,700
Then...

111
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,080
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!

112
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,560
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!

113
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,700
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!

114
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,700
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!
-Your Grace, please don't be angry!

115
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,260
I was such a beauty.

116
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,300
Look what you've done to my face!

117
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,180
Don't touch me!

118
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,980
This is my body!

119
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,220
Why can't I touch it?

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,780
It hurts.

121
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,900
Okay, okay.

122
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,440
I won't touch you.

123
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,460
Let me tell you something important.

124
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,540
I've found out

125
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,060
that the scent on Princess Ningshuang

126
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,280
is similar to the one
on the Ganquan Register.

127
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,760
Since Princess Ningshuang

128
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,140
was the one who tore out the pages
from the Ganquan Register,

129
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,540
then if I go ask her outright like this,

130
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,800
she definitely won't tell me the reason.

131
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,740
Do you have any spell

132
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,980
that can make people tell the truth?

133
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,020
You're a nine-tailed fox!

134
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,700
You can even shapeshift into a human form!

135
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,500
How come you don't have a spell
that can make people

136
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,400
tell the truth?

137
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,500
Are you an idiot?

138
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,580
Of course I'm not.

139
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,620
See?

140
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,620
Making people tell the truth
is harder than shapeshifting

141
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,540
into a human.

142
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,620
Besides,

143
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,620
didn't I already tell you these things?

144
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,060
First,

145
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,260
magic must never be casually shown
to others.

146
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,620
Second,

147
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,220
you're just a mortal.

148
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,780
Once I cast a spell,

149
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,300
it will definitely harm your body.

150
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,470
If you could help me find my father,

151
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,940
I wouldn't have
to go through all this trouble.

152
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,700
Let's go.

153
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,180
Come back with me
and figure something out.

154
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,110
I'm not leaving!

155
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,320
You've actually grown fond
of staying here?

156
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,740
I'm going

157
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,860
to have my revenge.

158
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,420
Why are you being so petty?

159
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,620
Didn't we just

160
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,100
get our revenge?

161
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,220
Not enough.

162
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,940
Far from enough.

163
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,860
For centuries,

164
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,980
I have never suffered
such great humiliation.

165
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,100
If I don't get even,

166
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,620
how can I hold my head up...

167
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,940
in this world?

168
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,200
Fine, have it your way.

169
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,540
I don't care anymore.

170
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,380
Wait.

171
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,760
You should be careful too.

172
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,580
Something might come for you at night.

173
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,540
You!

174
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,060
I advise you not to make
such an expression with my face!

175
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,460
You'd better take care of yourself.

176
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,980
Don't wear my body out.

177
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,420
You!

178
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,620
You!

179
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,960
-Farewell, Your Grace.
-Farewell, Your Grace.

180
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
Le Ning!

181
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,260
Come stay with me at Fucang Palace.

182
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,060
Your Grace!

183
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,820
This...

184
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,180
This is not appropriate.

185
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,540
What's wrong with it?

186
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,180
Didn't we often...

187
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,220
Never mind.

188
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,020
Listen to me.

189
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,340
From now on,

190
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,100
stay away from that Huo Xiangjiu.

191
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,020
She is no longer

192
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,820
the kind and clever Little Xiangjiu
you once knew.

193
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,900
Your Grace,

194
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,550
Xiangjiu and I are as close as sisters.

195
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,460
I don't understand why you're trying
to drive a wedge between us.

196
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,140
Could it be

197
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,860
that you also want
to be Xiangjiu's good friend, Your Grace?

198
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,580
Forget it.

199
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,310
This isn't something
I can easily explain to you.

200
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,020
Listen up, all of you!

201
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,180
From now on,

202
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,180
no one is allowed to bully Le Ning.

203
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,190
Anyone who disobeys...

204
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,460
will face immediate execution.

205
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

206
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Fine, fine.

207
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,640
The Old Fox won't come with me.

208
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,400
I'll just figure something out myself.

209
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,340
Off I go!

210
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,480
-Le Ning.
-Le Ning.

211
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,900
-Le Ning.
-Le Ning.

212
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,420
What's your relationship
with His Grace?

213
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,740
He seems to really like you.

214
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
What exactly is going on between you two?

215
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,860
-Come on, tell us!
-Come on, tell us!

216
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,440
I...

217
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,870
For the failure,

218
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,100
just pay with your life.

219
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,720
It's no big deal.

220
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,260
Lord Gongsun,

221
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,400
didn't you say this would be a sure thing?

222
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,560
How is Lord Feng still alive and well?

223
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,280
Gao Wei!

224
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,360
How dare you speak to Lord Gongsun
like that?

225
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,060
Lord Gongsun

226
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,680
was also acting for my benefit.

227
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,620
Your Highness,

228
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,900
I was blinded by my ambition
for personal credit.

229
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,300
hoping to help you ascend
to the throne sooner.

230
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,440
I never imagined

231
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,500
that Lord Feng would be so fortunate.

232
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,900
Your Highness, I hope

233
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,460
you can forgive me.

234
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,260
Lord Gongsun,

235
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,480
please don't say that.

236
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,540
You are a pillar of our state.

237
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,660
How could I

238
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,260
ever punish you?

239
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,620
Your Highness,

240
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,940
you are so benevolent...

241
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,800
A father's debt

242
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,590
should be repaid by his son.

243
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,900
Guards!

244
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,740
Your Highness!

245
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,580
I only have this one son!

246
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,780
Your Highness,

247
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,980
please have mercy!

248
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,180
Even if I have no merits, for the sake

249
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,500
of my years of hard work in your service,

250
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,740
please spare my son's life,

251
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,600
Your Highness.

252
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,740
Hard work is just hard work.

253
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,400
If hard work counted as merit,

254
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,810
then every constable in this state

255
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
would be considered a hero.

256
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,140
Your Highness,

257
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,580
if you could spare my son's life,

258
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,660
I am

259
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,200
willing to be your loyal servant!

260
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,320
There's no need for that,
Lord Gongsun.

261
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,500
Your son

262
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,780
is to marry Princess Ningshuang.

263
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,980
How dare I let you be my servant?

264
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,860
I wouldn't dare anymore.

265
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,500
I would never dare again.

266
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,140
I wouldn't dare to covet the marriage
alliance with Princess Ningshuang again!

267
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,700
Your Highness!

268
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,420
Lord Gongsun,

269
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,060
your family came from humble origins.

270
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Your current position is hard-won.

271
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,340
You must cherish it.

272
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,620
You must always hold gratitude
in your heart

273
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,160
and repay kindness with action.

274
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,060
Your Highness, without your favor,

275
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,220
I couldn't have become who I am today.

276
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,579
Lord Gongsun,

277
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,300
it is good that you know it.

278
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,660
A low-born wretch
will always be a low-born wretch.

279
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,579
If one day they dare
to dream of a noble's status,

280
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,460
that is overstepping!

281
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,940
They will lose their life!

282
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,760
Gao Wei, how insolent you are!

283
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,900
Sorry that I spoke out of turn.

284
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,340
Sorry that I spoke out of turn.

285
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,180
Enough.

286
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,580
As long as you behave obediently,

287
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,640
which master

288
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,020
would bear to kill an obedient servant?

289
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,000
From now on,

290
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,620
Your Highness, I will follow your lead

291
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,000
with unwavering loyalty.

292
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

293
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,000
Your son is no longer a young boy.

294
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,600
How can he ever grow
if he stays by your side?

295
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,690
Transfer him to the palace.

296
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,520
Make him a palace guard

297
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,920
right by my side.

298
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,000
That way, I may also entrust him
with greater responsibilities.

299
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,720
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness.

300
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,560
However, my son has stayed
by my side since childhood.

301
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,640
He is simple-minded and dull.

302
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,960
If he were to enter the palace,

303
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,040
I fear he might cause offense...

304
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,160
Lord Gongsun,

305
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,200
What a great opportunity it is
that His Highness

306
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
transfers your son to the palace!

307
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,860
Why do you keep declining?

308
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,220
How ungrateful you are!

309
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,960
That is not what I meant.

310
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,740
Then why not express your gratitude
at once?

311
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,000
Thank you,

312
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,600
Your Highness.

313
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,200
You...

314
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

315
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
Matters concerning Lord Feng

316
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,120
must not be rushed.

317
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,730
At the family feast,

318
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,560
I noticed a new maid by his side.

319
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
Let's bribe her.

320
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,380
She is close to him.

321
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,350
She can act far more easily
than we ever could.

322
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,860
Your Highness,

323
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,760
you're truly thoughtful.

324
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,760
I'll do it immediately.

325
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,760
That won't be necessary.

326
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,940
This time,

327
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,920
I'll handle it personally.

328
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,340
Your Highness.

329
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,160
Your Highness,

330
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,060
dinner is ready.

331
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,160
Lord Gongsun,
please stay for the meal as well.

332
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,880
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness.

333
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,200
We still have official business
to attend to,

334
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,400
so we won't
take up any more of your time.

335
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,480
Your Highness,

336
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll take my leave.

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,920
Lord Gongsun,

338
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,400
please.

339
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,920
How many times have I told you?

340
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,360
Do not disturb me

341
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,960
when I'm discussing official matters.

342
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,260
Let's go.

343
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Why do you never listen?

344
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,360
Why do you never listen?

345
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,800
Prince Fuying wanted to transfer you
to the palace,

346
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
just to keep you firmly under his control.

347
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,240
And you

348
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,320
actually agreed!

349
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
Did we even have the option to refuse?

350
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,720
If you hadn't been helping the tyrant
do evil all this time,

351
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,760
how could our lives have become so fraught
with fear and dread?

352
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,820
You insolent fool!

353
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
You absolute idiot!

354
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,420
Have you ever thought about this?

355
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,600
All other princes are stationed
in their own states.

356
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,200
Only Prince Fuying stays
by the His Majesty's side.

357
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
If we don't pledge allegiance to him,

358
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,240
how can our Gongsun family
rise to greater heights?

359
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,120
So what?

360
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,420
I don't care at all.

361
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,720
You...

362
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,440
You're truly stupid!

363
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,920
What did I teach you since you were a boy?

364
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,800
Each generation must be more ruthless
than the last.

365
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,920
But you...

366
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,320
How did I end up with a son

367
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,120
as ambitionless and soft as you?

368
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,810
And there's another thing.

369
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
Don't tell me I'm right.

370
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,860
You want to stay in the palace,

371
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,680
just because of that woman!

372
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,640
If Prince Fuying learns
about your past with her,

373
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,600
our Gongsun family will be finished!

374
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,560
Also,

375
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,440
try not to mention Lord Feng
in front of Prince Fuying.

376
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,120
You...

377
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,560
Did you hear me?

378
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,420
You...

379
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,940
You...

380
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,240
Where is the secret manual?

381
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,220
Where is...

382
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,960
the secret manual?

383
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,760
It's here.

384
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,480
Please don't pass out just yet, okay?

385
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,640
Your Grace.

386
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,500
Your Grace.

387
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,720
-Ah!
-Ah!

388
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,320
-Ah!
-Ah!

389
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,800
A demon!

390
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,860
-Ah!
-Ah!

391
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,100
-Ah!
-Ah!

392
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,160
Ah!

393
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,200
You should push it.

394
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,040
Thank you.

395
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,780
What a coincidence.

396
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,320
Bye.

397
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,580
What on earth

398
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,640
did I do to you?

399
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,720
We have no grudge against each other.

400
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,600
What kind of demon are you?

401
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,000
Why are you following me?

402
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,720
You're not Lord Feng.

403
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,920
What do you mean?

404
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,420
Lord Feng wouldn't be afraid of me.

405
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,960
But you look exactly like Lord Feng.

406
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,360
Wait.

407
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,000
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

408
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,840
Give me a hand.

409
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,120
So it's you!

410
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,180
What do you mean?

411
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,140
Do we know each other?

412
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,940
Once,

413
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,440
when I was in the outhouse,

414
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,400
you helped me.

415
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,860
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,340
I don't remember anything.

417
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,700
Why is this happening?

418
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,700
I have no idea either.

419
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,840
Where is Lord Feng now?

420
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,780
Can you take me to him?

421
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,980
This is what you get
for staying behind to seek revenge?

422
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,840
It's all because

423
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,080
your body

424
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
is too weak.

425
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,720
What is she?

426
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,570
A flower spirit.

427
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,650
A flower spirit?

428
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,960
Flowers can become spirits too?

429
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,490
All things can become spirits.

430
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,640
Then can shit become a spirit?

431
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,680
It can help flowers become spirits.

432
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,360
What are you two talking about?

433
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,960
Your physical form is already gone.

434
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,560
Now only your soul remains.

435
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,920
I don't even remember what I am anymore.

436
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,760
I only remember

437
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,900
I wandered the palace day after day.

438
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,220
One day, I saw Lord Feng by chance.

439
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,640
After watching him secretly for days,

440
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,170
I noticed he and I seemed
to be of the same kind.

441
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,640
So I wanted to ask you, Lord Feng,

442
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,780
to free me from this endless torment.

443
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,280
But never did I expect

444
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,080
that Lord Feng and this young lady

445
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,000
had swapped souls.

446
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,760
Since her body is already gone,

447
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,590
why does her soul still remain?

448
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,160
It won't last long.

449
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,840
A soul cannot survive
once separated from the body.

450
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,000
It must be
that there are still unresolved regrets.

451
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,720
What regrets do you have?

452
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,800
I only remember my name is Ru.

453
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,360
As for the rest,

454
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,320
I remember nothing.

455
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,160
Your Grace,
please help me uncover the truth.

456
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,370
Please help her.

457
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,420
Your soul won't last long.

458
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,260
Soon it will vanish completely.

459
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,050
What does it matter whether you can

460
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,610
settle your regrets or not?

461
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
Of course it matters.

462
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,770
Even with only one day left,

463
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,360
if there's still an unfulfilled wish,

464
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,490
one should do their best to fulfill it.

465
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,840
Only then

466
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,480
can they finally be at peace.

467
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,090
I never meddle in others' affairs.

468
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,980
You may leave.

469
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,400
Your Grace, without your help,

470
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm afraid
I'll have to vanish into nothing

471
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,760
with my regrets.

472
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,280
Old Fox!

473
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,800
You're so cold-blooded!

474
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,920
Ru!

475
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,480
Don't leave.

476
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,490
Don't leave.

477
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,800
Don't worry.

478
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
He won't help you,

479
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,320
but I will.

480
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,360
Really?

481
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,120
Thank you so much.

482
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,940
May I ask

483
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,920
your name?

484
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,090
My name is Huo Xiangjiu.

485
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,800
You can call me Xiangjiu.

486
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
Miss Xiangjiu,

487
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,080
I'll await your good news.

488
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,840
Huo Xiangjiu...

489
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,600
As a noble gentleman among flowers,
it is like a refined guest from Sanxiang.

490
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,680
Blessed with the peerless fragrance,
it bears the virtuous spirit.

491
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,440
She's quite pretty,

492
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,480
but her singing is awful.

493
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,580
It was you who promised to help her.

494
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,110
It had nothing to do with me.

495
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,090
You're not really going to sleep
in this pigsty, are you?

496
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,850
You're so terrible
at getting along with people.

497
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,220
None of your business!

498
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,170
Come back to Fucang Palace with me.

499
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Why?

500
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,400
I absolutely will not allow my body

501
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,320
to sleep in a place like this!

502
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,880
I think

503
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,780
you're

504
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,400
afraid.

505
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,080
Afraid?

506
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,400
I'm afraid?

507
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,260
You're afraid.

508
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I am afraid?

509
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,280
You are afraid!

510
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,159
I'm not afraid of demons.

511
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,639
I'm now the supreme Lord Feng!

512
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,969
You think I'm afraid...

513
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
Why did I pass out again?

514
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,780
Your body really isn't very good.

515
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,720
It's your mere mortal soul

516
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,640
that can't handle my powerful body.

517
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,080
Why don't you put a bed in the room?

518
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,580
Have you ever seen a fox
sleeping in a bed?

519
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,440
Then aren't you cold sleeping

520
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,180
on the block of ice?

521
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,080
How ignorant.

522
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
This is thousand-year-old ice.

523
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,880
It can suppress

524
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,480
the innate fire
generated by my cultivation.

525
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,090
No wonder you're so hot-tempered.

526
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,880
But putting my body on this ice

527
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,080
will easily cause rheumatism.

528
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,980
I really miss

529
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,280
my nine-colored tail now.

530
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,520
Well,

531
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,360
why did Princess Ningshuang

532
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,480
tear out those two pages
from the Ganquan Register?

533
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,330
Could it really be her
who captured my father?

534
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,770
If you're so eager to find your father,

535
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,690
why bother
with someone else's trivial matters?

536
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,280
That flower spirit

537
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,160
will soon

538
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,020
vanish into nothing.

539
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,100
Why waste your efforts on what's futile?

540
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,320
There are no trivial matters
in this world.

541
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,960
So-called trivial matters

542
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
are just

543
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,970
hardships that haven't yet fallen
upon oneself.

544
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,040
But then,

545
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,730
you'll delay your search for your father.

546
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,380
My father said

547
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,690
that one shouldn't ignore
others' suffering

548
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,250
just because they're in a hurry
to reach their own destination.

549
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,470
Do you know
why humans are stronger than animals?

550
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,940
Because we know how to help each other,

551
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,280
how to understand each other,

552
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,160
and how to love.

553
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,480
Love, you understand?

554
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,040
Love me?

555
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,660
The way you broke up my sentence
changed the meaning.

556
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,460
It's...

557
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,040
It's not "love you."

558
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,700
It's "love, you understand?"

559
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,380
Forget it.

560
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,560
You're not even human.

561
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,620
It's pointless explaining it to you.

562
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,340
In my life,

563
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,060
if only I could meet someone

564
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,940
who would love me for a lifetime.

565
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,520
Wouldn't it be better

566
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,300
if it were for every lifetime?

567
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,340
You really don't understand love at all.

568
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,140
Getting love that lasts a lifetime

569
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,820
is already a rare blessing.

570
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,620
If that's the case,

571
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,460
if one could experience love
that lasts every lifetime,

572
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,300
wouldn't that be the greatest blessing
in the world?

573
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,660
Every lifetime?

574
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,680
That's something
I wouldn't even dare to dream of.

575
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,360
Since it's just a dream,

576
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,620
why not be a bit bolder?

577
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,060
By the way,

578
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,740
is it possible that my father
has some secret business to take care of,

579
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,940
so he's hiding,

580
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,060
not wanting me to know?

581
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,920
It's possible.

582
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,580
Yeah,

583
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
I think so too.

584
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,980
Xiangjiu!

585
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,320
I've learned the soul-swapping technique!

586
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,120
Xiangjiu!

587
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,160
Xiangjiu!

588
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,220
Xiangjiu!

589
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,320
Xiangjiu!

590
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,260
I've learned the soul-swapping technique!

591
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,200
Xiangjiu!

592
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,560
Xiangjiu!

593
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,600
Xiangjiu!

594
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,520
Xiangjiu!

595
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,920
Yu!

596
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,480
How dare you hit me!

597
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,120
Xiangjiu,

598
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,840
I'm sorry

599
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,670
that I hit the wrong person.

600
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,200
Hurry up and swap back!

601
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,300
I'm going crazy dealing with you two!

602
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,600
Xiangjiu...

603
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,800
Let's begin.

604
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,840
Ancestors
of the Bai Clan of Bronze County,

605
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,500
I, Bai Yu, the 30th generation descendant
of the clan,

606
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,420
will perform
the soul-swapping technique here.

607
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,080
Heavenly Thunder!

608
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,680
Earthly Fire!

609
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,280
Five Elements!

610
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,060
Six Harmonies!

611
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,120
Commence the soul exchange!

612
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,180
Follow my command!

613
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,300
Why am I still in Huo Xiangjiu's body?

614
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,100
Bai Yu,

615
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,220
your soul-swapping technique
didn't work at all.

616
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,660
Yu,

617
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,540
why am I in your body?

618
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,700
Why am I in the wily fox's body?

619
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,740
You two...

620
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,700
I'm Huo Xiangjiu.

621
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,580
I'm Bai Yu.

622
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,380
Yu!

623
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
I'm so sorry.

624
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,380
It's my first time
performing the soul-swapping technique.

625
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,040
I'm not very skilled at it yet.

626
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,540
Let's try it again.

627
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,230
Totally worthless, just as I thought!

628
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,420
Heavenly Thunder!

629
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,060
Earthly Fire!

630
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,060
Five Elements! Six Harmonies!

631
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,660
Commence the soul exchange!

632
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,040
Follow my command!

633
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,620
Why am I back
in the wily fox's body again?

634
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,580
Why am I in Bai Yu's body?

635
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,420
Xiangjiu,

636
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,840
I'm in your body.

637
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,760
I never thought

638
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,730
that I would embrace you

639
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,180
in this way.

640
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,140
Don't move!

641
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,860
I'll break your arms if you try anything!

642
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,900
Do you actually know how to perform
the soul-swapping technique?

643
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,940
The current situation

644
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,340
clearly proves that I do!

645
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,040
Then could you just get it right

646
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
for once?

647
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,780
Calm down!

648
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,160
Everything is under control.

649
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,660
Yu,

650
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,100
make our souls return to our own bodies!

651
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,160
Let's try it again!

652
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,260
Heavenly Thunder!

653
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,020
Earthly Fire!

654
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,260
Five Elements! Six Harmonies!

655
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,860
Commence the soul exchange!

656
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,700
Follow my command!

657
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,800
Xiangjiu,

658
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,170
is it really you?

659
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,140
It's me!

660
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,380
I'm back!

661
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,180
Old Fox!

662
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,700
Old Fox...

663
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,620
I'm Bai Yu.

664
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,300
Then you two...

665
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,560
Every soul back to the right body counts.

666
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,380
Old Fox,

667
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,700
it's our turn now.

668
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,920
Xiangjiu,

669
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,900
you go back first,

670
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,960
in case we mess things up again.

671
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,620
Okay.

672
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,420
Good luck!

673
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:46,880
Xiangjiu,

674
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,880
I'll go find you soon.

675
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,420
For the first time, I'm admiring
my own appearance so directly.

676
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,940
Truly majestic and imposing,

677
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,100
valiant and extraordinary,

678
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,020
curvaceous and shapely,

679
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,140
dashing and stylish,

680
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,540
and drop-dead gorgeous!

681
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,620
You wily fox,

682
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,800
being able to enjoy such a fabulous figure

683
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,940
is the greatest honor

684
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,240
of your life!

685
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,820
Please remember this moment forever!

686
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,780
Stop babbling.

687
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,740
Just do it.

688
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,300
You're right.

689
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,460
If this drags on any longer,

690
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,180
you'll end up occupying my body.

691
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,580
What a rotten deal for me.

692
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,760
Heavenly Thunder!

693
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,640
Earthly Fire!

694
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,140
Five Elements! Six Harmonies!

695
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,780
Commence the soul exchange!

696
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,920
Follow my command!

697
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,300
It didn't work.

698
00:45:59,340 --> 00:45:59,920
Master,

699
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,880
it's me.

700
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,740
You stupid dog,

701
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,550
why did you suddenly show up
in the middle of this?

702
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,320
What was that in my mind just now?

703
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,860
How bizarre.

704
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,700
You're Huo Xiangjiu, aren't you?

705
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,500
No.

706
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,980
You are Huo Xiangjiu!

707
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,540
Prince Fuying

708
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,720
asked you to go to the Eastern Palace.

709
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,220
Prince Fuying

710
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,780
wants to see me?

711
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,020
I'm quite busy today.

712
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,260
Perhaps another day.

713
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,280
Prince Fuying's order

714
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,760
is not something you can refuse.
