1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,190
At this point,
don't you have even a trace of remorse?

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,500
Remorse?

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,910
That's something only fools possess,

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,420
especially fools like you!

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,860
You only think of others.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,180
How pitiful.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,580
Do you know...

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,860
what your father said to me
before he died?

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,380
Please...

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,200
report...

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,760
to...

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
the Emperor...

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
that in Bronze County,

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,480
Young Master Gao...

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,740
and the magistrate

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,040
are in collusion,

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,720
tyrannizing the people there.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,300
Please beg His Majesty...

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,940
to seek justice...

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,420
for the people...

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,620
of Bronze County.

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,620
I've never seen such a foolish person.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,900
At death's door,

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
he was still thinking of others.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,340
What did he want?

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,900
What did he want?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,240
He wanted peace of mind.

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,220
He wanted to sleep soundly.

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,460
He wanted to enjoy every meal.

30
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,900
The rose's in her hand,
the flavor in mine—

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,380
that's something venal people like you

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,700
will never understand.

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,660
You can ignore others' suffering,

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,100
but you have no right
to mock those who help others in need!

35
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,600
If this world is to be better,

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,620
there has to be more people like them

37
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,920
and fewer people like you!

38
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,380
How touching.

39
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,700
I was almost moved by you.

40
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,780
Gongsun Hao,

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,020
if you have any humanity left,

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,100
please...

43
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,340
tell me...

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,500
where my father's body is.

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,180
Please.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,020
Have you heard of...

47
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,060
corpse-dissolving liquid?

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,430
There was nothing left of his body.

49
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,200
I'll kill you!

50
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,820
Xiangjiu!

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,260
Xiangjiu, are you alright?

52
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,440
I'll kill you!

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,620
Gongsun Hao!

54
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,980
Do you dare kill me?

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,430
I'm different from you.

56
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,940
You're a cultivator.

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,980
Once you take a life,

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,620
your body and soul
will be destroyed completely.

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,540
No matter how many people I kill,

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,020
as long as I put down my knife,

61
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,460
I can achieve salvation.

62
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,220
You're merely a mortal.

63
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,740
What's going on?

64
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,680
Master.

65
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,820
If a cultivator takes a life,

66
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,700
their body and soul
will be destroyed completely.

67
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
I'm a loyal dog.

68
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
I should be the one

69
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,210
doing this kind of thing of course.

70
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,900
Mao Jin!

71
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,340
Mao Jin.

72
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,340
Have you forgotten your aspiration?

73
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,840
Didn't you say you wanted
to guard the South Heavenly Gate

74
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,700
with Lord Howling Celestial Dog?

75
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,980
You're...

76
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,340
my South Heavenly Gate.

77
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,600
Master.

78
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,420
Now I finally understand

79
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,540
what Lord Howling Celestial Dog
has been guarding

80
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,680
is perhaps never that gate.

81
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,140
Bai Yu,

82
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,100
did you see that?

83
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,260
My master...

84
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,100
never killed your ancestors.

85
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,460
Master.

86
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,220
I didn't let you down, did I?

87
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,460
I really am a loyal dog, right?

88
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,300
You are my family.

89
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Whose dog is this?

90
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,500
I'll beat you to death!

91
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,800
Thank you.

92
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,080
Why are you here all alone?

93
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,380
What's your name?

94
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,340
You look a lot
like the Howling Celestial Dog.

95
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,020
From now on,

96
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,550
would you like to follow me?

97
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,710
Don't be afraid.

98
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,060
I'm here with you.

99
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,460
Mao Jin,

100
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,900
you're unbelievable.

101
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,080
Of course!

102
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
I'm unquestionably a loyal dog!

103
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,380
You really are a lackey.

104
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,060
Yes.

105
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
That's the highest praise for me.

106
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,920
So tell me,

107
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,020
what's so great about your love?

108
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,140
My love

109
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,790
expects nothing in return.

110
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,940
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.

111
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,100
As long as she's well, I'm well too.

112
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,480
Just like how I treat my master.

113
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,520
But I don't know how to sample dishes.

114
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,740
There's nothing difficult about that.

115
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,840
Just take a bite of each dish,

116
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,610
and if you find something you like,
eat your fill.

117
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,180
Your Majesty,

118
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,980
the remaining followers of Prince Fuying

119
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,300
who should be handled have been handled.

120
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,720
Tell them

121
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,300
not to expand the scope of punishment,

122
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
to avoid implicating the innocent.

123
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,500
Punish the principal offenders severely,

124
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,620
the others leniently, or not at all.

125
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,260
Your Majesty, you're wise.

126
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,500
Where is Mochen?

127
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,780
He still refuses to see me.

128
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,980
Lord Feng said

129
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,340
the bond between you and him has ended.

130
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,900
There is no need to meet again.

131
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,780
If he stays here,

132
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,030
will he really suffer tribulation
every day?

133
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,990
Three days from now,

134
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,540
unless he can ascend,

135
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,700
otherwise...

136
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,160
for the rest of his life...

137
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,350
he will suffer tribulation every day.

138
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,180
This isn't fair.

139
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,790
This isn't fair.

140
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,700
Why must he suffer all this?

141
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,180
He is a demon.

142
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,520
This is the price a demon must pay
to become an immortal.

143
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,040
What is a demon?

144
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,670
If we're talking about demons,

145
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,100
Gongsun Hao is the real demon.

146
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,020
You're right.

147
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
But his origin

148
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,520
is his original sin.

149
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,460
If he doesn't want
to accept fate's arrangement

150
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,140
and live his life like all other animals,

151
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,400
he must endure these hardships.

152
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,400
You think this is unfair.

153
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,580
But if anyone
could easily become an immortal,

154
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,030
do you think that would be fair?

155
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,890
Now you have only 2 choices.

156
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,270
Either help him ascend,

157
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,300
or let him stay and suffer tribulation.

158
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
Old Fox, you're back.

159
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,840
I've tidied up the Fucang Palace nicely.

160
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
That bastard Gongsun Hao

161
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,800
made this place a complete mess.

162
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
I have something to tell you.

163
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,180
Wait a moment.

164
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,940
Let me go light some incense first.

165
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,360
I've been so busy lately...

166
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,890
I've decided not to ascend.

167
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,700
Why?

168
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,460
Actually,

169
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,450
after enduring so many tribulations,

170
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,200
I've gotten used to it.

171
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,930
It's not as painful as you imagine.

172
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,860
But I've never thought about
spending the rest of my life with you.

173
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,820
You can call me a coward,

174
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,660
or say I'm heartless.

175
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,500
In short,

176
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,300
I don't have the courage

177
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
to entrust the rest of my life...

178
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,320
to a fox.

179
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,540
Actually, being with you before

180
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,520
was merely out of novelty.

181
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,500
In life,

182
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,740
how many people

183
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,420
get to encounter a fox?

184
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,780
But as time goes on,

185
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,480
I would also inexplicably feel on edge.

186
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,900
I'm worried

187
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,300
that I might accidentally
say something to anger you,

188
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,680
and you...

189
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,800
would eat me.

190
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,000
I am human after all.

191
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,150
In the future, I will marry a human.

192
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,340
I want to live with a human,

193
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,540
not a fox.

194
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,060
In this world,

195
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,280
love that lasts a lifetime

196
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,430
is already rare enough.

197
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,440
But if that's the case,

198
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,280
love that lasts every lifetime—

199
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,190
wouldn't that be the greatest blessing
in the world?

200
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,980
That's something
I wouldn't even dare to dream of.

201
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,000
In my life,

202
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,540
if I could meet someone who loves me
for a lifetime, that would be enough.

203
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,740
Wouldn't it be better

204
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,359
if it were for every lifetime?

205
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,640
You really don't understand love at all.

206
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,420
Getting love that lasts a lifetime

207
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,120
is already a rare blessing.

208
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,360
If that's the case,

209
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,900
if one could experience love
that lasts every lifetime,

210
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,380
wouldn't that be the greatest blessing
in the world?

211
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,260
Every lifetime?

212
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,600
That's something
I wouldn't even dare to dream of.

213
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,070
Let's just consider each other...

214
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,740
as mere passersby in life.

215
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,380
Xiangjiu,

216
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,740
the meal is ready!

217
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,140
Wily Fox,

218
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,470
you're here too.

219
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,560
If I had known,
I'd have had the Imperial Kitchen

220
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,960
prepare chicken for you.

221
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,000
He will soon ascend to immortality.

222
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,600
He must have many things to attend to.

223
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,530
We shouldn't disturb him anymore.

224
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,020
Look at your clothes.

225
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,780
They're so improperly worn,

226
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,420
always askew like this.

227
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,140
Alright.

228
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,060
Got it.

229
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,340
No.

230
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,860
I must punish you this time.

231
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,660
How?

232
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,540
Carry me on your back.

233
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,030
Why must you torment him like this?

234
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,100
Only in this way

235
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,460
can he leave without attachments.

236
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,580
Ningshuang.

237
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,380
Bai Yu,

238
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,680
we shouldn't
see each other again in the future.

239
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,410
Ningshuang,

240
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,980
this is my fault.

241
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,840
If he loves me,

242
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
even without you,

243
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,940
he would still love me.

244
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,860
If he doesn't love me,

245
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
even without you,

246
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,080
he still wouldn't love me.

247
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,880
Xiangjiu,

248
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,920
I've had feelings for you since childhood.

249
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,900
That has not changed even now.

250
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,380
But what about you?

251
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,650
Have you ever felt anything for me?

252
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,160
In this world,

253
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,490
there are always many things
beyond human power.

254
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,500
We call this helplessness and regret...

255
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
fate.

256
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,120
After Old Fox ascends,

257
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,720
I will leave the palace

258
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,160
and live in seclusion in the countryside.

259
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,760
Then what does that make me?

260
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,520
He will be with me

261
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,250
only because you won't be here.

262
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,960
Well,

263
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,640
that makes me seem too cheap.

264
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,100
This kind of love—

265
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,100
I don't want it at all.

266
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,080
You know that's not what I meant.

267
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
I know you mean well,

268
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,600
but to me, love

269
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
is just like one of the 4 limbs.

270
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,820
Limbs, once severed,

271
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,080
can hardly grow back.

272
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,000
But if I lose someone I love,

273
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,540
I can simply find another.

274
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,640
There's no need to torment myself,

275
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,520
much less to seek death.

276
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,760
In this world,

277
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,480
the only ones who will remain true to you

278
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,410
are your parents...

279
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,680
and yourself.

280
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,600
Living in this world,

281
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
why must we live so miserably?

282
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,040
When you're in love,
confess your feelings boldly.

283
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,100
No need to be timid.

284
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,840
When you part,

285
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,820
wave goodbye decisively,

286
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,760
leaving no regrets.

287
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,400
Bai Yu,

288
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,120
let's...

289
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
part ways here.

290
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,420
Your Grace.

291
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,940
Your favorite dishes.

292
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,660
Now that Mao Jin is gone,

293
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,640
for the next few days,

294
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,500
let me serve you in his place.

295
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,420
Every meeting is a prelude

296
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,500
to a parting.

297
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,400
You don't need to grieve too much.

298
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,140
I just feel...

299
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,820
this parting came too suddenly.

300
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,140
If I had known earlier,

301
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,580
I would have cherished
the final moments with him.

302
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,580
Partings in this world

303
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,380
mostly arrive unexpectedly.

304
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,920
Therefore,

305
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,360
when you meet someone worthy,

306
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,560
cherish them dearly.

307
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,720
It's just a pity

308
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,160
that I didn't realize it earlier.

309
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,600
From now on,

310
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,130
please take good care of Xiangjiu.

311
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,120
Don't worry, Your Grace.

312
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,160
Xiangjiu and I are like sisters.

313
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,280
Even without your request,

314
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,520
I will definitely take good care of her.

315
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,720
Le Ning.

316
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,840
Your family name

317
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,800
is Cao, right?

318
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,560
How did you know?

319
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,340
You have an ancestor

320
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,380
named Cao Yuan.

321
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,620
You peeked at my family tree?

322
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,500
It's a great blessing
that Xiangjiu and you

323
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,380
became good friends.

324
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,180
I...

325
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,420
prefer to dine alone.

326
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,820
Oh.

327
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,300
Okay.

328
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
Please enjoy your meal, Your Grace.

329
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,750
Why are you smiling?

330
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,480
Living in this world,

331
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,440
why must we live so miserably?

332
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,200
When you're in love,
confess your feelings boldly.

333
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,440
No need to be timid.

334
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,740
When you part,

335
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,500
wave goodbye decisively,

336
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,290
leaving no regrets.

337
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,620
You must be thinking
something bad about me.

338
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,280
Didn't you go eat

339
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,480
with Bai Yu?

340
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,080
Bai Yu's cooking...

341
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,840
His cooking

342
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,500
isn't good?

343
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,040
Then let's enjoy our meal.

344
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,120
Mm.

345
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,200
You eat more too.

346
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,980
Here.

347
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,440
After you go to the celestial court,

348
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,840
you probably won't be able
to enjoy so many delicious dishes.

349
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,680
How would you know?

350
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,080
Of course.

351
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,620
Have you ever heard

352
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,750
of a cook who cultivates immortality?

353
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,300
If no cook has become an immortal,

354
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,480
how could there be cooks in heaven?

355
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,380
That makes sense.

356
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,900
You said before

357
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,700
that Qiaoru cultivated

358
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,980
because

359
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,460
she fell in love.

360
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,560
She fell in love with Xiaofu.

361
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,560
Then...

362
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
who did you fall in love with?

363
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,620
Someone.

364
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,360
Was she...

365
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,020
pretty?

366
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
Was she cute?

367
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,900
Was she brave and kind?

368
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,540
Was she clever?

369
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,100
Since she was so good,

370
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,180
why did you fall in love...

371
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,020
with other women?

372
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,780
Old Fox,

373
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,110
you've lived for so many years.

374
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,120
How many women have you loved?

375
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,140
One.

376
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,860
You're lying to me again.

377
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,080
As the price for my help,

378
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,980
tell me

379
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,540
about all the women

380
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,880
you've loved.

381
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,480
All of them.

382
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
I'm afraid that would take
at least 3 days and 3 nights.

383
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,600
Then...

384
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,330
you'd better...

385
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,280
hurry up.

386
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,260
Before

387
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,960
the next tribulation,

388
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,770
finish telling all.

389
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,680
Then I must start

390
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,660
from a few thousand years ago,

391
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,000
when I was still a little white fox.

392
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Back then,

393
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,480
I was caught by a hunter

394
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,880
and locked in a cage.

395
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,120
He had a kind and lovely daughter.

396
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Those years,

397
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,200
I stayed by her son's side,

398
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,740
helping his parents take care of him.

399
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,820
I was worried he might go astray.

400
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,750
Then it would let his parents down.

401
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,920
When he no longer needed me

402
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,860
and I returned to her,

403
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,200
she was already very old.

404
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,240
This time,

405
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,140
everyone thought she was a fairy.

406
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,140
But actually,

407
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,880
she was just an uneducated little girl.

408
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,480
But she was kind,

409
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,520
lovely,

410
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,360
and quite clever.

411
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,720
Unfortunately, at that time,

412
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,000
the royal power fell

413
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
into the imperial advisor's hands.

414
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,920
The imperial advisor wanted
to marry his own daughter to the king.

415
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
Guess

416
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,580
what the king did.

417
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,860
The king

418
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,480
actually...

419
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,640
wanted to castrate himself.

420
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
She was a woman.

421
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,760
Her father,

422
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,440
to avoid turmoil within the royal clan,

423
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,540
raised her as a boy from childhood.

424
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,200
In the end,
she actually inherited the throne.

425
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,080
But she...

426
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,640
through a strange twist of fate,

427
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,820
met the Emperor of an enemy state.

428
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,490
The two of them fell off a cliff.

429
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,080
I cast a spell midway

430
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,400
to save them,

431
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,730
leaving them hanging on a tree.

432
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,840
I saw them

433
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,680
kissing on the steps.

434
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They got married.

435
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,250
They must have lived very happily.

436
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,300
She was a noble princess,

437
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,030
betrothed by the weak Emperor
to a foreign state.

438
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,380
That was an important matter
concerning the people of 2 states.

439
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,580
She was unwilling to abandon the people

440
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,860
for the sake of her own happiness.

441
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,470
I was appointed
as the envoy to escort her,

442
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,630
personally sending her
to the foreign state.

443
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,190
The tribulation is coming.

444
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,430
The tribulation is coming.

445
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,360
Hurry.

446
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,800
I'll help you ascend.

447
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,800
I'll help you ascend.

448
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,220
There's still one person
I haven't told you about.

449
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,380
Let's just stop there.

450
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,900
You've already told me about 6 women.

451
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,020
That's enough.

452
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,900
Just stop there.

453
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,820
We don't have much time left.

454
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,100
Le Ning told me before.

455
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,720
It's like this, right?

456
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,310
I'm not doing it wrong, am I?

457
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,160
The seventh one—
I tried my best to avoid her.

458
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,740
I was worried if I met her again,
I would be unwilling to leave.

459
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,870
I wanted to appear directly before her

460
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,260
as a stranger

461
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,940
and ask her to help me ascend.

462
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,990
But when I actually saw her,

463
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,870
I couldn't let go again.

464
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,660
Feng Mochen,

465
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,380
stop talking and focus, okay?

466
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,820
The tribulation is coming soon.

467
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,180
Primordial forces stir.

468
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,580
Nine stars move in order.

469
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,620
Descend upon me your radiance.

470
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,340
I'm sorry.

471
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,740
Please stop talking!

472
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,440
I can barely remember it!

473
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,520
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,160
It's been 7 lifetimes...

475
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,460
and I couldn't make you happy.

476
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,860
What?

477
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Little White Fox,

478
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,180
who locked you in here?

479
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,020
Is becoming an immortal

480
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,680
really that important to you?

481
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,720
Becoming an immortal

482
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
is my destination,

483
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,560
but not my purpose.

484
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Why didn't you...

485
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,670
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

486
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,850
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

487
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,820
Knowing these things

488
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,969
might not necessarily be good.

489
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,639
But isn't that how you've always been?

490
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,040
You've endured all the pain.

491
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,300
Why have you never told me?

492
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,870
I was worried that would...

493
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,030
make you stay farther away from me.

494
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,980
That would

495
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,780
make me help you ascend sooner

496
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,540
and spare you
from the pain of tribulations.

497
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,510
Have you forgotten?

498
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,460
I didn't cultivate

499
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,480
to become an immortal.

500
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,639
Moreover, the tribulation

501
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,880
isn't that painful for me.

502
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,320
Do you remember what you said?

503
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,200
Love that lasts a lifetime

504
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,860
is already rare.

505
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,810
If one could experience love
that lasts every lifetime,

506
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,630
wouldn't that be the greatest blessing
in the world?

507
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,160
Feng Mochen!

508
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,420
Feng Mochen.

509
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,540
Nine stars move in order!

510
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,780
Primordial forces stir!

511
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,560
Afield the creeping grass,

512
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,000
with crystal dew overspread.

513
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,880
There's a beautiful lass,

514
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,160
with clear eyes and fine forehead.

515
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,560
When I meet the clear-eyed,

516
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,890
my desire is satisfied.

517
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,750
Afield the creeping grass,

518
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,830
with dewdrops overspread.

519
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,560
There's a beautiful lass,

520
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,230
with clear eyes and fine forehead.

521
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,950
When I meet the clear-eyed,

522
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
amid the grass let's hide.

523
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,180
Meeting you...

524
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,720
is the greatest fortune of my life.

525
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,880
Mine too.

526
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,600
Mine too.

527
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,380
You're free now.

528
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,140
You little beast!

529
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,060
You let it go?

530
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,540
Little White Fox!

531
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,800
Run!

532
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,440
Don't let my father catch you!

533
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,000
Little White Fox, run!

534
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
You can't hit it!

535
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,620
Little White Fox,

536
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,520
run!

537
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,380
Little White Fox,

538
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,640
if only...

539
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,200
you were human.

540
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,040
That way,

541
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,120
you could take me away.

542
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,120
You want

543
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,700
to transform into human form?

544
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,240
Though you're exceptionally gifted,

545
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
it will take

546
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,280
500 years at least.

547
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,100
Like the wind,

548
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,340
like ink,

549
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,020
like dust.

550
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,660
Feng Mochen.

551
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,520
Does it sound nice?

552
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,800
I exchanged your 500 years of cultivation

553
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,940
for her life.

554
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,780
And according to your wish,

555
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,820
I erased all her impressions and memories

556
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,740
of you.

557
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,660
It's so good to see you again.

558
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,940
Actually, when I first saw you,

559
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,020
I felt somehow familiar.

560
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,560
To transform into human form,

561
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,800
she exhausted all her cultivation.

562
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
If she had remained a little flower,

563
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,000
she wouldn't have suffered any of this.

564
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,800
She fell in love.

565
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,800
We could go to a rural village,

566
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,600
have children,

567
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,960
farm and weave,

568
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,140
and just live as ordinary people

569
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,480
for the rest of our lives.

570
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,740
Wouldn't that be nice?

571
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,560
That would be wonderful.

572
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,280
A life like that...

573
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,420
is what I dream of.

574
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
In my life,

575
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,540
if only I could meet someone

576
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,140
who would love me for a lifetime.

577
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,760
If that's the case,

578
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,450
if one could experience love
that lasts every lifetime,

579
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,750
wouldn't that be the greatest blessing
in the world?

580
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,960
Old Fox! Old Fox!

581
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,640
Feng Mochen!

582
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,360
Old Fox!

583
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,240
Feng Mochen,

584
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,560
now

585
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,960
you have shed your mortal flesh

586
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
and can join the ranks of immortals.

587
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,440
Immortal,

588
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,180
can I choose not to be an immortal?

589
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Do you take the immortal realm
as child's play?

590
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,520
I cultivated

591
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,760
never to become an immortal.

592
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
In my eyes,

593
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,540
immortals are worthless.

594
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,900
How dare you!

595
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,820
How insolent!

596
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,660
You show no respect
for the higher immortals!

597
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,940
You impudent little demon,

598
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,620
how dare you say such outrageous words!

599
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,940
Am I wrong?

600
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,580
When the weak are bullied,

601
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,900
where are you?

602
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,740
When the sick suffer in pain,

603
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,620
where are you?

604
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,500
When parents lose their children,

605
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,580
where are you?

606
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,220
When evil people
trample the good underfoot,

607
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,460
where are you?

608
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,860
Since you never care about the suffering
in the mortal world,

609
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,360
aren't you utterly worthless?

610
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,420
Someone as arrogant and rude as you

611
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,540
doesn't deserve
to join the ranks of immortals!

612
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,860
I indeed don't deserve

613
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,740
to be an immortal

614
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,440
like you,

615
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,300
looking down on the mortal world.

616
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,420
I only wish to be an ordinary person,

617
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,080
spending my life

618
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,900
with the one I love.

619
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,560
Even though human life is short,

620
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,060
just a few decades,

621
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,640
I would still be content.

622
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,760
Feng Mochen,

623
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,200
you should know

624
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,010
you can't have everything your way
in this world.

625
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,860
I know.

626
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,060
In this world,

627
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,520
you're the ones in charge.

628
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,620
Then I'll do as you say.

629
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,240
Tell me what I must do to become human.

630
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll do it.

631
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,960
Fine.

632
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,060
Since you want to become human so badly,

633
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,040
go suffer in the Avici Hell!

634
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,900
You'll suffer a tribulation there
at every moment.

635
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,320
Perhaps for 100 years,

636
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,440
perhaps for 1,000 years—

637
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,240
God knows when you can
transform into a human.

638
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,640
Do you dare?

639
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,560
Fine.

640
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,520
So be it.

641
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,820
Just like that,

642
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,580
to become human and truly meet

643
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,260
and fall in love

644
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,460
with the one

645
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,650
he deeply loves,

646
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,220
Feng Mochen walked into the Avici Hell

647
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,180
without hesitation.

648
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Not even the greatest Chopin
could express my sorrow.

649
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,700
What a heartbreaking fairy tale.

650
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:19,840
I think

651
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,740
my joke anthology is better.

652
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,860
Then read your joke anthology.

653
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,500
What took you guys so long?

654
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,510
It's Le's fault.

655
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,380
She ate all the snacks Mao bought.

656
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,540
We had to buy more.

657
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,900
They were so delicious.

658
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,220
I couldn't help it.

659
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,340
Bai,

660
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,260
did you learn any new jokes today?

661
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,780
Remember to tell me later.

662
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,540
Sure.

663
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,340
No problem.

664
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,340
Where's Feng?

665
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,660
Wasn't he with you?

666
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,720
I haven't seen him.

667
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,700
Look over there!

668
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,160
Feng,

669
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,360
all you know is acting cool.

670
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,090
Why did you stick on a few tails?

671
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,200
School asked me to play a nine-tailed fox.

672
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,330
What a coincidence.

673
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,440
This storybook
is also about a nine-tailed fox.

674
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,560
It's really good.

675
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,020
Jiu.

676
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,340
Fairy tales are all lies.

677
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,680
And they're something adults

678
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,260
specifically use to fool children.

679
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,280
Otherwise,

680
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,400
why don't adults read fairy tales?

681
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,260
Why?

682
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,660
Because they know they're lies.

683
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,340
Those who believe in fairy tales

684
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,500
are children.

685
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,700
When you stop believing in fairy tales,

686
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,460
you'll be a grown-up.

687
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,540
If you don't believe in fairy tales,

688
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,580
why play a nine-tailed fox?

689
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,340
To make them believe

690
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,900
I'm still a child.

691
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,900
Come on, Jiu.

692
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,540
Let's bring food to Mao.

693
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,340
Let's go!

694
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,620
Mao!

695
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,540
You guys are so awful,

696
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,460
always giving my dog

697
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,700
my name.

698
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,820
Don't be angry,

699
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,660
Mao.

700
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,660
Because we think...

701
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,980
you and Mao are very alike.

702
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,540
Mm.

703
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,260
How could I be like a dog?

704
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,420
You just are.

705
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,860
I'm not playing with you anymore!

706
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,410
Let's go!

707
00:47:46,140 --> 00:48:10,020
